Power Generating Knee Brace
A sign of things to come for sure , the Power Generating Knee Brace harvests excess energy from the kinetic energy in the knee joints in the same way that brakes reclaim energy from tires on certain hybrid cars .
The energy production itself has been proven efficient .
The real problem facing the device is the bulk ; something that will surely be solved in time .
Expect to see both domestic and military applications of the device in the future , with implementations in other areas of the body to help those with , say , a pacemaker or similar medical devices .
Nail Watch from Timex - The TX54
This one comes at us from the Core77 Year 2154 Design Competition .
Apparently , no one in the future will want to wear watches and thus , these guys will take over .
I think this is a fun and cool idea .
Clicking the edge of the nail turns on and off the glow feature .
Momenta Next - Gen PC
Part of the Next - Gen PC Design Competition , this concept device is actually a full - fledged PC that is worn about the neck .
A small projector displays the interface on the nearby wall and gestural commands allow the user to interact with the machine minus an actual physical interface .
Another cool feature is the heart rate dependent video capture .
What that means is if your heart rate goes up , the PC starts recording automatically .
Granted , this is only a concept , but you ca n’t help but wonder how far off we are from something like this .
The Impact Jacket Sometimes simple innovations are the best .
The video explains how the jacket works above , but essentially a rip cord is attached to the motorcycle ( or horse , or occasional segway ) and should the rider fall from the vehicle , a CO2 cartridge fills the jacket with compressed gas and acts like an airbag .
It ’s currently popular with Law Enforcement Agencies and has already saved lives !
VitalJacket
Forget complex medical rigging and long hospital stays .
The VitalJacket is innovative because it allows the user to simply slip on the shirt , which immediately begins monitoring vital health stats such as a person ’s ECG , heart rate , respiration , and temperature , among other things .
All data is stored on a built in SD card and simultaneously transferred via bluetooth to a PDA for further analysis and tracking .
Prices reportedly start around $ 635 .
Digital Escape Mask
A dystopian future , at this point , is all but guaranteed .
How will you handle the inevitable soul - crushing destruction of humanity when it finally comes around ?
Why not simply ignore it with the Digital Escape Mask ?
The concept device augments reality by re-skinning it with something more pleasurable .
Polluted air is replaced with fresh air .
Sounds , smells and visuals are pleasurable .
This is escapism taken to the ultimate level .
The mask also projects an emoticon - like version of your actual expression to display your mood to those who are not wearing the masks .
As cool as it all sounds , let ’s hope there is never an actual need for such a product .
Mark of Fitness Exercise Monitor
One thing that separates this particular fitness monitor from others is that it is entirely self contained ; there is no chest belt attachment .
The semi - glove design is small , convenient , and does not interfere with your activities .
The device itself is capable of accurately monitoring your heart rate and keeps accurate estimations of calories burned as well as your target heart rate .
Speedo LZR Racer
While I realize this is technically not a gadget , per se , given the recent Beijing Olympics / Michael Phelps hubbub , it felt appropriate to place this on the list .
Not only that , but this suit is probably more advanced ( and more expensive ) than you ’d expect .
This suit is the first of it ’s kind , created from a three - piece 3D pattern , which is then ultrasonically bonded together to create streamlined seams that reduce drag .
The Olympic stars currently have it , but you can grab this high - tech swimsuit when it comes out in October for $ 550 .
Honda ’s Walking Assist Device
Research on this device began in 1999 as part of Honda ’s comprehensive study on human walking , research which was then used to help create ASIMO .
The device is functional , and works by using hip angle sensors and brushless motors .
The inspiration for the device comes from wanting to help elderly and people with poor muscle ability achieve mobility .
My guess would be that the only reason you ’re not seeing this on the market just yet is because of battery life ; the achilles ’ heel of so many devices .
ActiveTalk Walkie Talkie Watches Ever since Dick Tracy , we ’ve waited expectantly for our communication wrist watches .
Now you can finally keep in contact with your relatives , friends , and fellow crime fighters with the ActiveTalk Walkie Talkie watches .
Simply choose a channel and press call when you want to speak !
These guys are rechargeable and come with a 2 mile range making it perfect for those areas where cell phone coverage is spotty , if present at all , such as when you ’re outdoors hiking , skiing , or chasing down your next super - villain .
USB Bracelet
Okay , so it ’s no Tiffany masterwork , but how many times have you been stuck on the run and found yourself wanting a USB cable ?
Geek merges with chic to bring you the USB bracelet .
The tech itself is shrouded in silky and soft polyurethane material and conforms around your wrist .
Expect all the functionality of a regular USB cable .
Who knows what ’s next ?
RJ - 45 belts ?
Belkin Router Shoes ?
The possibilities are endless !
DuoFertility
This is one for the couples who are trying to concieve ( or conversly , avoid conception ) .
The DuoFertility is a small , USB - capable device that continuously measures a woman ’s basal temperature to determine when she is ovulating .
All the woman has to do is wear a patch underneath her arm and the device works on it ’s own .
You can view up to 6 days of results on the device itself , as well as download the data to a computer .
The company behind the device grew out of Cambridge University , so you know you can expect a lot .
In fact , the device is capable of measuring up to 20,000 more temperature readings than other basal temperature monitors .
The device is currently in trials ( which you can sign up for via their website link in the title above ) , but expect it to retail for around $ 1000 when it is finally released .
ThinkGeek ’s Wi-Fi Detector Shirt
Wardriving is n’t a hobby !
It ’s a way of life !
But in all seriousness , what wearable gadget list would be complete without ThinkGeek ’s Wi-Fi Detector T - shirt ?
The premise is simple ; when you ’re in the range of a wi- fi - signal , the bars on the shirt light up .
The stronger the signal , the more bars , just like on your cell phone .
The shirt runs off 3 AAA batteries , which are concealed inside a pocket of the shirt .
The signal detector itself is removable for easy washing .
Reactiv
That ’s what UK - based Designer Michael Chen calls his product , which is squarely aimed at bicyclists .
Using LED ’s embedded into the clothing ’s arms and back in conjunction with accelerometers , the lights can go green if the rider is accelerating or red if they are slowing down .
Tilt switches turn the lights amber when the rider raises their arm to give the appropriate hand signals .
The current model is a working prototype , which earned the designer a hefty sum at the James Dyson design awards .
Chen hopes to have Reactiv Jackets on the market by Christmastime , retailing for � 100 or approximately $ 186 at today ’s conversion rate .
Skelecycle - The Wearable Motorcycle
For all the risk that may be involved with this particular vehicle , I ca n’t help but be attracted to it .
36 pneumatic “ muscles ” control the cycle in conjunction with the drivers movements .
The cycle lays flatter at higher speeds , so that when you are going full speed , you are literally suspended flat out , inches above the ground .
And did we mention that it ’s environmentally friendly ?
The sensation must be unreal , as is the product itself for now .
But all the numbers are based on the real world , claims the creator of the , uh , “ bike . ”
The basic parts are already being engineered for use in other vehicles , so who knows ?
Maybe one day soon this might become a reality !
* BONUS !* Sarcos ’s Exoskeleton
We ’ve received a number of high tech innovation from military products already .
Teflon , microwaves , and even modern computing and the Internet itself all started as Military projects .
Will the day come when everyone is wearing Aliens - Style Exosuits ?
One can only dream …
Okay , we ’ll admit it .
We have an unnatural love for gadgets and all things computer - related .
If this makes us geeks , than so be it !
Of course , for better or for worse , there are some of use who like to wear their pride on their sleeve ( literally ) and proudly display their inner geek for all to see .
In this post we bring you all the best wearable gadgets of the past , present , and future !
Some are cool , some are freaky , but all are guaranteed to make you stand out from the rest of the low - tech populou
That ’s it for today ’s 15 Hottest Wearable Gadgets .
Got any more to add to the list that we missed ?
We ’d love to hear from you in the comments !
Also be sure to check out some of out other killer features posts here on The Hottest Gadgets .
The Democratic and Republican national conventions have passed , but controversy surrounds how they were funded and how they were run .
Mass arrests of peaceful protesters , excessive police violence , wholesale disregard for the Bill of Rights and the targeting and arrest of journalists marred what should have been celebrations of democracy .
The “ host committees , ” the legal entities that organize and pay for the conventions , act as large party slush funds , outside of campaign - finance restrictions .
Scores of major corporations ( and a couple of unions ) , barred from giving unlimited funds to political parties , could give whatever they wanted to the host committees of Denver and St. Paul , Minn .
According to a recent article in National Underwriter magazine , “ Both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee refused to comment on their insurance purchasing decisions , or even reveal who was providing coverage for their respective conventions . ”
Bruce Nestor , president of the Minnesota chapter of the National Lawyers Guild , who organized scores of legal observers around the Twin Cities to protect citizens ’ legal rights , told me : “ St. Paul actually negotiated a special insurance provision with the Republican host committee so that the first $ 10 million in liability for lawsuits arising from the convention will be covered by the host committee .
The city is very proud of this negotiation .
It ’s the first time it ’s been negotiated between a city and the host committee .
But it basically means we [ the city ] can commit wrongdoing , and we wo n’t have to pay for it . ”
According to the Minnesota Independent , more than 40 journalists were arrested or detained during the Republican National Convention .
Like what happened to “ Democracy Now ! ” producer Nicole Salazar , videotaping protests in downtown St. Paul .
She was violently forced to the ground , her nose bloodied , was held down with a man ’s knee or boot on her back , with another person pulling on her leg .
Fellow producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous was thrown against a wall and kicked in the chest and back .
The police might normally intervene and arrest the perpetrators .
Except here , it was the police who were the assailants .
And they arrested their victims .
Arriving on the scene , I tried to have my colleagues freed , as we were all accredited journalists , and the police arrested me .
And we were not the only ones .
As the mayors and police of St. Paul and Minneapolis patted each other on the back for a job well done , the nonprofit group FreePress , the head of the local chapter of the Newspaper Guild and other media advocates and reporters delivered more than 50,000 signatures to the mayor ’s office demanding that the charges against the journalists be dropped .
We were met by St. Paul Deputy Mayor Ann Mulholland .
Free Speech TV CEO Denis Moynihan asked about the Republican host committee indemnification of the city , “ Is n’t that just giving a $ 10 million ticket to the police to violate civil rights ? ” Mulholland countered , “ We are very proud of that … the $ 10 million was critical for our city .
We would not have been able to host the convention otherwise . ”
The two major - party conventions have become protracted , expensive advertising spectacles for the presidential candidates .
It makes sense that Democrats and Republicans would want to control the message .
But democracy is not an advertisement , nor is it under the sole dominion of the two parties .
People were engaged in Denver and St. Paul in a vast array of civic dialogue , public gatherings , marches , protests , concerts , art openings — in fact , there was more democracy happening outside the convention halls than inside them .
The convention center names tell the story :
It was the Pepsi Center in Denver , the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul .
Xcel , which pushes nuclear power , gave $ 1 million to each convention .
Both top candidates support nuclear power as a viable option .
In Denver , but particularly in St. Paul , dissent was crushed with a massive array of paramilitarized police , operating under the U.S. Secret Service , granted jurisdiction over the “ National Special Security Events ” that the conventions have been dubbed .
Corporations pay millions to the host committees , earning exclusive access to lawmakers and candidates .
The host committees , in turn , unleash police on the public , all but guaranteeing injuries , unlawful arrests and expensive civil litigation for years to come .
More than just a campaign - finance loophole that must be closed , this is a national disgrace .
Throughout the convention week , one of the 25 remaining typeset copies of the Declaration of Independence was on display at St. Paul City Hall — not far from where crowds were pepper - sprayed , clubbed , tear - gassed and attacked by police with concussion grenades .
As the clouds clear , it is instructive to remember the words of one of the Declaration ’s signers , Benjamin Franklin :
“ They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . ”

Using a concept from economics , researchers have figured out how information gets pulled through a series of regions in the brain .
The economics approach , called Granger causality , now has been applied to neuroscience to suggest that neural wires physically stimulate each other , charging up networks in sequence .
The result shows that materials are drawn from one specialized part of the brain to the next .
In economics , scholars use Granger causality as a statistical concept that is based on prediction .
Add a twist of neuroscience , and Granger causality is a useful tool , says Chad Sylvester , a graduate student at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
The Granger concept supports evidence for neuron - to - neuron triggering by measuring them in a direct , but non-invasive way , he said .
For years , scientists could see which brain regions were contributing to specific mental tasks by viewing Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scans , however getting those scans fast enough to trace the brain ’s informational pull was difficult .
In Sylvester ’s experiment , volunteers were asked to attune their gaze to a portion of a screen , looking for a specific cue .
Previous research revealed that this task activated two brain areas : the frontoparietal cortex , which is involved in the direction of the attention ; and the visual cortex , which becomes more active in the area where volunteers expected the stimulus to appear .
The researchers were able to show that as volunteers waited for the stimulus to appear , the frontoparietal cortex was specifically influencing the visual cortex , not the reverse .
Sylvester ’s use of Granger causality supported the finding of specific interactions between brain regions and their wired relay of information during a particular mental assignment .
Down the line , researchers plan to look into applying these insights into questions about brain organization and function , such as our capacity to pay attention and how memory retrieval areas interact with visual processing regions .
Trauma studies will also explore how the brain can adapt to a simple injury , or how the presence of such an injury can hinder information flow to other extremely important areas of the brain .
The results of the new study are detailed in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience .
( For super - geeks reading this , according to Granger causality , if a signal X 1 " Granger - causes " a signal X 2 , then past values of X 1 should contain information that helps predict X 2 above and beyond the information contained in past values of X 2 alone . )
Because it includes Draconian DRM program SecuROM , Spore 's taking a bit of a pounding at the moment .
Same thing happened to Mass Effect , same thing happened to BioShock .
The message is fairly clear : people know what SecuROM does , and they do not want .
EA 's response to this ?
To let you eat cake .
They 're sticking with the software , whether you like it or not , and upcoming RTS title Red Alert 3 will be coming bundled with it .
This time , though , they 're going a little easier on you , allowing you five installs ( and a few other minor tweaks ) .
Like the other games , though , spare a thought for the dev team .
It 's not their decision to implement SecuROM , it 's EAs , and the following plea from the team makes clear just how polarising a topic this has become :
Red Alert 3 is shaping up to be a world - class RTS game that will give you many hours of enjoyment .
I think it would be a shame if people decided to not play a great game simply because it came with DRM , but I understand that this is a very personal decision for many of you and I respect that .
As you might imagine , I 'm a lot less respectful of those people who take the position that they will illegally download a game simply because it has DRM .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc ’s shares fell nearly 17 percent on Thursday as worries over Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc ’s future raised questions on which investment bank may be next to face questions about its survival .
A Merrill Lynch sign is seen in Toronto , April 29 , 2008 .

“ I think the market ’s telling you that if Lehman is going to go away , Merrill is probably the next victim , ” said Malcolm Polley , chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors .
Lehman shares slid 42 percent to $ 4.22 , dragging the entire sector lower .
Merrill stock fell was especially hard hit because it is seen as having similar weaknesses , investors said .
Merrill fell $ 3.87 to $ 19.43 on the New York Stock Exchange to their lowest level in nearly 10 years .
The decline reflected investor concerns that the bank ’s commercial mortgage exposure might cause more write - downs .
Write - downs of commercial mortgages were in part responsible for Lehman Brothers ’ record $ 3.9 billion loss preannounced on Wednesday .
According to reports on Tuesday , Lehman ’s talks on selling a stake to the Korea Development Bank ended earlier this week .
On Thursday , Lehman shares were further pummeled after analysts voiced concern about Chief Executive Dick Fuld ’s ability to sell a stake in the bank ’s Neuberger Berman asset management unit .
On Thursday afternoon , sources said Chief Executive Dick Fuld was in talks to sell the whole firm , instead of just a piece of its business .
Merrill Chief Executive John
Thain arranged last month to sell about $ 30 billion in toxic debt to private equity firm Lone Star Funds .
Merrill has written down more than $ 40 billion over the last year .
Earlier this month , Goldman Sachs analyst William Tanona said the bank could still write down bad assets before September 30 in excess of the $ 5 billion already announced as a result of a deal with Lone Star Funds .
As Merrill ’s stock declines , however , it will be harder for the bank to raise capital .
“ Bear Stearns was the weakest of the investment banks , Lehman Brothers is ... obviously having issues , and then next on the list to worry about if there were to be a domino effect is Merrill Lynch , ” said Ben Wallace , securities analyst at Grimes & Co , which sold the last of its Merrill shares on Thursday .
Still , he added : “ I think people are getting ahead on their worrying , ”

You ca n’t say she did n’t warn them .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin introduced herself to the nation with a now - famous joke about lipstick being the only difference between a certain dog breed and a hockey mom .
On Saturday , the Republican vice presidential nominee unleashed her inner pit bull , accusing Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama of being someone who would “ pal around with terrorists . ”
Her accusation -- made before an overflow crowd of more than 8,000 at Home Depot Center ’s tennis stadium in Carson , and earlier in the day at a Denver fundraiser -- signaled an increasingly abrasive stance toward Obama on behalf of her running mate , Republican nominee John McCain .
In Carson , Palin signaled her intentions early on in her 23 - minute speech .
Advertisement
“ One of my campaign staff said as I was walking out here , ‘ OK , the heels are on , the gloves are off , ’ ” she said .
The “ terrorists ” to whom Palin was referring is William Ayers , founder of the 1960s radical group Weather Underground , who is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an acquaintance of Obama .
Palin began the attack with a wry observation about her disastrous Katie Couric interview -- she appeared to draw a blank when asked which newspapers and magazines she reads .
Palin , who later told Fox News that she reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , among other publications , said she was annoyed by Couric ’s question .
Clearly buoyed by a well - received performance against her Democratic opponent , Sen .
Joe Biden , in their only debate Thursday , Palin apologized for what she described as her “ impatient ” response to Couric .
Advertisement
“ Evidently there ’s been a lot of interest in what I read lately , ” she said .
“ I was reading today a copy of the New York Times .
And I was really interested to read in there about Barack Obama ’s friends from Chicago .
Turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man who , according to the New York Times , was a domestic terrorist , that , quote , ‘ launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the United States Capitol . ’ ”
The New York Times article , an investigation published Friday into whether Obama had a relationship with Ayers , concluded that the men were never close and that Obama has denounced Ayers ’ radical past , which occurred when Obama was a child .
The article also said Obama “ has played down his contacts with ” Ayers .
“ This is not a man who sees America as you and I see America , ” Palin said of Obama .
“ We see America as a force for good in this world .
We see America as a force for exceptionalism .
. . .
Our opponents see America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who would bomb their own country . ”
The Obama campaign responded forcefully .
“ Gov. Palin ’s comments , while offensive , are not surprising , given the McCain campaign ’s statement this morning that they would be launching Swift Boat - like attacks in hopes of deflecting attention from the nation ’s economic ills , ” said spokesman Hari Sevugan .

“ In fact , the very newspaper story Gov. Palin cited in hurling her shameless attack made clear that Sen.
Obama is not close to Bill Ayers , much less ‘ pals , ’ and that he has strongly condemned the despicable acts Ayers committed 40 years ago , when Obama was 8 .
What ’s clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy . ”
Republicans have long been expected to attack Obama on the issue .
In August a major fundraiser for McCain spent $ 2.8 million on an ad by the American Issues Project that questioned Obama ’s relationship with Ayers .
( The donor , Texas billionaire Harold Simmons , helped fund Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , the group that damaged John F. Kerry ’s 2004 presidential campaign when it called his Navy service into question . )
The anti-Obama ad aired in Ohio and Michigan in the summer .
Last week , the McCain campaign said it would pull out of Michigan , a tacit admission that it expected Obama to carry the state .
Palin , who did not know the campaign pulled out of Michigan until she read about it Friday , according to McCain aides , implied Saturday in Denver that she regretted the decision .

“ Well , as I said the other day , I would sure love to get to run to Michigan and make sure that Michigan knows we have n’t given up there , ” Palin said as she left a diner after visiting with soldiers ’ mothers .
“ We care much about Michigan and every other state . ”
California is a reliably Democratic state in the presidential race -- yet it also is a reliable source of cash for Republicans .
After the Carson rally Saturday , Palin attended a fundraiser in Costa Mesa .
Today she is scheduled to headline a fundraiser in Burlingame , after which she is expected to leave for Florida .
McCain , meanwhile , will take time off to prepare for his second debate with Obama , on Tuesday .
In Carson , Palin was interrupted numerous times by protesters , who were in turn shouted down by the crowd .
She said that her father , Chuck Heath , was born in North Hollywood and that her grandfather was a Los Angeles photographer who specialized in shooting boxers .
“ I learned a few points about fighting from him , ” she said .

Many people in the Carson crowd compared Palin favorably with Ronald Reagan .
“ What ’s wonderful about Sarah is that she ’s liberated without being liberal , ” said LaDell Jorgensen , 42 , who drove from San Clemente for the rally .
“ She really connects with the old Ronnie Reagan patriotic people who love America . ”
Paul Nissan , 56 , of Culver City , said it gets kind of lonely being a Republican on the Westside of Los Angeles .
“ What ’s been set in motion with her makes it seem like California can get in the mix , ” he said .
“ It ’s encouraging for those of us out here in Reagan Country . ”
Advertisement
Nissan ’s friend , Jeanne Tanigawa , 57 , said she was a McCain supporter even before he chose Palin .
“ She ’s like the cherry on top , ” Tanigawa said .
Neither Nissan nor Tanigawa was bothered by Palin ’s claim that Obama “ would pal around with terrorists . ”
“ I ’m aware of the background there , ” Nissan said .
“ I think it ’s down to where we ’ve got to be blunt about associations and values .
The ideological differences are so stark . ”

Burst Alert !
March 19th was an exciting day for NASA .
We know “ why ” it was special , but we do n’t know “ why why ” it was special .
They finally explain the why why today , and you can read all about it in Nature tomorrow .
There was something amazing about GRB 080319B and the other cosmic bursts that NASA ’s Swift satellite detected that day .
( See NASA 's animation of what they think happened ) .
" Even by the standards of gamma - ray bursts , this burst was a whopper , " says Swift lead scientist Neil Gehrels of NASA .
" It blows away every gamma ray burst we ’ve seen so far . "
Here ’s the why ( we 'll get to the why why in a second ) : Artist 's interpretation of GRB 080319B .
Credit : NASA / Swift / Mary Pat Hrybyk - Keith and John Jones .
The optical afterglow was 2.5 million times more luminous than the most luminous supernova ever recorded , making it the most intrinsically bright object ever observed by humans in the universe .
It was so bright that immediately after the blast , Swift 's UltraViolet and Optical Telescope and X - Ray Telescope indicated they were effectively blinded , originally leading researchers to think something had gone wrong .
" For a few precious seconds , the luminosity was a million times that of the whole galaxy , " explains Dieter Hartmann , a Professor at Clemson University .
And on top of that , the burst shattered the record for the farthest object that ’s ever been visible to the naked eye .
The previous record was a spiral galaxy called M33 , which is thousands of times closer than the March 19 explosion .
The explosion , which took place halfway across the universe , was so far away that it took its light 7.5 billion years to reach the Earth .
In fact , the explosion took place so long ago that neither the Earth nor the Sun had come into existence .
If something like this happened closer to home , we would be in deep trouble .
David Burrows , NASA 's Swift X-ray Telescope leader at Penn State , says , " if it happened in our own galaxy , it could cause chemical changes that cause something like a nuclear winter .
We do n't believe there are any stars in our galaxy that are likely to become gamma ray bursts , but it is possible that an event like this may have happened in our galaxy in the past and lead to mass extinctions . "
If you 're having trouble grasping the magnitude of such an occurrence , do n't feel bad .
Hartmann explained that you can't really come up with an analogy to put the amount of energy that 's being released into terms that ' normal ' people would understand .
" Those numbers are staggering , " he says .
And ' normal ' is n't used pejoratively .
Even astrophysicists are blown away .
Grigory Beskin , the Relativistic Astrophysics Group Head at the Special Astrophysical Observatory , said , " this is a true miracle to see such an optical flare . "
Astronomers began their scientific analysis beginning 30 minutes before the explosion , and after following its afterglow for months , they ’re ready to talk .
Until recently they did n’t know the why why : why it was so powerful , and why the afterglow was so much brighter than other afterglows .
It turns out that a jet of material shot out from this dying supernova almost directly toward the Earth at 99.99995 percent the speed of light .
Judith Racusin , a graduate student at Penn State and one of the presenters at the NASA press conference today , explained that through unlikely circumstances , we got a chance to see something amazing with this jet , and it 's changing the way astrophysicists are thinking .
" What 's interesting about this burst , is that both the optical afterglow and the X - ray afterglow are inconsistent with our current theoretical understanding of how these objects work .
It 's forced us to really test our understanding of these objects , and as a result we 've had to come up with an alternative explanation . "
So NASA scientists have come up with a two - component jet model , in which there is both a wider outer jet ( characteristic of what we usually see with these objects ) , and a narrow inner jet .
Hartmann says the narrow jet was just 0.4 of a degree across , while the less - energetic , wider jet was about 20 times wider .
" The narrow jet just happened to be pointed almost precisely at the Earth this time , which makes us think that most of the time , the narrow jet just is n't pointed directly at us .
It 's allowed us to see these objects in a new way , " says Racusin .
The NASA scientists realize that sometimes better data spell trouble for simple models .
" But on the bright side , " says Hartmann , " it 's leading to new theoretical models ! "

Sex ist nicht nur schön , sondern ebenso gesund .
Nicht nur der reine sexuelle
Akt tut gut , sondern die dazugehörigen Streicheleinheiten und die Nähe .
Die Menschen suchen nicht nur den reinen
Sex , sondern die damit verbundene Erotik , um sein Gegenüber in den Stunden der Sinnlichkeit zu genießen und ganz für sich zu haben .
Die Menschen haben
Sex , zum einen für den körperlichen Genuss , zum anderen um sich begehrt zu fühlen .
Beim Sex kommt klar zum Ausdruck , wie der andere Mensch einen körperlich begehrt und anziehend findet .
Zeitgleich tut der Sex mit dem Orgasmus dem Menschen von der Haarspitze bis zum kleinen Zeh gut .
Glückshormone werden ausgelöst und ein Sich - fallen - lassen löst die Sorgen und Nöte für den Moment , die Minuten und die Stunden .
Die Menschen tun sich gegenseitig gut und der Körper entspannt und genießt den Akt in vollen Zügen .
Und nicht nur , dass der gesamte Körper ins Wohlbefinden gelangt , Sex macht richtig schön .
Eine Nacht den schönsten Sex seines Lebens genießen , ist wie eine Woche Beautyfarm .
Es gibt kein besseres Schönheitselexier als mehrere Orgasmen hintereinander verspürt zu haben .
Dies sind einer der Gründe , warum Menschen neben der Fortpflanzung den gegenseitigen
Sex begehren und suchen .
Sex und Wissenschaft
Die Sexualpsychologen , es gibt sicherlich unterschiedliche Sichtweisen , sehen in dem sexuellen Akt eine Art der Kommunikation .
Psychosoziale Bedürfnisse werden geweckt und wollen erfüllt werden .
Sich zugehörig fühlen und angenommen zu werden sei ein essentielles Grundbedürfnis des Menschen .
Die tiefere Bedeutung von Sex sei letztlich das Gefühl , dass man völlig in Ordnung ist .
Sex verbindet und Sex stärkt die Beziehung .
Mit dem Sex , der Begehrlichkeit und dem Wunsch dem Partner ganz nahe zu kommen , ist ein Ausdruck der Gefühlstiefe und der Liebe .
Sex und seine Probleme
Wir haben Sex , weil der Wunsch nach dem körperlichen Austausch mit dem Partner groß ist .
Wir haben
Sex , einfach weil wir Lust darauf haben und der Sehnsucht danach kurzfristig genauso nachkommen , wie gezielt im Internet oder auf Sex Dating Apps zu suchen .
Es ist einfach schön , einen sexuellen
Akt zu erleben und nach Zeiten der Pause ist der Wunsch wieder da .
Es ist im Menschen genetisch bedingt ein grundlegendes Bedürfnis .
Nur manches mal will es nicht klappen !
Überall in der Werbung , unter Freunden oder in Büchern wird Sex hochgespielt .
Man könnte manchmal das Gefühl bekommen , es wäre gut noch einen Master auf der Hochschule abzulegen .
Doch wenige sprechen darüber , wenn die Lust nachlässt , der Stress zu groß ist oder Impotenz ein Thema ist .
Der Wunsch nach
Sex ist nach wie vor da .
Doch möchte es zwischendurch einfach nicht klappen .
In Liebe dies anzunehmen ist ein Teil vom Sexualleben .
Ebenso kommt es aus wissenschaftlich Sicht zwischen Mann und Frau zu Missverständnissen , wenn es um den Sex geht .
Frauen und Männer haben aus unterschiedlichen Gründen Sex
„ Für viele Männer ist der Grund in eine Beziehung zu gehen letztlich der Sex .
Frauen hingegen benutzen Sex oftmals als Pfand . “
Diese Aussage stammt von einem Sexualtherapeuten .
Eine interessante
These , die nicht so abwegig erscheint .
Frauen verwenden dieses „ Pfand “ oftmals unbewusst .
Dies wurde nachgewiesen .
Mann und Frau geben wohl
Sex gerade dann , wenn die Beziehung noch nicht gefestigt ist .
Der bekannte Versöhnungssex wird oftmals als etwas besonders Intensives dargestellt .
Die Verbindung , die gerade noch angeknackst war , wird durch den Sex wieder sehr intensiv empfunden .
Über den
Sex möchtet sich die Frau , jedoch auch der Mann , wieder angenommen fühlen .
Der körperliche sexuelle Austausch ist sozusagen der leibliche Beweise .
Es wird oftmals behauptet , dass Männer mehr Lust auf Sex haben als Frau .
Wissenschaftlich ist dem wohl nicht so .
Es ist wohl so , dass es unterschiedlich schnell geschieht , das Bedürfnis Sex erleben zu wollen .
Männer sind schnell dabei und verspüren den Drang sich sexuell auszutauschen .
Frauen müssen erstmals in Stimmung kommen , damit sie für den Sex offen sind .
Vom Geschlecht auf die Lust schließen
Gerade jugendliche Männer verspüren wohl mehr Lust auf Sex als gleichaltrige Frauen .
Dies liegt am Sexualhormon Testosteron , was in dem Alter in Wallung gerät .
Die jungen Männer haben schon eine Erektion , wenn sie nur an eine Frau denken .
Frauen hingegen brauchen eine Aufwärmzeit und junge unerfahrene Mädchen wollen gestreichelt und geküsst werden , damit die Scheide für den Sex bereit ist .
Ausnahmen bestimmen natürlich die Regel und es gibt ebenso junge Frauen , die stets Lust auf Sex verspüren .
Um so mehr Mann und Frau den
Sex genießen können , umso mehr haben sie Lust darauf .
We ’ve all heard about detox programs for the body , which aim to clear away all the toxins which block our system .
Well , considering the amount of mental ‘ toxins ’ we indulge in everyday in the form of negative and destructive thoughts , I thought why not have a mental detox program too ?
By this , I mean a series of practives you could do for a couple of weeks , or a month , at the end of which your thoughts would be purged of negativity and a new clarity and peace of mind could emerge in your life .
As any army general will tell you , an adversary is best attacked on multiple fronts at once , and so it is with our thoughts .
These five steps outlined below – meditation , simplification , inspiration , exercise and positivity – work hand in hand to keep you in a good frame of mind throught the day .
I would recommend you start with a timeframe like two weeks and see how you get on , and then maybe the next time try it for a month or even longer .
Step 1 : Meditation
Meditation , is quite simply , the art of stilling the mind and going beyond your thoughts to a space of peace and beauty inside yourself .
If you are serious about trying to rid the mind of negative thoughts , then I would recommend you make time for a meditation practice at least once a day .
It is best if you do it at the same time every day ( so as to build up a habit ) – for many reasons , the ideal time is early in the morning , directly after you wake up and have a shower and before you eat breakfast .
However if you ca n’t do this , at least pick some time of the day where you can sit down for five or ten minutes undisturbed .
We have written quite a few articles on meditation and concentration exercises ( see resource list below ) ; try these different techniques and see which one best suits you .
A word of warning : Do n’t expect that at the end of 2 weeks all your thoughts will be cleared .
When I give meditation classes , one unfortunate thing I see time and time again is people coming in expecting to reach that state , and giving up in disappointment because they can’t control their thoughts after a couple of weeks or a month .
The fact is , to have no thoughts at all is a very high state of meditation .
Instead in our meditation we try to identify with a deeper , more ‘ real ’ part of our being , so that we learn not to take our negative thoughts so seriously and be swept away by them .
Step 2 : Simplification
One reason why our mind runs amok is because it is overstimulated by the bewildering array of inputs out there – radio , TV , Internet , newspapers to name but a few .
When we are more selective about what goes into our mental process in the first place , the easier it is to control it once it is there !
Try to look at your daily activities , and separate the truly essential inputs from the superfluous .
For example , we watch TV for five hours a day to relax , but the afterward we find our mind dwellining on the fictional situations we have just watched , which have nothing to do with the here and now of our lives .
Another thing we often do is take on extra activities and obligations out of a misplaced sense of obligation or because others feel it is something we should do , which only serves to bring extra worry and stress into an already mentally overcrowded life !
Every morning , when you have finished your meditation practice , try to identify areas of your life that are causing excess mental baggage , and work on removing them .
Do n’t suddenly emiminate all superflous areas of your life at once – this will create a tremendous resistance and strain in your mind – but slowly and surely identify areas of your life that are weighing you down , and work on replacing them with something more fulfilling .
Step 3 : Inspiration
If we implement the previous point and cut down on the number of mental distractions , we then have a lot of time on our hands , and as the saying goes , an idle mind is the devil ’s workshop – in other words if we do n’t fill this space with positivity , our mind just finds more negativity to take its place !
Before you embark on your mental detox program , locate at least five or six sources of inspiration in the form of inspiring books , music , programmes ( and yes , self - improvement blogs ! ) and have them at hand whenever you have some free time .
In this way , your free time can be not only relaxing , but elevating !
Step 4 : Exercise
Often much of our negative thoughts comes from stressful energy which has no outlet for release and which just builds up in the mind .
Having a daily half - hour exercise regimen not only makes us feel more alert and revitalized , it also acts as an outlet for the stuck mental energy that can build up during the day .
Personally , I always try to go for a run or do some other form of exercise early in the morning after meditation , because I know that life and other things will always get in the way later on !
Another way to make sure you have a regular schedule is to do it with a friend – it ’s much harder to back out of it when you ’re letting someone else down .
Step 5 : Positivity
The last part of of our detox plan deals with the obvious question – so what do we do when negative thoughts do crop up ?
Our initial response can sometimes be to fight with them or repress them , but this actually only gives them added strength .
A better response is to see what emotion is causing this negative stream of thought and invoke the opposite quality .
If your emotion is fear based , invoke the quality of love , if it is anger , invoke peace , if it is insecurity , invoke detachment .
You can invoke them by repeating the name of that quality silently and feeling that quality grow inside your heart .
It may be a struggle sometimes when the negative emotion is particularly strong , but persistence definitely pays off .
One final note :
When you begin a juice fast or other kind of body detox , the first thing that happens is that all the toxins get released on their way out of the system , and you feel a little bit under the weather for a while .
Similarly , when you begin the mental detox , you may notice that the negative mind puts up a surprising amount of resistance , because it sees you are trying to change it .
In addition , the additional awareness you get from meditation may reveal other negative thoughts you had that were lurking below the surface , so it might seem as if there was more negativity than there was before !
That ’s why it ’s important to have inspiration and exercise too , becuse they act as a channel for these ‘ toxins ’ as they leave your mind .
Like the physical detox , this mental detox does require a degree of commitment and a real aspiration for change , but after a couple of weeks , the peace of mind and clarity of vision you get will all have been worth it .

More articles from our blog :
Eight - year - old children have a radically different learning strategy from twelve - year - olds and adults .
Eight - year - olds learn primarily from positive feedback ( ' Well done ! ' ) , whereas negative feedback ( ' Got it wrong this time ' ) scarcely causes any alarm bells to ring .
Twelve - year - olds are better able to process negative feedback , and use it to learn from their mistakes .
Adults do the same , but more efficiently .
Brain areas for cognitive control
The switch in learning strategy has been demonstrated in behavioural research , which shows that eight - year - olds respond disproportionately inaccurately to negative feedback .
But the switch can also be seen in the brain , as developmental psychologist Dr Eveline Crone and her colleagues from the Leiden Brain and Cognition Lab discovered using fMRI research .
The difference can be observed particularly in the areas of the brain responsible for cognitive control .
These areas are located in the cerebral cortex .
Opposite case
In children of eight and nine , these areas of the brain react strongly to positive feedback and scarcely respond at all to negative feedback .
But in children of 12 and 13 , and also in adults , the opposite is the case .
Their ' control centres ' in the brain are more strongly activated by negative feedback and much less by positive feedback .
Three - way division
Crone and her colleagues used fMRI research to compare the brains of three different age groups : children of eight to nine years , children of eleven to twelve years , and adults aged between 18 and 25 years .
This three - way division had never been made before ; the comparison is generally made between children and adults .
advertisement
Unexpected
Crone herself was surprised at the outcome : ' We had expected that the brains of eight - year - olds would function in exactly the same way as the brains of twelve - year - olds , but maybe not quite so well .
Children learn the whole time , so this new knowledge can have major consequences for people wanting to teach children : how can you best relay instructions to eight - and twelve - year - olds ? ' ’
Ticks and crosses
The researchers gave children of both age groups and adults aged 18 to 25 a computer task while they lay in the MRI scanner .
The task required them to discover rules .
If they did this correctly , a tick appeared on the screen , otherwise a cross appeared .
MRI scans showed which parts of the brain were activated .
Learning in a different way
These surprising results set Crone thinking .
' You start to think less in terms of ' good ' and ' not so good ' .
Children of eight may well be able to learn extremely efficiently , only they do it in a different way . '
advertisement
Learning from mistakes is complicated
She is able to place her fMRI results within the existing knowledge about child development .
' From the literature , it appears that young children respond better to reward than to punishment . '
She can also imagine how this comes about : ' The information that you have not done something well is more complicated than the information that you have done something well .
Learning from mistakes is more complex than carrying on in the same way as before .
You have to ask yourself what precisely went wrong and how it was possible . '
Is it experience ?
Is that difference between eight - and twelve - year - olds the result of experience , or does it have to do with the way the brain develops ?
As yet , nobody has the answer .
' This kind of brain research has only been possible for the last ten years or so , ' says Crone , ' and there are a lot more questions which have to be answered .
But it is probably a combination of the brain maturing and experience . '
Brain area for positive feedback
There is also an area of the brain that responds strongly to positive feedback : the basal ganglia , just outside the cerebral cortex .
The activity of this area of the brain does not change .
It remains active in all age groups : in adults , but also in children , both eight - year - olds and twelve - year - olds .
Techno-artist Evan Roth has a message for the Transportation Safety Administration -- several messages , actually -- about what he considers excessive airport security " theater " ... and he has chosen an intentionally provocative method of delivery : the TSA 's own X - ray screening machines .
( 2012 ’s 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Here 's Roth 's idea , which he calls " TSA Communication " and tells me has already made it through three trial airport runs :
Take a metal plate , stencil and cut out a message -- words or an image -- place the plate at the bottom of your carry - on bag , and watch what happens as the TSA employee operating the airport X - ray machine notices ... or does n't notice .
The cut - out images , which could be anything , currently range from the benign : an American flag ; to the smart - alecky : " Nothing to see here ; " to what some might find offensive and a TSA agent somewhere is bound to cause a fuss over : a silhouette of a box cutter , which Roth calls " the exact opposite of a box cutter . "
( You can see more examples here . )
( Update : A TSA blogger responds . )
Best known for co-founding The Graffiti Research Lab --
" Dedicated to outfitting graffiti artists with open source technologies for urban communication " -- Roth and I have been swapping e-mail about his TSA project .
I 've also consulted an expert on airport security screening to get that point of view .
Roth first , then the expert :
Are you serious about doing this ?
So far I have traveled with the plates three times ( I 'm actually answering these questions in the Hong Kong airport having just passed security 20 minutes ago ) and I plan to continue doing so .
I fly all the time , and a big part of doing this project is simply so I have something to look forward to when I go to the airport .
I hate flying , I hate airports , I hate security , I hate wasting time , and most of all I hate being forced to play a role in the theater of security .
Of course having to take off my shoes and throw out my 4oz Jell - O is n't the end of the world , but by passively going along with it I feel as if I am agreeing to take part in the ruse .
Taking off my belt is not going to make flying any safer .
What would make flying safer is if America would stop being such an international a*****e.
But since neither of these situations seems very likely to end any time soon , I would rather go through the dance of airport security as an active participant rather than a passive one .
Are you at all concerned about the obvious risks associated with joking with airport security ?
Legally I do n't think I 'm breaking any laws by carrying the plates in my carry - on bag .
I 've read the TSA 's list of prohibited items , and while a 4 oz container of yogurt might pose some problems , " TSA Communication Plates " are n't currently on the list .
I would , however , consider it my crowning achievement as an artist if they added " TSA Communication Plates " to their list of prohibited items ( I 'm not holding my breath ) .
And while there is a certain amount of humor in the project , I would n't be doing this if it was only intended simply as a joke .
Are you concerned about what others might do if your idea catches on ?
I am excited by what others might do if this catches on .
I think if we all got a little more accustomed to creatively talking back instead of following instructions , the U.S. would be in much better place .
People have been sending me lots of good ideas ( for plates ) , for example the 4th Amendment , " ( TSA Administrator ) Kip Hawley is an idiot , " and , " Put me in the slow lane where you hand search everything I 'm carrying . "
What has happened on your trial runs ?
At the Amsterdam airport I went through security with the box cutter plate ( which I 'm calling " The Exact Opposite Of A Box Cutter " ) .
They asked me what was in my bag and when I reached to open it up they got a little jumpy and told me not to touch it .
They swiveled the monitor around to show me the item in question and I was happy to see that the resulting image showed up almost exactly like the concept images I had made up .
After I told them it was an art project they relaxed and allowed me to take it out of the bag , at which point they let me go ( you have to love the Netherlands ) .
Then today I took the American flag plate from Hong Kong to Bangkok , and they did n't notice :(.
We already know what happens if you try to go through TSA screening -- say at Boston 's Logan Airport -- wearing a pin that looks like a bomb .
As Roth 's project has started to get a bit of attention on the Internet , it 's been suggested by many that he is simply begging for trouble .
Coincidentally , I happen to have a reliable source -- OK , he 's my brother -- who works for a company that provides screening equipment to airports , military installations and the most security - sensitive of government facilities .
( He has government security clearance and I could tell you the famous place where he is today , but then he'd have to kill us both . )
I sent him the link about Roth 's X - ray art and asked whether he thought this would a ) work as the artist intends , and b ) go over very well at your typical airport security station .
His reply :
It is beyond me why anyone would do anything that would increase their likelihood of being selected for more intensive screening .
It 's a funny concept , but a very bad idea in practice .
Yes , it 's very doable -- we do similar things for testing , like cut a hand - grenade silhouette out of a thin sheet of lead .
If anything obscures the imagery of the bag , the screener will certainly be more likely to perform additional screening .
And you do n't have to have government security clearance to know what " additional screening " can mean .
Roth says he does n't like flying now ?
I 'm thinking he 's going to be liking it a lot less before long .

First , this is a way for George W. Bush to try to suppress the vote in Ohio .
Secondly , in this state , all voters are required to present valid identification in order to vote .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , is leading the charge , by sending the letter to Bush to probe the matter .
President George W. Bush late Friday asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate whether hundreds of thousands of newly registered voters in the battleground state of Ohio would have to verify the information on their voter registration forms or be given provisional ballots , an issue the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on last week .
The unprecedented intervention by the White House less than two weeks before the presidential election may result in at least 200,000 voters in Ohio not being able to vote on Election Day if they are forced to provide additional identification when they head to the polls .
“ I strongly urge you to direct Attorney General Mukasey and the Department of Justice to act . ”
Boehner said in his letter “ Unless action is taken by the Department immediately , thousands , if not tens or hundreds of thousands of names whose information has not been verified through the [ Help America Vote Act ] procedures mandated by Congress will remain on the voter rolls during the November 4 election ; and there is a significant risk if not a certainty , that unlawful votes will be cast and counted .
Given the Election Day is less than two weeks away , immediate action by the Department is not only warranted , but also crucial . ”
Independent studies have shown that phony registrations rarely result in illegally cast ballots because there are so many other safeguards built into the system .
For instance , from October 2002 to September 2005 , a total of 70 people were convicted for federal election related crimes , according to figures compiled by the New York Times last year .
Only 18 of those were for ineligible voting .
In recent years , federal prosecutors reached similar conclusions despite pressure from the Bush administration to lodge “ election fraud ” charges against voter registration groups seen as bringing more Democratic voters into the democratic process .
Some of the Bush administration prosecutors who refused to seek these indictments were then fired in 2006 as part of a purge of nine U.S. Attorneys deemed not “ loyal Bushies . ”
Governor Strickland will hopefully , put his foot down on all these false allegations and tell President Bush to go take a flying leap .
The Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner has worked hard to correct all the problems this state was having with the previous Republican Administration and the past election fraud they perpetuated .
Update :
In reference to previous Republican Administration , Ohio had former Republican Ken Blackwell as Secretary of State .
Blackwell gained national prominence for his dual roles as Chief Elections Official of Ohio and honorary co-chair of the “ Committee to re-elect George W. Bush ” during the 2004 election .
Allegations of conflict of interest and voter disenfranchisement led to the filing of at least sixteen related lawsuits naming Blackwell .
Blackwell appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit .
On October 26 , 2004 the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed in part and reversed in part .
The court agreed with the plaintiffs and the District Court that Blackwell ’s directive violated HAVA to the extent that it empowered poll workers to withhold a provisional ballot based on their “ on - the - spot determination at the polling place ” .
Update II : CommonDreams article about Ken Blackwell and the problems Ohio had , in the past , with his voter disenfranchisement : Will Ken Blackwell Find the Ways to Steal Ohio 2006 as He Did in 2004 ?
As election day approaches , Blackwell ’s dirty tricks sink ever deeper .
Blackwell is now using “ push polls ” made infamous by Karl Rove .
True to form , child molestation charges are front and center .
He has also escalated the mass disenfranchisement of Ohio voters , trashing the ballots of some ten percent of absentee voters .
He has eliminated the state - wide ballot initiative meant to save workers rights and wages .
He ’s even tried to strike the Democratic gubernatorial nominee from the ballot altogether .
All of which could affect not only his race for governor , but key U.S. Senate and House races as well .
Blackwell is using Rove ’s notoriously deceptive push poll device to spread an unsubstantiated smear against his Democratic gubernatorial opponent , Ted Strickland .
This year Blackwell will count the votes in his own race for governor , in the crucial U.S. Senate race between GOP incumbant Mike DeWine versus Congressman Sherrod Brown , and in a number of cricital House races hotly contested for the first time in years .
As he does so , Blackwell is conducting the largest purge of voter rolls since the apartheid nightmare of the post -Reconstruction Jim Crow south .

1 - year cheerleading ban given in Morton Ranch hazing
An investigation into allegations of hazing of cheerleaders at Morton Ranch High School has led to the suspension of all varsity cheerleading activity at the campus for the rest of the school year .
Katy school officials took the action based on information gathered in the inquiry into the incident involving about two dozen cheerleaders , school district spokesman Steve Stanford said in a written statement Friday .
The investigation began July 25 when a parent of a junior varsity cheerleader complained to the school 's principal on the same day the hazing allegedly occurred , school officials said .
Stanford said administrators were told the school 's varsity squad " kidnapped " junior varsity members from their homes , blindfolded them , bound their hands and mouths with duct tape and tossed them into a swimming pool .
Parents of the cheerleaders were informed of the decision in a letter via certified mail Friday .
It 's not clear whether the juniors on the varsity squad will be eligible to compete for the team next year .
No charges have been filed in connection with the investigation , Harris County Assistant District Attorney Donna Hawkins said Friday .
Hawkins said the case will be presented to a grand jury .
Keith and Pamela Davis , whose daughter is a 12th - grade varsity cheerleader , said they were upset when they received the news .
" The coach was supposed to be there with those girls that morning , and she did not show up , " Keith Davis said .
Campus principal Joe Cammarata and school officials had no prior knowledge about the events that particular morning , Stanford said last month .
Davis said he finds it hard to believe that school administrators did not know of the mock kidnapping in advance .
The cheerleading coaches distribute a monthly calendar with workout routines and activities that are planned , Davis said .
" The sleepover and the kidnapping of junior varsity girls was on that schedule , " Davis said .
Lisa MacIntyre , also a parent of a varsity cheerleader , said after the investigation was launched in July that she did n't know why the cheerleaders veered from the annual tradition and decided to go to a teammate 's house for a swim .
Morton Ranch has about 3,000 students .

I thought about the redirect_to method when I saw Ryan ’s screencast of how to go back with redirect_to : back .
That way the user will be redirected to the URL from the Referer header field , it ’s the same as redirect_to request .
referer .
The Referer is a user - supplied value which is set by the browser or another user - agent .
It should not be possible to spoof the Referer in an Ajax request , but some browsers seem to allow it ( Firefox does not ) .
An attack on this is quite unlikely .
However if the attacker manages to manipulate the Referer , the victim will be redirected to another site .
This site may install malicious software on the victim ’s computer through browser security holes .
Or it could be a phishing site that asks the victim to enter his username and password .
Then I saw comment # 11 which suggests to put the referer into a hidden field :
<%= hidden_field_tag : referer , ( params [ : referer ] || request.
env[‘ HTTP_REFERER ’ ] ) %>
The hidden_field_tag method automatically escapes the value , so it is not vulnerable to XSS .
However , be aware of XSS if you use the params otherwise .
More important is that you would use redirect_to params [ : referer ] .
This is a very nice redirector for any URL you like .
If the attacker sets the params [ : referer ] value by supplying the parameter to the site with the hidden_field_tag from above , the victim will be redirected to any desired page :
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld
Header Injection
Then there is a another problem with user - supplied values in the HTTP headers : Header Injection .
It seems that Ruby / Rails does not sanitize the parameter passed to redirect_to .
That means the user may set any header field he likes :
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld%0a%0dX-Header:+Hi!
Note that “ %0d%0a ” is URL - encoded for “ \r
” which is a carriage - return and line - feed in Ruby .
So the resulting HTTP header will be :
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
(…)
Location : http://www.malicious.tld
X - Header : Hi !
And even if you allow the user to supply only parts of the target URL , the attacker may still overwrite the Location header field ( and thus redirect to any site he wants ) :
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=path/at/your/app%0aLocation:+http://www.malicious.tld
Response Splitting
As Header Injection is possible , Response Splitting might be , too .
In HTTP , the header block is followed by two carriage - return , line - feeds ( CRLF ) and the actual data ( usually HTML ) .
The idea of Response Splitting is to inject two CRLFs , followed by another response with malicious HTML .
The response will be :
HTTP/1.1 302 Found [ First standard 302 response ]
Date : Tue , 12 Apr 2005 22:09:07 GMT
Location :
Content - Type : text / html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[ Second New response created by attacker begins ]
Content - Type : text / html
< html >< font color=red >hey < / font ></html >
[ Arbitary input by user is shown as the redirected page ] Keep - Alive : timeout=15 , max=100
Connection : Keep - Alive
Transfer - Encoding : chunked
Content - Type : text / html
Read the original article here .
Under certain circumstances this would present the malicious HTML to the user .

The cloud is one of the most common and most misused topology icons .
A cloud icon is used to represent an unknown or suppressed portion of a topology , but careful attention must be paid to exactly how one is placed , as illustrated in the following examples .
From the above topology even the dimmest bulb can deduce that R1 connects hosts in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to the Internet .
The are two subtleties to be aware of , however .
First , R1's interface to the Internet is not illustrated .
Second , R1 potentially has other connections to elsewhere in the network that are also not pictured .
Compare the above the above drawing to this one :
Notice that the second drawing clarifies both subtleties ; it reveals that R1 connects to the Internet via it 's Serial1/0 interface , and verifies that no other connections from R1 are present .
( If there are in fact additional connections from R1 , our drawing is to be considered inaccurate or incomplete . )
Now let 's consider an example where a cloud is used to fully encapsulate a device .
By placing the www.example.com server wholly within a cloud , we can illustrate that it exists , but also note that the path to reach it is unknown or undocumented .
As the example above is strictly layers one / two , we draw the line from R1 to the cloud edge ; a direct connection to the server would n't make sense .
However , we are free to make such lines when representing logical connections , such as a layer three VPN or a remote file share .
Just be sure to maintain a sense of symmetry when connecting devices across a cloud .
Either both end points should be explicitly labeled or neither should be .
Finally , avoid using clouds to group host devices , as is often done for some reason when representing wireless LANs .
While a cloud could technically represent a partial view of a host subnet , its symbolism in this case is ambiguous at best .

Reto Schneider has collected some of the most bizarre experiments conducted in the name of science for his book The Mad Science Book ( reviewed here ) .
Here he selects nine of his favourites .
1. Dogbot meets real Dog
In 2003 , researchers from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris tried to find out whether dogs would accept Sony ’s commercial dogbot AIBO as one of their own .
The experiment resulted in a formal scientific publication , “ Social behaviour of dogs encountering AIBO , an animal - like robot in a neutral and in a feeding situation ” , and the insight that the answer is “ no ” .

2 . The psychonaut
To find out what would happen if the brain was cut off from all external stimuli , scientist John Lilly built the first sensory deprivation tank in 1954 .
Floating in warm water for hours in complete darkness and silence , Lilly began to experience vivid fantasies .
“ These are too personal to relate publicly , ” he reported later .
The hallucinations of his test subjects were similarly difficult to categorize scientifically .
This was one reason why his research did not take off .
Lilly later gave up scientific research and founded the firm Samadhi Tanks , which manufactured tanks for domestic use .
Having became something of a New Age guru , he died in 2001 .
One of the few scientific experiments honoured by Hollywood , Lilly ’s work was the model for the 1980 film Altered States .
To no one ’s surprise , the real experiments were done with much less flashy equipment than that shown in the film .
Lilly sometimes had to switch off the light himself and then climb , in complete darkness , into a tank , which was little more than an outsize bathtub .
Watch the title sequence of Altered States , which shows a sophisticated vertical tank that never actually existed
3. Psychology ’s atom bomb
This is probably the most famous experiment ever not actually done .
American market researcher James Vicary claimed that he had exposed the audience in a cinema in Fort Lee , NJ to the secret instructions “ Eat Popcorn ! ” and “ Drink Coke ! ”
As a result , the sales of Coca - Cola in the cinema foyer increased by 18.1 % , while those of popcorn rose by 57.5 % .
Vicary later admitted that the whole story had been fabricated .
But it stuck and became an urban myth .
Vicary ’s experiment had its last major airing to date during the US Presidential elections of 2000 , when in a TV advert promoting the Republican candidate George W Bush unseen by viewers , the word “ RATS ” was flashed up momentarily when a Democrat policy was mentioned .
See the ad for yourself : the word appears at 0:25
4. Holidaying in a draught
Being a guinea pig for the British government ’s Common Cold Unit in 1946 was very popular with students .
They saw it as a cheap holiday : getting free accommodation in spacious flats fully equipped with books , games , radio and telephone , and spending your leisure time playing table tennis , badminton , or golf .
You even got paid three shillings a day .
The students were instructed to maintain a distance of at least 9 metres from all unprotected persons , other than their flatmates .
The unpleasant part of the experiment began when the participants had to spend half an hour in a draughty corridor after taking a hot bath , had to wear wet socks for the rest of the day , and were infected with nasal secretion from a cold sufferer .
To everyone ’s surprise the experiments demonstrated that the common cold had nothing to do with cold temperatures .
Watch a ( hilarious ) film about the experiment
5. Remote control bullfight
Spanish neurologist Jose Delgado from Yale University was not only convinced that electrical stimulation of the brain was the key to understanding the biological bases of social behaviour : he was also prepared to prove his case in a rather risky fashion .
On a spring evening in 1964 he came face to face with Lucero , a 250 - kilogram fighting bull owned by landowner Ramón Sánchez , who had granted Delgado the use of a small practice ring on his estate of La Almarilla in Córdoba for the experiment .
Lucero lumbered towards him .
Delgado pressed a button on the remote control .
The radio - controlled electrodes he had placed in the brain a few days before the experiment activated .
This instantly dissipated the animal ’s aggression – Lucero skidded to a halt and trotted off .
Watch a video of Delgado ’s encounter with the bull
Delgado ’s experiment was considered newsworthy enough to be published on the front page of the New York Times – ironically only one year after it was actually done .
6 . The 28 - hour day
At one time , one of the great unsolved mysteries of sleep research was whether the human sleep –wake rhythm of 24 hours was merely a habit , changeable at any time , or whether people had an internal , hard - wired body clock .
So sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman set out to find a location where there was no difference between day and night .
He found it in a 20 - metre wide and 8 - metre high rock chamber in the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky , where he and his student Bruce Richardson decided to try out a 28 - hour day .
They would sleep for 9 hours , work for 10 hours and have 9 hours ’ leisure time .
They spent 32 days in the cave .
Richardson adapted to the new cycle after just a week .
Kleitman , who was 20 years older , failed to adapt .
Watch some footage from the experiment
7 . A year in bed
It sounds like the ideal job for couch potatoes : in January 1986 , 11 men went to bed in Moscow , and did n’t get up for the next 370 days .
They were washed lying down , and ate , read , watched television and wrote letters in a prone position .
At the time , this was the simplest method to simulate the effects of weightlessness on Earth .
But the 370 days this study lasted went way beyond anything that had been done before .
In addition to the medical results , it had unintended consequences .
Some marriages did not survive the strain , and one of the men fell in love with a researcher who was working on the project .
Each participant had been promised a car as compensation for his efforts .
As former Cosmonaut and director of the study Boris Morukov says , “ It was still the Soviet era then , and getting hold of a car was n’t easy . ”
Only one man quit the experiment , after three months – he already owned a car .
8. The Doctor Fox Effect
The lecture that Myron L Fox delivered in 1970 to a crowd of assembled experts had an impressive enough title : “ Mathematical game theory as applied to physician education ” .
His polished performance at the annual conference of the University of California School of Medicine ’s further education program so impressed the audience that nobody noticed that he was an actor , who did n’t know the first thing about game theory .
All that Fox had done was to take a scholarly article on game theory and work up a lecture from it that was quite intentionally full of imprecise waffle , invented words and contradictory assertions .
The researchers behind the experiment – John Ware , Donald Naftulin and Frank Donnelly – wanted to find out whether a brilliant delivery technique could so completely bamboozle a group of experts that they overlooked the fact that the content was nonsense .
The answer is : yes , it can .
At the beginning of the talk , Fox was nervous because he feared people would see through the ruse and recognise him .
After all , he was the actor who played Dr. Benson , the vet who looked after the inspector ’s dog , in Columbo .
But the performance went so well that by the end he was confident enough to take questions from the audience .
A journalist later wrote : “ If an actor makes a better teacher , why not a better congressman , or even a better President ? ”
Ten years later Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House .
9 . Urine in the web
In 1955 , psychiatrists at the Friedmatt Sanatorium and Nursing Home in Basle , Switzerland were trying to find a way to diagnose schizophrenia .
They fed urine concentrate from fifteen schizophrenics to spiders and compared the webs that they spun to those constructed by spiders that had been given researchers ’ urine instead .
No systematic differences were found .
However , the researchers found out one thing : concentrated urine “ must taste extremely unpleasant , despite all the sugar that was added ” .
The spiders ’ behaviour left no room for doubt : “ After taking just a sip , the spiders exhibited a marked abhorrence for any further contact with this solution . ”

Mr. Miller said the bureau ultimately planned to release much more information from its investigative files , including notes of F.B.I. interviews with Dr. Ivins and other suspects and witnesses and surveillance logs detailing his movements and actions .
But those disclosures , requiring a detailed review to remove private and classified information , are likely to be months away .
Mr. Mueller , the F.B.I. director , is likely to face tough questions at next week ’s scheduled oversight hearings , not just about the case against Dr. Ivins but about the prolonged pursuit of Dr. Hatfill .
Senator Charles E. Grassley , an Iowa Republican and frequent critic of the bureau , said he was frustrated by the delay in closing the case and answering questions .
“ If the case is solved , why is n’t it solved ? ” Mr. Grassley asked .
“ It ’s all very suspicious , and you wonder whether or not the F.B.I. does n’t have something to cover up and that they do n’t want to come clean . ”
Investigators have not reviewed three boxes of papers left by Dr. Ivins marked for the attention of his lawyer , Paul F. Kemp , because the records must first be reviewed to see whether they should be kept confidential under attorney - client privilege , Mr. Kemp said .
A government lawyer not involved in the investigation will soon review the papers with Mr. Kemp , who said some might be given to investigators or made public .
What is clear is that the disclosures have not closed the matter .
“ They took their shot , ” said Representative Rush D. Holt , a Democrat who holds a doctorate in physics and has followed the case closely because the letters were mailed in his New Jersey district .
“ They hoped and maybe believed that the case they laid out would persuade everyone .
I think they ’re probably surprised by the level of skepticism . ”
Many scientists who have tracked the case , too , have found the evidence less than decisive .
“ For a lot of the scientific community , the word would be agnostic , ” said Dr. Thomas V. Inglesby , an expert on bioterrorism at the Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center .
“ They still do n’t feel they have enough information to judge whether the case has been solved . ”
Mr. Holt and Dr. Inglesby were among a number of outsiders who said that only an independent review of the investigation and the evidence against Dr. Ivins  either by Congress or a commission like the one that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks  could give the public confidence that the case was over .
Russian television is to give prime time airing 9/11 film on the eve of
this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in New York and DC !
Public showing of Italian Truth film could lead to international tribunal .
Filmmaker Urges International Tribunal to Probe 9/11
Großansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift : The Sept. 11 attacks have provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories
Italian film - maker Giulietto Chiesa , who was in Berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official US version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events .
" Chiesa said .
" Our task is to inform millions of people of the true situation .
Everybody should be involved in this struggle with a tribunal or commission helping once we win approval for the idea , " he said .
In an interview with German news agency dpa , Chiesa , a European parliamentary deputy , said Russian television is to give prime time airing to his film on the eve of this week 's seventh anniversary of the attacks in New York and Washington .
" That means that some 30 million Russian citizens will learn the truth about what happened , which is a very big result for me . "
Chiesa , whose documentary was first screened to a large German audience at the Goethe Institute in Munich in May , was clearly delighted at his reception in Berlin .
" It 's important that so many people have shown up , " he said .
One of a panel of six experts debating the 9/11 topic in Berlin , Chiesa said he was eager for his film to gain more public support and become a " multiplicator " across Germany .
" If that happens it means we are making politics in the right sense of the word . "
Critics question government version of attacks
Andreas von Buelow , a controversial former German minister of technology , and ex-state secretary in the Defense Ministry , was among the Berlin participants who said further investigation was needed into 9/11 .
He told dpa it was " one of life 's characteristics that governments are prone to lie in order to achieve their agendas .
The Americans told us that in Iraq , Saddam Hussein had something to do with al - Qaeda , which was absolutely untrue .
Even the CIA knew this , " he said .
Bildunterschrift : Großansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift : Some say the US invasion of Iraq on a false pretext is proof of government lies of international events
" Then , they told us that Saddam Hussein was preparing weapons of mass destruction , which was also untrue , so they have been lying all over the place and are still fighting there .
Meanwhile a million people have been killed . "
Asked if there was any prospect of a policy change once the next US president was elected , he replied bluntly " No ! "
Juergen Elsaesser , 51 , a Berlin - based journalist and author whose latest book is titled " Terror Target Europe : The Dangerous Double Game of the Secret Services , " spoke of the huge contradictions in the official US version of the 9/11 events .
" Critics find themselves accused of conspiracy theories , but the biggest conspiracy is to be found in the official 9/11 version of the US government which maintains that Osama bin Laden , from a cave in Afghanistan , along with 19 young Arabs , combined to carry out the most perfidious attack in the history of mankind , " he said .
" That just does n't add up .
For me the most important contradiction is how the air defences of the greatest military power on the planet failed to prevent such attacks occurring and that no interceptor fighter planes or rocket systems were ever activated . "

A funny thing happened in the drafting of the largest - ever U.S. government intervention in the financial system .
Lawmakers of all stripes mostly fell in line , but many of the nation ’s brightest economic minds are warning that the Wall Street bailout ’s a dangerous rush job .
President Bush and his Treasury secretary , former Goldman Sachs chief executive Henry Paulson , have warned of imminent economic collapse and another Great Depression if their rescue plan is n’t passed immediately .
Is that true ?
“ It ’s more hype than real risk , ” said James K. Galbraith , a University of Texas economist and son of the late economic historian John Kenneth Galbraith .
“ A nasty recession is possible , but the bailout will not cure that .
So it ’s mainly relevant to the financial industry . ”
The Paulson plan will get some bad assets off the balance sheets of troubled Wall Street institutions and commercial banks .
That may help thaw the lending freeze .

A reader writes about last night 's awful address :
The president waits so long to speak to the public and when he speaks two points stand out :
First there is no recognition -- not even the slightest -- of any failure by his administration in the process .
Second he relies almost exclusively on fear to sell his medicine -- not reason , not patriotism , not a sense that America as a nation will have to share some serious loss .

As it now stands , backers of California 's Proposition 8 , the initiative to ban same - sex marriage , have the fundraising lead , nearly $ 18 million to the foes ' $ 12.4 million .
But that could change .
Hollywood is starting to play a big role in the effort to defeat the initiative .
Director - producer Steven Spielberg and his wife , actress Kate Capshaw , announced today that they would put in $ 100,000 to kill the initiative .
The donation matches a $ 100,000 No - on - 8 contribution announced last week by actor Brad Pitt .
Proponents of the initiative include many of the nation 's most prominent conservative Christian individuals and organizations , including Focus on Family and the American Family Assn. , a group based in Tupelo , Miss. , that singles out the entertainment industry as being at the root of many of the nation 's woes .
In a statement , Spielberg and Capshaw denounced the initiative : " By writing discrimination into our state constitution , Proposition 8 seeks to eliminate the right of each and every citizen in our state to marry regardless of sexual orientation .
Such discrimination has NO place in California 's constitution , or any other . "
Bruce Cohen , producer of the film " American Beauty " and a Los Angeles finance committee co-chair for the No - on - 8 campaign , said the Spielberg - Capshaw donation affirmed " their unwavering commitment to equality in such a significant a way . "
The donation comes as the No - on - 8 campaign begins airing the first ad of the campaign .
The spot features a gray - haired heterosexual couple , Sam and Julia Thoron , explaining that they raised three children , all now adults .
Their daughter , Liz Thoron , is a lesbian .
Soft music plays and a family picture appears .
" My wife and I never treated our children different , we never loved them any differently , and the law should n't treat them differently either , " Sam Thoron , 69 , says .
" If Proposition 8 passes , our gay daughter and thousands of our fellow Californians will lose the right to marry , " says Julia Thoron , 68 .
Frank Schubert , manager of the Yes - on - 8 campaign , called the ad " a blatant appeal to sympathy and emotion . "
" I 'm not surprised that they 're using a heterosexual couple , " Schubert said .
" I do n't think they want to show gay couples .
I think they want to make gay marriage as , quote , normal , as possible .
They want people to think gay marriage is completely normal , when it was created out of whole cloth by four judges . "
California is one of three states with a marriage measure on its November ballot .
Arizona and Florida are the others .
Proposition 8 would create a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between a man and woman .
It would reverse a California Supreme Court decision issued this year that legalized same - sex marriage .

Anyone with normal hearing can distinguish between the musical tones in a scale : do , re , mi , fa , so , la , ti , do .
We take this ability for granted , but among most mammals the feat is unparalleled .
This finding is one of many insights into the remarkable acuity of human hearing garnered by researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , reported in January in the journal Nature .
Izhak Fried of U.C.L.A. and his colleagues worked with epileptic patients who had electrodes implanted in their brain to pinpoint the source of their seizures .
Some of the probes linked to the auditory cortex , providing the researchers with a detailed window into sound processing .
The study revealed that groups of exquisitely sensitive neurons exist along the auditory nerve on its way from the ear to the auditory cortex .
In these neurons natural sounds , such as the human voice , elicit a completely different and far more complex set of responses than do artificial noises such as pure tones .
In this mixed environment humans can easily detect frequencies as fine as one twelfth of an octave — a half step in musical terminology .
The vexing question is : Why ?
Bats are the only mammal with a better ability to hear changes in pitch than humans do .
Predatory species such as dogs are not nearly as sensitive — they can discriminate resolutions of one third of an octave .
Even our primate relatives do not come close : macaques can resolve only half an octave .
These results suggest the fine discrimination of sound is not a necessity for survival .
More likely , the researchers speculate , humans use their fine hearing to facilitate working memory and learning capabilities , but more research is needed to explore this puzzle .
I didnâ€™t want the week to go by completely without noting the revealing interview given by Likud Party leader and former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to the Financial Times and published in its October 7 edition .
The interview makes clear that Netanyahu , who , according to recent polls , would be the front - runner in Israel if new elections were held today , has no interest in a two - state solution and would prefer to lead his country and the Palestinian territories under its control into a de facto apartheid state , bantustans and all .
To quote from the FT :
â€œâ€ ¦Mr. Netanyahu wants to see the West Bank divided into a collection of disconnected economic zones with dedicated business projects .
â€ œThe ancient town of Jericho , for instance , should capitalise on its proximity to the Jordan River to attract Baptist tourists from the US â€ ” a location which the hawkish leader of the Israeli opposition says is â€˜easily worth tens of thousands of jobs .
â€™â€ â€ œThe Palestinians , Mr. Netanyahu adds , would be allowed to hold on to their population centres .
Other parts of the West Bank , such as the Judean desert and the Jordan Valley , should not leave Israeli control .
â€
˜These areas are very significant for us because they are our strategic security belt , â€ ™ he says .
â€œâ€¦â €
™It is not so much that peace brings prosperity – it is that prosperity brings peace , â€ ™ he says.â€ 
All this sounds , of course , a lot like a recipe for setting up Bantustans .
Instead of casinos in Sun City in Bophuthatswana , Netanyahu proposes Biblical tourism for Christian Zionists as a possible economic engine for Palestinian development .
Netanyahu goes on to offer his worldview , one that demonstrates clearly what the neo- conservatives have tried to do since 9/11 â€ ” subordinate the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to a â€œclash of civilizationsâ€ in which the U.S. and the West would naturally have to support Israel .
Quoting again from the FT :
â€ œResolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians â€ ¦is a second - order issue for the Likud leader .
â€ ˜The issue for me is not the Palestinian problem .
I think that conflict has been replaced by the battle between radical Islam and the western world , â€ ™ he says.â€ 
[ Editorâ €™s note :
Is there any doubt that distribution of â€ ˜Obsessionâ€™ in the U.S. and abroad serves Likudâ€™s purposes exceptionally well ? ] â€ œHanding back control of the Israeli - occupied West Bank to the Palestinians as part of a peace deal , argues Mr. Netanyahu , would strengthen the hand of Iran .
â€ ˜Any area we withdraw from will be taken over by Iran and its proxies , â€ ™ he claims , pointing to the takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist group , last year .
â€ ˜Both Lebanon and Gaza have become Iranian bases and they would get a third one if we retreat from the West Bank. â€™â€ 
So , if Netanyahu somehow regains the premiership and has sufficient political power ( and U.S. backing ) to follow through on his current views , the inevitable result will be a de facto apartheid Israel and , one way or another , the end of a state that is both Jewish and democratic .
Indeed , the biggest threat to Israelâ€™s existence clearly lies not with Iran and its allies , but rather from Netanyahu the Likud and those who support them abroad , particularly in the U.S .
Speaking of which , check out a bizarre story in the current issue of The Forward about a U.S. group called â€ œStand Up Americaâ€ led by two retired U.S. generals who have retained a U.S. attorney to represent former Israeli defense minister Gen.
Shaul Mofaz in any legal effort to reverse his defeat last month in the Kadima primary election by Tzipi Livni .
Mofaz , of course , represents the right wing of the centrist party , although , historically , his views are virtually indistinguishable from Netanyahuâ€™s , Mofazâ€™ former mentor in Likud .
( It was Mofaz whose threats against Iran last spring contributed substantially to the biggest daily spike in the global price of oil in its historic rise through the summer . )
The two generals are Thomas McInerney and Paul Vallely who have long advocated a military attack on Iran and have been members of the Iraq Policy Committee , a group that has lobbied hard ( and so far unsuccessfully ) for taking the cultish Mujahadin - e - Khalq ( MeK ) off the State Departmentâ€™s terrorism and for providing it with loads of assistance as leader of the â€œdemocratic oppositionâ€ to the theocracy .
Stand Up America , according to McInerny , is to â€œprotect America and let people understand the danger of radical Islam and the seriousness of global jihad.â€ 
â€ œWe do not want a government in Israel that will support appeasement , â€ McInerney told The Forward .
â€œâ €
¦We believe it is 1938 and everyone is going on , in denial.â€ 
The two generalsâ€™ last trip to Israel was sponsored by the American Israel Education Foundation , an affiliate of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
As sustainable fabrics go , bamboo certainly has buzz on its side .
I ’ll admit to having fallen under its spell , though I ended up fairly unhappy with the durability of the socks and sheets I purchased while trying to avoid non-organic cotton .
Living here in Austin , I can attest that under the right conditions , bamboo does n’t need the care ( read : water ) that even organic cotton does in order to thrive .
There are yards all over the city where bamboo planted as a privacy screen has busted out all over .
It ’s like kudzu , only taller .
So the idea of using bamboo for fabric is extremely appealing .
Plant it , ignore it , harvest it , fabricize it .
It ’s that last part that ’s a problem .
How exactly is thick , reedy bamboo turned into soft , fuzzy fabric anyway ?
The answer is often chemicals .
As the Organic Clothing blog and Victoria Everman have reported , a little bit of bamboo fabric is made by mechanical means in a very labor intensive process where they basically mash it up .
The rest is made by cooking the bamboo in solvents that are neither eco-friendly nor safe for workers .
Rebecca Clarren puts it like this in “ Bamboo shoots and trees ” on Salon.com :
Manufacturers of bamboo textiles use sodium hydroxide — one of the main ingredients in Drano — and carbon disulfide , to turn bamboo into a fiber that can be woven .
Both chemicals are volatile organic compounds that can contribute to smog and of course can lead to a host of diseases if ingested .
The perception that all bamboo is grown without pesticides is also not necessarily correct , says Clarren , and she also notes that shipping the stuff all the way from China is n’t the greenest idea ever .
I have no idea how to compare that to the savings in water from not using cotton , but she has a point .
The Organic Clothing blog notes that friendlier processes for producing bamboo fiber are starting to emerge , but they are not yet widespread .
I ’m always looking for green products that do n’t make me think .
It ’s so tempting to declare something “ safe ” so I do n’t have to work so hard researching products .
In this case , though , it seems that asking a few questions about how the bamboo was grown and processed is necessary before congratulating myself for living more lightly on the earth .
There are lots of good reasons to be annoyed with Paul Krugman .
( Like here , here , and here ) .
But as a cock - eyed optimist , I ’m very happy to have him around .
Think about it :

( The Accidental Theorist , Part 1 )
2. Publicly and articulately advocates free trade without hemming or hawing .
( Pop Internationalism )
3. Identifies anti-globalization activists as the enemies of the world ’s poor .
( The Accidental Theorist , Part 3 )
4. Titles an essay “ In Praise of Cheap Labor : Bad Jobs at Bad Wages Are Better than No Jobs at All ” ( The Accidental Theorist , Part 3 )
5 . Points out that if you oppose Big Government , you should favor cutting Social Security , Medicare , and other popular programs .
( “ The Lost Fig Leaf ” ) Sure , he ’s hoping to scare us away from libertarian rhetoric , but there ’s no use running away from the truth .
Yes , he ’s been slipping .
And it ’s tiring to hear an economist so much more successful than me prattling about equality !
I do n’t begrudge you your publications , Paul , why ca n’t you let Bill Gates , Monty Burns , and Scrooge McDuck count their billions in peace ?
Still , I ca n’t imagine Paul Samuelson doing any of the above , much less Galbraith .
At least in economics , the intellectual climate has n’t been as good as it is now for a century .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors is not considering bankruptcy , the company said in a prepared statement Friday .
The announcement was in response to the automaker 's precipitous stock price decline the previous day , a spokesman said .
" Clearly we face unprecedented challenges related to uncertainties in the financial markets globally and weakening economic fundamentals in many key markets , but bankruptcy protection is not an option GM is considering , " a company statement said .
" Bankruptcy would not be in the interest of our employees , stockholders , suppliers or customers , and we believe speculation about a possible filing is exaggerated and unconstructive , " it said .
GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) shares dropped 31 % Thursday , ending the day at just $ 4.76 , the stock 's lowest price since 1950 .
The stock bounced back 13 cents , or 2.7 % , Friday to close at $ 4.89 .
Deteriorating outlook
On Thursday , Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services placed its ratings for GM under review for possible downgrade .
S&P said the move reflected the weakening of automotive markets across the world and expectations that tight credit markets will make things tough for the foreseeable future .
S&P said it believes GM has enough cash for at least the rest of 2008 , but rapidly worsening industry conditions will make things tough in 2009 .
Also yesterday , J.D. Power & Associates issued a report projecting an even faster decline in U.S. and world auto markets than the market research firm had recently thought .
J.D. Power expects U.S. light - duty vehicle sales to be 16 % lower this year , at 13.6 million units , than in 2007 .
The U.S. auto market will deteriorate even more rapidly in 2009 , J.D. Power predicted , while various global markets will either decline or grow much more slowly .
GM has depended on international growth to offset some of the sales declines in its home market .
The company 's statement denying that it would file for bankruptcy was clearly needed , said David Healy , an analyst with Burnham Securities .
" I suppose the way the stock has acted , they had to say something , " he said .
A GM spokesman dismissed a Friday report by the Associated Press that cited unnamed sources who said the automaker was likely to announce more production cuts and possible plant closures as early as next week .
The company had previously said it would make cuts in engine , transmission and metal stamping operations .
Those cuts were related to closures of plants producing trucks and SUVs , vehicles which have seen sharp declines in popularity in the face of high gas prices and a slowing economy .
GM is not planning any cutbacks beyond that , said spokesman Mike Meyerand .
Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) shares also saw a steep drop Thursday , closing down 22 % to $ 2.08 .
" While we are always disappointed to see our stock value drop , the most important thing we can do for all of our stakeholders is to focus on our tranformation plan , " Ford said in a statement Friday .
On Friday the stock rose almost 8 % to $ 2.25 .
" It was staring at me .
Then he just stood up and jumped on me .
Before he even got me I called , ' Bear ! ' " he said .

Several weeks ago , Digg made online headlines when it banned several dozen of its users , some of which were among its most highly ranked contributors ( including Reg “ Zaibatsu ” Saddler , who by some metrics was the # 3 Digg user of all time ) .
On Digg ’s blog , the company explained that the bannings were a result of script abuse , although some observers found this explanation to be unconvincing .
Shortly afterwards , Digg announced that it had raised $ 28.7 million in a new round of venture funding .
And in the last few days , Digg jettisoned more members of its community with another fresh round of bannings , again including many high profile users .
A separate Digg blog post patiently re-iterated Digg ’s justifications for these actions .
A palpable level of online controversy has ensued as banned users have cried foul , while other users have applauded Digg ’s actions .
For anyone who is actively involved in online community - building , whether through a blog , a website , or a social network , examining the events of the past few weeks quickly reveals several important lessons about how Digg has handled the establishment and growth of its community .
But perhaps more importantly , the way that Digg has gutted user morale and shown itself willing to cast off those that have been so crucial to its success also reveals the limits of its core crowdsourcing model .
Building a Flawed System
Kevin Rose demos Digg in 2004
Before we can get into all of that , let ’s take a moment and revisit the past .
Recall that Digg launched in December of 2004 .
At the time , Digg was regarded as a direct competitor to Slashdot due to its focus on tech stories .
In a 2006 interview with ZDNet , Digg founder Rose proclaimed the site ’s raison d’etre , saying :
[ Digg ] was just a side project of mine and something that we wanted to try out by giving power and control back to the masses .
Typically with technology news sites a handful of editors choose which stories are relevant and which they believe the audience would like to read about .
This was the first time that anyone experimented with allowing the general mass audience to decide what they believed to be the most important topic of the day .
At a time when the idea of Web 2.0 was just beginning to take hold and millennials were chafing under the constraints of receiving their news through the mainstream media , Digg offered the promise of news that was determined for the people , by the people .
The fundamental assumption behind the site was similar to that of any crowdsourcing model :
The wisdom of the masses will provide news stories that are more relevant , interesting , or informative than anything chosen by a select few .
Unfortunately , things have n’t quite worked out that way .
In order to understand why , it ’s important to know the difference between Digg ’s website ( i.e. the nuts and bolts of how it functions ) vs. Digg ’s business ( i.e. as a potentially money - making Silicon Valley startup ) .
Both of these elements play important but distinct roles that led to the unmaking of Digg ’s purported mission .
The Website
For those who are unfamiliar , Digg ’s basic website functionality was as follows :
Users found links they wanted to share from across the Internet and submitted them to Digg , where they were automatically entered into an “ Upcoming Section . ”
Users could vote or “ digg ” up stories if they enjoyed them and if they received enough diggs , based on Digg ’s proprietary algorithm , the story would be promoted to the front page .
In theory , the Upcoming Section could be a thriving area of the site , where stories were discussed and voted upon , but as the site grew larger and the rate of submissions accelerated , it quickly became useless to check this section , due to the sheer volume of information ( As of October 2008 , roughly 10,000 to 15,000 stories are submitted to Digg per day .
That is about one story every 7 - 10 seconds ) .
But Digg also had other features as well .
Specifically , it allowed you to 1 ) Have your own profile page , and 2 ) Follow people by making them your “ Friend . ”
Initially , profile pages displayed user stats , such as the number of stories submitted and the percentage of those stories promoted to front page ( later , they would also display personal information such as photos and links to other social networking sites ) .
Making someone a “ Friend ” allowed users to follow that person ’s actions , including stories submitted and dugg .
Users quickly realized that one way to get diggs for their submitted stories was to make someone your Friend and consistently digg that person ’s stories .
Reciprocal diggs would usually follow .
Using this process to find interesting stories , and to find online friends who would digg your own stories , was considerably easier than wading through the morass of thousands of stories submitted daily in the Upcoming Section .
As a result of all of these elements , the system favored stories submitted by users who had a combination of the following attributes :
• The time and the inclination to find interesting stories •
The time to digg their friend ’s stories •
The will to both digg and submit stories consistently over a long period of time
Users who had these attributes naturally saw a large percentage of their stories get promoted to the front page .
This was what led to the concept of “ top users ” or “ power users , ” a notion that was , in some ways , antithetical to the idea of democracy ( and that ’s completely leaving out the fact that the site needs editors to supplement the efforts of its users ) .
Why should a really fascinating or interesting story have a higher chance of getting promoted to the front page if it was submitted by a top user than a newcomer ?
Indeed , today still , a story submitted by a top user will instantly garner a significant number of diggs from followers , often regardless of the story ’s quality .
While Digg ’s algorithm was theoretically supposed to correct for this , page after page of front page stories submitted by the same few individuals demonstrated that Digg was not doing its stated job very well .
At one point , Digg ’s top 100 users were responsible for over 50 % of Digg ’s front page stories .
This was Digg ’s fundamental problem , although it did n’t have to be :
It was an attribute shared by many other Web 2.0 companies .
Only a small fraction of the total number of users contributed substantially to the site .
According to recent Quantcast statistics , 1 % of the Digg ’s users are contributing 32 % of the site ’s visits .
But this is no different than a company like Wikipedia , which clocks in billions of pageviews every month , yet whose articles and infrastructure are mostly maintained by a few thousand enthusiasts .
While Wikipedia and similar sites have found ways to recognize and reward their active participants , Digg , as we ’ll see , has constantly tried to shake the image that it is controlled by a select few .
The Business
From the business end , Digg has acted in ways to consistently grow its page views and expand its audience in the three and half years since its founding .
About a year ago , Digg changed its interface to make friends ’ stories significantly less accessible and to require more clickthroughs , a move that was widely decried by power users and which inadvertently led to the script situation that it is currently caught up in .
In a stunning analysis by ReadWriteWeb , the site also began dramatically expanding the variety of its front - page topics , focusing less and less on technology as the years went on ( in other words , while the proportion of tech stories to all stories submitted remained roughly the same , the proportion of tech stories promoted to the front page went down dramatically ) .
The implications of this were more troubling : Digg was actively manipulating the distribution of front page stories .
Combined , these moves showed that Digg was becoming ever - more conscious of its need to appease investors as time went on .
Despite a lucrative ad deal with Microsoft in 2007 , social networks like Digg remained ( and still remain ) notoriously difficult to create a business model around .
Digg has also struggled to contain the influence of its top users throughout its existence .
Far from acknowledging their contributions , Digg has constantly denied their key role its growth .
On an episode of Diggnation , Rose even claimed that he did n’t know who the top users were , saying , “ I do n’t pay attention to who might be considered a top Digger , or who ’s not . ”
In early 2007 , Digg stopped hosting a public list recognizing users that were getting the most front page stories .
According to Digg , this move was to prevent them from being harassed , although the list has since moved elsewhere with few complaints of any such trouble .
More recently , Digg has shown its independence by banning dozens of high - activity users , allegedly due to script use .
Some of the scripts employed actually allowed users to digg their friend ’s stories more easily , giving Digg pre-2008 levels of functionality .
Digg ’s recent actions are objectionable and suspect for a number of reasons .
First of all , several of the banned users have complained there was no warning given and that the decision was irreversible .
But most importantly , while many relative new users were swept up in the mix , top users such as “ CosmicDebris ” and several others were also eliminated .
These users have helped Digg to deliver dozens of millions of page views and clicks to sites across the Internet .
It is not an exaggeration to say that they have helped to make Digg the popular site that it is today .
For Digg to cast off these users like so much dead weight , rather than work with them constructively , is an indictment of Digg ’s recklessness with its devoted community .
It has also brought to light the tension between Digg and those users that have climbed their way to the top by learning Digg ’s system .
As a result , several other top users have expressed fear that their accounts , which they have poured hundreds of hours of time into , will be next on the chopping block .
Recent events have given hints about Digg ’s upcoming trajectory .
This past summer , Digg rolled out its Recommendation Engine , allowing users a new way to find interesting stories and taking some focus and dependency off of its top users .
In July , Google allegedly and mysteriously walked away from a deal to buy Digg , amidst longstanding rumors that the cofounders have been intent on a sale .
And earlier this month , Digg recently reported a new round of venture funding and declared it would be expanding worldwide .
Put all of these together and you get the picture of an organization that is trying to establish it is not dependent on the efforts of a few dedicated and unpaid volunteers ( i.e. its top users ) to keep its website interesting and thriving .
But what has it sacrificed in its attempt to prove this ?
Lessons Learned
The way that Digg has handled its growth reveals important lessons , both for competing social news sites and for social media companies looking to build thriving communities :
True Democratization of News is Difficult – Rose and his crew are undoubtedly a talented group of programmers , but even their Digg algorithm has had compensating for the flaws inherent in Digg ’s system .
In the years following its creation , Digg became less a democracy and more a republic , with a select few users responsible for the majority of front page stories .
The Web is still struggling to come up with a news model that can efficiently crowdsource its editorial process , although sites that automate the process ( e.g. Techmeme ) or sites that rely on editors ( e.g. Fark , Slashdot ) are at least more transparent with their advantages and failings .
Recognition is a Key Motivator – Social networks typically have a tangible way for users to track their notoriety .
MySpace has “ Friends , ” Youtube has “ Number of Times Viewed , ” and Twitter has “ Followers . ”
Digg has “ Stories Made Popular . ”
Top users often pointed to this number with pride , a reminder of the thrill of seeing one ’s submission spread to thousands of eager readers .
Digg , however , has done nothing to acknowledge their contributions and with its recent bannings , it has indicated it does n’t believe it needs them at all .
While Digg ’s growth may not be adversely affected by the accounts gone missing , it seems that when Time named “ You ” the Person of the Year in 2006 , they were actually on to something more meta than originally thought :
People like being recognized for contributions and the potential for Internet fame that may follow .
Social networks that have gone on to insanely high valuations or become profit - making ventures have recognized this fundamental fact of Web 2.0 .
Digg has not .
Communities Require Nurturing –
The way that Digg has treated it users has not been with the committed touch of a benign leader , but of a dictator that assumes its actions ( or lack thereof ) will be consistently met with the assent of its followers .
Its town halls have been little more than PR exercises , and user - requested features like the Recommendation Engine have taken years to roll out , while others ( e.g. forums ) have yet to be implemented at all .
A comparison between Digg and Mixx quickly shows that while the former ’s traffic still trounces the latter ’s , Mixx ’s founders and employees have been open about how they are fostering the growth of their website .
Anecdotal comparisons between , say , “ The Drill Down ” podcast ( which covers tech news as well as social news sites like Digg ) and Mixx ’s unofficial podcast , “ Social Blend , ” starkly contrast how each company has dealt with its fanbase .
While Digg and its policies are frequently an object of criticism on “ The Drill Down , ” “ Social Blend ’s ” contributors typically have nothing but kind things to say about their digital overlords .
Conclusions
Kevin
Rose recently claimed that his primary goal in the most recent round of bannings was to enforce the TOS and make the site easier to use .
According to Rose , the bannings are only a response to people trying to subvert the system :
What happens is that some people try and get around [ Digg ’s algorithm ] , and they try different ways of doing this .
One of these methods is called script digging … and they go and they will digg their friend ’s stories , in order to help propagate those stories on the recommendation engine , or to help promote them to the front page .
They use automated methods … sometimes it ’s very apparent …
We have ways of telling how they do it .
And so what ’s going on is that these people are abusing the system , they are using extra resources and when they throw that many diggs at the system at once it sets our database slaves a little bit off kilter and they will have to readjust everything .
We ’re talking about , not damaging , but definitely causing a spike in usage and slowing down the site for other users , especially when multiple people are using it , or hundreds of people , whatever it may be .
And so what we do is we always give people a second chance .
We ’ll stop them from doing this , we ’ll put limitations on it .
Oftentimes , and I hate to say it , but these people are trying to game the system …
There are users that are on the site that will come out on their blog and swear that we have blocked them and that Digg is turning on their users ... I can assure you , there ’s no reason for us to do that .
The thing we want more than anything else is a healthy , accurate community .
We do n’t want people to game the system , we want it to be fair to everyone .
So , we ’ve started banning people .
If people are abusing us multiple times , I do n’t care if they ’re the number 1 digger or the number 5 millionth digger .
We ’ll ban them , because it ’s B.S.
It does n’t matter how popular you are .
I do n’t care which user it is , if they are gaming the system , they are going to get banned .
And we ’ll be able to tell , we ’ll be able to detect that .
If Digg ’s management responds to this article they will undoubtedly re-iterate this and say that they are simply trying to protect the community ( e.g. by enforcing the TOS equally ) .
For the moment , let ’s put aside whether or not it ’s plausible that a few hundred people using the alleged scripts can significantly affect Digg ’s formidable servers .
What I have tried to establish is that Digg is giving you an incomplete story .
To prove to its investors that its democratization model is functional , Digg has decided that it has a vested interest in getting rid of its top users .
In its misguided efforts , it has destroyed the community that it sought to create .
While antagonizing and banning its most active contributors may be expedient , Digg will only ensure a new group of followers will similarly rise up over time , forcing the exact same measures down the line .
This will continue until Digg solves the fundamental issue with its site :
That those that are most committed will always have the most control .
Digg may continue to grow in traffic and size , but with every controversial move like the recent banning measures , it will irritate a continually growing contingent of its most ardent supporters .
Unless Digg can find a way to embrace its fans rather than eliminate them , it will find its brand promise as the leader of news democratization fading fast .

The US government today announced the biggest financial bailout in the country 's history as it took troubled mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into temporary public ownership to save them from collapse .
The US treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , said the Federal Housing Finance Agency , hitherto the two companies ' regulator , would henceforth run the companies in a state of " conservatorship " and the two chief executives would be replaced by new men .
Paulson had briefed presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain over the weekend about the plan .
McCain gave it his immediate backing but Obama said he would reserve judgment until he saw further details , adding that determining the future of the companies would be a top priority if he won the White House .
" We have to protect taxpayers and not bail out the shareholders and management , " he said .
The plan received the full backing of the Federal Reserve chairman , Ben Bernanke , and financial markets appeared likely to be cheered by the news .
The move helped put a prop under one part of the financial system that had been looking particularly shaky for several months .
Rumours of the move on Friday were sufficient to push shares up on Wall Street after the London stock markets had ended a bad week by shedding another 2.25 % to close at 5,240.7 .
The US government was forced to announce a plan to prop up the finances of the troubled mortgage giants in July .
Paulson said then that Washington would buy up shares in the two companies and underwrite their ballooning debt , which has risen to around $ 800 bn ( £ 452 bn ) each .
Congress at the time approved lending unlimited amounts to the two companies or taking a stake in them if they ran into real trouble .
The two companies have lent or underwritten about $ 5.3 trillion of the total $ 12tn of outstanding mortgage debt in the United States .
Freddie and Fannie have long been considered as being too big to be allowed to fail .
The collapse in the housing market and surge in mortgage defaults meant the two groups racked up a combined $ 14bn of losses over the past year .
Although there are increasing signs from the US that house prices are stabilising after falling for two to three years , many analysts say the housing market 's problems are far from over .
" Mortgage delinquencies continue to set new records , promising more losses and future write - offs for banks and other mortgage lenders , " said economists at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort .
" The problems are spreading from the subprime sector to prime loans , particularly to mortgages with adjustable rates and optional payment features .
With unemployment rising faster , cyclical problems will now compound the damage caused by falling house prices . "
Someone once said there is no such thing as bad weather , just bad clothing .
This is mostly true .
Dressing properly for cold weather certainly has a great deal to do with my enjoyment of riding in the winter , but I have to admit that I like the looks on my co-workers ' faces when I ride my bike into work at 5 F .
I 'll also admit to enjoying and taking full advantage of the incredibly mild winter we had last year .
On the other hand , I would n't mind a little snow this year , so I can use my 2 year old , but used - only - once cross country skis !
And maybe even the studded bike tires !
I 've learned and changed a few things over the years , but the fundamentals have n't changed - layers of clothing , with a good wicking baselayer , topped off with a wind / waterproof jacket , good gloves , good shoes and a proper hat .
In this series of posts , I will talk in both general and specific terms .
For instance I may mention using a wool t- shirt as a baselayer and then I may include a few sources for ones I have and like .
In the past I 've received comments that I am suggesting that one has to spend a fortune on equipment and clothes for winter riding .
This is definitely not the case .
However I am certainly of the opinion that good gear is worth its weight in gold on a cold rainy ride .
I do have a few pricey items , like my Lake winter cycling boots and my Goretex rain jacket , but in their defense , I 've gotten and will continue to get many more years of use from them .
Besides the cost is more than offset by savings on gasoline and car maintenance .
Base Layers
Sales of existing homes rose in July , surpassing expectations , as buyers snapped up deeply discounted properties in areas hit hardest by the housing bust .
But the number of unsold homes hit a high — evidence that the worst housing slump in decades is far from over .
Prices nationwide are n't expected to hit bottom till early next year .
The National Association of Realtors said sales rose 3.1 % , to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 million units , up from June 's downward - revised annual rate of 4.85 million units .
July sales had been expected to rise by only 1.6 % , according to economists surveyed by Thomson / IFR .
Sales were about 13 % lower than a year ago , and prices were off sharply .
The median price of homes sold in July ( half sold for more , half for less ) fell to $ 212,000 , 7.1 % from July 2007 .
Despite the third monthly sales increase this year , the number of unsold single - family homes and condominiums rose to 4.67 million , the most since 1968 , when the NAR started tracking the data .
That was an 11.2 - month supply at the July sales pace , matching the all - time high , set in April .
Until the supply is reduced , analysts say , the housing slump is likely to persist .
The inventory is being swelled by a wave of mortgage foreclosures : 33 % to 40 % of sales activity is coming from foreclosures or other distressed properties , estimates Lawrence Yun , NAR chief economist .
Though buyers are pouncing on lower prices — especially in such states as California , Florida and Nevada — sales are weak in states such as Texas .
" People are responding to lower prices , " Yun says , but there 's " too much uncertainty " about the housing market 's future to mark a definite bottom .
In Las Vegas , sales were 96 % higher in July , after prices fell more than 25 % , to a median of $ 220,000 , according to The Associated Press - Re / Max Monthly Housing Report , which analyzed sales recorded by real estate agents in 55 cities , regardless of company affiliation .
Sales in Los Angeles were up 31 % after prices fell 35 % over the past year , to a median of $ 335,000 , according to the AP - Re / Max report .
In Miami , sales were up 9 % , while prices dropped nearly 10 % , to a median of $ 280,000 .
One of those sellers last month was Jennifer Del Pino , who unloaded her 3,600 - square - foot Miami home to a buyer from Germany for $ 490,000 .
Having cut her asking price by $ 60,000 , she sold her house in about a month .
One unknown for the housing market is the future ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to supply money for loans .
The two government - sponsored mortgage giants have sharply cut back their mortgage activity as they cope with rising losses from foreclosures .

Jeremy Pascoe has been using a hire car since his Land Rover was stolen A motorist has spoken of his anger after his stolen car was held at a police pound for four years and stripped of many of its parts .
Jeremy Pascoe , 42 , is suing Thames Valley Police because he says there was so much damage to his Land Rover Discovery , it had to be scrapped .
A dog had been living in the vehicle with a bowl of food left in the boot .
A police spokesman said Mr Pascoe had rejected a compensation offer and it was for the courts to settle the case .
Mr Pascoe 's five - year - old Discovery , then worth £ 8,900 , was stolen from outside his home in Cobham , Surrey , in 2004 .
' Systematically stripped '
It was recovered by West Midlands Police , but then handed over to Thames Valley Police as evidence in a car theft case .
When Mr Pascoe tried to retrieve the car two years later , the police insisted on keeping it because they said there was a dispute over its ownership .
This case has been duly considered and compensation was offered to Mr Pascoe - the offer was rejected
Thames Valley Police
It was finally returned to him in January this year .
" It had been systematically stripped , " he said .
" The wing mirrors had gone , the headlights were missing and smashed and every single panel on the car had been targeted , including the roof .
" I think it was harvested for parts or they all went on eBay .
There had been a dog living in the car - there was fairly fresh dog food in the back .
" This had happened whilst on a police pound on an army base in Oxfordshire . "
When the car was recovered in 2004 , a report by West Midlands Police said it had three small scratches on one door and a slightly flat front tyre .
But a report filed earlier this year indicated the car was a write - off .
' No apology ' Last month Mr Pascoe won a court action against Thames Valley Police at Oxford County Court .
He is now waiting for a new hearing to find out how much compensation he should receive .
In the meantime , the commercial music company director says he and his wife Rachel , plus daughters Emily , four , and Phoebe , 16 months , have been forced to hire a car .
He said he has rejected a police offer of £ 1,800 compensation .
" My issue with the police is when the car was recovered and handed to them it was a five - year - old Discovery in very good condition .
When it came back it was scrap , " he said .
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the incident was " regrettable " but until the legal proceedings were over it would not be offering Mr Pascoe an apology .
" This case has been duly considered and compensation was offered to Mr Pascoe .
The offer was rejected and it's now for the court to decide the level of payment , " he said .

What are these ?
Icons Of Fright were recently invited to sit down with several other journalists and ( Låt den rätte komma in ) directorfor a round table interview .
Among one of the many subjects to come up is the recently announced American remake of his classic film .
" I ’m not involved at all , " he told us .
When asked if he was unhappy with the idea of someone else remaking his film for American audiences ( when the original has yet to come out theatrically ) , he told us , " It gives you some sort of feelings of jealousy , of course .
I have been dancing with this material for 3 years , and now somebody else is doing it .
But , you have to put that aside and just wait and see what they come up with .
And maybe they ’ll find other things in that book that could be interesting .
It would be very sad if they made a copy of this .
" Once such thing that was excised from the novel for the movie adaptation was the nature of the relationship between Eli and her " blood supplier " Håkan .
" We had to make some big choices of things we had to cut out " , he tells ICONS .
" The biggest thing that we left out that the character Håkan , the older “ blood ” supplier for Eli , he was an outspoken pedophile in the novel .
So that really gave another tone to the whole thing .
That ’s too often used as say … an emotional special effect , without taking responsibility for what that really is .
It ’s a really complicated thing to debate on screen , I think .
So that would ’ve disturbed the story a lot to have that .
" I asked Tomas if he'd be receptive if the producers of the remake or director Matt Reeves approached him for his thoughts or advice .
He simply answered , " No . " Look for our entire round table interview with Tomas Alfredson later this week !

( Låt den rätte komma in ) was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a script by John Ajvide Lindqvist ( and based on his original novel of the same name ) and stars Kåre Hedebrant , Lina Leandersson , Per Ragner , Henrik Dahl , Karin Bergquist , Peter Carlberg , Ika Nord & Mikael Rahm .

In his book , Slayer Slang , A Buffy the Vampire Slayer Lexicon , Michael Adams tells how this unconventional teen challenged linguistic taboos and introduced new words and phrases in nearly every show .
Slayer , witch , werewolf , vampire , commando , contractor , vengeance demon , supernatural force incarnate – in other words , they are all average kids , in average relationships , battling the forces of adolescent evil , personified , in Sunnydale at least , by vampires , demons , and monsters .
They are also particularly adept speakers of American English , especially of slang .
After her self - sacrifice , Buffy is buried under a headstone that reads “ She Saved the World . A Lot . ”
What does it mean for American English that the world ’s protector , its thoroughly contemporary American savior , is a rapid - fire quipster , a hip teen who knows the language of her place and time , but who , by virtue of her role as Slayer , however hesitantly accepted , is necessarily an unacknowledged hero , an essentially normal person whose destiny casts her out of the mainstream , whose status paradoxically erases her status in the conventional world ?
Buffy needs slang , as a means of shrugging off millennial expectations , as a weapon , and as an expression of personality officially denied her by her role : in a sense , she IS slang , as are those who associate with her .
Slayer slang may be here to stay , not only as slang , but as standard American English
Buffy has introduced new slang terms and phrases in nearly every episode , many of them formed in the usual ways , some of them at the crest of new formative tendencies .
The show incorporates familiar slang , too ; the familiar and newly coined slayer slang together compose a particularly vivid snapshot of current American teen slang .
Undoubtedly , most slayer slang will prove ephemeral , not that there ’s anything wrong with that ; indeed , short - lived terms and tendencies are often significant in their time and can influence the course of American English , though once they disappear , we may not see the connections between them and what follows them .
Some items of slayer slang , however , steadily intrude on everyday speech and may be here to stay , not only as slang , but as standard American English .
Does anyone feel like we ’ve been Keyser Sozed ?
Besides contributing items to the slang lexicon , slayer slang intensifies current formative practices in slang : it glories in them , certainly , but it also constitutes , by exaggerating them , a critique of those practices .
For instance , the writers acknowledge that slang increasingly trades on references to popular culture by shifting proper names into other parts of speech , both verbs and adjectives .
Thus Xander asks in ( 5 May 1997 ) , “ Does anyone feel like we ’ve been ? ” after the character inwhen he means ‘ tricked , manipulated ’ .
Afraid that Halloween will get out of hand , Xander remarks in ( 27 October 1997 ) , “ Halloween quiet ?
I figured it would have been a big ole vamp , ” from the alternative rock festival ; similarly he argues in ( 8 December 1998 ) , “ Look , you wanna do , fine , but I ’m done with that . ”
On much :
When we say sentences like Walk much ?
we shorten
Do you walk much ? ;
Do you is understood by both speaker and auditor .
At first glance , Whedon ’s sentences seem well - behaved , but they are n’t really :
Do you excuse much is not what he has in mind in Excuse much ; if anything is understood , it must be a pronoun , yet it is n’t the me we usually assume , but you , as in the very colloquial declaration Excuse you !
And what is the result ?
Excuse ( you ) much , which makes a lot less immediate sense than Walk much ? , not least because the question is “ … rude or anything ? ” rather than the phrase involving much .
When we hear a word or sentence pattern , it undergoes scrutiny , whether we ’re conscious of it or not : we judge its acceptability according to a certain set of standards ; the standards vary according to the vocabulary against which the newer item is measured .
In the case of much , collocations with verbs in brief questions have long been acceptable in colloquial English ; collocations with adjectives have not .
At first , those saying or listening to ADJECTIVE + much constructions approved of them as slang because such sentences do not pass our acceptability judgments : in other words , acceptability as slang depends on a certain degree of unacceptability with regard to a standard .
After a while , though , ADJECTIVE + much had been repeated often enough that it lost at least some of its original unacceptability .
Without offense to the perpetually hip Gary Trudeau , when sentences like “ Off message much ? ” appeared in Doonesbury ( 7 October 1999 ) , the once rebellious much had begun to conform , to enter the consciousness , perhaps even the verbal repertoire , of the statusful .
And it does n’t help the street cred of ADJECTIVE + much that NOUN + much is clearly so much more effectively rebellious against traditional English grammar and conventional meanings of much , of course , but also against the increasingly acceptable ADJECTIVE + much ; comparatively , after those more radical collocations began to appear , Pathetic much ?
just does n’t seem so tough .
Even NOUN + much faces gradual acceptability : Stephanie Manzella does n’t seem to have missed a beat when asking her boyfriend , Tim Redding , who was having trouble parking , “ Curb much ? ”
While NOUN + much consigns ADJECTIVE + much to acceptability , frequent repetition of both ADJECTIVE and NOUN + much gradually may push the latter into colloquial English usage as well .
Slang is a type of linguistic jaywalking

When the McCain campaign released the bad news it had accumulated in its post - haste vetting of Sarah Palin , it did so all at once , during the holiday weekend at the end of last month .
They chose this strategy , as one key campaign adviser promised a New York Times reporter , " to flush the toilet . "
And what a toilet it is .
Just to pick one of the examples that actually relates to the issue of Palin 's mode of governance – the ostensible reason she was chosen to be a heartbeat away from the presidency by a man with a 72 - year - old ticker – is to enter a political and ethical looking - glass that makes Whitewater - era Arkansas appear to be a mirage of high - minded , almost Platonic public service .
But while Whitewater obsessed Washington 's journalists for almost a decade and led ultimately to the impeachment of an enormously popular president , 2008 's version of Troopergate has failed to inspire much in the way of outrage or even media interest .
Despite any number of attempts to obscure them , the facts of the matter , while complicated , are also clear .
Last July , Palin demanded of Alaska 's public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan - whom she had appointed to the job - that he fire her ex-brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , from his post as a state trooper .
( Wooten was , at the time , in divorce proceedings with the governor 's sister . )
A formal investigation of Wooten was undertaken , with the result that he was briefly suspended from his job - a punishment that did little to satisfy Palin .
At one point Monegan felt forced to warn the governor 's husband Todd Palin : " You ca n't head - hunt like this .
What you need to do is back off , because if the trooper does make a mistake , and it is a terminable offense , it can look like political interference . "
Unable to get what she wanted , Sarah Palin fired Monegan , without offering much in the way of a cause or an explanation .
Monegan soon fought back with his story of public pressure over a private matter .
The apparent capriciousness of Palin 's action led to an investigation by a bipartisan panel in Alaska 's legislature .
At that point , Palin complained that Monegan had not been a " team player on budgeting issues , " and created her own investigation inside the Alaska attorney - general 's office .
This backfired , however , when the attorney - general 's office found that Palin 's record was at odds with her public statements .
In fact , members of her staff had sought Wooten 's firing and - according to a recent report in the Washington Post - both Palin and her husband personally participated in the campaign to oust him .
The Palins ' new tactic appears to be to try to shut down any investigation by virtue of non-cooperation .
Key witnesses have ignored subpoenas , including the Palins themselves .
They have attacked Monegan both personally and politically .
As the Anchorage Daily News complained : " Palin and McCain are trying to ignite a partisan firestorm that wipes out the Troopergate investigation until after the [ presidential ] election . "
This may not be possible , as the Alaska legislature is planning to issue its report – as originally promised – by October 31 .
Whether this strategy of non-cooperation , disparagement and , by all appearances , dishonesty , will work as an effective cover - up strategy will depend on how interested the rest of the mainstream media remains in the story , and how well the McCain team 's strategy of attacking all media institutions works .
It 's hard to believe that America might actually be even more dishonestly , ineffectually and ideologically governed after January 20 , 2009 than before it .
But the Palin / Troopergate story , like so much of the tone and tenor of the McCain campaign post - nomination , offers ample evidence for just such a nightmare scenario .

While the British government puts huge amounts of pressure on ISPs to clamp down on file - sharers , it is doing some pirating of its very own .
It seems that Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's own website is in serious breach of copyright , as it is based on a ripped - off Wordpress theme .
The issue of copyright is a hot one in the UK right now and the government is n’t scared of getting involved .
It has been putting huge amounts of pressure on ISPs to take action against alleged music file - sharers , so imagine , if you will , the beautiful crimson color Prime Minister Brown ’s face will turn today when he is declared a pirate too .
Amongst other things ,
Anthony from antbag.com makes WordPress themes – he gives them away for free but if someone wants to donate , they can .
His work is released under Creative Commons 3.0 license , which means that if someone wants to use a theme ‘ as is ’ or modified in some way , they are required to credit him .
A link in the footer of every theme he creates points back to Anthony ’s site – this is the minimum attribution he expects , which is pretty damn reasonable .
So imagine Anthony ’s surprise when he discovered that his NetWorker theme for WordPress had been used by the British government without honoring the Creative Commons license .
The theme has been heavily modified , including the removal of all links back to his site , but Anthony has been able to verify from the source files that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s own website is in fact built on NetWorker .
It is clear that Brown ’s site indeed uses the Anthony ’s theme – violating the Creative Commons license .
Not only was the link to the the original removed , Brown ’s site should have also made their version available under a similar license – share alike .
Still , the site even claims it is protected by Crown Copyright – a quick look at the CSS for the theme should dispel that myth .
Anthony sent an email to the company who developed the site who claimed that although they did some testing on the NetWorker theme , they then rebuilt it from scratch .
Unfortunately , according to Anthony “ they failed to remove the credits in the CSS file that named the theme ‘ NetWorker ’ or to change the theme folder which is named ‘ NetWorker - 10 ’ ( Networker version 1.0 ) . ”
There is a campaign running in the UK right now featuring “ Knock - Off Nigel ” along with cringe - worthy videos depicting this fictitious character as some kind of social outcast .
One would think that Mr Brown would avoid the sort of behavior that could easily make him the star of the next campaign but if it ’s good enough for the MPAA , it must be good enough for him .
Update :
We were contacted by Dave Smith , Managing Director of New Media Maze , the creators of the Number 10 site .
He has a full statement on this issue which is available here , but in summary , here is his explanation , in his own words :
1 . The only file that was drawn upon from AntÂ ’s theme was the CSS file , a fact that we have never denied .
2. Under AntÂ ’s theme license ( CCL ) , there was no requirement to attribute the work to him in the footer .
3 . Under the CCL , he was correctly attributed in the CSS file that was used .
4 . Therefore we have abided by the license of AntÂ ’s work and are not guilty of ‘ ripping off ’ anyone ’s work .
For his part , Anthony does n’t wish to prolong the conflict .

Yesterday 's story about the tragic death Rangers prospect Alexei Cherepanov has taken a more disturbing turn now that amateur video ( available after the jump , watch if necessary ) of the final minutes of his life has been revealed .
The official medical report lists his death as chronic ischemia , a condition in which not enough blood gets to the heart or other organs , and his death was not caused by any contact as was originally reported .
Now Russian league officials are angry and concerned , calling out both the actions of the emergency workers at the game facility and why Cherepanov was even playing with this disease .
Pavel Krasheninnikov , who sits on the Russian Hockey Federation 's supervisory council and is a member of the State Duma , said there was no ambulance on duty at the arena where Cherepanov 's Russian team , Avangard Omsk , was playing .
He asserted that emergency workers took too long to respond and did n't have a defibrillator , a machine used to shock the heart .
It was unclear how much time it took paramedics to respond .
" There are elements of negligence here , " Krasheninnikov said in televised comments .

Both Rangers officials and Cherepanov 's North American agent say the young forward cleared all of his recent physicals and there was no evidence of the potentially fatal disease .
The video of Cherepanov 's final moments on the bench before he 's limply carried away without a stretcher , which Wyshyinski appropriately calls " repulsive . " does reveal a disturbing reality of the KHL .
The Russian crowd , obviously unaware of the severity of the situation applauds as Cherepanov is carried off the bench , hopeful that he'd be okay .
The odd music piping through the arena at the time also adds an eerie element to it .

From the Republican State Senate President Lyda Green :
" She 's not prepared to be governor .
How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ? " said Green , a Republican from Palin 's hometown of Wasilla .
" Look at what she 's done to this state .
What would she do to the nation ? "
I repeat : the Republican State Senate President .
From Palin 's hometown .
I mean , the ads just write themselves .
And the Democrats :
Anchorage Democratic state Sen. Hollis French said it 's a huge mistake by McCain and " reflects very , very badly on his judgment . "
French said Palin 's experience running the state for less than two years has n't prepared her for this .
Alaska Democratic Party chairwoman Patti Higgins , attending her party 's national convention in Denver , said she was shocked to hear the news this morning .
" In this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is ... under a cloud of suspicion , who is under investigation for abuse of power .
It just sounds like a pretty slow start to me , " Higgins said .
The Obama people should say nothing .
They do n't need to .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The US Supreme Court announced today that they have accepted the writ of certiorari filed by the State of Hawaii seeking to reverse the Hawaii State Supreme Court ’s decision of January 31 , 2008 , that curtails the State ’s ability to sell or otherwise dispense , what is commonly referred to as “ the Ceded Lands . ”
The acceptance of the “ cert ” means that the US Supreme Court will review the submitted arguments and render its decision .
The State of Hawaii is counting on a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court .
At stake is the very survival of the 50th State of the union .
The land in question is the 1.8 million acres ( nearly half the total land area of the Hawaiian Archipelago ) that was hijacked from the government and the crown heads of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1894 by the illegal , self - declared , rebel government , the Republic of Hawaii .
A few years later , in 1898 , the Republic of Hawaii “ annexed ” itself to the United States , and in the process , passed off ( “ ceded ” ) the stolen lands to the U.S.
The puppet government , the State of Hawaii , is now holding the bag of stolen property deceptively called the “ Ceded Lands . ”
The salient point is , the Republic of Hawaii did not have lawful title ( or rights ) to these lands when they were handed over ( “ ceded ” ) to the U.S.
Thus , no lands lawfully transferred .
Although this act of “ cession ” was clearly unlawful , any objections were summarily ignored , overruled or dispatched by the bully power of the U.S.
In 1959 , the U.S. magnanimously passed on the stolen property ( the “ Ceded Lands ” ) as the land base for the newly created puppet government called the State of Hawaii .
The Apology Law The January 31 , 2008 Hawaii State Supreme Court ’s decision surprised everyone .
It was the first time that a state court acknowledged that United States Public Law 103- 150 ( commonly called “ The Apology Law , ” passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1993 ) carries the force of law .
Until this decision in January , all previous efforts by Hawaiian Kingdom nationals to invoke USPL 103-150 in state and federal courts in Hawaii had been summarily rejected by those courts .
In essence , the State Supreme Court ’s decision says that the State ’s ownership of the “ ceded lands ” is questionable because the Apology Law clearly indicates that these lands were improperly acquired .
The court thus concluded that until the State of Hawaii settles this ownership question with the “ native Hawaiians ” the State cannot sell or otherwise transfer any portion of those “ ceded lands . ”
In its ruling , the court parrots the prevailing assumption that “ native Hawaiians ” are the default claimants to the lands .
The Rightful Claimants
While it is true the State of Hawaii does not own the “ ceded lands ” neither do the so - called “ native Hawaiians . ”
By citing “ native Hawaiians ” as the default claimants to the “ ceded lands ” the State Supreme Court perpetuates a critical error , ignoring the historical and lawful fact that the lands in question belong to the Hawaiian Kingdom , not the “ native Hawaiians . ”
This mis-direction is employed to avoid addressing the actual crime — the theft of the national autonomy and the national lands of the Hawaiian Kingdom .
It also avoids the rightful remedy — the return of the national autonomy and national lands to the Hawaiian Kingdom .
The rightful owners of the land are the parties from whom they were stolen : the crown ( ruling monarch ) and the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom .
The monarch and the national government hold these lands in trust to benefit the people of Hawaii .
Misdirection
By projecting the “ native Hawaiian ” as the injured party , the State Supreme Court follows the lead of the Apology Law and deliberately misdirects the issue , framing it as a mere domestic problem rather than a significant international violation .
When the United States landed armed troops to support the 1893 seizure of the Hawaiian Kingdom by insurrectionists , the U.S. brazenly violated the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Kingdom , a peaceful nation with close , friendly , treaty - guaranteed relations to the U.S.
There were no complaints , no disputes and certainly no hostilities to justify the invasive action by the U.S. Aside from acknowledging the unlawfulness of the violation , the U.S. did nothing to rectify the situation .
Instead , in 1898 , the initial violation of Hawaii ’s sovereignty was shockingly amplified when the U.S. commenced its hostile occupation with the fraudulent “ annexation . ”
Today , the State of Hawaii perpetuates the fraud in order to cover up its inherent illegitimacy as a puppet government installed under the illegal occupation of the U.S.
This “ ceded lands ” case represents a desperate effort by the State of Hawaii and the U.S. to overcome the problem caused by the illegal “ annexation ” and the lack of clear title to the so - called “ ceeded lands ” — officially implicated in the Apology Law as lands having been stolen from the Hawaiian Kingdom .
What ’s at stake for the State ?
The State of Hawaii is counting on the U.S. Supreme Court to : 1 ) ignore the fact that the lands claimed by the State is actually stolen property and 2 ) somehow remove the cloud over the State ’s claim to these lands .
The State ’s primary obstacle is the Apology Law .
Thus , to overcome this obstacle , the State of Hawaii is seeking to have the U.S. Supreme Court dismiss or otherwise invalidate the Apology Law ; to render it as a noble sentiment , but having no force of law .
Failure to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to nullify the Apology Law would destroy the very basis of the existence of the State of Hawaii .
If the Hawaii Supreme Court ruling is upheld , it implies the State of Hawaii has no land !
No land , no State .
Furthermore , the Apology Law ’s implication that the State of Hawaii has no land , also indicates that the State of Hawaii has no lawful standing as a political entity .
This is because the same set of events , circumstances and illegal actions that produced the “ ceded lands ” fraud , also implicates the various puppet governments from the Republic of Hawaii to the State of Hawaii as frauds .
Since they all stemmed from the same illegal acts , they are all unlawful frauds .
Therefore , the default owner and the default governing authority is the one that was in place before the unlawful actions started , January 16 , 1893 .
The lawful default government is the Hawaiian Kingdom .
Other ramifications
Not only is the very existence of the State of Hawaii at stake , this landmark case portends dire ramifications for any lands “ acquired ” from Native Americans all across the U.S.
Seeing the potential danger , twenty - nine other states have filed friend - of - the - court briefs supporting the State of Hawaii in its effort to strike down the Apology Law .
These states rightfully fear that if the Apology Law is not overturned , much of their lands would be placed in serious jeopardy , especially those gained from the Native American through broken treaties , deception and theft .
Either way it goes , the outcome of this case will generate tremendous repercussions throughout the United States .
Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for the U.S. State Department to begin negotiating with officials of the Hawaiian Kingdom for a peaceful transitional process to restore Hawaii as an independent nation .

Nanoflowers Could Lead to Superior Batteries
September 12th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Flower - shaped nanoparticles , or “ nanoflowers ” , might lead to superior batteries in the near future .
Chemist Gaoping Cao and colleagues report in the latest issue of Nano Letters that they are working on developing nanoflowers which could lead to longer battery life for cell phones , laptops , and more .
While nanoflowers are not new , Cao claims that previously discovered forms of the nanoparticle were n’t able to provide the longer battery life that will be necessary for electronics of the future .
In Cao ’s study , scientists grew clusters of carbon nanotubes — each 50,000 times smaller than a strand of human hair — that have strong electrical conductivity .
They then put manganese oxide on top of the nanotubes .
The process resulted in dandelion - shaped nanoclusters that will ultimately lead to a battery system with a higher energy storage capacity , longer life , and greater efficiency that current batteries .
And while I would be happy to have a more self - sustaining laptop , perhaps the nanoflowers will have even more important uses — like keeping future plug - in hybrid vehicles running for longer .

Jose Luis Hernandez rose from vegetable chopper to sous chef at an exclusive New York restaurant -- and saved $ 100,000 along the way .
Recently , the illegal immigrant from Mexico contacted real - estate agents in Brooklyn , N.Y. , where he currently rents an apartment .
" I wanted to use my money as a down payment on a house , " says Mr. Hernandez , 32 years old .
In doing so , he sought to join thousands of undocumented workers who in recent years have purchased homes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number , or ITIN , instead ...

The Two Souls of Socialism
4 . The Myth of Anarchist “ Libertarianism ”
One of the most thoroughgoing authoritarians in the history of radicalism is none other than the “ Father of Anarchism , ” Proudhon , whose name is periodically revived as a great “ libertarian ” model , because of his industrious repetition of the word liberty and his invocations to “ revolution from below . ”
Some may be willing to pass over his Hitlerite form of anti-Semitism ( “ The Jew is the enemy of humankind .
It is necessary to send this race back to Asia , or exterminate it ... ” ) .
Or his principled racism in general ( he thought it was right for the South to keep American Negroes in slavery , since they were the lowest of inferior races ) .
Or his glorification of war for its own sake ( in the exact manner of Mussolini ) .
Or his view that women had no rights ( “ I deny her every political right and every initiative .
For woman liberty and well - being lie solely in marriage , in motherhood , in domestic duties ... ” ) – that is , the “ Kinder - Kirche - Küche ” of the Nazis .
But it is not possible to gloss over his violent opposition not only to trade - unionism and the right to strike ( even supporting police strikebreaking ) , but to any and every idea of the right to vote , universal suffrage , popular sovereignty , and the very idea of constitutions .
( “ All this democracy disgusts me ...
What would I not give to sail into this mob with my clenched fists ! ” )
His notes for his ideal society notably include suppression of all other groups , any public meeting by more than 20 , any free press , and any elections ; in the same notes he looks forward to “ a general inquisition ” and the condemnation of “ several million people ” to forced labor – “ once the Revolution is made . ”
Behind all this was a fierce contempt for the masses of people – the necessary foundation of Socialism - from - Above , as its opposite was the groundwork of Marxism .
The masses are corrupt and hopeless ( “ I worship humanity , but I spit on men ! ” )
They are “ only savages ... whom it is our duty to civilize , and without making them our sovereign , ” he wrote to a friend whom he scornfully chided with : “ You still believe in the people . ”
Progress can come only from mastery by an elite who take care to give the people no sovereignty .
At one time or another he looked to some ruling despot as the one - man dictator who would bring the Revolution : Louis Bonaparte ( he wrote a whole book in 1852 extolling the Emperor as the bearer of the Revolution ) ; Prince Jerome Bonaparte ; finally Czar Alexander II ( “ Do not forget that the despotism of the czar is necessary to civilization ” ) .
There was a candidate for the dictator ’s job closer to home , of course : himself .
He elaborated a detailed scheme for a “ mutualist ” business , cooperative in form , which would spread to take over all business and then the state .
In his notes Proudhon put himself down as the Manager in Chief , naturally not subject to the democratic control he so despised .
He took care of details in advance : “ Draw up a secret program , for all the managers : irrevocable elimination of royalty , democracy , proprietors , religion [ and so on ] . ” – “ The Managers are the natural representatives of the country .
Ministers are only superior Managers or General Directors : as I will be one day ...
When we are masters , Religion will be what we want it to be ; ditto Education , philosophy , justice , administration and government . ”
The reader , who may be full of the usual illusions about anarchist “ libertarianism , ” may ask :
Was he then insincere about his great love for liberty ?
Not at all : it is only necessary to understand what anarchist “ liberty ” means .
Proudhoun wrote : “ The principle of liberty is that of the Abbey of Theleme [ in Rabelais ] : do what you want ! ” and the principle meant : “ any man who can not do what he wants and anything he wants has the right to revolt , even alone , against the government , even if the government were everybody else .
“ the only man who can enjoy this liberty is a despot ; this is the sense of the brilliant insight by Dostoyevsky ’s Shigalev : “ Starting from unlimited freedom , I arrive at unlimited despotism . ”
The story is similar with the second “ Father of Anarchism , ” Bakunin , whose schemes for dictatorship and suppression of democratic control are better known than Proudhon’s .
The basic reason is the same : Anarchism is not concerned with the creation of democratic control from below , but only with the destruction of “ authority ” over the individual , including the authority of the most extremely democratic regulation of society that it is possible to imagine .
This has been made clear by authoritative anarchist expositors time and again ; for example , by George Woodcock : “ even were democracy possible , the anarchist would still not support it ...
Anarchists do not advocate political freedom .
What they advocate is freedom from politics ... ”
Anarchism is on principle fiercely anti-democratic , since an ideally democratic authority is still authority .
But since , rejecting democracy , it has no other way of resolving the inevitable disagreements and differences among the inhabitants of Theleme , its unlimited freedom for each uncontrolled individual is indistinguishable from unlimited despotism by such an individual , both in theory and practice .
The great problem of our age is the achievement of democratic control from below over the vast powers of modern social authority .
Anarchism , which is freest of all with verbiage about something - from - below , rejects this goal .
It is the other side of the coin of bureaucratic despotism , with all its values turned inside - out , not the cure or the alternative .

Christie Brinkley ’s ex-husband Peter Cook seems to think it ’s really important for him to salvage his name – even though the guy has so little self - awareness that he does n’t realize every word out of his mouth only makes his situation worse .
The online porn addict / real life adulterer gave an interview to 20 /20 that will air this Friday .
In it , Cook tries to blame every single martial problem on Brinkley , and instead of looking better just looks like a simpering fool .
Brinkley fired back at Cook ’s comments later that day and has since applied for a restraining order to keep Cook away from their children .
Christie Brinkley has filed a request for a temporary restraining order and a motion for post - judgment relief again her ex-husband Peter Cook , a Suffolk County , N.Y. , official confirms to PEOPLE .
The motion was filed Wednesday – two days before Cook ’s revealing interview with ABC ’s Barbara Walters is set to air .
Cook , 49 , who has admitted to having an affair with an 18 - year - old assistant and an online pornography habit , told Walters during his interview for Friday night ’s 20/20 broadcast , “ I ’m not the … pervert that I ’ve been painted to be . ”
The restraining order would prevent Cook from seeing his children and is not to keep him away from Brinkley , a source close to Cook tells PEOPLE .
“ She ’s upset because the kids are seen in footage during the 20 /20 interview , ” the source says .
Cook last saw the children when they had dinner on Wednesday night , and they are scheduled to be together this weekend , the source says .
Brinkley and Cook halted their messy divorce trial in July when both parties announced a settlement deal .
The judge in the case , Mark Cohen , signed their final divorce decree Sept. 29 .
The new motion is on the court calendar for Oct. 29 , but the court official said it ’s unclear at this point whether the parties will actually appear in court or if their lawyers will simply submit statements to the judge in writing .
[ From People ]
So Cook and Brinkley were officially divorced on September 29th .
That means within a week of everything being over and done with , Cook had violated the confidentiality agreement that was part of their divorce settlement .
Wow , that really does sound like a trustworthy , upstanding guy .
I think he ’s just a narcissist and is incapable of handling people thinking he ’s anything less than absolute perfection .
He needed his ego stroked by his wife and his 18 - year - old girlfriend , and now he ’s aware that the general public thinks he ’s slime .
All that matters to Cook is doing whatever it takes to let him think everyone else admires him again ; otherwise his entire ego will crumble .
Considering it only took a week for him to mess up , it sounds like Brinkley and Cook ’s custody issues will go on for a long , long time .

Aether , a collaboration between Edmund McMillen ( Gish , Triachnid , Coil ) and Tyler Glaiel ( Magnetism , Paths ) , is a gloriously imaginative puzzle adventure game where you swing through the stars to reach the planets .
You start on Earth , with the visit of a creature that takes you on a strange odyssey .
Using the [ ASWD ] keys for direction , you click on the left mouse button to launch the tongue of the creature up into the clouds .
Swing from cloud to cloud to go higher up until you reach space , then swing from star to star to launch yourself toward one of four other planets and solve a puzzle for each one .
Once you 're above the clouds and you have enough speed , you can also just hurtle through space without being attached to any stars .
There are different colored navigation indicators pointing you towards each planet that look like butterflies .
Two - key combinations can also help you gain momentum , for instance pressing up and left at the same time can help you can gain enough swing to go completely around in a circle .
Each planet 's puzzle has a different type of solution .
When you successfully solve each one you see a flash of light .
After you complete all four puzzles , head back to blue earth to complete the game .
Analysis : Surely influenced by The Little Prince , the game seems to take place within the imagination of a child .
On each planet you encounter creatures with some kind of complaint or anxiety , each trouble is symbolically released through creative puzzles .
A few things about the game were a bit wonky .
On some of the planets , solving the puzzle did n't solve the creatures ' problems , which was confusing .
The somewhat clumsy physics of the tongue while swinging makes it difficult at times to build momentum .
Combined with the gravity of a planet or moon , this makes it awkward to leave a planet , so starting off is the hardest part to get used to .
It was also difficult to tell where the planets were as you were approaching because the navigation indicator would disappear .
But those are small quibbles in an otherwise amazing game .
The designers have made a truly compelling experience with excellent atmosphere .
It 's a fantastic artistic endeavor with delightful physics - based game play and creative puzzles .
You can also just spend some time flying through space or the clouds , the music and movement are so relaxing .
Play Aether
Let ’s play a little game called “ Guess Who Said It ” :
“ I ’m the new energy , the new face , the new ideas , and he ’s got the experience based on many , many years in the Senate , and voters are gonna have a choice there of what it is that they want in these next four years . ”
Was it :
( a) Barack Obama on John McCain
( b) Sarah Palin on Joe Biden
The answer is ( b ) Sarah Palin on Joe Biden , in another conversation with Katie Couric to air tonight .
Because if voters do n’t want someone who ’s been in the Senate for “ many , many years , ” they should obviously vote for … wait .
Is n’t there some other guy on Palin ’s ticket whose experience is also based on many , many years in the Senate ?
John McSomething ?
So , right , Palin ’s pitch does n’t really pass muster .
Of course , Obama has also made much of the same “ change vs. experience ” argument before , despite his running mate having decades of Washington experience .
As he proclaimed in his convention speech , to take but one example , “ The change we need does n’t come from Washington .
Change comes to Washington . ”
Maybe Obama and McCain can switch V.P.s so these arguments start making sense ?

Every teacher wants to be the cool guy , the Robin - Williams - in - Dead - Poet 's - Society friend to students , but a court case from Connecticut offers a lesson to teachers - in - training : be careful when you buddy up to students online .
While sites like MySpace make it easy to engage in casual contact with students , they also make it easy for the contact to cross professional red lines .
Jeffrey Spanierman 's teaching contract was not renewed after teaching English for several years at a high school in Ansonia , Connecticut , and he sued the school district over his release .
The case began several years ago when Spanierman created a MySpace page under the name " Mr. Spiderman " and began friending students .
When a guidance counselor eventually came across the page , she found that Spanierman had posted a ten - year old picture of himself on the page .
In addition , the counselor saw " pictures of naked men with what she considered ' inappropriate comments ' underneath them . "
But just as disturbing were the " very peer - to - peer like " conversations that Spanierman had with students — and we 're not talking about file - swapping .
Court documents seen by Ars show that Spanierman talked to his students this way :
Spanierman : " Repko and Ashley sittin in a tree .
K I S S I N G. 1st comes love then comes marriage .
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL " Student : " dont be jealous cuase you cant get any lol : ) " Spanierman : " What makes you think I want any ?
I 'm not jealous .
I just like to have fun and goof on you guys .
If you do n't like it .
Kiss my brass !
LMAO "
( The judge notes in a footnote to his ruling that " spelling and grammatical rules are not always closely followed in such casual or informal online exchanges , and that oftentimes certain phrases are abbreviated or expressed in a form of shorthand [ e.g. , ' LOL ' can mean ' laughing out loud , ' and ' LMAO ' can mean ' laughing my ass off ' ] . " )
Do n't be this guy
The question is whether this type of behavior crosses a professional line .
When Spanierman was approached about the page , he took it down ... and then proceeded to put it back up under the name Apollo68 .
This move sealed his fate , and his contract was not renewed after the new page was discovered ( students had complained about some of the content and tone ) .
So what happened to freedom of speech ?
Freedom of association ?
Are teachers no longer to have MySpace pages ?
Should they avoid friending students ?
The judge addressed some of these legal questions , noting that Spanierman did not have tenure and was not fired , ruling out wrongful termination issues .
He also could not sue on free speech grounds because most of his content was simply casual ( in some cases very casual ) speech .
The only " protected " speech on his MySpace page , the content of which might possibly get him into trouble , was a poem about the Iraq war that Spanierman .
It opens thusly :
The damage is done .
No Where [ sic ] to run .
The sand and sun are n’t any fun .
They rain down all day in the fields where soldiers lay [ sic ] .
Their firearms held tightly .
Their steps fall lightly .
They watch for the enemy .
A man , woman or child they see .
He could be any of the three .
In houses they go hoping bombs wo n’t explode .
For war of revenge that has no end .
Et cetera .
This is Vogon - level poetry , the sort of stuff that led the judge to write , " Leaving aside the question of whether one could call this bit of poetastery an ' elegant articulation ' of the current conflict in Iraq , the court concludes that , construing all ambiguities in favor of the Plaintiff , the poem could constitute a political statement . "
However , because the content of the poem had nothing to do with his contract nonrenewal , the judge noted that free speech issues do n't actually apply .
The case is one in which the school district was " reasonable " to expect " a teacher with supervisory authority over students , to maintain a professional , respectful association with those students .
This does not mean that the Plaintiff could not be friendly or humorous ; however , upon review of the record , it appears that the Plaintiff would communicate with students as if he were their peer , not their teacher . "
Such issues predate MySpace , but student / teacher interactions generally took place in the school setting , with teachers dressed as teachers and surrounded by the symbols of their authority .
Forging social networks with one 's own students and communicating with them over the Internet at all hours , in school and at home , certainly make it easier to be less formal .
And when the age gap between student and teacher is n't more than a few years , slipping into the kind of talk seen above is n't difficult to imagine .
Over at PBS ' Mediashift , lawyer Jeffrey Neuburger had some astute comments on the case , noting that the " easy familiarity " of sites like MySpace , " in the view of the school district , drew Spanierman over the line between acceptable discourse and inappropriate communications .
The severity of the punishment may also reflect an institutional discomfort with a new means of student - teacher communication that is outside the channels customarily controlled by the school district . "
Be that as it may , the judge gave the school broad discretion to make judgments about whether such contacts were disruptive to the learning environment .
Spanierman 's suit was tossed , though the case does lead us to wonder what student / teacher interaction will look like a decade from now .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
In one $ 85 billion fell swoop , the U.S. Federal Reserve may have wiped out what credibility it won resisting Lehman Brothers ’ rescue plea and opened its door to countless other companies to come calling for cash .

By providing a massive loan to American International Group on Tuesday , just two days after refusing to use public funds to save Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy , the central bank also invited tough questions on how exactly it determined whether a company was too big to fail .
Between the $ 29 billion the Fed pledged to swing the Bear Stearns sale to JPMorgan in March , $ 100 billion apiece to rescue mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , up to $ 300 billion for the Federal Housing Authority , Tuesday ’s $ 85 billion loan to insurer AIG and various other rescue deals and loans , taxpayers are potentially on the hook for more than $ 900 billion .
“ They pretended they were drawing a line in the sand with Lehman Brothers but now two days later they ’re doing another bailout , ” said Nouriel Roubini , a professor at New York University ’s Stern School of Business .
“ We ’re essentially continuing a system where profits are privatized and ... losses socialized , ” Roubini said , adding that auto makers , airlines and other struggling businesses would no doubt be asking for government help too .
The government was hard pressed to say no to AIG because of concerns that its collapse would harm thousands of companies around the world and cause chaos in the $ 62 trillion market for credit default swaps , where it is a big player .
Many on Wall Street were clamoring for a rescue earlier on Tuesday , and AIG ’s share price swung wildly throughout the day as rumors swirled of an on again , off again government rescue .
But Roubini said instead of handing out money to firms that made bad bets -- which could inadvertently encourage more risky behavior if companies think they have a safety net -- the government should be buying up mortgages and rewriting the terms so that households are not buried in debt .
STRINGS ATTACHED
To be sure , the Fed attached quite a few strings to its AIG funding deal .
The loan carries a high interest rate , the government can veto any dividends , and AIG is expected to sell assets over the next two years to repay its debt .
Senior management will be replaced .
But the central bank also followed a pattern established with Bear Stearns in March and repeated with Fannie and Freddie earlier this month of essentially wiping out shareholders while protecting those who held debt .
Some economists warned that investors had caught on and were betting on future bailouts by selling stock and buying bonds in struggling firms .
That ends up pushing down a company ’s share price , which can exacerbate its troubles .
“ If the message is that any time something like this pops up we ’re going to wipe out the equity and coddle the bondholders , that is its own sort of moral hazard , ” said Michael Feroli , an economist with JPMorgan in New York .
“ I do n’t think you have to be a die - hard free market advocate to be at least a little bit concerned . ”
BERNANKE ON THE HILL
Fed officials said that they needed to act because of AIG ’s extensive involvement in financial markets .
Through its insurance , risk and asset management businesses , AIG has dealings with many thousands of companies all over the world , so a bankruptcy would have had huge global repercussions .
RBC Capital Markets analyst Hank Calenti pegged the market impact of an AIG failure at more than $ 180 billion , or about half of the total capital that financial firms have raised since the beginning of the credit crisis last year .
But JPMorgan ’s Feroli said the Fed could have chosen to let AIG fail , just as it had done with Lehman .
“ We do n’t know if the disease would have been worse than the medicine , ” he said .
“ We ’ll never know .
But we know we lived through Lehman . ”
He said the central bank needed to clearly explain when and why it would act to salvage a company in jeopardy or face the prospect of a long line of companies seeking bailouts .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , who has stayed out of the public eye during the Lehman and AIG drama , is due to testify before a congressional committee next week and can expect some pointed questioning , Feroli said .
“ He needs to provide some sort of clear demarcation of what is or is not a systemic risk . ”
“ Of the many unconventional actions taken by the Fed in the current crisis , this may likely prove to be the most controversial and should make Bernanke ’s ... testimony on Capitol Hill an interesting event . ”
Joy Behar Says " Sarah Palin is So Dumb " .... gasp !
It was nearly a free - for - all during the opening segment of the ABC morning talk show The View on Wednesday .
As is their normal practice , the ladies chimed in on some hot topics and politics was at the forefront .
Behar wanted to discuss 's latest interview withand things quickly got heated .
Palin made a stump speech earlier this week and she got a big laugh when she remarked that she 's been hearing about 65 year old Joe Biden 's Senate speeches since she was in 2nd grade .
Couric brought up the sound bite during their interview and asked , " When you have a 72 year old running mate is n't that a risky thing to say ? "
Palin replied , " Oh no , it 's not anything negative . "
Joy Behar was livid about the way Palin tried to insinuate that she had n't meant it as a slight against Biden .
She blurted , " The fact that she 's so dumb as to say " .... which brought a host of wow's and whoa's from the other View co-hosts and studio audience .
She then tempered her words and corrected , " Politically not astute , let 's put it that way . "
That was just the beginning .
Barbara Walters turned on Elisabeth Hasselbeck in an uncharacteristic manner .
Whoopi Goldberg did what she does best - she demanded to be heard and started out with her ever popular statement " the truth is " .
Who knew she was the truth squad .
With 34 days to go until election day , we need to brace ourselves because it 's starting to get really , really ugly .
Check it out on video below :
There 's a serious ergonomic issue with the controls , specifically the buttons ...
Almost all of the buttons are flush , which looks nice , but there need to be some nibbies ( technical term there ;-) ) for tactile feedback ... like the raised nibs on the " F " and " J " keys on the home keys of your keyboard .
The nibs should be stragegically placed so that you can find other keys based on the tactile focus points .
And the buttons themselves should have bevels around them so that you can tell where each button is .
Bottom line , after a week of ownership you should be able to find every button / control on the center stack in the dark without having to take your eyes off of the road .
This is not a major technical challenge , just good ergonomic design .
Flash works everywhere ?... that 's news to me .

Flash works everywhere ?
That 's news to me .
I assume you 're not spending much time in Linux then .
I 'm running 32 - bit Linux because so many sites I enjoy depend on Flash , which is VERY difficult to get working on 64 - bit Linux .
Also , I actually found myself having to install flashblock on Firefox because the flash plugin is so buggy .
To my knowledge , my browser never crashes due to Java applets or JavaFX ... certainly not for unwelcome advertising ( yet ) .
Browser crashing due to Flash - heavy advertising - laden pages seems to happen weekly before I installed the blocker .
Also , Flash applets often seem to kill my CPU and perform very poorly .
I have no idea if that 's due to the Flash authors or the plugin , but the bottom line is that I resent Flash and wished less sites used it .
The more important point , however , is that Flash needs competition .
I think JavaFX , in a few iterations , could be a first - class competitor to Flash either killing it or persuading Adobe to take platforms outside of Macintosh or Windows more seriously as well as improve it 's core features and performance .
I welcome the competition and am actually excited about the potential for Sun to do a better job with desktop Java this time around .
I 'd like to see Java become a major player in the desktop space in the future and in order to so they 'll need to work on performance as they 're starting to address with this release .

in response to Faro G JAVA FX is one of the major future release item .
I am still waiting to see how easy will the web development will become with it .
A good visual editor to make JavaFX applets should be developed .
I hope that Sun will improve the current NetBeans visual editor for JavaFX .
Instead , the eclipse based visual editor for Adobe Flex is very good .
The major advantage to use an Adobe Flex applet instead of a Java Applet ( previous 6u10 ) was the performance and the amount of kb to download .
I do n't know if JavaFX will fill the performance gap .
The promise with Jdk6u10 ( and next Jdk7 ) to minimize the kb download should be accomplished .
...
Creating a complex enterprise application with JavaFX alone and not reusing JSF / Spring Web Flow / SEAM etc , will it make sense ?
I still need to understand how this all will integrate .
I think the new JavaFX will be used instead of the good - old Java Applets , and will not replace the good - old HTML - AJAX - JSF sites ( SpringMVC , Jboss Seam , ) .
Thus , in the next future , we 'll have the choice to make : - a light - weight web site with JSF ( Seam , ... ) ; - a RIA web site with JavaFX Applets or with Adobe flex .

So now we hear leaked word that the FBI is beginning an investigation into whether ACORN “ helped foster voter registration fraud around the nation before the presidential election ” and where there is “ any evidence of a coordinated national scam . ”
Let ’s note a few points .
DC
Republicans have been aggressively lobbying the DOJ to open an investigation into ACORN in advance of the election .
And leaking word of such an investigation ( possibly starting the investigation at all ) most likely violates DOJ guidelines about DOJ / FBI actions which can end up interfering with or manipulating an election .
But , remember , this is right out of the book of the Bush Justice Department ’s efforts to assist in GOP voter suppression efforts in the 2004 and 2006 elections ( part and parcel of the US Attorney firing story ) .
This is the same scam US Attorney firing player Bradley Schlozman got in trouble for pulling with ACORN just before the 2006 election .
And before he got canned , Gonzales helped revise and soften the departmental prohibition on DOJ announcements , thus making it easier to play these kinds of games .
This is a big deal .
It may be their last gasp to use the DOJ to help mitigate the scale of Republican defeat on November 4th .

Paddy and I went nuts getting this up the nanosecond it came up .

Although Microsoft's Games for Windows brand has enjoyed ample support from third - party publishers , gamers have been less enthusiastic with its adoption than its console counterpart , Xbox Live .
One of the primary reasons for the aversion is that a number of services usually taken for granted as free by PC gamers are available only for those who subscribe to Microsoft 's Gold membership , which carries a $ 49.99 annual fee .
However , this week Microsoft is tearing down that barrier to adoption .
The company has announced that effective immediately , all multiplayer components of its Games for Windows - Live service are free .
All gamers will now have unlimited access to multiplayer matchmaking with friends , TrueSkill matchmaking , multiplayer achievements , and cross- platform gameplay , which were previously available only to Gold subscribers .
Those features are in addition to previously gratis goods , including friend lists , text and voice chat , and single - player achievements .
The GFW - Live multiplayer update applies to both current and future games that are compatible with Microsoft 's PC brand .
The publisher also reiterated several announcements made during its E3 Media & Business Summit presentation , saying that a PC version of the Xbox Live Marketplace will launch this fall , and that the Windows Live in - game user interface will undergo a significant revamp .
The publisher did not reveal whether the new PC interface will make use of the recently revealed Xbox Live avatar system .
In related GFW news , Microsoft also dropped a few tech - head details for the next revision to its application framework , DirectX 11 .
Calling DX11 " a big step forward for gaming , " Microsoft said that its newest game - development tool will implement new computer - shader technology , which it claims " lays the groundwork for the GPU to be used for more than just 3D graphics , so that developers can take advantage of the graphics card as a parallel processor . "
DX11 will also feature increased support for multicore processors and " tessellation , which blurs the line between super - high - quality prerendered scenes and scenes rendered in real - time . "
Does the Truth Matter Anymore ?
This is not false naivete : I am genuinely surprised that John McCain and his campaign keep throwing out false charges and making false claims without any qualms .
They keep talking about Sarah Palin ’s opposition to the Bridge to Nowhere without any embarrassment over the fact that she once supported it .
They keep saying that Barack Obama will raise taxes , suggesting he ’d raise them on everybody , when Obama ’s plan , according to the Tax Policy Institute , would cut taxes for “ about 80 percent of households ” while “ only about 10 percent would owe more . ”
And as Sebastian Mallaby pointed out in his recent column , Obama would cut taxes for middle - income taxpayers “ more aggressively ” than McCain would .
And now comes a truly vile McCain ad accusing Obama of supporting legislation to offer " ' comprehensive sex education ' to kindergartners . "
The announcer declares : " Learning about sex before learning to read ?
Barack Obama .
Wrong on education .
Wrong for your family . "
Margaret Talev of McClatchy newspapers called the ad a “ deliberate low blow . ”
Here ’s what she wrote in an excellent fact check : “ This is a deliberately misleading accusation .
It came hours after the Obama campaign released a TV ad critical of McCain 's votes on public education .
As a state senator in Illinois , Obama did vote for but was not a sponsor of legislation dealing with sex ed for grades K - 12 .
But the legislation allowed local school boards to teach ‘ age - appropriate ’ sex education , not comprehensive lessons to kindergartners , and it gave schools the ability to warn young children about inappropriate touching and sexual predators . ”
Is McCain against teaching little kids to beware of sexual predators ?
McCain once campaigned on the idea that the war on terrorism is the “ transcendent ” issue of our time .
Now , he ’s stooping to cheap advertising that would be condemned as trivial and misleading in a state legislative race .
Boy , do I miss the old John McCain and wonder what became of him .
And I wonder if the media will really take on this onslaught of half - truths and outright deception .
UPDATE : I wrote this post late Tuesday night .
I 'm glad to see the story on the front page of today 's
Post begin to take up what will be an ongoing imperative in this campaign .

Sounds like wishful thinking .
My galvanic response is to agree that every Java hacker I ever knew was a jerk and every Python hacker a bigot and every COBOL hacker ... well , I only knew one and he was my high school comp sci and calculus teacher and he was pretty damn nice ... but it 's not true .
I 've known a couple of awesome Java hackers and far and away the most annoying , bigoted , and time wasting hacker I ever had to work with was 100 % Perl .
It was n't anyone here though .
I think that 's part of this place 's charm .
It spits out people like that pretty quickly .
Sidenote : a huge number of those in prison in the US in particular do n't belong there at all : Incarceration Rates .
And those numbers only get more awful when you add race to the mix– South Africa under Apartheid was internationally condemned as a racist society .
What does it mean that the leader of the " free world " locks up its
Black men at a rate 5.8 times higher than the most openly racist country in the world ?
- Incarceration is not an equal opportunity punishment
Not to get a political thread started , just saying .
How " evil " one is is not a direct function of how incarcerated one is .
That 's all not to mention that 60 % of US prisoners are there for so - called crimes which involve no dishonesty or violence .
Drug laws in the US are a sad , unfunny joke .
I 'm not sure how that relates to programming , though , except that certain programming languages are sad , unfunny jokes , too .
I wo n't start a flame war by naming them , and I 'm sure everyone has their own favorites to name to the category anyway .
Suffice it to say that Perl is n't a joke and Intercal I find funny .
Perl as a language is friendly and fun , and tends to attract people who are friendly and fun too ;-)
Personally , I have learnt and used many languages over the years but have loved Perl since we met , and have stayed faithful ever since .
And that is probably at least partially because something in my brain resonates with the way ( _s_ )
Perl allows me to do things .
I 'd also suggest there is a correlation between Perl users and the FLOSS community in general .
It 's hard to be a Perl user without picking up a lot of the larger open source mind set - co-operation , collaboration , tolerance and acceptance - all of which are a Good Thing for making one 's way in the world in general .
As for making Perl knowledge a job requirement for holders of public office - sounds like a wonderful idea , but I recall how optimistic the U.K. media were when M Thatcher was running for PM because she was a science graduate and therefore was it was believed that she would be a more rational leader ... ' nuff said .
so i suggest that the programming language has the effect of rewire the brain somehow i also suggest that all governers , presidents , kings , and so on must know some perl to be qualified for their position by passing an international exam by the united nation .
Please do n't reveal the secret of how the geeks plan to take over the world . :-)
I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth Remember How Lucky You Are
If there is a correlation it might not be because of learning a programming language , but rather because of the act of programming .
Programming is one of the few things where 1 ) you can see what you produced does n't work .
FULLSTOP . and 2 ) there 's noone to blame but you .
You may blame the computer , the compiler , the teacher ... but if you persist and actually do debug the program you wrote you find out that the blame was on you .
Again and again .
This does teach some humility .
And unteaches blaming others for your faults .
Besides .. polite ne successful .
More often than not it prevents success .
Jenda
Support Denmark !
Defend the free world !
perl 's low defect rate must help to reinforce that effect . :)
I do n't think there 's any causative effect , really .
I think normal social effects are at play here .
The Perl community has somehow managed to evolve as a friendly place .
At this point it 's a self reinforcing system .
However , if noxious , vituperative folks were allowed to dominate the conversation , the friendly people would leave and standard Internet behavior would ensue , as the new feedback system gained dominance .
The OPs thesis sounds kinda like the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis .
TGI says moo
a doctorate thesis can be made by searching how many prisoners in jails know some perl .
It would also have to take into account how many prisoners in jails are innocent -- there 's bound to be a correlation between the two attributes . :D
But seriously ... are you trying to assert that no one has ever written evil code in Perl ?
Perhaps Perl has a better proportion of benevolent vs. evil code released to the world , compared to other languages ( e.g. Visual Basic , x86 assembler , javascript ) , but I do n't know how someone could possibly measure that .
I can see that you 've never been flamed Tom Christiansen , to name one of many well - known Perl hackers with a well - deserved reputation for forceful expressions of opinion .
Indianapolis Voter Registration at 105 %
James Joyner · · 33 comments
People in Indianapolis are fired up to vote , with early voting taking place at record levels .
Voter registration is at record levels and new registrations are coming at a torrid pace .
Indeed , Paul Ogden does the math and figures that voter registration in Indianapolis and Marion County has exceeded 105 percent of the over - eighteen population , which is quite a feat !
There ’s a bit of hubbub about this in the blogosphere .
Warner Todd Huston thinks the dreaded MSM is missing the story and wonders whether “ ACORN , Barack Obama ’s favorite fraud immersed ‘ community organizer ' ” is behind it .
Moe Lane , The Anchoress , Michelle Malkin , Rob Port , and others concur .
Of course , there are perfectly likely non-fraudulent reasons that could be .
The 2007 census baseline numbers Ogden ’s relying on could understate the current population .
The voter rolls likely include large numbers of people who have died or moved but will in fact not vote .
Ken Dixon , reporting for the Connecticut Post , notes that there are indeed several ACORN - related “ phony registrations ” in that state , including the registration of a “ 7 - year - old girl in the Marina Village housing complex , whose age was listed as 27 on the voter card . ”
Malkin points to other reports in Missouri , Wisconsin , Ohio , and Indiana from credible sources .
In all cases but the last , the numbers are negligible : a handful of obviously fraudulent registrations out of thousands generated from ACORN drives .
In Indiana , ACORN turned in 2000 registrations in Lake County , with 1100 of them “ no good . ”
Elections board Director Sally LaSota “ said the flawed forms are incomplete or contain unreadable handwriting — similar to hundreds of other forms ACORN produced prior to this week .
She said some ACORN vote canvassers apparently pulled names and addresses from telephone books and forged signatures . ”
ACORN says such practices go against their policies and that they have fired those involved .
Color me skeptical .
Still , it ’s unclear to me what the upshot of getting away with fraudulent registrations is .
Are we going to have significant number of phantom votes cast , presumably by absentee ballot ?
There does n’t seem to be much history of that sort of thing .
And they ’re going to REALLY have to kick it into overdrive in Indiana , which Bush won by 15.7 and 20.7 percent in 2000 and 2004 , respectively .
Then again , McCain ’s only got a slight lead in current polls .
UPDATE : A regular commenter emails to note that “ [ A ] lot of groups — including campaigns — reward workers for new registrations .
There is clearly a problem in the voter registration process .
BUT … that is NOT the same thing as voter fraud .
There are virtually no cases of actually voter fraud — or at least no evidence of it .
And it is n’t as if people have not looked for it . ”
I think that ’s right .
There are incentives for shady practices in both voter registration and the culling of voters from the rolls .
I do n’t know what the evidence is , though , for significant fraudulent voting in modern American elections .

The Federal Government ’s promised clean feed internet content filter has caused a panic among queer activists who fear overzealous blocking of same - sex support and lobby websites .
I am very fearful that the Federal Government ’s clean feed proposal will result in Australians being too apathetic to opt out , and therefore existing by default under a Great Firewall of Australia which places our visibility back into a nice , convenient closet , WA queer activist Rod Swift told Sydney Star Observer .
The Australian Communication and Media Authority conducted field testing of the opt - out filter earlier this year and reported a 92 percent success rate in blocking material inappropriate for children .
The tests also revealed the filters blocked material they should n’t have as much as six percent of the time .
A similar filter used in NSW public schools blocks searches containing the words gay or lesbian , including searches for youth support services focusing on sexuality issues .
If the topic of sexuality and safe sex is legal in our classrooms , then it should be legal for students to seek out information that may help them dealing with their sexual orientation or sexual health , Swift said .
They should also have the right to access information about their human rights and the equal opportunity protections that are law if they are of a minority sexual orientation or gender identity .
Australians will not be able to opt out of a second filter of illegal material under the proposal .
Filtering specifically against a blacklist of illegal content as well as the ability to filter additional material will be one part of the upcoming pilot trial , federal Communications minister Stephen Conroy said in a statement .
The blacklist of illegal material will not include generic key - word blocking commonly used in filters , but will be limited to a specific list of websites determined by ACMA .
Further details have not been made available .
Family First senator Steve Fielding was reported calling for pornography and fetish material be included in the compulsory filter this week .
The push raised further fears of censorship among GLBT activists , including former Democrats IT spokesman Brian Greig .
It ’s very scary that Labor is considering this and it smacks of a backroom deal with the Religious Right rather than any considered policy position , Greig said .
It ’s bound to fail , slow internet speeds and push up ISP prices .
Quite apart from the nightmare of trying to define - ˜inappropriate content ’ .
The clean feed filter for inappropriate content received $ 150 million in this year ’s federal budget .
ACMA ’s report also claimed filtering was ineffective over non-web protocols such as instant messaging and peer - to - peer file transfers like BitTorrent .
The field testing conducted by ACMA instead blocked all non-web internet traffic .
Meanwhile , a survey by the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia released this week revealed 91 percent of Australians support the addition of an R18 + rating for video games .
Presently any video game including material unsuitable for children is refused classification in Australia , effectively banning it .
Gay characters have been included in games rated M15 + by the Office of Film and Literature Classification .

Core Animation Is n't Just for Animation
Posted Oct 2 , 2008 — 48 comments below Posted Oct 2 , 2008 — 48 comments below
Often when I 'm talking to somebody about how they 're designing their app , I suggest they use Core Animation to implement the user interface .
More times than I can count , I 've gotten a puzzled look followed by the now - familiar " " response .
Animation is the most significantthat Core Animation tackles , but it 's far from being the only benefit .
This is a really versatile framework with huge performance potential .
You can have thousands of CALayers on the screen at the same time without breaking a sweat .
It probably would n't be practical to try the same with NSView instances .
There 's a lot of GPU magic at play here .
One element of it is the raw parallel processing power of modern graphics cards , and another is the fact that Core Animation can cache the contents of a CALayer on the card so that your code does n't need to constantly redraw it .
This , by the way , is part of the reason the iPhone UI is so incredibly fast on some relatively modest hardware .
Core Animation can automatically take advantage of a multi-core Mac because the layer tree is rendered on a separate thread .
The framework also provides a vastly simplified graphics model .
Instead of requiring a view to implement all of the logic to manage abstract " layer - like " objects that are composited onto the screen , Core Animation provides actual on - screen layers that do all of the basics for you .
Creating a layer is as simple as :
Once a layer is created , it 's easy to customize its appearance and behavior with delegate callbacks .
The delegate can draw a layer 's contents or can trigger actions — such as animations — in response to events .
CALayers can also accept values for arbitrary keys using standard key - value coding methods .

Airport admits ' strip search ' body scanners WILL show people naked
New ' strip search ' full body scanners being trialled in Australia will show people 's private parts , officials have admitted .
But to spare their blushes , the faces of passengers will be blurred .
Domestic travellers leaving Melbourne airport over the next six weeks will be asked to test the new security scanners that can see through clothing .
The X - ray backscatter body scanner has been described by critics as a " virtual strip search . "
The scanner is similar to one that was trialled at Paddington station in London in 2006 in direct response to the tube bombings in July 2005 .
Similar systems have also been tested at Gatwick airport .
The new scanner is designed to show people concealing weapons - but it will show a lot more than that , airport chiefs have admitted
Cheryl Johnson , general manager of the Office of Transport Security , said : '
It will show the private parts of people , but what we 've decided is that we 're not going to blur those out , because it severely limits the detection capabilities . '
' It is possible to see genitals and breasts while they 're going through the machine , though , ' she admitted
However , Ms Johnson said there were a number of measures in place to tackle concerns about privacy .
" The faces are automatically blurred and ... it 's only a chalk - style outline , it 's not as invasive as some of the other equipment that we 've got , " she said .
The scanner uses a low energy X - ray to reveal any objects , metal or otherwise , under a person 's clothing , including body features .
The testing will be entirely voluntary during the trial , which is being undertaken to test how the new scanners would affect the flow of passengers through the security point .
" It does see through clothing , but it 's not a photographic image , it 's a low - energy X - ray that reflects off the skin , " added Ms Johnson .
" The security officer that 's looking at it is located away from the screening lane , so there 's no comparison of the person walking through and the image .
' The images are not saved , you literally walk through , the screener hits a button to say clear and the image goes . "
The new scanners will be tested at Melbourne Airport alongside ' next generation ' baggage X - ray machines that can detect explosives in luggage .
Hand - held scanners that can detect explosives in liquids are also being tested .
Ms Johnson said these were a direct response to an alleged terrorist plot in 2006 to detonate liquid explosives on - board airliners .
She added all the scanners had tested well in laboratory conditions , but information was needed on how they would impact on passenger amenity .
The trial runs until the end of the November , and the results will be analysed before the technology is rolled out for real , possibly at domestic and international terminals .
The Sahul is the Australia - New Guinea continent , which is exposed during glacial maximums .
If one were to take a satellite photograph of the Sahul during an ice age , you ’d see more or less a complete island in the picture , one that spans from New Guinea to Australia and Tasmania .
Kind of like the one to your right .
Understanding the peopling of the Sahul is critical to understand human migrations and the peopling of Australia .
In the late ’ 70 ’s to the late ’ 80 ’s , most archaeologists thought that the Sahul was occupied by Late Pleistocene humans , somewhere around 45,000 years ago .
A bit of a shake - up spurred about the exact timing of the occupation when older sites like the Devil ’s Lair , Lake Mungo , Nauwalabila , Malakunanja , and Huon Peninsula were discovered .
Predictably , two camps emerged .
One camp asserted that the Sahul was peopled around 60,000 years ago .
The other camp held on the later date , contesting that their dates are based upon more reliable dating techniques , such as radiocarbon , luminescence , and uranium - thorium dating methods .
They also contest that 45,000 year old artifacts better resemble the Out of Africa “ package ” that is represented elsewhere .
A new paper in the Journal of Human Evolution looks at the archaeological “ package ” from the earlier sites .
The authors of the paper compare this archaeological record to the record of other Middle Stone Age sites in Africa , Europe , and Asia .
Similar to genes , the displacement of artifacts occurs when new technologies and cultures influence existing ones .
It can happen under different tempos — there can be a slow , gradual change of material culture or there can be rapid and punctual changes .
There can even a mix of the two .
In places like Europe , we see rather fast changes , as pre-existing populations like Neandertals were replaced by humans during the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition .
To see whether or not the Sahul represents a slower change , Phillip Habgooda and Natalie Franklin have looked at the archaeological record of the Sahul .
They ’ve published their findings under the title , “ The revolution that did n’t arrive : A review of Pleistocene Sahul . ”
I figure you can extract the main conclusion from this concise title .
But I wo n’t stop there because Habgooda and Franklin have written up a rather thorough study .
They specifically timed the rate of change in exchange networks , mining & quarrying , beads , ochre , art , burials , shellfish middens , grindstones , modified bone , and new lithic techniques .
For the section on exchange networks , they review the archaeological record of 20 sites .
The trade of exotic materials for symbolic reasons , especially over long - distances , is understood to be a relatively modern behavioral trait .
40,000 years ago , the people who occupied the Sahul were moving shells and other materials long distances — in some cases 300 kilometers and in other cases to places like the little islands in the Bismarck Sea , which is north of Papau New Guinea .
Related to trade networks , mining and quarrying , also represents a modern trait as people specifically sought out certain rocks to fashion into tools and adornments .
The record for mining emerges at a much more recent date : around 24,000 years ago .
Take note of the discontinuity between these dates , because a rapid displacement of the Sahul should share similar dates among the different parts of the package looked at .
I should n’t really need to define why we consider personal adornments like beads , as modern .
And in the Sahul , they are seen as 42,000 years ago .
But other pieces of adornments , such as this limestone plaque from the Devil ’s Lair appear only as early as 25,000 years ago .
The role of ochre in art , rituals , and personal hygiene is also looked at .
Similar to bead usage , ochre usage is seen as early as 42,000 years ago but not in an artistic and elaborate burial context until 2,000 years later .
Complex rock art and symbolic burials are traits of modern humans and for them to not sync up with ochre usage and adornments make me wonder what was going on ?
In general , resource exploitation is a modern human trait and by looking at the composition of middens and the number and specialization of grindstones , we can get an idea about when people started to change their lifestyles .
In the Sahul , this did n’t start happening until around 30,000 years ago .
Again , remember some other modern human traits are seen as early as 42,000 years ago but economic intensification did n’t happen until much later .
Furthermore , modified bone tools , a hallmark of modern human behavior , is seen around 22,000 years ago but compound stone tools like adzes are seen as early as 40,000 years ago !
Clearly , this paper shows that the Sahul was gradually influenced by the modern human expansions out of Africa .
Parts of the modern human package appear at different sites , separated spatially and temporally .
The authors provide us with this poignant summary as well as an image depicting their results ,
“ Following initial colonization of the continent , terrestrial fauna are the dominant resources exploited , but freshwater shell middens are apparent around the palaeoriver and lake systems of southeast Australia .
Long - distance transport and / or exchange networks are evident , as is collection and use of ochre for ritual behaviour ( burial ) and rock painting .
Stone assemblages are dominated by retouched and unretouched flakes , but waisted hatchets are found in Papua New Guinea at this time .
By 30,000 years BP , an expansion in resource exploitation may be signified by evidence of marine exploitation on islands off the northern coast of Sahul , the ( possible ) appearance of grindstones , and the intensive exploitation of macropods in southwest Tasmania .
Flake - based stone tool assemblages are augmented by the introduction of ground stone hatchets in northern Australia and small thumbnail scrapers in southwest Tasmania .
Personal ornaments in the form of shell beads are also present in northwestern Australia at this time .
By 20 – 18,000 years BP the variety of personal ornaments has expanded to include bone beads , pendants , and notational pieces .
Although there is evidence of painting of some form by 40,000 years BP , identifiable art does not appear until around 20,000 years BP .
Flint mining is evident at this time , and the flake - based stone tool assemblages are supplemented with bone points made on macropod long bones in the southeast of the continent . ”
Modern human behavioral traits in the archaeological record of the Sahul , emerged over a 30,000 year period , even though modern humans clearly had an early influence .
The authors consider one possibility may have been that there was not a rapid colonization of the Sahul .
I ’ve thought about this some and think that differences in population densities and impact of new technologies , i.e. adoption rates amongst ‘ stubborn ’ populations affect rates of cultural change .
Hell , look how long it has taken people to switch from Windows to Macs . ;-)
Somethings may not have been useful to early peoples and may have not been taken up as readily , and adopted later under different pressures and considerations .
What we can figure out is that what we consider the “ package ” is not necessarily and all or none indicator of modern human existance .
If you ’re interested in understanding the peopling of the Greater Australia area , and wanna know more about Sahul sites , I recommend reading this paper .
I got a bit annoyed by the over - usage of “ package . ”
I know even though I used the phrase in similar manner — without directly defining it .
But if you mentally replace it with other synonyms that work for you , the paper is much more digestible and chock full of information about the archaeology of early Austrialia , Papau New Guinea and adjacent areas .
“ The political media are up in arms because Sarah Palin wo n’t talk to them , ” said Kirsten Powers in the New York Post , but it ’s their own fault .
No campaign will grant easy access when it knows “ the press will make no honest attempt to be fair , ” and the coverage of Palin has been massively biased from the start .
It ’s hard to argue that the McCain - Palin camp is n’t going a bit overboard to protect Palin , said Chris Rovzar in New York magazine online .
Either “ Republicans are afraid Palin will crumble under direct questioning , ” or , as CNN ’s Campbell Brown complains , they ’re making a sexist attempt to protect her as a “ delicate flower ” while selling her as a “ pitbull with lipstick . ”
If the press would stop “ sniping ” and pay attention , said Investor ’s Business Daily in an editorial , it might see that Palin has been making serious foreign policy news .
Her meetings with foreign heads of state this week “ sent a stark message to the world ’s tyrants ” that a McCain administration would “ stand by ” America ’s embattled friends .
Please , said the Chicago Tribune , if Palin ’s hobnobbing had been serious John McCain would not have had her do it in a “ news - free cocoon . ”
Everybody knows the first - term Alaska governor is no “ whiz ” on international relations yet .
But , “ you have to wonder , why is the McCain campaign so afraid ? ”

Polls suggest Mr Obama is ahead of his Republican rival US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has warned that rival John McCain would " endanger " US security .
He said that the election winner would face security " tests " , due in part to President George Bush 's " bad policies " .
His running - mate , Joe Biden , said at the weekend that Mr Obama could face a " generated international crisis " within six months of becoming president .
Mr McCain , the Republican candidate , said Mr Biden 's remarks proved Mr Obama would be a risky presidential choice .
Opinion polls indicate that Mr Obama is leading Mr McCain with less than two weeks to go before the 4 November election .
American voters , this time round , are highly motivated
Campaign Trail : Gavin Hewitt A Reuters/C-SPAN / Zogby poll released on Thursday gives Mr Obama a 12 - point lead over Mr McCain , with 52 % to his 40 % .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll puts Mr Obama on 52 % , 10 points ahead of Mr McCain , while a Gallup tracking poll has the Democrat ahead by eight points , with 52 % to Mr McCain 's 44 % .
However , an AP - GfK poll released on Wednesday suggests a much narrower margin , putting Mr Obama only one point ahead , with 44 % support to his rival 's 43 % .
Clear signal Responding to attacks over Mr Biden 's comment on the likelihood that he would be " tested " by an international crisis , Mr Obama said his running - mate " sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes " .
" His core point was , the next administration is going to be tested regardless of who it is , " he told reporters .
" The question is : Will the next president meet that test by moving America in a new direction , by sending a clear signal to the rest of the world that we are no longer about bluster and unilateralism and ideology ? "
Does McCain 's inability to think on his feet , to go off the page , count against him ?
Campaign Trail : Matthew Price Mr Obama also accused John McCain of wanting to continue " the policies that have put our economy into crisis and endangered our national security " .
The McCain camp rejected Mr Obama 's explanation , and accused him of lacking leadership .
" Joe Biden guaranteed a generated international crisis if Barack Obama is elected , and a smile - for - the - cameras press conference is n't going to mitigate the risk of an Obama presidency , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Mr Obama was speaking at a news conference following a round - table meeting with foreign policy experts to discuss the " urgent issues " facing the world .

" Was John McCain a socialist back in 2000 ? " he said , referring to Mr McCain 's earlier opposition to President Bush 's tax - cutting plans .
And at a rally later in the day , he poured scorn on Mr McCain 's accusation that Mr Obama would raise taxes for Americans like Joe Wurzelbacher , the plumber who gained prominence after being mentioned numerous times in the last presidential debate .
" Let 's be clear who John McCain is fighting for - he 's not fighting for Joe the Plumber , he 's fighting for Joe the Hedge Fund Manager . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
State regulators closed Florida 's First Priority Bank on Friday , marking the eighth bank failure of the year .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which was named the receiver of the failed bank by Florida state officials , entered into an agreement with Atlanta - based SunTrust Bank ( STI , Fortune 500 ) to assume the insured deposits of First Priority .
All six branches of the Bradenton , Fla . - based bank will reopen on Monday as branches of SunTrust .
First Priority depositors will automatically become depositors of SunTrust , the FDIC said .
First Priority had assets of $ 259 million and total deposits of $ 227 million , according to the FDIC .
That includes $ 13 million in uninsured deposits held in approximately 840 accounts that potentially exceeded the federal insurance limits .
Account holders with more than the $ 100,000 insured limit will essentially " become a creditor " of the failed bank , said FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray .
Those accounts will be credited as the FDIC sells more of the failed bank 's assets , Gray said .
SunTrust Bank will purchase approximately $ 42 million of the failed First Priority 's assets , which are made up of mainly cash , cash equivalents and securities .
And LNV Corp. of Plano , Texas , a subsidiary of Beal Bank Nevada , will purchase $ 14 million in First Priority 's assets .
The remaining $ 171 million in assets will be sold by the FDIC .
Proceeds of these sales will be used to pay creditors including bank clients whose accounts exceed the $ 100,000 limit .
Customers with accounts in excess of $ 100,000 should contact the FDIC toll free at 1-800-837-0215 .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story said the FDIC closed Florida 's First priority Bank .
The FDIC did not close the bank , the State of Florida closed it and named the FDIC as receiver .

Below Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal publishes -- with the authors ' permission -- an exclusive excerpt from Kevin Funk and Steven Fake 's just published book , Scramble for Africa : Darfur Intervention and the USA ( Black Rose Books ) .
In Scramble for Africa Kevin Funk and Steven Fake provide a forensic and astute examination of the Bush administration 's politically cynical and opportunist exploitation of the people of Darfur 's terrible plight , using them as pawns to regain access to Sudan 's oil riches and to promote the self - serving imperialist concept of ``humanitarian intervention ' ' .
Funk and Fake reveal the hypocrisy of Washington , which can in the same breathe declare the Sudan regime 's slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Darfuris ``genocide '' while -- out of the general public 's earshot -- praise and collaborate with the very same butchers as allies in its ``war on terror ' ' .
The mainstream ``Save Darfur ' ' movement 's leadership also comes in for a similar investigation for its willingness to allow the interests of the people of Darfur to play second fiddle to Washington 's foreign policy double standards .
However , unlike most of the US left , Funk and Fake do not try to prettify the reactionary Sudanese regime and its crimes by placing a plus sign against it where US imperialism places a minus sign .
They do not enagage in much of the US left 's knee - jerk denial of the humanitarian and political crisis that is underway in Darfur , nor refuse to accept that it needs to be addressed .
They offer the principled anti-imperialist left with a ``Manifesto for Darfur activism '' with which to campaign for the people of Darfur and challenge the pro-imperialist direction of the mainstream ``Save Darfur ' ' leadership and expose US imperialism 's hypocrisy .
Had the US left adopted such an approach before now , the right - wing dominance of this movement may have been broken , the genuine activists in the US would have been won to a leftwing perspective and much of the left itself would not -- on this issue -- now be seen as callous apologists of a tyrannical regime .
Thankfully , there is still time

By Kevin Funk and Steven Fake
As the US is not a proximate cause of the atrocities in Darfur -- though it clearly has played an important background role -- the activist movement surrounding the conflict has managed to attract a somewhat unique constellation of participants .
While there is great variance in the ideologies of Darfur activists , on the whole they are likely to have establishment - friendly political beliefs , be they liberal or conservative , rather than a leftist outlook .
Amongst other factors , this reflects the left 's understandable focus instead on ending the US occupation of Iraq , as well as a division between those who cautiously support a UN presence in Sudan and others who view such an endeavor as imperialistic and can imagine no positive role for the US in resolving the crisis , even under the auspices of the UN .
While we will later discuss the framework in which US - based activists with a legitimate concern for both the human rights crisis in Sudan and principled anti-imperialism can operate , it is fitting to first examine the individuals and groups prominently involved in Darfur activism , paying special attention to the motives , both openly stated and otherwise , that serve as the rationale for their efforts .
Save Darfur Coalition : aiding the victims ot the superpower ?
The umbrella organization most responsible for the relative visibility of this movement is the Save Darfur Coalition , a collection of well over 100 groups whose membership roles read like a veritable " who 's who " of civil society and human rights organizations - Jewish , Christian , Muslim , secular , and otherwise .
Amnesty International , the National Association of Evangelicals , American Jewish World Service , the American Society for Muslim Advancement , and the NAACP are all Executive Committee members . [ 1 ]
The broad nature of the Coalition 's membership is indicated by the inclusion of both the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) and the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , organizations which each have profound suspicions regarding the other 's very purpose .
The ADL has accused CAIR of defending Palestinian suicide bombers and being " founded by leaders of the Islamic Association for Palestine , an anti-Semitic organization " ; CAIR leadership has denounced the ADL for its " anti-Muslim McCarthyism , " and for running a " smear campaign " designed to " exploit and amplify existing anti-Muslim prejudice . " [ 2 ]
Other curiosities pervade Save Darfur .
Describing the Coalition 's composition in regards to a then - upcoming April 30 , 2006 rally that the umbrella group was organizing in Washington DC , the Jerusalem Post observed that :
Little known , however , is that the [ Save Darfur ] coalition , which has presented itself as " an alliance of over 130 diverse faith - based , humanitarian , and human rights organization " was actually begun exclusively as an initiative of the American Jewish community .
And even now , days before the rally , that coalition is heavily weighted with a politically and religiously diverse collection of local and national Jewish groups ....
Besides the Jewish origins and character of the rally - a fact the organizers consistently played down in conversations with the Jerusalem Post - the other striking aspect of the coalition is the noted absence of major African - American groups . [ 3 ]
Though there has been some subsequent improvement in the representation of African Americans within the Coalition - the NAACP , as previously stated , is now part of the Executive Committee , and the September 17 , 2006 rally featured a more diverse array of speakers [ 4 ] -- serious questions remain about the potential sidelining of Muslim and Sudanese groups within a movement that has a strong Jewish ( and Evangelical Christian ) character . [ 5 ]
In what is frequently characteristic of Western movements that tend to view with some amount of condescension the same people they are supposedly seeking to help , the Washington Post reported that the " the original list of speakers [ for the April 30 rally ] included eight Western Christians , seven Jews , four politicians and assorted celebrities - but no Muslims and no one from Darfur " ; organizers had to hurry " to invite two Darfurians to address the rally after Sudanese immigrants objected " to their previous exclusion from the line - up . [ 6 ]
CAIR further criticized the Coalition , noting in a letter to the organization that no representatives from Muslim member groups such as itself were invited to speak , and asking that a CAIR spokesperson be included at the event .
According to a strongly worded press statement released on the day of the rally , " The Save Darfur Coalition never replied to CAIR 's letter , despite the fact that the Washington - based Islamic civil liberties group is an original signatory of the coalition 's founding ' Unity Statement . ' "
CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad went on to say that the incident " calls into question the coalition 's true agenda at the rally . " [ 7 ]
It is this true agenda , or at least the speculation that there is indeed an ulterior motive to buttress US foreign policy designs behind the involvement of many Darfur activist groups , that has been the subject of much speculation in left - wing discourse . [ 8 ]
On a grassroots level , it is not difficult to see why the atrocities in Darfur have resonated with many .
" No one was paying attention and I just wanted to do something , " said Arielle Wisotsky , who has been active on Darfur and is the teenaged granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor .
" This is a systemized killing of a whole group of people - it 's no different from the Holocaust " ; in response , Wisotsky co-founded Help Darfur Now , a student activist group that raises money for the likes of Doctors Without Borders and the International Rescue Committee . [ 9 ]
Of course there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of a group of high school students in aiming to address what is clearly a humanitarian disaster , nor to condemn them for failing to consider the comparable , and yet less publicized crisis in the Congo , the interests of the US in displacing China 's foothold in Sudanese oil sources , or how US imperial plans may be furthered by a " humanitarian " intervention .
However , there are disconcerting and in some cases racist and imperialist tendencies prevalent amongst some Darfur activist groups , typified by the aforementioned involvement of the ADL , whose record of concern for the welfare of Muslims is less than laudatory .
Recent history , in fact , provides an intimate display of how the ADL reacts when innocent Sudanese are killed by US air strikes rather than by other Muslims - killed , in other words , by acceptable enemies .
In a press statement released just eight days after the al - Shifa bombing ( whose crushing effects - amongst them an estimated death toll in the " several tens of thousands " - were discussed earlier ) , the ADL , while not making specific mention of the plant , showered the US with praise for its " decisive action " in response to the embassy bombings .
" Decisive " as it may have been in demonstrating brute US power , neither the attack nor the ADL 's response showed a single iota of even feigned compassion for the Sudanese people , whose plight now garners such steadfast pretended concern from the ADL and Washington . [ 10 ]
Deeper suspicions about the character of Darfur activism are aroused by the juxtaposition of media coverage of the April 30 " Save Darfur " rally with that of a much larger protest against the war in Iraq that had occurred a mere day before in New York City . *
The difference in turnout was clear , even allowing for the ambiguities of approximating crowd sizes .
Organizers for the April 29 antiwar protest estimated a turnout of " at least 350,000 " while most media outlets vaguely asserted " tens of thousands " [ 11 ] ; meanwhile , organizers for the " Save Darfur " rally gave an approximation of 75,000 , with the press mostly referring to it as a crowd of " thousands . " [ 12 ]
Yet major newspapers across the country prominently highlighted the Darfur rally while paying only fleeting attention to the antiwar protest , even as they freely reported its much larger attendance .
The Los Angeles Times featured a nearly 900 - word article on the " Save Darfur " rally , while limiting its coverage of the antiwar protest to two pictures , and not a single written word aside from the caption .
USA Today 's Monday , May 1 edition - the issue of record for both events , as the protest occurred on a Saturday and the newspaper is not published on weekends - included an article about the " Save Darfur " rally on the newspaper 's second page , previewed by a picture of attendees on the front .
Not an inch of USA Today 's copy was devoted to the antiwar protest .
The New York Times exhibited more fairness by having articles of almost equal length on the events , though it relegated its coverage of the Iraq war protest to local / regional news , while covering the Darfur rally in the " national " news section .
For its part , the Washington Post bestowed the entirety of its 169 words about the antiwar protest within the confines of its " Nation in Brief " subsection , next to a comedic - relief blurb about an arson squad preemptively blowing up a Mission Impossible III - themed promotional news rack , ( incorrectly ) suspecting that it contained a bomb .
The same day 's issue ran an almost 700 - word article on the " Save Darfur " rally , which at that time was apparently of more pressing relevance than the antiwar protest that had just occurred , even though the Darfur rally had yet to actually take place ; on Monday , the front page glistened with an article about the rally , accompanied by a story on the front page of the Style section on " Darfur is Dying , " the video game .
It is not difficult to fathom why Darfur , rather than a war of Washington 's own making in Iraq , or the even deadlier yet seemingly easier to mitigate crisis in the Congo -- " the worst haemorrhage of human life in this generation , " according to the UN Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs , Jan Egeland -- has resonated so profoundly in the current political climate , beyond even the imperialist lust for natural resources and a desire to repel Chinese influence . [ 13 ]
There has been a marked tendency by many , if not most groups involved in Darfur activism , to severely misrepresent the entire conflict along politically convenient but misleading racial and ethnic lines . [ 14 ]
Given the well documented propaganda function played by the commercial press , it is to be expected that in the midst of the " War on Terror , " mainstream news sources would reduce the issue to a highly misleading " black / African " versus " Arab " dichotomy .
Yet why is the same sort of language written into the official unity statement of the entire Save Darfur Coalition , and what does this proclivity towards blaming " Arabs , " as well as the aforementioned focus on Sudan instead of the Congo , say about the worldviews and motives of the movement as a whole ? [ 15 ]
The Washington Post , representing the liberal extreme of establishment opinion , hints at one such motive in an editorial supporting a US invasion of Sudan .
Lamenting how the US was " for a long time unwilling to project force " after the war in Vietnam -- true only in the sense that Washington could not be as typically brazen in its support of mass murderers ( such as Suharto in Indonesia and Somoza 's National Guard in Nicaragua ) as it was during the Vietnam era -- the Post called on the US " to avoid succumbing to an Iraq syndrome to match the Vietnam syndrome of the past " and to " prove its continuing readiness to lead in the world , " all by pushing for " humanitarian intervention " in Darfur , perhaps even unilaterally [ 16 ] -- a chilling possibility which the Save Darfur Coalition has in the past recommended that Washington consider . [ 17 ]
It is a treacherous tightrope to walk for principled and anti-imperialist US activists who are prodding their government to support measures such as a UN deployment , needing to balance this advocacy with a clear message that whatever action is taken cannot be a vehicle for US geopolitical interests .
Given President Bush 's overt praise for Darfur activism , [ 18 ] the Save Darfur Coalition 's curious claim that the Bush administration has done " good work " in resolving the conflict , [ 19 ] and the slogan found at rallies of " Out of Iraq , into Darfur " ( as if Sudan were merely the next stop on Washington 's supposed world liberation tour ) , it is clearly not a concern for many leaders in the Darfur activist movement .

It is because the Save Darfur movement 's politics are largely rooted in establishment - friendly ideals such as a Western " purity of arms , " disregarding prospects for a negotiated settlement in favor of the language of force , and the use of force in this case by self - designated benevolent Westerners to save dark - skinned victims from their Arab and Muslim tormentors , that Darfur activism has thrived in the United States . [ 20 ]
Accordingly , the Save Darfur Coalition * has been afforded a multimillion dollar budget boosted by donations from Fortune 500 corporations ( none of which goes towards humanitarian aid ) , support from Hollywood stars , and the ear of the White House ( according to a White House spokesperson , " The administration listens and speaks regularly to Save Darfur and other groups [ active on Darfur ] " ) , and thus , in the words of Alex de Waal , has " done something that none of us thought would ever be possible -- to start a mass movement on Sudan . " [ 21 ]
Efforts to halt Western - backed humanitarian catastrophes , such as the bloodbath in Iraq , or the Israeli Occupation , fail to attract corporate funding or sympathetic pledges from the Oval Office , and are instead subjected to hostile media coverage , and accusations of " anti-Americanism . "
Not surprisingly , since these are the same crises that are directly of our own doing , they could be terminated with relative ease by an enlivened US citizenry .
Yet in an intellectual and political culture which scorns the elementary principle of first examining our own crimes , those which we have the most power to stop , Darfur advocates are showered with accolades while antiwar activists are seen as quixotic , naïve idealists , or even dangerous ideologues .
There is much reason to be " struck , " as is Mahmood Mamdani , " by the fact that the largest political movement against mass violence on US campuses is on Darfur and not on Iraq , " or that the campaign to " save Darfur , " instead of one oriented towards halting US - sponsored crimes , is claimed by its leaders to be the largest " since the campaign against the Vietnam war . " [ 22 ]
The demands being made by this movement provide further cause for concern .
An evaluation of activist demands
As the ranks of Darfur activists include everything from traditional human rights organizations to evangelical Christian groups , there is a marked diversity of opinion amongst them about how to address the crisis .
Nevertheless , many of the most vocal and visible organizations working on Darfur , including the Save Darfur Coalition , have adopted common positions which revolve generally around the following themes : a hawkish stance concerning a " humanitarian intervention " ( perhaps even unilaterally , if necessary , meaning an invasion ) in Darfur , an assumption of humanitarian motives on the part of the US and other Western powers , a sidelining of the AU in favor of the UN ( or in some cases NATO , and even unilateral action by Washington ) , and a focus on advocacy to the point of disregarding aid for the victims , despite their often substantial budgets .
Informed by this set of principles and ideological underpinnings , much Save Darfur activism has been directed towards ends that at best comprise a questionable use of time and resources , or at worst have outcomes likely to negatively impact rather than improve the situation in Darfur .
A no-fly zone over Darfur
Although the idea of establishing a no- fly zone over Darfur has considerable currency amongst activists and politicians , there is little indication that they have given much thought to its probable consequences , beyond the feelings it may inspire of " doing something " to aggressively confront Khartoum .
First , it is important to understand what is being called for in regards to a no - fly zone .
By declaring one , the responsible party or parties ( likely the US and / or France , due to their nearby air bases ) are obliging themselves to shoot down Sudanese planes if they enter into the restricted airspace , something which may be construed as an act of war , and would be a " propaganda victory " ( Julie Flint ) for the Bashir regime , allowing it to rally nationalist sentiment against ' foreign aggression . '[ 23 ]
Aside from the concern that planes being used for humanitarian purposes could be mistakenly targeted in the no-fly zone , as they are " indistinguishable " from the aircraft used by Khartoum , [ 24 ] the actual shooting down of one of Khartoum 's planes could lead the Sudanese government to unleash their fury on the peacekeepers in Darfur , and / or Darfurians themselves , thus deepening the catastrophe .
As noted by the International Crisis Group , " Khartoum might respond [ to the implementation of a no - fly zone ] by escalating its actions on the ground against civilians , not unlike what happened in the initial days of NATO 's actions in Kosovo in 1999 . " [ 25 ]
A no -fly zone may also very well pull the plug on Darfur 's massive relief operations , and leave Darfurians with " lethal health and food crises , " a possibility over which aid groups are " quietly appalled . " [ 26 ]
This potential prompted one such organization , Action Against Hunger , to note that a no- fly zone would " have disastrous consequences that risk triggering a further escalation of violence while jeopardizing the provision of vital humanitarian assistance to millions of people . " [ 27 ]
As the Sudan specialist Julie Flint argues :
In the last three and a half years , humanitarian aid has stabilized conditions for the more than 4 million people who currently depend on relief .
Mortality and malnutrition have fallen , significantly .
If a no -fly zone were imposed , Khartoum would not go belly up .
It would in all likelihood retaliate by grounding humanitarian flights .
Its proxies in the Janjaweed militias would show their displeasure in the only way they know .
Relief workers might be expelled or forced to evacuate the region .
People who are now being kept alive would die .
The current emphasis on coercive measures conceals the fact that the US and its friends have no clear plan of political action , no sensible project for peace to go hand in hand with pressure on the Khartoum regime . [ 28 ]
Yet for all the risks , the potential upshot for a no - fly zone is also remarkably small .
Though Khartoum does still attack Darfur from the air , " the vast majority of attacks are executed by forces on the ground . "
Accordingly , a no- fly zone " would only weaken a very small piece of Khartoum 's killing machine . " [ 29 ]
Given the above , and that enforcing a no - fly zone would be " extremely resource - consumptive , " advocating such while the UNAMID force on the ground in Darfur is under - resourced represents a severe distortion of activism based on concern for the victims . [ 30 ]
Divestment
Evoking memories of global activism against apartheid in South Africa , the Save Darfur movement is also aiming to address the humanitarian crisis in the beleaguered region by campaigning for divestment from certain companies operating in Sudan .
Though there are ample grounds for criticizing other stances taken ( or not taken ) by many in the Save Darfur movement -- such as the failure to put substantial pressure on Washington to adequately fund the peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur -- the focus on divestment is not in and of itself objectionable , and to the extent it can aid efforts to stop the atrocities , it should certainly be pursued .
However , it is important to understand the limitations and potential pitfalls of such advocacy , as well as the political context that has allowed divestment from Sudan to progress in ways that divestment from other human rights abusers has not .
As explained by divestment supporter Eric Reeves , the goals of the movement are as follows :
The divestment campaign targets those companies that list on the New York Stock Exchange and other US exchanges which provide key commercial and capital investments in the economy of Sudan , supporting the National Islamic Front , National Congress Party regime in Khartoum , and insulating them from the consequences of their massive external debt and their profligate expenditures on military weapons and the prosecution of genocidal war in Darfur . [ 31 ]
Note that this is divestment from companies " that list on ... US exchanges " -- it is not divestment from US companies operating in Sudan , since they are already prohibited from doing so by US sanctions .
Accordingly , the divestment campaign is targeting foreign ( mostly Asian ) firms , most prominently oil companies such as PetroChina . [ 32 ]
While urging individual and corporate investors in the US to sell their holdings in foreign companies because of their links to human rights abuses in Sudan is laudable in principle , it is also , at the very least , convoluted .
One issue is simply the practicality of such an aim ; in light of the extended degrees of separation of influence between perpetrators and activists , it is not obvious the campaign can be effective .
While divestment from South Africa is often cited as a precursor to this divestment movement , it is in reality a poor basis for comparison in this regard , as US companies operated in South Africa without legal impediment for most of the duration of the US - allied apartheid regime , and thus were directly susceptible to pressure from US activists .
As noted , this is not the case with Sudan , and the added layer of complexity may render this campaign a waste of time and energy that could be applied to helping the people of Darfur in a more concrete fashion ; the same could be said in regards to efforts to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing .
Yet even if the campaign were successful in forcing total US divestment from foreign oil companies operating in Sudan , it is not clear how much pressure these firms would actually feel to pull out of the country , especially since some of them , such as PetroChina , are state - backed , in addition to the fact that the Sudanese macroeconomy is booming . [ 33 ]
There is , to be sure , no shortage of businesses or governments willing to invest in oil - producing countries without any consideration for human rights ( as the US does in Equatorial Guinea , " among the world 's worst " dictatorships ) , and thus any ostensible success in the divestment movement may simply lead to a shuffling of the line - up of investors rather than meaningful pressure on Khartoum . [ 34 ]
Just as fundamentally , pursuing a divestment strategy fails to take into account that the Save Darfur movement has far greater leverage vis-à - vis the US government , for whose policies US activists bear direct moral responsibility .
As an elementary statement of principle , activists concerned with improving the world will focus their efforts where they can most effectively influence change , generally the policies of their own governments .
As a thought experiment , one might ask what reaction the West would accord Chinese activists who opted to channel their limited energies into a ' divest from Blackwater ' campaign .
In such a case , Western opinion makers would have no difficulty perceiving moral truisms , and understanding that the efforts of Chinese activists would be better directed elsewhere .
Yet Darfur activists have largely failed to pressure Washington to take even basic steps - beyond ultimately meaningless rhetorical grandstanding - to improve the situation on the ground in Darfur , such as adequately funding peacekeepers .
In no small part because it largely frees domestic elites of moral culpability by focusing instead on China 's role in perpetuating the crisis in Darfur -- which is substantial , though again , less subject to pressure from US activists than Washington 's own cynical policies -- the divestment movement has gained significant ground in a relatively short period of time .
Across the country , states , major cities , presidential candidates , and dozens of universities have moved to discuss and / or implement varying levels of divestment from companies with Sudan operations , as well as US - based firms such as Berkshire Hathaway and Fidelity Investments which hold stock in such businesses .
Yet if divestment is a valid tactic for effecting change in a country which seriously violates human rights -- that is , if divestment is supported by the victims of the abuses , and can be " targeted " in such a way that it does not have adverse affects on the general population - then where is the rush to divest from Israel 's " war crimes " ? [ 35 ]
The contradiction is explicit in the case of Harvard University .
In 2002 , in response to a petition to divest the university from the Israeli Occupation , then - Harvard President Lawrence Summers condemned the campaign as " anti-Semitic in effect , if not intent . " [ 36 ]
Yet in April 2005 , Harvard became " the first major victory in a national campaign for divestment from Sudan " as it divested from PetroChina . [ 37 ]
As Summers commented :
Divestment is not a step that Harvard takes lightly , but I believe there is a compelling case for action in these special circumstances , in light of the terrible situation still unfolding in Darfur and the leading role played by PetroChina 's parent company in the Sudanese oil industry , which is so important to the Sudanese regime .
Employing his own perverse logic , why is this campaign not anti-Chinese , anti-African , or anti-Muslim ?
As the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz asks about those advocating divestment from the Israeli Occupation , " ' Why do n't they say anything about Cuba 's chilling of dissent or China 's occupation of Tibet ?
Why do n't they feel a personal stake in getting Jordan , Egypt , and the Philippines to stop torturing people ?
...
The only reason they feel so strongly about Israel is because it is the Jewish nation . ' " [ 38 ]
Yet it would be unimaginable for a figure even as crass as Dershowitz to openly condemn Darfur activists for bigotry and failing to " say anything about Cuba . "
Instead , Darfur activism receives extensive and favorable coverage in the mainstream media , while the voices of opponents of US - Israeli policies vis-à - vis the Palestinians are marginalized and ridiculed , if they are heard at all .
Accordingly , the campaign of targeted divestment from Sudan owes much , if not all of its ' success ' to the fact that it harmonizes with US rhetoric on Darfur and its official desire to weaken Chinese influence . *
Divesting from Israel 's human rights abuses , substantial as they are , does not accord with establishment prerogatives , and thus this campaign to divest - though longer running - has failed to resonate in the tender hearts of city legislators , state government officials , or the Lawrence Summers of the world ( evidently , no small category ) .
Supporting the victims : humanitarian aid and refugee policies
Peacekeepers in Darfur are not alone in being underfunded and largely ignored by the benevolent leaders of civilization ; aid groups operating in Darfur continue to operate under severe financial constraints , and Western ( and other ) governments have been remarkably callous in their handling of Darfurian refugees .
Remedying both situations is well within the capabilities of the West , though the Save Darfur Coalition and many other activist groups have carried out shockingly little advocacy to push Washington in this direction .
As noted , the Save Darfur Coalition does not dedicate any of its substantial funds to humanitarian aid , instead focusing its efforts on advocacy .
While this is not inherently objectionable , the Coalition also has been tepid in its push for Washington to be more generous with relief efforts , instead reserving the thrust of its energies for pushing for a UN intervention , or targeting China 's alliance with Khartoum - a questionable use of resources given the much greater leverage which US activists have with Washington instead of Beijing , and the highly important work being done by relief agencies .
It is also questionable in light of the dire financial straits faced by aid groups in Darfur , which have been teetering on the edge of catastrophe and facing increasing levels of attacks and banditry , all while the West proclaims its lofty intentions for the region . [ 39 ]
As a result of insufficient financial support , services to the displaced victims such as health care have been restricted , " Feeding centers have had to be closed , food cannot be distributed , staff are being reduced , [ and ] teachers in camps are no longer being paid . " [ 40 ]
At one point , the World Food Program was forced to cut its food rations in Sudan by half , due to a chronic lack of funding for the organization [ 41 ] ; as noted bitterly by several groups who depend on the World Food Program to help deliver aid , " A service upon which millions of people depend should not have to fear for its future every month . " [ 42 ]
The effects of such recurring funding shortfalls are widespread , as according to the UN , around four million Darfurians depend on aid to survive . [ 43 ]
Even with its blustery rhetoric on a UN force in Darfur , Washington " has made only minimal commitments of logistical , transport , intelligence , and medical / medevac resources " for the peacekeepers , which are " the very US military resources , " as commented by Eric Reeves , " that will be most needed by any international force deploying effectively to Darfur . " [ 44 ]
Darfurians who have escaped the region have often fared little better .
With a commonly cited figure of 2 million displaced by the conflict in Darfur , many have arrived in neighboring countries .
Chad , which borders Darfur to the west , currently has the largest population of Darfurian refugees , many of whom languish in squalid camps . [ 45 ]
Egypt , to Sudan 's north , also hosts a significant number of Sudanese refugees from both Darfur and the country 's south , [ 46 ] though many have been subject to widespread discrimination and mistreatment at the hands of local armed groups and the Egyptian authorities -- a fact over which Cairo 's staunch allies in Washington have been silent . [ 47 ]
In one incident in 2005 , Egyptian police forcefully cleared a refugee camp in Cairo , killing nearly thirty . [ 48 ]
As one Sudanese refugee who escaped to Egypt and then Israel commented , " Egypt was worse than Sudan .
We feared for our lives .
We feared for our children .
I would rather that the Israeli government shoot me here , in a clean , humane way , than send me back to Egypt . " [ 49 ]
In repeated cases , Egyptian border guards have been accused of shooting or beating to death Sudanese refugees as they attempted to cross into Israel , including a seven - year - old girl . [ 50 ]
While a number of refugees have been more fortunate and made it into Israel , they have often found themselves unwanted in the country which was founded , as repeated ad nauseam by apologists for Israeli crimes , in the aftermath of the same crime which many of the refugees are said to be fleeing genocide .
Steeped as the nation 's leaders are in tear - soaked memories of the Nazi holocaust , the leading Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz notes that " it appears that the state and its officials are doing everything in their power to be rid of these refugees , " [ 51 ] with other news sources paraphrasing the Interior Minister to the effect that " Sudanese refugees trying to get into Israel ... had to be stopped , " lest the country be " flooded . " [ 52 ]
Though the Israeli government has claimed that most Sudanese refugees are in Israel for economic reasons rather than because of a fear of persecution , and indeed some undetermined number of them are , this does not justify treating all Sudanese refugees as economic refugees -- nor is there justification for how Israeli authorities have dealt with refugees who have entered Israel to escape destitution .
The Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) dump Sudanese refugees on the streets , " leaving ... volunteers and student groups to shelter and feed them . " [ 53 ]
Caught entering Israel from Egypt , there are , at last report , some 200 Sudanese refugees ( about seventy of which are from Darfur ) being detained indefinitely in Israeli prisons . [ 54 ]
Others have been placed on kibbutzim while awaiting visas that will " allow them to immigrate elsewhere , " presumably to nations that do not mind corrupting their populations with the blood of dark people . [ 55 ]
As a spokesperson for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert explained , " We do n't want to be the Promised Land for African refugees . " [ 56 ]
As a result , while some 500 Darfurians are being allowed to stay in Israel , Israeli police have raided shelters housing refugees and the army is under orders to use " reasonable force " to repel the " infiltrators " who attempt to cross the Israeli - Egyptian border without authorization [ 57 ] ; groups of Darfurians and other Sudanese have been " forcibly " returned to Egypt from Israel without any attempt to verify if they were worthy of asylum , while the Israeli government has taken the ludicrous position that all is well because it has diplomatic assurances from the Egyptian government that the refugees ' safety will be assured . [ 58 ]
Indeed , media reports indicate that Egypt has forcibly returned to Sudan some of the refugees who have been expelled by Israel , leading Human Rights Watch to slam " Egypt and Israel 's shared disregard for the plight of Sudanese fleeing Darfur . " [ 59 ]
In the words of the leading Israeli newspaper , Tel Aviv is " giving the Egyptians a wink to do our dirty work for us . "
[ 60 ]
Especially righteous critics of Israel 's treatment of Darfurians such as Elie Wiesel , who has been actively calling for intervention in Darfur and was involved in the founding of the Save Darfur Coalition , [ 61 ] have staked out their moral high ground by only calling on Israel to accept a " symbolic number " of the refugees . [ 62 ]
The photo - op for Israel to look as though it is actually doing something of value apparently supersedes actual human suffering as Wiesel 's primary concern , unsurprising for a man who has a long record of subservience to the Israeli state and once declared that " I never criticize Israel when I am not in Israel . " [ 63 ]
While some in Israel have recognized the propaganda value of taking mild steps to aid Darfurians , Israel 's image is the concern , not ameliorating suffering . [ 64 ]
As Jerusalem Post columnist Larry Derfner writes :
It 's hard to escape the impression that the Olmert government is being humane to the refugees from Sudan 's Darfur region for appearance 's sake only .
I say this because the government is being amazingly cruel to the refugees from southern Sudan , who are far more numerous than the Darfurians , and who escaped a genocide that took many , many more lives than the one going on in Darfur . [ 65 ]
Any pretense of " humane " treatment of Darfurians ( or others ) fleeing to Israel has since been shattered by the eerily - titled " Prevention of Infiltration Act of 2008 , " passed by a margin of 21 - to - 1 in an initial , non-binding Knesset vote .
With potential ( non-Jewish ) refugees , asylum - seekers , and immigrants to Israel in mind , the bill , in the words of a Ha'aretz editorial , is designed " to signal to anyone planning on coming here that their lives are not going to be easy . "
It goes on to note that :
The provisions of the bill - so " callous " and " cruel " according to a Ha'aretz columnist that it " may be said to constitute a whole new form of Holocaust denial " also include allowing " infiltrators " to be held without arraignment for up to 18 days , and empowering soldiers to force migrants back into Egypt within three days of having crossed into Israel .
There would be no judicial process , nor , per usual , any effort to verify the refugee or asylum status of newcomers . [ 67 ]
One may take some solace in the fact that the bill is so patently outrageous and bad for public relations that it now seems unlikely to pass , at least in its current form , though another Ha'aretz piece reported just a few days prior that Israel was making offers to pay African countries to take Sudanese and Darfurian refugees off their hands .
As noted dryly , the scheme " is liable to be viewed negatively in the world , " though its designers can surely count on the usual silence from the Save Darfur Coalition and the US political establishment . [ 68 ]
There are also larger and wealthier countries better suited than Chad , Egypt , or even Israel to taking in large numbers of Darfurians , and it is telling that they have not done so -- especially given their fiery rhetoric on Darfur .
Human rights groups have denounced Britain for deporting hundreds of Darfurians , under the rubric that " it is safe to send ' ordinary non-Arab ethnic Darfuris ' back to Sudan " -- a category with less than transparent parameters , as noted earlier . [ 69 ]
Britain has denied asylum to more than 100 Darfurians residing in the country [ 70 ] ; one Darfurian refugee to Britain , Alnour Fashir , saw the government reject his asylum claim after just twelve days of consideration .
The British government 's Home Office ( responsible for internal issues such as crime and security ) claimed not to believe Fashir 's account of having been a rebel in Darfur on the grounds that his story conflicted with information available on wikipedia.org . [ 71 ]
Most shockingly , the British Home Office is reportedly " collaborating with the Sudanese government to question asylum - seekers fleeing the violence in Darfur , " and has " passed information about individuals to the Sudanese embassy ... "
One Darfurian refugee attending an appointment at the Home Office regarding his status was stunned to find himself being questioned in private by a Sudanese embassy official , remarking " It 's like somebody taking you to see your killer . " [ 72 ]
Though the British government has adopted the tragicomic line that it is safe to send Darfurians to Khartoum rather than back to Darfur itself , deported refugees tell a different tale , and unsurprisingly so , unless one adheres to the British government 's purported trust in Sudan 's handling of rejected asylum - seekers .
One former Darfurian rebel who had been deported to Khartoum describes his treatment at the hands of Sudanese authorities as follows :
The beating and questions went on for days .
I was blindfolded most of the time , so I could n't see what they were using to beat me .
Once when the blindfold was off though , I saw a piece of electric cable .
My whole body was numb so I could n't feel anything any more .
I was bleeding everywhere , I was soaked in blood .
They never let me use a toilet .
The room was covered with my faeces and urine .
At times I lost consciousness .
I was expecting to die . [ 73 ]
The nearly total absence of press reporting on the US ' failure to accept more Darfurian refugees is truly glaring , especially in comparison to the British and Israeli press , which have both produced a detectable level of reporting on their countries ' own shameful refugee policies towards Darfurians .
From what has appeared in the US media , reports indicate that , as of May 2007 , a grand total of three Darfurians had been granted asylum in the United States in the preceding four years , one of whom ( Daoud Ibarahaem Hari ) worked as a translator for the journalists Nicholas Kristof and Paul Salopek , and benefited from " high - level intervention " on his behalf by the U2 rock star and activist Bono , New Mexico Governor and former Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson , and the former president Jimmy Carter . [ 74 ]
As Hari recounts , the hundreds of Darfurian refugees he is aware of in Ghana -- living in " very hard circumstances , " and without , one might add , " high - level intervention " from the aforementioned figures -- " they did n't get a chance to resettlement ( sic ) in [ the ] United States at all . "
Though cruel , there is little reason for surprise at the callousness of Western policies towards refugees .
Elsewhere in Sudan , the UNHCR has received only a small fraction of the necessary funds it seeks to provide meager services to Sudanese refugees returning to their homelands from the Congo , to where they had been forced to flee and reside for many years as a result of the north / south civil war - a war for which the US bears significant responsibility . [ 75 ]
Even refugees who suffer directly at the hands of Uncle Sam fare little better .
Of the over two million refugees from the war in Iraq , in addition to the more than 2.7 million internally displaced persons , the US had as of January 2007 admitted a mere 466 since the invasion in 2003 . [ 76 ]
Meanwhile , the official rogue state Syria has accepted well over a million Iraqi refugees - and it has done so , it should be noted , " without any help from the outside world . " [ 77 ]
A manifesto for Darfur activism -- and beyond
There are many measures that could and should be advocated by Darfur activists , demands that will help to mitigate not only the crisis in Darfur , but also to target the conditions , often imposed by the West , which provide much of the impetus for this and other conflicts worldwide .
Paramount in these considerations should be promoting measures which will most likely create the conditions for peace in Darfur , and without serving to advance Western economic and political interests in the region ( or the thesis of a global " Clash of Civilizations , " inspired by rhetoric of Sudan 's war between " Arabs " and " Africans " ) , which serve to erode sovereignty and prevent economic development .
Also foremost must be the previously mentioned principle that activists should generally use their limited resources to effect change where they are most likely to be able to make a meaningful impact ; especially for citizens of the world 's superpower , this often , though not always , means confronting the policies of their own governments , whose machinations they have the most power to change .
Sudan and its Darfur region will not see true and lasting peace and justice unless hegemonic interests - Western , Chinese , or otherwise - cease to treat them as mere pawns on a regional and global chessboard .
Whether in peace negotiations or managing relief operations , the people of Darfur must have a dominant voice in running their own lives ; in the long term , such empowerment will prove far more effective than " solutions " imposed from without . [ 78 ]
Activists who are cognizant of these realities will accordingly seek the following :
• Especially in light of the utter failure of many Western advocacy groups to push for a well - funded AU force in Darfur with a strong mandate , the joint AU - UN deployment must not be allowed to suffer the same fate .
Increased financial assistance to UNAMID would allow it to more easily gather troops from African and Global South nations , while proper logistical support would ensure that the mission does not suffer from the same resource poverty that was imposed on the AU mission ( though the influence of major powers , even through funding , must be carefully circumscribed ) .
Activists cannot sit idly by while UNAMID struggles for months on end to find such basic and necessary hardware as the two dozen helicopters that it has been seeking , in vain , since August 2007 .
• Similarly , wealthy nations like the US must provide the missing logistical support necessary for UNAMID .
Troops should be drawn from Arab and African nations , as well as the Global South more broadly ; whenever possible , countries with a track record of supporting unsavory elements within Sudan , such as the US and China , should be precluded from sending troops , or having any direct involvement with the mission .
• Of extreme importance for the prospects of long - term peace in Darfur , activists must push for their governments to exert full diplomatic energy and dedicate funds towards rebel unification , and peace negotiations leading to a political solution to the crisis . [ 79 ]
As is , the DPA is " unworkable , " and must be renegotiated or scrapped for something new [ 80 ] ; negotiations must be participatory in nature , in stark contrast to the US - dominated process leading to the DPA . [ 81 ]
• Washington must cease to collaborate with Khartoum 's security agency and all figures linked in any way to the violence in Darfur , often rationalized as collaboration in the " War on Terror . "
Instead of enjoying an alliance with the US and in some cases receiving CIA funding and protection , such individuals and groups should face targeted sanctions from the UN and be referred to the ICC ( both of these measures are supported by the US public ) , at least in cases where issuing an arrest warrant is unlikely to further fan the flames of conflict . , Washington must cooperate with the court not only on cases like Darfur but also in those involving US crimes - for the sake of Darfurians and the victims of other conflicts around the world . [ 82 ]
• Though Darfur already receives comparably high levels of aid vis -à - vis other humanitarian crises around the world , far more can be afforded and is desperately needed both in Darfur and other conflict zones around the world .
Aid groups such as Doctors without Borders , Mercy Corps , and Oxfam have been singled out for special praise for their roles in Darfur . [ 83 ]
Food aid , which is particularly vulnerable to manipulation , must be administered in such a way that it supports , rather than depresses local agricultural prices , and cannot be used as a vehicle for propping up US agribusiness . [ 84 ]
Wealthy nations should open their borders to Darfurian refugees , and facilitate their entrance .
• As suggested by Human Rights Watch , the UN Security Council should mandate that all oil money flowing into Sudan be paid into a UN - monitored fund .
This would not only give the UN leverage over Khartoum , but would also require that a certain percentage of the funds be directed towards humanitarian efforts in Darfur . [ 85 ]
• However inadequate the gesture , Washington must pay reparations for past crimes in Sudan , namely its crucial support for Nimeiri and other repressive regimes during the 1970s and 80s , which contributed to around two million deaths , and the bombing of al - Shifa .
These funds ( perhaps to be administered through the aforementioned UN fund ) should be directed towards compensation measures , such as infrastructure reconstruction and the victims and their families .
Other measures , though applicable to Darfur , have much more general relevance :
• The UN should be democratized to dramatically decrease the institutionalized power that the US and the other Security Council members wield , which has the effect of severely hampering the impartiality of UN peacekeeping missions , amongst other deleterious effects .
If a sufficient degree of democracy is achieved at the UN , thus lessening the current status of " humanitarian interventions " as a one - way street , member countries can pursue plans to create a standing force to respond to crises such as the one in Darfur .
• Activists must oppose the imposition of structural readjustment policies and neoliberalism in general , which have generally impoverishing effects on the targeted country 's population , and serve to further concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a small elite sector of society ( as noted , Sudan 's macroeconomy is booming , with IMF approval , though ordinary Sudanese are seeing few , if any of the benefits ) .
As such , these policies are crucial contributing factors to calamitous situations in impoverished regions like Darfur .
• Washington 's policies of forming alliances with unsavory regimes ( as done with Nimeri in the past , or the Obiang dictatorship in Equatorial Guinea currently ) , and militarizing vast swaths of the world through policy plans such as the opening of a new Africom center or the Trans - Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative , need to be vociferously opposed .
That these demands range from the ignored to the politically unthinkable in mainstream discourse is an indictment of both the Save Darfur movement - for its naïve credence in Western benevolence [ 86 ] and general failure to promote sensible solutions to the conflict - as well as the left , which has done little more than scoff at Darfur activists for their insufficient ideological and historical grounding and criticize their aims without supplying any of its own . [ 87 ]
Far less time and effort have been dedicated to actually engaging with Darfur activists , many of whom no doubt became activists out of a sincere concern for what is truly a humanitarian calamity .
Leftists should attempt to work with them on ways to address the crisis , broaden awareness of the sordid history of US - Sudanese relations and understanding of the ways in which the US - and not just China - is responsible for obstructing efforts to end the ongoing crimes in Darfur .
Should the left be successful in destroying a myth at the heart of much Darfur activism - that the US Army is " the armed wing of Amnesty International , " in the mocking phrasing of the journalist Johann Hari - the Darfur activist movement will become much more effective at promoting justice and an end to the atrocities .

Nevertheless , the rally also included former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , whose humanitarian concern is self - explanatory from her reaction to the catastrophically lethal US sanctions against Iraq , about which she infamously commented : “ I think this is a very hard choice , but the price — we think the price is worth it . ”

5 Middle East scholar James Zogby , for one , chose to speak at the April 30 rally despite some skepticism about the involvement of “ some Jewish groups who had a history of using Sudan as an issue to drive a wedge between Arabs and Africans . ”

There has also been controversy about the presence in the Save Darfur movement of Evangelical Christian groups , one of which has openly stated ambitions to convert Muslims to Christianity .

The spectacular popular mobilization seeking an end to conflict in Sudan ’s Darfur region could damage efforts to stop the bloodshed at a time when real progress might be within reach , experts say .
An interpretation of the conflict as one between Arabs and Africans or even between moderates and Islamist extremists has helped mobilize the worldwide campaign , said Alex de Waal of the Social Science Research Council in New York .
“ It ’s easy to take this simplified construct of Arabs and Africans and turn it into something that ’s meaningful , even though it may not be ethnographically or historically correct , ” he said ....
The simplification of the conflict in the media and by pressure groups has helped the Darfur issue become so prominent in the US , de Waal said …
“ In the case of Darfur , where the situation is not only complicated but has changed hugely in the last three years , that simplification can be very problematic , ” de Waal said .
15 An excerpt reads : “ A government - backed Arab militia known as Janjaweed has been engaging in campaigns to displace and wipe out communities of African tribal farmers . ”
See Save Darfur , “ Unity Statement , ” accessed 3 Oct. 2006 < http://www.savedarfur.org/pages/unity_statement>.

2006 < http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4334-2004Jul21.html>.
Some in the federal government have clearly contemplated going it alone , evidenced by the unanimous passage of House Resolution 467 , which included a provision that “ urges the Administration to seriously consider multilateral or even unilateral intervention to stop genocide in Darfur , Sudan , should the United Nations Security Council fail to act . ”
For the text of the bill , see House of Representatives , “ H Con Res 467 Declaring Genocide in Darfur / 07-22-04 , ” accessed 4 Dec. 2006 < http://www.beaboutpeace.com/archives/2005/07/h_con_res_467_d.html>.
Writing in the Boston Globe , John Shattuck , a former Clinton administration official , makes a similar argument , noting that the crisis in Darfur represents “ an opportunity for the United States to begin to reestablish its role in the world as a defender of human rights . ”
See his “ US Can Help End Darfur Genocide , ” Boston Globe , 15 July 2004 , accessed 17 Feb .
2007 < http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0715-02.htm>.
Indeed , a common theme in liberal commentary on Darfur is lamentation that the US has lost its “ moral leadership ” in the world because of the publicity nightmare in Iraq .
See for instance Samantha Power ’s observation that the “ US capacity for moral leadership [ is ] at its lowest point in history . ”
Power , Samantha , “ The Void : Why the Movement Needs Help ” , New Republic , 15 May 2006 , accessed 22 Oct. 2007 < http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/ksgnews/Features/opeds/050806_power.html>.
The victims of US sponsored violence the world over might be surprised to learn that Washington ever had a “ capacity for moral leadership ” to lose .

18 In a meeting with “ Darfur advocates , ” Bush heaped praise on rally organizers and hailed the countrywide rallies as an effort to “ urge the world to unite with the United States ” – apparently , in avoiding doing anything substantive to bring an end to the conflict , rhetorical flourishes aside .

Eric Reeves expands on the nature of the Save Darfur Coalition ’s relationship with the US government , whose actions :
should give pause to those who have heretofore been willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the Bush administration .
This is perhaps especially true of the gullible and excessively financed Save Darfur Coalition , which has become the unfortunate “ default ” bureaucracy for Darfur advocacy in the US .
A number of well - placed sources have confirmed to this writer that the administration ’s priority is politically “ managing ” the American Darfur advocacy movement , particularly the Save Darfur Coalition ( SDC ) , rather than responding to advocacy demands — - demands that are in any event typically impoverished on the part of SDC .

Khartoum claims that international aid organizations are agents of hostile Western governments whose ultimate goal is regime change .
Already , threats of coercive military action are giving oxygen to regime hard - liners .
A military strike during enforcement of a no - flight zone would most likely hand President Omar Hassan al - Bashir the same kind of propaganda victory he scored when American cruise missiles knocked out a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum in 1998 …
The humanitarian ’s first obligation is to do no harm .
Talk of coercive military action must end .
A no - flight zone would be recklessly dangerous and would not address the real problems in Darfur .
To endanger the region ’s humanitarian lifeline is not simply wrong - headed .
It is inhumane .

The key challenge in enforcing a No Fly Zone would be distinguishing humanitarian aircraft from military aircraft .
For example , the Anonov cargo planes that do so much of the heavy lifting for humanitarian organizations are indistinguishable from Antonovs that drop bombs on innocent civilians .
Khartoum has in the past painted its military aircraft the white color of the AU and humanitarian organizations ; it would certainly do so again if confronting a No Fly Zone .
Moreover , the regime would certainly attempt to engineer a mistake in identity so as to provoke the shooting down of a humanitarian Antonov , perhaps by forcing a re-routing of humanitarian flight paths .

26 Flint , “ In Sudan , Help Comes From Above ” :
Aid agencies are quietly appalled by the prospect of a no - fly zone .
They believe Khartoum would respond by grounding humanitarian aircraft and , at worst , by forcing aid agencies to leave .
Even if Khartoum did n’t ground flights , the United Nations most likely would , for fear of sending its planes into a potential combat zone .
Without humanitarian air access , Darfurians would soon suffer lethal health and food crises .
In the event of heightened military activity on the ground , Darfurians would be caught in the crossfire .
The people of Kosovo and Bosnia had easier access to neighboring host countries .
Darfur is vast and dry .
Its people would not be able to easily flee to safety .
Today , as Khartoum ’s janjaweed militias turn against each other , rebel movements fragment and banditry rages , millions of Darfurians who depend on humanitarian assistance can be reached only by air .
United Nations and African Union traffic accounts for 9 of every 10 flights in Darfur .
Some agencies deliver as much as 90 percent of their supplies using aircraft .
The collapse of the humanitarian apparatus would be a death sentence for Darfurians , especially those in camps who rely on aid agencies for food , clean water and shelter .

The UN refugee agency says it may have to scale down its operations in West Darfur because it is running out of money .
The UNHCR says it is facing a shortfall of more than $ 7 million needed to assist more than two million internally displaced people and thousands of refugees from Chad and the Central African Republic .
Lisa Schlein reports for VOA News from UNHCR headquarters in Geneva .
The UN refugee agency says it is hard to believe it has to appeal for money when the misery of millions of people in Darfur is constantly in the news .
It says cuts will have to be made in its protection and assistance programs to compensate for the lack of funds .
UN refugee spokeswoman , Jennifer Pagonis , says many of the 2.5 million displaced people and about 30,000 refugees from Chad and the Central African Republic will suffer from these cut backs .

Needless to say , no similar concerns were expressed about Beirut ’s ability to absorb the significant portion of the Lebanese population that was driven out of the country ’s southern region in 2006 by Israel , as the US and Britain stalled any international diplomatic moves to halt the wanton Israeli bombardment .
In other instances , Israel was more willing to accept newcomers .
One may recall Operation Moses from 1984 - 5 , when some 8,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted in a US - Israeli operation to Israel from Sudan , then suffering the effects of a severe famine , though one the US long denied .
As the journalist Deborah Scroggins cites ( p. 66 ) :
[ The academic ]
Ahmed Karadawi had often pointed to the Ethiopian Jews as another case of Western hypocrisy , noting that US and Jewish charities raised $ 300 million to finance Operation Moses , the most dramatic of the Israeli airlifts , and care for its 8,000 beneficiaries - ten times the amount raised in the United States at the height of the famine to care for 600,000 refugees remaining in the Sudan .

“ All the refugees who are returned to Sudan - whether to Darfur or to South Sudan - will be executed on arrival , ” said Eytan Schwartz , spokesperson for The Committee for Advancement of Refugees from Darfur .

He added that Israel ’s decision to let 500 refugees remain in the country was “ an important symbolic gesture ” of humanitarian aid based on the past history and suffering of the Jewish people ...

Amongst the deported is :
… Dr. Halima Basheer , 27 , who says she was gang - raped by Sudanese soldiers for telling aid workers about the rapes of more than 40 schoolgirls , London ’s Sunday Telegraph said .
She learned about the rapes because the girls were taken to her clinic , she said .
After telling the aid workers , Janjaweed militia soldiers went to her office , she said .
“ They said to me : ‘ You told those people about the rape at the school .
Why did you do that ?
You are always talking about rape , but you do n’t know what it is .
We will teach you a lesson about what rape is . ’”
The soldiers took her to a secluded hut and raped her , she said .

2007 http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/humanint/2004/01newhumanitarianism.htm:
In varying degrees , Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Congo — altogether , places where millions of people have been killed in the last 20 years — are consequences of a global economic system that has , in effect , favored a form of warlordism ( often exercised from the capital ) over governance in which strong States , via government bureaucracies , can deliver services and are accountable .
The mechanism by which global economic forces lead to warlordism appears to be fairly direct in some cases : the IMF ( or an individual donor government ) demands that State enterprises be sold , reducing patronage and income ; a foreign investor both cuts services and is lured into paying protection to an emerging warlord , who trades on the State ’s decline and deals in drugs and guns , which then become new sources of social dislocation and the only viable economic activity .
It is easy enough ( and partially true ) to say that the real problem lies with corrupt political leaders .
But weak States tend to be more corrupt , and opportunities and incentives for corruption are multiplied by the system of privatization in particular .

The International Crisis Group has put together a sensible proposal for how the international community can further negotiations .
See International Crisis Group , “ Darfur : Revitalising the Peace Process , ” 30 Apr. 2007 , accessed 5 July 2007 < http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4769&l=1>.
Omer Ismail of the Carr Center for Human Rights at Harvard University , and Colin Thomas - Jensen of the International Crisis Group , summarize the state of international efforts at fostering rebel unity thus :
Until the rebel groups achieve a greater degree of political cohesion , there simply will not be a workable peace process .
Poor rebel leadership is part of the problem , but the international community ’s efforts to forge rebel unity have been uncoordinated , sporadic , and are unlikely to work until it aggressively pursues a common approach .
Toward that end , the United States , African Union , and EU should assemble a team of diplomats based in Chad and Darfur and dedicated to the task . …
The rebel leaders we spoke to in Chad are serious about peace , but until the international community gets serious about peacemaking , this conflict will drag on and consolidate the government of Sudan ’s ethnic cleansing of Darfur .

The UN reports :
One third of the global food aid budget , or some $ 600 million annually , is wasted due to conditions tying it to processing and shipping by national carriers of donor countries , and such in - kind aid should be replaced by cash payments that boost production in recipient states , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) said today . …
The report noted that as much as 90 per cent of all food aid resources may be tied to some specific conditions , often making it difficult for implementing agencies to use the aid in the most efficient way and ensure that it effectively reaches the people who need it most .
The world ’s leading food donors spend as much as half of their food aid budgets on domestic processing and shipping by national carriers , according to research quoted by the report , with one third of global food - aid resources wasted by such requirements .
Megan
Tady usefully surveys the politics surrounding US food aid :
Last month , in a move that shocked observers , CARE , one of the world ’s largest humanitarian organizations , rejected $ 45 million in US food aid , shining a spotlight on a practice the group says may hurt starving populations more than help them .
Complaining that US food aid policy is inefficient , unsustainable and perhaps even detrimental to combating food insecurity , CARE believes “ enough is enough , ” according to Bob Bell , director for CARE ’s Food Resource Coordination Team .
The decision comes at a time when other humanitarian and food advocacy organizations are calling on members of Congress to rewrite food aid policy that puts starving populations first when they authorize this month ’s 2007 Farm Bill .
The United States is the world ’s largest provider of international food aid , supplying more than half of all food aid designated to alleviate hunger , about four million metric tons of food per year .
As currently implemented , US food aid lines the pockets of American agribusiness and the shipping industry .
Under existing rules , at least 75 percent of food aid has to be grown and packaged in the United States , and shipped using US flag - bearing vessels .
Unlike most countries that donate food , the United States sells a portion of its food aid , either by selling it to recipient governments , or allowing it to be monetized , a process where food aid is sold to generate cash for development projects .
And while most donor countries provide cash as food aid , the United States insists on giving in - kind donations .

Washington is playing a leading role in the unfolding drama in Darfur .
So we have an obligation to know about the history of United States policy in the neighborhood .
Not long ago , Ronald Reagan ’s policy in neighboring Chad deepened a longstanding crisis and scuttled a chance for peace .
This may be a cautionary tale for Darfur , where US President George W. Bush proposes humanitarian intervention to end the suffering .…
Enter newly elected US president Ronald Reagan .
He declared Chad a major foreign policy priority and said the right words — neutrality , peaceful solutions and no foreign meddling .
Actions , however , told a different story .
The Reagan administration brushed aside the hard - worn African consensus , branded Libya ’s troops occupiers and insisted they leave .
To sugarcoat its demands , Washington promised to fund a replacement Inter - African Force ( IAF ) .
The Libyans withdrew in November 1981 and 4,800 IAF troops arrived in Chad in December .
Requested to honor its pledge , Washington became stingy — it provided 8 cents of every dollar the IAF needed .
This , combined with mandate disagreements , kept the IAF toothless .
Having deceived the Africans , the Reagan administration rapidly implemented its real agenda .
The goal was to overthrow the consensus GUNT government and replace it with Washington ’s favorite Chadian warlord , Hissene Habre — the same renegade warlord condemned to death by his former colleagues .
The US covertly showered cash , arms and equipment on Habre .
Rejuvenated , his militia roared in from Darfur and took Ndjamena , Chad ’s capital , on June 7 , 1982 .
As a direct consequence , the OAU became acrimoniously split ; the IAF peacekeepers withdrew ; the GUNT formed a government in exile ; and its militias re-entered Chad as a two - pronged armed rebellion that soon threatened Habre ’s grip on power .
Reagan hastily leaped to Habre ’s defense .
He first informed Congress and invoked the War Powers Act .
Next , he sent two sophisticated surveillance planes to Habre , followed by other military aircraft , Redeye missiles , sundry war materiel and even American “ advisors , ” whose number may have reached 500 .
In July and August 1983 alone , new US military aid for Habre totaled $ 25 million . …
Protected by Reagan , Mitterrand , and other friends , Habre tyrannized Chad with impunity until 1990 , when an aide , Idriss Deby , overthrew him .
Uncovered documents and other evidence now suggest Habre probably murdered 40,000 political opponents — after the war .
Weeks ago , on July 2 , in Gambia , the Afric
Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska is opposed to placing the beluga whales in her state ’s Cook Inlet on the endangered species list , arguing that to do so would be “ premature . ”
Ms. Palin said the same thing about polar bears .
For all of the caricatures , Ms. Palin can be a skillful politician .
“ Premature ” is such a subtle , reassuring word .
It implies that she wo n’t always be opposed to protecting belugas , just not right now .
By “ premature , ” Ms. Palin might mean that scientific studies of the beluga whale population are incomplete .
It is hard to see her as a proponent of exacting science ; some of the studies her aides cited to justify her earlier opposition to listing the polar bear as endangered flatly ignored the threats posed by climate change and were financed by the oil industry .
There is little doubt that her real concern is protecting Alaska ’s gas - and - oil development .
Presumably , the time for listing the belugas will be mature when the gas - and - oil infrastructure in Cook Inlet is in place and the shipping lanes are running full and the fishing industry is going gangbusters .
After humans have gotten everything they want out of those waters , then it will be time .
Here ’s the problem :
The number of beluga whales in Cook Inlet crashed from 653 in 1994 to an estimated 278 in 2005 .
If it is premature to protect them now , then the time will truly be mature , by Ms. Palin ’s logic , only when there are none left .
As I ’ve mentioned before , I get tons of email from people describing the personal finance problems in their lives , commenting critically on things I ’ve written , and offering up their own stories of success .
Not only that , as The Simple Dollar has become more and more popular , I ’ve had more and more opportunities to talk about personal finance with people face to face .
What amazes me is that I see most of the same problems pop up time and time again .
Sure , the specifics of the story change , as do the severity of the situation , but these same twelve items come up in almost every story I hear about financial problems .
Even worse , quite often multiple items from this list appear in the same tale of woe .
I ’m not immune to them , either .
At the time of my own financial meltdown , I was guilty of the majority of these things .
It was only due to a commitment to fixing my financial situation that I was able to overcome these mistakes and set them right .
Here they are , the twelve biggest mistakes I witness and hear about time and time again .
Concern rarely extends beyond the next paycheck or two .
These are the people who live from paycheck to paycheck .
Their next paycheck or two will cover the immediate bills .
If there happens to be some money left over , it ’s spent on frivolous things .
These are the people who are constantly hitting the ATM to check their debit card balance so they know how much they have to spend or the people who juggle credit cards that are maxed out .
The only thing that matters is the next paycheck and the brief breathing room that it provides .
What ’s the solution ?
The best way for people in this situation to begin to escape is to set up an automatic savings plan of some sort .
The automatic savings plan would scrape a small amount of money out of that checking account each week and put it somewhere safe .
The point is n’t so much to build up savings ( although that ’s very useful and valuable ) , but to slowly wean yourself from spending everything that you bring in .
Only one person in the family knows where the money goes .
Most families have one person that ’s largely in control of managing the money – and that ’s fine .
It can be very useful to have a family “ accountant ” – a person that manages the checkbook , makes sure the bills are paid , and so on .
This can actually be a very good thing , particularly if one person in a family is particularly detail - oriented .
The problem occurs when this leads to financial atrophy in the family , where no one but the person running the checkbook knows where the money goes or is involved in the decision - making process .
While it can be very easy to just let that person run things , it can be very dangerous , too .
That person might not be saving appropriately for family goals , might be leveraging credit card use in order to allow everyone to keep spending as they are , and so on .
What ’s the solution ?
The best solution is for partners to have monthly meetings about their financial situation .
Just sit down and talk about it .
Go through the checkbook registry together and the bills together and just make sure that everyone is aware where the money is going and why it ’s going there .
Then , if there are problems , they can be discussed and handled appropriately .
Doing this goes a long way to ensure that nasty surprises – like hidden credit card bills and so on – do n’t crop up .
Partners do n’t talk about their shared goals .
When my wife and I were first married , we basically did n’t talk about our shared goals – and when we did , it was mostly just bumping heads because our goals were n’t in alignment .
We both had vague plans about having children and owning a home , but anything beyond that – and anything specific on either of those two topics – varied greatly between the two of us .
It was n’t until we started actually sitting down and talking about our shared goals that things began to click into place .
I began to realize that some of my dreams did n’t match hers at all , and vice versa .
I also began to understand that when we sat down , talked about our different dreams , figured out the areas where they lined up , and came up with clear and specific goals that we both shared , it engaged both of us to make it happen .
Rather than fighting through gentle resistance to get what I wanted , I found a cheerleader that pushed me onward to get what we wanted .
The best part ?
What I wanted and what we wanted really were n’t all that far apart .
It just took sitting down , talking about things , and making things concrete and specific to turn resistance into support – to turn vague ideas and dreams into action .
What ’s the solution ?
Sit down with your partner and talk about where you want to be in five years .
In ten years .
In twenty five years .
Figure out what each of you wants individually , then look at the areas where they overlap .
Compromise a little bit and come up with detailed plans for things that you both want and you ’re both willing to work towards .
There is no budget or spending limit , particularly on non-essential items .
I ’m not actually referring to a hard and strict budget here .
Instead , I ’m talking about not keeping track of – and keeping control of – one ’s spending on nonessential items .
Many people simply do n’t bother to keep track of their spending on such things in any way , shape , or form , and they ’re often shocked at how much money has been frivolously spent when the credit card bill comes due .
Then they pay it and forget about it again – it ’s more important to keep up with the Joneses , you know .
My wife and I did this for several years .
We kept our spending separate and did n’t really worry about how much we were spending .
Quite often , this would result in a mess , where there were bills to be paid and we ’d both spent more than we should .
Eventually , clear communication got us out of this routine and now we both spend in a much more rational fashion .
What ’s the solution ?
Put everyone on a spending allowance .
Seriously .
Each person gets a certain amount to spend per week ( or month ) .
This requires honesty and commitment from both sides , so the best way to do it is to regularly talk about it .
Agree to a spending cap for each of you and then discuss any spending beyond that .
Family members and friends loan each other money without thinking about the consequences .
Many people talk about the guilt , anger , and mistrust that they feel when it comes to debts with their family .
They either feel bad ( in some fashion ) about an inability to pay back a family debt , upset because of the expectations that others have of them in terms of loaning money , and anger and mistrust when people do n’t pay back the money that ’s loaned .
Luckily , I ’ve largely been able to avoid this .
On the occasions when I ’ve wanted to help out family members , I ’ve been smart enough to make it a gift .
What ’s the solution ?
Do n’t mix lending with family .
If you want to help a family member with their financial situation , make it a no-strings - attached gift and forget about it .
If you ’re under the expectation that a family member is going to pay you back , you ’ve changed a loving and caring relationship into a business - like lender - borrower relationship .
Are you close and familial with your mortgage lender ?
There is no emergency fund .
Many people are often completely blindsided by unexpected expenses .
It ’s a disaster if their car breaks down or they lose their job – immediate panic mode .
I was once in this very situation .
A truck breakdown in 2005 was extremely costly , as was the need for new glasses in about that timeframe .
I had to worry and plan and move money around in order to be able to easily deal with both of those situations .
What ’s the solution ?
Well , it ’s pretty easy – build an emergency fund .
Start an automatic savings plan – as discussed in the section about living paycheck to paycheck – and do n’t touch that money unless there ’s a need .
Having that flexible cash on hand makes emergencies much easier to handle .
Plus , such an emergency fund ( once it becomes normal and routine ) can be the beginnings of a bigger savings goal , like saving for a house down payment .
There is no plan for the unexpected passing or disability of a key wage earner .
Ask someone what they ’d do if the primary wage earner in their home suddenly passed away or became severely disabled and you often see a panicked “ deer in the headlights ” look .
Further down that line , I hear from a lot of people who are having serious problems following the incapacitation or death of a key wage earner .
What ’s the solution ?
Surprisingly , it ’s not that hard to protect yourself against both of these events .
A nice healthy emergency fund helps with the short term of either scenario , and a solid life insurance policy and a long term disability insurance policy will take care of the needs in each situation .
If you ’re young and in reasonable health , both types of policies can be quite cheap and they protect you against any such disaster .
A long term care policy ( one that covers the costs associated with your care if you require significant medical and personal care to survive ) can also be useful .
Children are kept away from money concepts .
Many children ( even through the teen years ) have only a minimal understanding of money .
They view it as merely a way to get stuff they want , not as a way to translate your hard work into a home , food on the table , clothing , electricity , future plans , and a few pleasures .
Instead , many children get an allowance that is n’t based on any effort and are allowed to spend it entirely on their wants .
In this situation , the money has little meaning , and it ’s made even worse when it ’s supplemented by parents who step in with more money all the time .
What ’s the solution ?
Have your children earn money in exchange for tasks done , and eventually build them towards small - scale entrepreneurship , like in the book Young Bucks .
When they do earn money , have them set aside some for giving to others and for long - term savings goals so that they understand the usefulness of saving the money .
There is a pervasive anti-frugality pro-consumerism attitude .
Many people find themselves eschewing frugality .
They buy heavily into the idea that “ you only live once ” and that “ settling ” for the best buy or the least expensive option is foolish .
People who believe in this often are put under peer pressure to spend and often put pressure on others to do the same – you ca n’t live cheap if you ’re going to be one of the boys , right ?
You gotta have all the toys .
I used to do this all the time .
I ’d buy expensive golf clubs and gadgets and always had a strong collection of Magic : the Gathering cards .
Living cheap ?
Come on … that was for losers .
What a fool I was .
What ’s the solution ?
If you ’re constantly bombarded with the sense that you need to spend money to fit in with a social group , find another social group .
Engage in activities that are personally appealing to you that do n’t revolve around spending money and seek others who are interested in those things .
If you find you need to spend to feel good about yourself , seek out low - cost alternatives – hit the library if you ’re a book or music nut , for example .
You may also want to seek some degree of counseling if your self - worth has actually become tied to the stuff that you have .
Employee benefits are n’t well understood or utilized .
Most employers offer a lot of nice benefits that are largely undiscovered – or they ’re underutilized by the employees .
At my previous job , one thing I was quite good at was discovering employee benefits that we were entitled to – and my coworkers were often amazed at the stuff I found .
Free sports tickets .
Free car usage .
Free prescription benefits and medical reimbursement accounts .
Free meals .
Free lectures .
Free books and reading materials .
Free investment advice and counseling .
All you have to do is look .
What ’s the solution ?
Read through your employee handbook and know the benefits available to you .
Pay attention to emails and memos from human resources , as they often let you know about benefits .
If you ’re not sure about something , ask for help .
And do n’t hesitate to sign up for stuff – it ’s there for you .
Major purchases are financed by debt , not by advance saving , and are often bought impulsively without research .
Not long ago , I watched a friend purchase a car .
They needed to replace their old college - era Honda , so they just watched a couple of TV commercials , went to one local dealership less than a week later , and came home with a vehicle ( and a hefty debt as well ) .
He ’d known that he needed a car for a while , but there was no advance planning – when he decided to do it , he just went and did it .
The end result ?
A poor impulsive car choice that does n’t excel in reliability or gas mileage and a huge amount of debt .
All it would take is a tiny bit of advance planning and an hour or two at the library and you ’ll get a reliable car with good gas mileage , the car you actually want , and you ’ll have a nice down payment in hand – and thus a better loan , too .
What ’s the solution ?
If you know you ’re going to be buying a car in the near future ( three years or less ) , start making payments now by putting that money each month into a savings account .
Then , as the time gets closer , figure out what you actually need and research those cars at the library or online .
Find a model that fits your needs and wants the best and is reliable and has good gas mileage , then know what the car should cost – you can do this with an hour or two at the library .
Then walk in there , buy the car with a large down payment or outright cash , and you ’ve suddenly got a great car for a very nice price .
You can apply the same exact logic to other purchases – appliances and home purchases reward advance saving and research .
Investments ( particularly retirement ) are n’t diversified .
A final concern that I often hear is that people are utterly panicked by the downturn in the stock market and are watching their retirement savings lose 20 - 25 % of their value over the last year .
This is especially true for people who are reaching retirement age – losing 25 % of your retirement in the years just before retirement means that you ’re simply going to be working for a while longer .
For younger folks like myself , it ’s not quite as worrisome .
My Roth IRA wo n’t be available for withdrawals for thirty years , after all .
But even for me , it ’s important to not have every egg in one basket – I invest in broad - based index funds that essentially have a few pennies in thousands of different stocks at once , so that the failure of one company wo n’t cause me to drown .
What ’s the solution ?
Diversify , especially as you get closer to retirement .
If you do n’t know what you ’re doing , put your money in a “ target retirement ” option that ’s close to your retirement date so that they can auto - diversify for you .
Do not hold more than 20 % of your retirement savings in a single stock – I ’d be nervous holding more than 10 % .
Functional .NET - Fighting Friction in the BCL with Directory .
GetFiles Thursday , October 16 , 2008
Very recently on a project , I was having significant issues with System .
IO .
Directory .
GetFiles , in which I was getting an access denied message which prevented further crawling of certain directories .
The performance issue was another issue that was detrimental .
I was n't happy either with the design of this API .
Instead , I set out to fix some of these issues and come up with a design that I felt better addressed some of my concerns with some techniques from functional programming .
The Issues
There are several issues that lead me to come up with an alternative for this situation of getting all files in a directory .
Arrays should n't be returned from method calls Processor intensive for iterating over large directory trees instead of calculating only what I need , when I need it Filtering is weak , and only uses file format patterns Access denied internal messages occur for no apparent reason which halts the method
Let 's talk about each just a little bit more .
The first issue with GetFiles is that it returns an array .
Eric Lippert , of the C# team recently posted on " Arrays considered somewhat harmful " , in which he describes that for most cases , arrays should not be used in one form or another .
In this post , he states :
You probably should not return an array as the value of a public method or property , particularly when the information content of the array is logically immutable .
Let me give you an example of where we got that horridly wrong in a very visible way in the framework .
If you take a look at the documentation for System .
Type , you 'll find that just looking at the method descriptions gives one a sense of existential dread .
One sees a whole lot of sentences like " Returns an array of Type objects that represent the constraints on the current generic type parameter . "
Almost every method on System .
Type returns an array it seems .
Given that the GetFiles method returns an array , we could feel free to mutate the contents of this array and we'd be none the wiser for it .
There is no need , once calculated , to change this value .
This file path is what it is .
If you need to modify the contents , a Map ( Select ) would do wonders if you are using an IEnumerable < string > instead .
The problem with arrays is that they are a big bucket of mutability .
Coming from the functional programmer standpoint in me , I do n't like that as an option , and would rather have an immutable List < T > .
Secondly , there are performance implications of recursing through large directories all at once .
It 's very much a blocking call in the application .
Another key point in the functional programming world is to only calculate what you need , aka just - in - time computing .
If I 'm not going to immediately use all items in this array , I just calculated all files for no apparent reason .
So , there is a big plus when returning an IEnumerable < T > and using the yield return to calculate the value .
Thirdly , the search options for handling whether or not to include a given file or directory is a string used for file or directory masks .
There are more important ways of filtering than just using that one simple mechanism .
Instead , what if I want to return only hidden files , compressed and so on ?
The level of effort got a little bit higher for doing that .
Instead , what you could do is provide a Predicate < string > function in order to be able to include certain files as you calculate your items .
Finally , there has been a big blocking issue which brought this up in the first place .
There are instances in which the implementation was throwing very odd internal windows errors while it was searching in some hidden directories .
So , the implementation of this just simply would n't work for my needs .
Given these issues that I faced here , what could I do about it ?
Handling the Native Code
In order for us to fix the overall issue with the Directory .
GetFiles method , we need to interact with native code .
This involves the standard P / Invoke operations to call into kernel32.dll .
There are three methods that interest us for enumerating files and folders , FindFirst File , FindNextFile and FindClose .
The FindFirstFile method is used , given the file name , returns both a SafeFindHandle and the WIN32_FIND_DATA structure , which contains file information such as file name , file size , date stamp information and so on .
The FindNextFile then takes the given SafeFindHandle and returns success as well as another WIN32_FIND_DATA containing the next file or directory should one be found .
We implemented a custom handle class called SafeFindHandle in order to support disposing the underlying IntPtr handle .
Creating handles is the best way to ensure proper disposal .
We override the ReleaseHandle method in order to call the FindClose method , which closes our handle .
Let 's take a look at the code to implement our native code calls :
internal sealed class SafeFindHandle : SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid
{
[ SecurityPermission ( SecurityAction .
LinkDemand , UnmanagedCode = true ) ]
internal SafeFindHandle ( ) : base ( true ) { }
protected override bool ReleaseHandle ( )
{
return NativeMethods .
FindClose ( handle ) ;
}
}
internal static class NativeMethods
{
[ DllImport ( " kernel32.dll " , CharSet = CharSet.Auto , SetLastError = true ) ]
internal static extern SafeFindHandle FindFirstFile (
string fileName ,
[ In , Out ] WIN32_FIND_DATA data ) ;
[ DllImport ( " kernel32.dll " , CharSet = CharSet.Auto , SetLastError = true ) ]
internal static extern bool FindNextFile (
SafeFindHandle hndFindFile ,
[ In , Out , MarshalAs ( UnmanagedType.LPStruct ) ]
WIN32_FIND_DATA lpFindFileData ) ;
[ DllImport ( " kernel32.dll " ) , ReliabilityContract ( Consistency.WillNotCorruptState , Cer.Success ) ]
internal static extern bool FindClose ( IntPtr handle ) ;
[ Serializable , StructLayout ( LayoutKind .
Sequential , CharSet = CharSet.Auto ) , BestFitMapping ( false ) ]
internal class WIN32_FIND_DATA
{
internal FileAttributes dwFileAttributes ;
internal int ftCreationTime_dwLowDateTime ;
internal int ftCreationTime_dwHighDateTime ;
internal int ftLastAccessTime_dwLowDateTime ;
internal int ftLastAccessTime_dwHighDateTime ;
internal int ftLastWriteTime_dwLowDateTime ;
internal int ftLastWriteTime_dwHighDateTime ;
internal int nFileSizeHigh ;
internal int nFileSizeLow ;
internal int dwReserved0 ;
internal int dwReserved1 ;
[ MarshalAs ( UnmanagedType.ByValTStr , SizeConst = 260 ) ]
internal string cFileName ;
[ MarshalAs ( UnmanagedType.ByValTStr , SizeConst = 14 ) ]
internal string cAlternateFileName ;
}
}
Now that we 've defined the basis for our solution , let 's move onto implementing the GetFiles method in a better fashion .
Implementing the Solution
We defined above a few issues that I 'd like to solve with our implementation .
Functional programming aspects such as lazy evaluation , immutability , and high order functions will be implemented in our solution .
Let 's answer each of our questions above in our implementation .
Use IEnumerable < T> instead of a mutable array
Use yield break / return to compute what is needed Use a Predicate < T > instead of a weakly typed query string for more powerful filtering Use Native P / Invoke in order to get around some of the blocking issues .
Given these answers , let 's look at my implementation of GetFiles .
My normal standard is to abstract IO methods into a class called FileSystem , which implements the IFileSystem interface .
This way , I can abstract any side effecting code that needs to deal with the file system directly .
public IEnumerable < string > GetFiles (
string directory ,
SearchOption option ,
Predicate < string > pred )
{
var findData = new NativeMethods .
WIN32_FIND_DATA ( ) ;
using ( var findHandle = NativeMethods .FindFirstFile (
directory + @ " \* " , findData ) )
{
if (!findHandle.IsInvalid )
{
do
{
if (( findData.dwFileAttributes &
FileAttributes .
Directory ) != 0 )
{
if ( findData.cFileName != " . " &&
findData.cFileName != " .. " )
{
if ( option == SearchOption .
AllDirectories )
{
var subdirectory = Path . Combine (
directory ,
findData.cFileName ) ;
foreach ( var file in GetFiles ( subdirectory , option , pred ) )
yield return file ;
} // if - option
}
} // if - findData.dwFileAttributes
else
{
var filePath = Path.Combine ( directory , findData.cFileName ) ;
if ( pred( filePath ) )
yield return filePath ;
}
} while ( NativeMethods . FindNextFile( findHandle , findData ) ) ;
}
}
}
This implementation may need a little polishing in terms of error checking , some performance improvements such as Expressions over Predicate < T > , but as soon as I started using this approach , the performance of my application improved greatly , as I 'm only computing the values as I need them and not beforehand .
This solution also allows me for better filtering as well .
Let 's look at a few examples of using this .
// Get zip files only in C : \Work
var fileSystem = new FileSystem ( ) ;
var files = fileSystem.
GetFiles ( @ " C:\Work " , SearchOption .TopDirectoryOnly ,
path => string . Compare ( Path.GetExtension ( path ) , " .zip " ,
StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase ) == 0 ) ;
foreach ( var file in files ) Console.
WriteLine ( file ) ;
// Get hidden files in C : \Program Files
var hidden Files = fileSystem.GetFiles ( @ " C:\Program Files " , SearchOption .
AllDirectories ,
path => ( File.GetAttributes ( path ) & FileAttributes .
Hidden ) != 0 ) ;
foreach ( var file in hidden Files ) Console.
WriteLine ( file ) ;
As you can see from the above code , it 's much more functional in that I am using high order functions such as Predicate < T > , using lazy evaluation to calculate , and not returning a mutable array .
But , how 's my performance ?
Since I 'm only taking what I need , when I need it , nothing is done until I actually call GetNext on the IEnumerator < T >.
But , when forced to iterate this way versus using Directory .
GetFiles , the two are close , but the edge is more towards my approach .
There are alternatives to this approach , such as instead of using a Predicate < T > , using IQueryable <T > .
Such an example might look like this .
var fileSystem = new FileSystem ( ) ;
var results = from file in fileSystem .
GetFiles ( @ " D:\Work " , SearchOption .AllDirectories ) .
AsQueryable ( )
where ( File.GetAttributes ( file ) & FileAttributes .
Hidden ) != 0
select file ;
foreach ( var result in results ) Console.
WriteLine( result ) ;
Both approaches work well and since we have lazy evaluation , it 's pretty flexible , but what 's your thought ?
Wrapping It Up
This is just one of the many improvements that can be made to the BCL .
Had generics and lazy evaluation been around since the beginning of the .NET framework , I would guarantee many of the design decisions around the libraries would be much different .
Instead , there are several friction points we hit against that we must mitigate .
Solving these problems , using functional programming techniques greatly improves the experience and API design .
Understanding functional programming and some of the concepts behind this can greatly improve your APIs going forward and I hope this was proof that you can in fact do that .

The incredible Siamese twin fish conjoined at the stomach
It is so incredibly rare that you would think Siamese twin fish attached at the stomach would never survive .
But at eight months old , these two Nile Tilapia fish in Thailand have found the perfect way to cope with life upside down ... or the right way up if you 're the lucky twin .
The bigger fish protects its smaller sibling on the bottom , while it in turn looks for food .
Believe it or not :
These fish really are conjoined twins
The Nile Tilapia fish is a common freshwater species found in tropical rivers , canals , lakes and ponds but these two were found in a Bangkok aquarium .
The fish can reaches a maximum of 2ft in length and can weigh up to 9lb .
Originally from waters stretching from Africa to the Cape Horn , the fish was introduced to freshwater irrigation systems so as to fight algae growth but has now become a pest .
Best mates :
The bigger fish helps its sibling , while the smallerone searches for food
Behind shrimp and salmon Nile Tilapia is the third most imported fish to the U.S .
It is not the first time Siamese twins have been discovered in the animal kingdom .
In July , a pair of barn swallows conjoined at the hip by skin and muscle tissue , were found in Arkansas .
The Arkansas Game & Fish Commission said it was a ' one in a million - probably more than that - occurrence ' .
When discovered by officials the birds were not eating , and one died , while a veterinarian later put the other down .
Experts say finding conjoined birds is rare because they likely die before being discovered .
They believe the birds came from a double yolk egg .
Life upside down :
The Siamese twin Nile Tilapia are still alive and well at eight months in an aquarium in Bangkok
Is she a blithering idiot , a liar , or informing us that now McCain has ditched his earlier positions on abortion ( and gays ) ?
You decide .
From The Atlantic ’s Ambinder :
Dr. James Dobson today asked Gov. Sarah Palin about her private conversations with Sen. McCain about the Republican platform ’s planks on life and marriage .
“ In your private conversations with Senator McCain is it your impression that he also strongly supports those views ?
I know that he did not oppose that platform when it was written .
Do you think he will implement it ? ”
Good question .
A lot of social conservatives worry about this .
Governor Palin responded : “ I do , from the bottom of my heart .
I am such a strong believer that McCain believes in those strong planks and we do have good conversations about some of the details too , about the different planks and what they represent . ”
The 2008 GOP platform is a bit more conservative than it was in 2004 .
If McCain is going to implement it – something of which Palin is convinced from the bottom of her heart – then that means that McCain will support a constitutional amendment to ban all abortion ( including those cases where the mother was raped or was the victim of incest ) , a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage , and he will oppose government - sponsored embryonic stem cell research .
Either Palin trying to mislead Dobson , equivocate , or perhaps he does n’t know what her running mate believes .
McCain opposes a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage … .
He supports embryonic stem cell research …he opposes a constitutional amendment banning all abortion .
Read the platform for yourself : On abortion … on gay marriage … on stem cells …
A day after the second presidential debate , both components of the Republican ticket for the executive sat down with Fox News ‘ Sean Hannity to discuss , among other things , energy policy .
In the interview , John Mccain said Sarah Palin was “ … probably one of the most foremost experts in this nation on energy issues . ”
Mccain elaborates :
“ She has been involved in these issues of energy in many unique ways , including being on the board that oversights the natural gas and oil resources and other resources in the state of Alaska .
And so I think that there ’s nobody more qualified to take on our mission of being energy independent ”

While Governor Palin may have some exposure to the politics and business of oil and gas in her home state of Alaska , I struggle with the notion on many levels .
If Palin is one of our foremost experts , what does that make people like like Amory Lovins and Daniel Kammen who have been studying energy all of their adult lives ?
What about the thousands of scientists at the twenty - plus energy laboratories in the U.S. like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado , the Idaho National Laboratory , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , or Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico ?
This is not particularly a new story .
McCain has been touting the Alaska Governor ’s experience on energy for the last two months .
In one interview , McCain of Palin , “ She knows more about energy than , uh , probably anyone in the United States of America . ”
Palin ’s knowledge about energy issues should not be accepted at face value because Senator McCain and GOP talking points say she is .
Palin ’s limited exposure to other types of energy ( yes , energy means more than petroleum products ) , her clumsy ramblings about energy , and the fact that she continues to stumble on what is supposedly her strong suit , brings me to the following conclusion about the question at hand :
Sarah Palin is not , in fact , one of the foremost experts in this nation on energy issues .
Congress Has 43,457,362 Reasons to Help Goldman Sachs Embattled firm and employees spent millions in donations and lobbying expenses .
September 26 , 2008  --
Not all their money has gone for mansions and Ferraris .
The embattled Goldman Sachs investment banking firm and its employees have spent more than $ 43 million dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to cultivate friends and buy influence in Washington , D.C. since 1989 , according to an ABC News analysis of campaign finance records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics .
As a group , Goldman Sachs bankers have been the country 's top political campaign contributors this year and have given $ 29.5 million in contributions since 1989 , according to the Center .
" They are almost in a class by themselves , " said Sheila Krumholz , the executive director for the Center for Responsive Politics .
" Their top executives are in a class that is way above the clout and name - dropping that most other American businesses can achieve , " says Krumholz .
The firm has been badly shaken by the financial crisis , with management seeking emergency infusions of cash .
The bailout legislation , proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , reportedly led financier Warren Buffett to put $ 5 billion into Goldman Sachs because he felt the government would act to solve the financial crisis .
In a statement , Buffet expressed confidence in Goldman Sachs .
" It has an unrivaled global franchise , " he said , " a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance . "
Though he did tell the Wall Street Journal that if the government fails to act that his investment in Goldman would " get killed , and so will all our other investments . "
Before becoming Treasury Secretary , Paulson was chairman of Goldman Sachs , earning over $ 140 million in compensation during his seven years as the firm 's top officer , according to company filings .
Upon taking office , Paulson divested himself of his 3.23 million Goldman shares , reportedly worth $ 485 million at the time , to comply with government ethics rules .
A spokesperson for the Treasury Department told ABC News that the department has a long history of bringing the expertise of Wall Street to the office of Secretary .
" The issues Treasury is working on right now involve financial institutions and the economy broadly .
It 's entirely appropriate for Secretary Paulson to engage in matters that impact the financial markets broadly , " said the spokesperson .
Goldman Sachs bankers are also the number one contributors to the Barack Obama presidential campaign , giving $ 691,930 to his campaign in this cycle , according to the records .
John McCain 's campaign has received substantially less from Goldman Sachs employees , $ 208,395 , although they are , as a group , his fourth largest contributor .
In the 2008 election cycle , Goldman Sachs bankers have come up with $ 4.8 million in contributions to federal candidates , according to the records .
72 per cent of Goldman 's money this year has gone to Democratic candidates and the national party , the majority party in Congress .
Employees of Goldman Sachs are listed as a top contributor to 55 separate members of Congress .
In addition to campaign contributions , Goldman Sachs has spent $ 13.8 million on lobbying expenses since 1998 , when Paulson became co-CEO .
" I think they 've found it 's a small price to pay relative to the profits they could reap if they controlled how Washington affects their industry , and their company specifically , " said Krumholz .
In addition to its connection to Paulson , Goldman Sachs has plenty of other former partners who have significant positions of power .
President Clinton 's Treasury Secretary , Bob Rubin worked there for 26 years , rising to co-chairman .
New Jersey Governor John Corzine was at Goldman for 24 years , serving as CEO and chairman for five years before running for the US Senate .
The current White House chief of staff , Josh Bolton , is the former executive director of Legal and Government Affairs for Goldman Sachs International in London .
A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said the firm does n't have ready access about their employees ' donations going back 20 years , but stated that " all Americans have the First Amendment right to participate in the public process , which includes campaign contributions . "
The spokesperson said that Goldman 's survival was no way tied to the proposed bailout , " Secretary Paulson 's plan is pivotal to the nation and its economy . "

Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is found in products in every area of our lives , from baby bottles to canned food linings .
From CDs to helmets .
Electronics to dental sealants .
It ’s not good for you .
Nalgene stopped using it .
Canada banned it .
California considered banning it , but did n’t .
BPA has been detected in over 90 % of Americans tested , and it is possibly linked to breast and prostate cancer .
This synthetic hormone may harm the reproductive system of humans .
The FDA has studied it and released a draft assessment declaring it safe .
A panel studying the FDA ’s draft assessment will soon make a pivotal decision as to whether BPA can continue to be used in contact with food .
The chair of the panel is Martin Philbert , who founded and directs the University of Michigan ’s Risk Science Center .
The Risk Science Center recently received a $ 5,000,000 donation ( 25 times its annual budget ) from Charles Gelman , a supporter of BPA , and critic of government regulation .
Gelman is a retired industrialist with his own page on SourceWatch .
He donates to organizations like the Cato Institute and the Mackinac Center for Policy Research .
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the connection between Charles Gelman and Martin Philbert , offering this beauty of a quote :
“ Donor Charles Gelman , once labeled the second worst polluter in Michigan by the state ’s Department of Natural Resources , said in an interview that he considered the chemical , which is used to make baby bottles and aluminum can liners , to be safe .
Worries about health problems that may be caused by the chemical are exaggerated by “ mothers ’ groups and others who do n’t know the science , ” Gelman said . ”
The FDA did n’t consider it a conflict of interest for Philbert , so $ 5 million must be the fee for approving the safety of a chemical in America .
They say they are looking into it …
Yeah , right .

White Balance - Are you RGB Savvy ? by Moose Peterson , exclusive to nikondigital.org Photography is all about light !
One of the major characteristics of light we depend on in photography to communicate is color , be it one band or its entire spectrum .
In conventional film capture , while most photographers are aware of this basic fact , most take for granted the color temp of the light falling on their subject and how their film might react to and render it .
But more to the point , honest , exact , faithful color rendition has never been a real major point of contention for most conventional photographers .
When digital still photography came along for the masses , the attitudes about color temp from conventional photography carried over to digital even though the major characteristic of light we still depend on to communicate is still color .
But being unaware of color temp and white balance , both that of the light falling on the subject and the setting in which you 've set the camera , can no longer be taken for granted !
While exact color rendition might not still be the number one priority , getting real close probably is .
There is definitely two camps when it comes to how to achieve the correct white balance in digital photography .
The first camp is getting it right right when you take the photo and the second is fixing the color balance after the fact in the computer .
As you might as well have guessed , I 'm in the first camp , I demand of myself that I get it right right from the start ( I 'm still from the old school definition of what is a photographer ) .
I do n't have the luxury of time to mess with images in post - production .
But is it possible to get it right right from the start with current digital camera technology ?
If you 're shooting with the Canon 1D , you bet !
You can dial in exactly the white balance you want for the color temp of the light falling on the subject .
You can do this in increments of 100 k which is really nice !
If you 're shooting with the D1 family of cameras ( including the D100 ) you do n't have this option of dialing in an exact white balance number .
Instead we 're stuck with the preassigned numbers the silly little icons offer us ( leftover conventions of video cameras ) .
But you might be surprised by what you can do and how close you can come to perfection with some simplistic understanding ( which is the only way I can operate ) and application of what is available to us .
The Numbers Here 's a brief primer on color temp ( to learn more , head to http://www.schorsch.com/kbase/glossary/color_temperature.html for the abridged version or http://cybaea.com/photo/color-correction.html for a whole lot more ) .
Daylight , light falling on the Washington Mall on clear , fine beautiful day on the 4th of July was rated at 5500 k .
This has been our bench mark for daylight Kelvin temp ever since ( your conventional film has this color temp rating ) .
It 's from this number in which our conventional film was based that everything we do with digital has been based ( not the best of systems ) .
Here 's the same basic information but in a chart which has film type , color correction filters and color temp .
This chart is for conventional film , but you can use it for digital to get a feel for color temp / white balance if you do n't know numbers already .
The way to use the chart is to use a ruler to " draw " a line from film type ( WB setting ) to color temp and where it crosses the middle graph indicated the filtration required to match the WB & CB .
" A man 's got to know his limitations " and while I believe this , I do n't think Dirty Harry was referring to white balance in the D1 Family when he said it .
To start understanding what we have to work with , here 's the Kelvin Temperature range we have available to us in the D1 / X / H : A ( Auto White Balance ) : automatically adjusts the white balance between 4,200 and 7,000 k .
Incandescent :
The color temperature of this setting is basically fixed at 3,000k .
Fluorescent :
The setting is fixed at approximately 4,200k .
Direct Sun : Color temperature is fixed at approximately 5,200k ( even though basic sunlight is 5,500k ) .
Flash :
Its color temperature is set at approximately 5,400 k ( even though flash is 5,500k ) .
Cloudy :
This setting is obviously for overcast light .
Its color temperature is set at approximately 6,000 K .
Shade :
The color temperature is set at approximately 7,000 k in the D1 and 8,000 k in the X/H .
( Why are all of these numbers approx .?
That 's the nature of the beast since white balance is not determined by an actual color temperature meter but rather from information from R G B sensors that is then run through a whole lot of numbers and equations predetermined by Nikon engineers . )
You can fine tune these numbers and either increase or decrease them depending on your needs .
With the D1 you can make fine adjustments to these preset numbers ( depress the WB button and rotate the sub - command dial to access ) in these increments .
* starting White Balance And for the D1X/ H ( depress the WB button and rotate the sub- command dial to access or through the menu system ) you have these options which are slightly different from the D1 .
* starting
White balance ( this information supercedes my info in The D1 Generation ) So OK , you have all these numbers , what do you do with them ?
( And please note the numbers are different for the D1 vs X/H especially for Shade & Fluorescent . )
The goal in our everyday digital photography is to match to the best of our ability the color temp of the light falling on the subject with the white balance settings of our camera ( or if being creative , not matching them to taste ) .
But here lies the challenge because most photographers do n't know the color temp of the light falling on their subject let alone able to match that with the rigid white balance settings we have available in the D1 family .
I 'll tell you what I do , I simply shoot 99 % of the time at Cloudy - 3 and move on .
But I have the sinking feeling that for many of you , that 's not good enough so I 'll continue ( but you will more than likely come back to this setting yourself ) !
The first response many have to my shooting at Cloudy - 3 when the sun is shinning is , " Cloudy when I can see the sun ? "
Many look for logic in the words , Cloudy - Sun , instead of looking at the color temp / white balance numbers .
Cloudy is 6000 k and depending on the camera you 're shooting with , Cloudy - 3 is either 6580 k or 6600 k .
While basic sunlight might be rated 5500 k , finding this number in the real world does n't happen very often ( smog , time of day , some degree of clouds and the real biggie , reflected color of objects around the subject alter the actual CT ) .
The color temperature most often found on your basic day is closer to 7000 k .
Our closest setting then to this 7000 k mark is Cloudy - 3 . ( I 've experimented on the X/H with Shade +2 but I 've found I do n't like the outcome a good 50 % of the time . )
It is very important to understand that we are communicators and that we are human .
Humans are into color , it pushes a lot of our buttons !
This combination demands we use color either accurately or artistically ( which can be one in the same or not ) in our images .
We first must recognize and acknowledge what is our subject and the subject 's natural color .
We then must recognize the color temp of the light falling on our subject , and then use the numbers available to us in our camera to capture the most accurate white balance .
( Keep in mind that you might have to be doing this in a split second if photographing action and you have n't already established your own preferred setting , you could miss the shot ) .
This is the most simplistic approach and application of white balance and is the bases of my workflow .
Many have asked about the effectiveness of carrying around a color temperature meter to take some of the guess work out of this equation .
I used a color temp meter for years long ago in my commercial days and got very good at using it , knowing how to prevent my clothes for example from biasing the reading , etc .
I grabbed one again when I first received my D1 in my initial attempt to get a handle on the D1's WB .
But because we have such a limited range of WB settings to work with in the D1 Family , knowing I was shooting at 9800 k did no practical good .
In getting it right right from the start , some of this is " flying by the sit of your pants " photography .
Keep in mind I always work on the KISS theorem , I strive to eliminate as many " problems " so my concentration remains on the subject !
But what about Auto , should n't that setting with it 's variable range work better , make our life and photographs better ?
I 'm here to tell you , Auto WB is the last option you should use !
When I hear digital shooters tell me they have their cameras set to Auto WB , I know they have n't done their homework and are causing themselves ultimately more work ( I 'm amazed how many NEF shooters shoot on Auto WB and then wonder what 's wrong with the color of their previews .
All of that info and the wrong WB ) !
I 've yet to shoot with any digital SLR , Kodak , Canon or Nikon that had a Auto White Balance that delivered what I desired let alone close to what the subject required .
Why ?
In a nutshell , keep in mind that our CCD 's captures B&W with color being added on the image 's path to the Compact Flash card .
To really over simplify the problem , in that path , something gets lost in the translation .
Because of the genius of my partner , we now can actually see the white balance the D1 Family is setting when the camera is set to Auto .
The two images that follow of a Red- shouldered Hawk were captured with the camera set to Auto - 3 .
You can see visually the vast difference in the color balance between the two images .
This despite the fact that the images were taken within microseconds of each other .
The image on the left , Digital Pro reports the camera set the white balance to 4589 k and the image on the right at 5477 k ( you will only find out this info by using Digital Pro ) .
It looks as if the sun came out in the image on the right when in reality , the white balance just got closer to the correct color temp .
( Do n't confuse this with the problem with Tone in the X / H. )
This is a common problem with Auto WB and a visual demonstration why that 's the worst WB setting you can select !
I realize that goes in the face of common logic and what I said when I first started to shoot with the D1 three years ago .
But the proof is in the pudding .
4598 k 5477 k So .
I come back to what I said in the beginning , Cloudy - 3 comes the closest to our everyday shooting color temp / white balance needs .
You can mess around with other settings but in the end , to get it right right from the start , this is our best option right now .
How can you learn color temperatures ?
That 's a darn good question now is n't it .
The answer is of course you can , but do you really need to ?
Color temperature of light is pretty predictable within a certain range of error .
That 's to say that we know that on a basic sunny day , the color temp can be within the range of 5500 - 7000 k .
So see , you can learn color temperature , there 's your first lesson .
The real question is , is it important to know specifically within that range the exact color temp to be able to match it with a D1 family setting ?
Heck no !
Even if you had a color meter and could work it to get an accurate reading , looking at the tables above , you can see our inability to match a reading to a setting exactly .
So your ability to be able to exactly know color temp might not really get you that much farther down the road .
But we 're talking your basic sunny day , that 's really cheating as that 's the easiest .
What about outside that range ?
Most white balance problems for photographers come from color temps when there is no visible sun .
Sunrises and sunsets , cloudy and overcast days and altitude are times when the color temp can spike in either direction of our baseline 5500 K .
The first light of sunrise might be in the 2000 k range where light right outside my door at 8200 feet elevation I have measured at 18000k !
Here 's a simple chart of round numbers coinciding with light sources .
Color Temp Light Source ( in the roughest sense ) Color Temp Light Source ( in the roughest sense ) 1000 k Candles , some flashlights 2000 k Pre-sunrise 2500 k Household bulb , used 3000 k Household bulb , new / some studio lights 3000 - 4000 k Sunrise / sunset ( without the influence of heavy smog / smoke ) 4000 - 5000 k Fluorescent bulbs , cool white - " daylight " balances 5000 - 5500 k Electronic Flash , portable ( new bulb ) 5500 - 6000 k Studio Electronic Flash ( new bulb ) 6000 - 7000 k
Sunlight , bright day 7000 - 8000 k " slight " overcast skies at lower elevations 8000 - 9000 k
Heavy overcast / slight shade 9000 - 11000 k
Rain at lower elevations / clear day at higher elevations ( above 8000 feet ) 11000 - 18000k
Overcast to snowy days at higher elevations ( above 8000 feet )
These numbers are based on my own years of running around with a color temp meter learning color temps for my own photography
These numbers are based on my own years of running around with a color temp meter learning color temps for my own photography Now as I see it you have really one of two options .
You can take the easy way out ( I highly recommend it ) and simply learn the generalities of color temperature by knowing the info I 've gathered in the chart above or you do what I did to compile the chart , that 's spend time and money with a color temperature meter .
Why did I run around for years with a Minolta Color Meter to compile this trivia in the first place ?
When I did commercial work , I would often have to gel the strobes so they would match the color temp of the ambient light so the use of the strobes would not be apparent .
I do n't do that work any longer thank goodness !
Many ask , " ca n't I just learn from what the LCD monitor displays ? "
The last reference for color temp / WB you should use is the preview monitor on the back of any digital camera !
Their accuracy leaves much to be desired .
Can you then trust your computer monitor to display the correct WB of your digital images ?
Man ..is that a loaded question and one I 'm not going to get into .
I know I can trust my monitors but that 's not a blanket endorsement that everyone should trust theirs without some homework at the very least .
Then what about making prints to learn what is and is n't correct WB ?
That 's just as bad as the monitor question for evaluating correct WB .
May be in the future David can write a piece on these two topics but for right now , I 'm not touching them other than to say , they 're not your best options !
81A It 's a well known fact that I use an 81a filter ( Nikon A2 ) on all of my lenses all of the time .
I did this always with conventional film but many wonder if I do it with digital ?
It has n't changed , I still use and 81a filter all of the time on all of my lenses .
But does n't digital " see " this color correction filter and " filter " it out so it has no effect ?
When you first come into digital photography , this logic makes perfect sense but that 's not how it works , thank goodness !
You can do the test for yourself , but if you shoot one image with and one image without an 81a filter attached , you will see the 81a image being " warmed " up .
That 's the purpose of the 81A filter , to " warm " up the scene or remove blue from the spectrum of light .
In rough terms , when shooting in 5500 - 6000 k light , the 81a filter is equal to adding about 800 - 1000 k rating to your film .
In other words , the color correction abilities of the 81a permit a 5500 k WB to properly record a color temp around 6500 k .
This is the technical reason why I use the 81a filter , always have and always will ( until I can dial it into my digital camera ) .
But there is an even more important reason why I use the 81a filter .
The Psychology of Color ( www.moose395.net/howto/color.html) is something that was pounded into my head long ago back in the days of fashion and advertising photography .
While I 'm not in that spectrum of photography anymore , I am still selling something with my images .
I 'm trying to get folks involved with their wild heritage , I 'm selling them on its worth and why it should be protected .
The 81a filter permits me to grab folks heartstrings on the most basic of levels .
Read the article on The Psychology of Color , it might influence your use of color !
Where does flash come in ?
This is really a darn good question that with the D1 , many including myself did n't want to consider .
Since the D1 made flash such a pain to use , using the flash 's constant 5500 k ( the flash 's bulb temp when brand new , it slowly changes color temp with time ) to " clean up " color was n't really a fun option .
With the improvement of flash with the D1X & D1 H the option of flash to clean up colors is back again .
What do I mean when I say " clean up " colors ?
This comes back to conventional film theory which can be applied to digital .
The best way to explain it is to explain how I use it for my photography .
When a butterfly thought to be extinct was rediscovered , I was there to photograph it .
The male butterfly is a very specific blue which I needed to accurately record .
The butterfly that was rediscovered lives in Los Angeles where the smog can radically change the color temp from day to day .
This color temp change made it impossible to accurately record the blue of the butterfly .
To accomplish the job , flash fill was used with its constant 5500 k being the light source " cleaning up " the ambient light color temp .
This constant color temp permitted me to accurately , frame after frame after frame , record the blue of the butterfly .
This same thing can be applied to digital , but the question arises , do you set your camera WB to Sunny , Cloudy or Flash for the utmost accuracy ?
After all of my testing and David 's number crunching , there is n't one setting that is going to give you anymore accurate color clean up over the other .
I still use Cloudy - 3 when doing flash fill outdoors and find those results to be the best for my needs .
Color Temperature / White Balance
This is by no means the last word on white balance !
This is at best a starting point which in time will change .
It will change in time because of your own requirements and how they might change and how you might solve them .
It will change in time as technology comes along to improve and change things .
I personally do n't think there is one perfect answer at this time for white balance and color temp .
I do think though you can easily create the images you want to create with the correct white balance you require .
I know you can do this with the information I 've provided here and a little thought on your part .
Go out with this information and paint the world red !
David adds -- In addition to Moose 's empirical results , there are two good scientific reasons to consider using an 81A on a digital camera if you want warmer images .
First , the 81A is applied before the image is captured , not after .
That means that you are using the 12 - bits of your camera 's exposure in a more effective way than by having the white balance conversion change the sensor values any more than they have to after the light has hit the sensor .
Second , the D1X and D1H are least sensitive to Red .
So the Red channel needs all the help it can get .
If we ask the camera to ' multiply ' the red values by too much then we 're adding noise we do n't need to -- and can prevent by proper filtering before the shot .
Oct. 8 , 2008  --
The following is an excerpted transcript of ABC News ' Charles Gibson 's exclusive interview with Sen. Barack Obama on the second presidential debate , the economy and other issues important to voters , for " World News With Charles Gibson " in Indianapolis on Oct. 8 , 2008 .
GIBSON : Senator , we 're undergoing a global market meltdown , and we -- the basic firmament on which our economy is based has undergone a seismic shock for the last few days and yet last night , you guys had a debate about spending and tax policy and earmarks that you could have had three months ago .
That 's frustrating to people .
OBAMA : It was .
It was frustrating to me .
Part of it's the format .
Look , you 've got two minutes to respond to a financial crisis .
And so , you know , if we had had more time , I think we could have had a better debate about what 's happening right now .
I do think that we do n't have the regulatory infrastructure , either domestically or globally , to deal with global capital markets .
We have a 20th century system , and we 've got a 21st century market .
So there are going to be a couple of things that we 're going to have to do .
First of all , I was glad to see that we finally had some coordination between what the United States was doing , European countries , other central banks were doing .
Because of the way capital now flows , there 's got to be better coordination .
Number two , I was glad to see that Secretary Bernanke has decided to -- or that Chairman Bernanke has decided to go ahead and try to boost up the commercial paper markets .
The average person may not , you know , think about commercial paper as underpinning the economy , but if major companies can't get , you know , short - term loans to make payroll or buy inventory , then you could see bankruptcy of huge companies all across the country .
So those are some sort - term measures , but long term , we 're going to have to revamp how our regulatory system works and then we 're going to have to get fundamentals of the economy in ways that we just have n't taken care of for the last eight years .
GIBSON : But we have to deal with the tools that we have now with this .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : We 've talked to a lot of people as we 've traveled around the Midwest .
One woman in Dayton said to me , if either one of these guys could tell me succinctly , simply , how they 're going to get us out of this mess , that guy would win .
It 's still to be won .
And she said neither has , and it seems as if neither can .
OBAMA : Well , I -- you know , let me tell you .
I can give you a succinct summary of what I intend to do .
And I think that it will get us out of trouble , but it 's going to take some time .
Number one , we 've got to make sure that this rescue plan works the way it 's supposed to work ; which means strong oversight .
It means that the secretary of the treasury is treating the taxpayer money that we 're putting up like we are investors so that , you know , when we buy up assets , we 're making sure that we 're going to be in a position to sell them back later and get our money back , that we are thinking about homeowners not just about Wall Street banks in terms of needing help .
And then what we 've got to do is to deal with a fundamental imbalance in our economy .
Part of the problem here is that the average person has seen their wages and their incomes going down .
And they were relying on the hope that their home prices would continually go up .
So that was the asset that was going to help fund college , help fund retirement .
And that was unrealistic .
So we 've got to go back to basics , which is if you 're going to be able to send your kids to college or retire , you 've got to be earning enough money to save .
And that 's why it 's so important that we get people back to work .
That 's why it 's so important that we develop an energy strategy that works .
That 's why we 've got to fix our health care system because that 's the real looming nightmare out there when it comes to our budget deficits and our national debt .
And that 's why we 've got to have an education system that works .
So those four fundamentals , those are going to be the lynchpins of our long - term economic growth .
In the short term , what we 're going to have to do is make sure that our financial institutions are regulated sufficiently , that we do n't end up seeing these enormous risks , huge mountains of debt that are used to speculate , essentially , at trillion dollar levels and that put the entire economy , not just domestically but globally , at risk .
GIBSON : Somebody else said to us where 's the passion in these guys .
Where 's the anger ?
People that lost trillions of dollars in their stock accounts , in their pension plans , in their 401 ( k ) s .
You said out there at this rally fear and panic cannot pervade us .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : And yet fear does right now .
And people look to leaders to turn that around or to counter that .
OBAMA : Well , I think that , you know , one of the reasons that we are doing well right now in the campaign -- and we 've still got four weeks , which is eternity in politics -- I think the people looked at my approach over the last three or four weeks during this economic crisis , which was consistent , which set out very clear principles from the first day , principles , by the way , that ended up being adopted by Secretary Paulson and were embedded in this rescue plan , that they saw I was n't trying to play politics with the issue , that , you know , a measured , calm , steady response to the crisis but one that recognizes that it 's outrageous we 're in this position to begin with and that we 've got to make sure that whatever we do is working for ordinary people .
I think that has all helped .
I mean -- and , frankly , you know , Senator McCain ended up lurching from place to place on this issue .
And that , I think , is not the kind of leadership that we 're going to need if we 're going to be able to guide the economy out of this perilous position .
GIBSON : You also said at this rally we need new direction , we need new leadership in Washington .
What would you be doing right now that 's any different than what the Bush Administration has done and is doing ?
OBAMA : Well , I 'll tell you what .
I do think that the administration is hampered by the fact that people do n't have a lot the confidence in the president .
I mean , if you think about previous crises -- you know , FDR .
There were a whole bunch of programs that he tried that did n't work .
But what he was able to provide to people was a sense that somebody 's in charge and we 're going to get through this .
And -- and that is as important as anything .
And the fact that , if you 've seen President Bush come out of the Rose Garden for two minutes at a time and , you know , not give a clear sense of what is taking place , describing this -- describing this rescue package as -- seeing it described as a bailout where the average person still thinks that what 's happening is $ 700 billion is going out the door , and we 're never going to see it again , and it 's going to a bunch of Wall Street types .
You know ...
GIBSON : That 's puts you in a position -- that puts you in a position of essentially saying trust me .
I 'm a 47 - year - old guy with one term in the Senate .
OBAMA : Yeah .
GIBSON : You got to put your faith in me .
OBAMA : Well , of course .
Look , if I was n't -- if I did n't have confidence in the ability to lead the country , I would n't be running for president .
But it 's not simply trust me .
What I 'm saying to the American people is trust in us .
Trust in ourselves .
Trust in our innovation , the talent of our workers .
Trust in our ability to be pragmatic and think these problems through and solve them .
I mean , the truth is that very rarely when we have a crisis like this do we just have a blueprint solution that pops out and everything runs smoothly .
That 's not how things work .
One of the great gifts of America is we 're practical people so we try things .
If they do n't work , then we try something else .
And we fidget with this and we tinker with that .
But we maintain confidence in our core institutions , our core values , and we remain confident in the American people .
And that 's the job of the president to organize the -- the best people out there to rally the country , to give them a sense of direction and vision and say , you know what , we 're going to keep on trying a bunch of stuff until something works .
GIBSON : But we -- we passed the $ 700 billion rescue package .
The market went down .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : The Fed said we 'll be the primary lenders to bank and to businesses .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : Market tanked .
We now have a worldwide rate cut to try to increase liquidity .
The market is yawning at that today .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : It almost -- and the credit markets remain frozen .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : It almost seems as if rationality is out the window .
OBAMA : Well , look , in the same way that I think Greenspan , the former Fed chairman , talked about irrational exuberance , we now have irrational despair .
You know , trust is broken down in our financial institutions .
Banks are afraid to lend to each other .
They 're afraid to lend to companies that have great balance sheets and have done everything right .
And that 's , again , why it 's so important for the president to be able to restore a sense of confidence and to help change the mindset of -- of traders , the markets .
Now , what makes it more complicated is we now have a global economy .
And that 's why it 's going to be so important for the next president to show global leadership .
One of the things that I will do as president is to gather together the G - 20 .
You know , we have this G - 7 that is an organization of what used to be the biggest economies .
But it does n't include China .
It does n't include India .
It does n't include huge markets .
And what we need to do is gather them together and say , you know what , we need a set of institutions that can help coordinate interest rates , can help coordinate some of these other issues so that we do n't have these global crises that spiral out of control and no single government ends up being able to stem the tide that 's coming out .
GIBSON : One woman last night stood up and asked you at the debate why should we trust either one of you with our money .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : Which was an interesting question .
It bespoke a sort of lack of faith in any kind of institution , a systemic breakdown that is indicative of fear .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : How do you counter that ?
OBAMA : You know , you have to deliver .
And so I 'm not sure that you 're going to be able to entirely counter that prior to the election .
I think people are right to be cynical .
Look , we -- we just went through eight years in which the economy was growing .
People were working hard , remember .
American worker productivity had never been higher and yet people 's wages and incomes had gone down .
We have a half trillion dollar deficit , and we 've added several trillion dollars to the national debt .
I think it 's not surprising that people say , OK , I 'm working maybe two jobs .
I 'm not seeing my kids enough .
I have n't bought a new car or gone out to dinner in several years .
And yet I still do n't have anything to save .
I still am seeing my paycheck buy less and less .
I still can't heat my home in the winter the way I need to .
And so what we 're going to have to do , I think , is to -- the next president is going to have to be straight with the American people and say , we 've got some big challenges .
It 's not going to be easy .
We 're not going to dig ourselves out of this situation overnight .
But if we make a series of smart steps , if we 're willing to prioritize , if we 're willing to stop doing things that we do n't need to do and just focus on the things that we have to do in order to get this economy right -- and that includes making some tough budgets choices -- then I have no doubt that America 's going to be strong once again .
But it 's going to require that kind of honesty with the American people and the ability to inspire the American people to remind them of what is great about this country .
And that 's something that we have n't heard a lot over the last several years .
GIBSON : The kids at Bowling Green , I watched the debate with them last night .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : And other kids that we talked to during the day .
They said they 're not talking about our issues .
OBAMA : Student loans .
GIBSON : Right .
They 're not -- they do n't believe the money 's going to be there to pay for their loans to get them through four years of college .
And then on top of that , I said to them , well , if you do n't have any faith in that , how many of you believe Social Security will be there when you get to be 65 .
Twenty - one kids , three held up their hand .
OBAMA : Yes .
GIBSON : That , again , is a -- is a great doubt of faith in the system .
OBAMA : Although here 's what I 'll say .
I mean , first of all , we 've been talking about student loans probably every day during course of this campaign .
I mean , I 've got a very specific plan to make sure that students are able to afford to go to college in exchange for community service or military service .
So we are going to make sure that every young person in America can go to college .
They have a right to be worried about social security and Medicare because those entitlement program are going to be running out of money unless we make some fundamental changes .
And those are going to be tough choices .
You know , I have offered what I think is the best approach on Social Security , for example , which is raising the cap on the payroll tax , keeping the tax rate the same , but saying , you know , somebody like myself or Warren Buffet can afford to pay a little more in payroll tax to make sure the system is solvent .
Medicare is a whole different problem .
I mean , that is a big nightmare .
Our health care costs are escalating so quickly that we may not be able to do anything about it .
But one thing I 've got say , though , despite the expressions of concern and skepticism on the part of young people , I would n't be sitting here a month away from the election with a pretty good shot at getting elected president had it not been for the extraordinary idealism and hopefulness of young people .
We have seen an outpouring of involvement and passion on their part that I do n't think we 've seen in a generation .
And that makes me optimistic .
GIBSON : Change the subject for a moment .
John McCain has unloaded on you in the last 72 , 96 hours as has Sarah Palin .
McCain is saying , essentially , we do n't know who Barack Obama is , where he came from .
I 'm an open book , he 's not .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : Were you surprised , A , that he did n't bring it up last night at the debate and use that line of attack ?
And , B , since you must have prepared for it , what were you going to say ?
OBAMA : Well , I am surprised that , you know , we 've been seeing some pretty over - the - top attacks coming out of the McCain campaign over the last several days that he was n't willing to say it to my face .
But I guess we 've got one last debate .
So presumably , if he ends up feeling that -- that he needs to , he will raise it during the debate .
The notion that people do n't know who I am is a little hard to swallow .
I 've been running for president for the last two years .
I 've campaigned in 49 states .
Millions of people have heard me speak at length on every topic under the sun .
I 've been involved now in 25 debates , going on my 26th .
And I 've written two books which any -- everybody who reads them will say are about as honest a set of reflections by , at least , a politician as are out there .
So , you know , I think that , you know , Senator McCain 's campaign has been focusing on me primarily because they do n't want to focus on the economy .
And they 've said as much .
I mean , you 've had their spokespeople over the last couple of days say if we talk about the economic crisis , we lose .
I mean , you can't be much more blatant than that .
They want to change the subject .
And I understand it because the fact is that John McCain has subscribed , for the most part , to the same economic philosophy as George Bush , the same economic philosophy that has governed over the last eight years and has helped to get us in this mess .
GIBSON : And , finally , she 's come at you , Sarah Palin has come at you because of the Bill Ayers connection .
OBAMA : Right .
GIBSON : Are you going to have to address that again ?
How are you going to explain it ?
Have you had a continuing connection with it ?
And why did n't you just cut it off once and for all once when you knew ?
OBAMA : Why do n't we just clear it up right now .
I 'll repeat again what I 've said many times .
This is a guy who engaged in some despicable acts 40 years ago when I was eight years old .
By the time I met him , 10 or 15 years ago , he was a college professor of education at the University of Illinois .
And we served on a school reform board together , by the way , that was funded by Walter Annenberg , who had been an ambassador and close friend of Ronald Reagan .
And so I have talked to him about school reform issues .
And the notion that somehow he has been involved in my campaign , that he is an adviser of mine , that he -- I 've palled around with a terrorist , all these statements are made simply to try to score cheap political points .
And , you know , the idea that the McCain campaign would want to make this the centerpiece of the discussion in the closing weeks of a campaign where we are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we 're in the middle of two wars , I think makes very little sense not just to me but to the American people .
And if , you know , look , I can handle these attacks for the remaining four weeks , but it 's certainly not serving our democracy right now .
We need to be having a debate about how we 're going to yank ourselves out of a very difficult situation .
And that 's what I 'm going to spend my time talking about .
GIBSON : Senator , thanks .
OBAMA : Thank you , so much .
GIBSON : Appreciate talking to you .
OBAMA : Thank you .
Eric Boehlert thinks that might be the case :
The race is unrecognizable in terms of where the players are situated now and where they were five weeks ago .
( Between September 15 and October 19 , there was a 12 - point swing in the Gallup daily tracking poll . )
Now ask yourself :
What role has the Drudge Report played in that burst of campaign movement ?
The answer , of course , is zero .
Zilch .
Nada .
Nothing .
His trademark flashing red lights have gone missing .
The dynamics of the campaign have irrevocably changed , and the mighty Drudge Report , the news site Beltway journalists trip over themselves to genuflect in front of , has been a complete bystander in the closing weeks of the 2008 campaign . [..]
The reason is simple .
Because of the unprecedented economic turmoil , we 're now in serious times .
( Fifty thousand home foreclosures this year , in the state of New Jersey alone , is serious business . )
And the Drudge Report does n't do serious .
The American public 's attention has shifted from the campaign to the economy , and that 's why the Drudge Report remains largely irrelevant to that unfolding story .[.. ]
As long as those patterns hold , Drudge finds himself in no - man 's - land with no levers of power to pull .

Skyworks , the UK company behind Wainwright 's Walks and Railway Walks , has been commissioned to film the whole of China from the air .
In an exclusive deal with China Central Television , Skyworks - which has also worked with historian Simon Schama and on Robbie Coltrane 's ITV show B Road Britain - has been given access to fly across the country and capture it on camera .
The footage will be used in a 52 - part series that Skyworks has been commissioned to make for CCTV - China 's state broadcaster - called Flying Views of the World .
Footage of Europe from the air will feature in the first half of the CCTV series , while the other 26 30 - minute episodes will include aerial views covering the whole of China .
Flying Views of the World will be shown next year on three CCTV channels and a further 80 syndicated TV services across China .
The Skyworks managing director , Damian Keogh , said : " To be the first company ever to film the whole of China is a real achievement for Skyworks .
" With filming due to start in 2009 , we have already established interest from a number of sponsors , many of whom have business interests in China .
" This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to film the previously unfilmable , for the people of China and the rest of the world . "
The series will be filmed entirely from the air in high definition , using the latest technology and giving viewers a bird 's - eye view of different landscapes .

PHILADELPHIA  Shawn
Hebb may have one of America ’s toughest jobs : convincing people that Whole Foods Market can be an economical place to shop .
This week , leading five customers through a store here , he breezed past the triple cream goat cheese , $ 39.99 a pound , and the fresh tuna , $ 19.99 a pound , to focus on the merits of beans , chicken thighs and frozen fish .
Then he held up a $ 1.50 package of tofu .
“ It looks gross but it ’s delicious , ” he said .
Whole Foods Market is on a mission to revise its gold - plated image as consumers pull back on discretionary spending in a troubled economy .
The company was once a Wall Street darling , but its sales growth was cooling even before the economy turned .
Since peaking at the beginning of 2006 , its stock has dropped more than 70 percent .
Now , in a sign of the times , the company is offering deeper discounts , adding lower - priced store brands and emphasizing value in its advertising .
It is even inviting customers to show up for budget - focused store tours like those led by Mr. Hebb , a Whole Foods employee .
In advance of tomorrow ’s release of the Alaska legislature ’s report on the troopergate investigation , the McCain - Palin campaign has released its own investigative report clearing Palin of any wrongdoing .
' Fundamental agreement ' reached on bailout
Top congressional negotiators have announced that they have a " fundamental agreement " on a government bailout of the nation 's financial system , granting extraordinary powers to the secretary of Treasury to purchase hundreds of billions in bad debt while attempting to stem foreclosures for homeowners struggling on Main Street .
The announcement came in the Capitol after a three - hour meeting involving a dozen of the top negotiators from both parties and both chambers of Congress .
Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D - Conn . ) said , " We believe we are prepared to act expeditiously on a package ... and send a message to the markets . "
But Dodd cautioned that this is still a " set of principles " and not completed legislative language .
Quite often , the nitty - gritty details of bill language can slow the process .
Still , Dodd and other key negotiators seemed more confident Thursday afternoon than they have at any other point in the week long bailout negotiations .
The bill could reach the president 's desk in a few days , Dodd said .
House Republicans continue to warn that they have n't signed off on this deal , but the bailout ship may sail without them given the pace of legislative activity today .
Sen. Robert Bennett ( R - Utah ) , the top GOP negotiator in the Senate , said , " We have a plan that will pass the House , pass the Senate and be signed by the president , and bring certainty to the markets . "
Dodd said the agreement includes a crackdown on executive compensation , but it does not appear to have a bankruptcy provision , coveted by liberal Democrats , which would allow judges to restructure mortgages for people facing foreclosure .
A community of Farkers rally around a cause
When total strangers rally around a cause , it makes the whole idea of social media actually matter .
Recently , a man named Joe wrote a post titled " My son needs your help " in the forum section of Scout.com .
The post was a plea for this man 's son , who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer .
He is seeking to raise $ 100,000 .
The post said this :
" As many of you know my son has been diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer .
This is something that has devastated and displaced my family ( my wife and I have 3 kids ) .
We were supposed to go to New York City for a treatment that would help him .
But we hit a snag .
Our insurance will not pay for the treatment and the hospital will not take us now since the insurance will not pay for it .
The cost of the treatment is $ 100,000 .
This is something that is far beyond what I or my family can afford .
But I will do anything to get my son the treatment he so desperately needs .
This treatment has shown promise and can extend my son's life .
So my wife and I are asking you for help .
Our goal is to get 100,000 people to donate at least a dollar .
That will help us get our son the treatment that he needs . "
Being a skeptic , I have a difficult time believing in the veracity of such posts .
But the post was linked to Fark.com , a news aggregation site , with a tight - knit group of editors who keep a watchful eye on what 's posted among the thousands of submissions they receive each day .
Joe 's piece was linked to on Fark , with the headline " Farker Joe8122 's son needs your help . "
It was linked to on Tuesday , and by the end of the day , there were already more than 1200 comments on Fark .
The replies ranged from " You got my 5 bux , " to " " $ 5 on the way , " to " I 'm in for 5 , " to " Why traveling to NY ?
Of the top Children 's Hospitals , none of them are in NY " to " What kind of treatment is this ? " to " I 'll pray for you . "
Reading these comments reminded me of the recent spate of emails my family and extended family and I have had .
In these emails , we discussed my father 's health .
He 's just had a kidney transplant in the Philippines .
It was successful , thank God .
It was nice to see the family -- our community -- rally around him .
In Joe 's case , it 's the Farkers rallying to support one of their own .
To be able to write a story and have it shared among people who care , is a nice use of social media .
To be able to reach out to complete strangers who share , not blood , but a mere common interest in news or information , and receive their contribution and prayers , gives meaning to this whole notion of social media .
At the time of this writing , Joe 's raised nearly $ 20,000 .

UPDATED : Paper Now Says Problem ' Resolved ' , But It Is n't ...
John Gideon Byon
10/22/2008 , 1:48 pm PT
Guest Blogged by John Gideon of VotersUnite.org
According to today 's Island Packet voters on Hilton Head Island ( Beaufort County ) , South Carolina discovered that some races were missing on the final review screen of the ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting machines , at the end of the voting process , after voters completed their selections ...
She [ voter Nancy Roe ] said she clicked on all her choices --- including two candidates for Bluffton Town Council .
But when she reviewed her selections before actually casting the ballot , she noticed that her two picks for the Bluffton Town Council did not register .
Her husband had the same problem .
With the assistance of a Hilton Head employee , the two attempted to re-cast their ballots .
Again , it did n't work .
They resolved the problem by casting paper ballots for the council race , Nancy Roe said .
" I 'm real political , so I checked the ballot , " she said .
" If I had only given it a quick glance and punched ' vote , ' I never would 've known . "
During the South Carolina primary , as The BRAD BLOG reported at the time , ES&S iVotronics in at least one county failed to work at all , leading to voters scrambling to cast votes on scraps of paper , and even paper towels !
Here we have another instance of South Carolina election officials failing to do required pre-election testing .
These instances should never happen but they are happening all too often in this state that relies heavily on their failed voting system vendor .
Last week , the same ES&S iVotronic touch - screens were reported to have been flipping votes in two WV counties , and yesterday , in one TN county .
We 'll have another report , on votes flipping on ES&S iVotronics in yet another TN county today shortly .
[ Update : That story now here ...]
In August of 2007 --- in time to actually do something about it --- HDNet ran a scathing investigative exposé ( video here ) on the very same ES&S iVotronics , the terrible quality - control practices in use at their sweatshop in The Philippines and the tendency of the machines to break down and flip votes .
The report was almost entirely ignored by the entirety of the rest of the media .
It 's time to get these machines the hell out of service .
UPDATE : 10/23/08 , 12:25 pm PT : South Carolina 's Island Packet says the problem is now " resolved " .
But it is n't .
The paper explains this way :
Obama , for example --- and that candidate 's name appears on the final review screen .
In most races , voters pick a single candidate --- John McCain or BarackObama , for example --- and that candidate 's name appears on the final review screen .
However , in the races for Bluffton Town and Beaufort City councils , voters can choose up to two candidates .
In those cases , the machine shows voters only that they 've picked the correct number of candidates
without showing the candidates ' names , according to Eric Montgomery , a county election equipment specialist .
So on the ES&S iVotronic the review screen does not show the names of the voters selections when the race is a " choose two " or more .
It only tells the voter that they chose two candidates ( for instance ) .
The Help American Vote Act of 2002 , however , requires that the voter be able to review and verify their selections .
Not a number , but their selections :
Section 301 :
( a) Requirements .
-- Each voting system used in an election for Federal office shall meet the following requirements : ( a) Requirements .
-- Each voting system used in an election for Federal office shall meet the following requirements : ( 1 ) In general .-- ( A ) Except as provided in subparagraph ( B ) , the voting system ( including any lever voting system , optical scanning voting system , or direct recording electronic system ) shall -- ( i ) permit the voter to verify ( in a private and independent manner ) the votes selected by the voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted ;
( ii ) provide the voter with the opportunity ( in a private and independent manner ) to change the ballot or correct any error before the ballot is cast and counted ( including the opportunity to correct the error through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error ) ;

But is it all roses ?
Below the fold are a few thoughts and calculations that show how this is truly a green energy source .
Green as in immature , that is .
The basics on Pelamis and the Aguçadoura I Project can be found here .
Celebration
Two and a half years behind schedule , after legal and technical delays and the sale of the main commercial company ( Enersis ) to Babcock & Brown , the first pelamis was finally permanently deployed .
A high profile event was staged to signal the day , with the Minister of Economy ( Manuel Pinho ) and an entourage of CEOs and journalists embarking on the Portuguese Navy frigate Corte Real to follow the tug boat trailing the red serpent to its final resting place , 5 Km off the coast , by the village of Aguçadoura .
The pelamis units spent much of the last two years in the port of Peniche waiting for this day .
After legal clearance the company struggled with technical difficulties , especially concerning the undersea cable that connects the mini -farm to the shore .
The Pelamis engineers developed a floating plug that allows the connection to the cable without the help of divers .
But unfortunately the system had been tested in shallow waters and failed in the deployment site , where a deeper water column exerted different hydrostatic pressure on the plug .
Solving this issue alone took more than a year .
After a few rehearsals at sea and some tuning of the units for better adaptation to the site , the green light was given .
The first serpent is in place with the next two being deployed these days , depending on the weather .
Manuel Pinho compared the event to the dawn of Wind Energy , that fifteen years turned is a story of success .
He hoped that the same can be said about Wave Energy fifteen years from now :
The future of wave energy starts today .
Finland is very good in mobile phones , Portugal wants to be good in renewable energy .
We are among the top five in the world , and we are just in the beginning of the process .
Renewable energy is the source of energy for the future and we think this can create an industrial revolution and a lot of opportunities for jobs and research and we want to be ahead of the curve .
The read serpent being put in place .

The Cluster
A new agreement was signed at the occasion with Pelamis Wave Power ( the technological partner ) having a 23 % stake , Babcock & Brown 46.2 % , EDP 15.4 % and Efaced 15.4 % .
This new consortium will proceed with the Aguçadoura II project , that will be a larger scale farm , constituted by 25 pelamis units , summing up 18.75 MW of installed capacity .
The press is quoting the project as costing up to 70 million €.
But these companies have longer term horizons ; Leocádio Costa , Enersis ' CEO :
What 's programmed in the second phase is for 40 % of the project being built nationally by Efacec , which is our largest producer of transformers , and with which makes all the sense he had talked to for the set up of a Cluster .
The Government providing us the licences , we are ready to go up to 500 MW in three or four different zones [ along the Portuguese coast ] .
Alberto Barbosa , Efacec 's CEO :
Through the years we will grow in Portugal and increase installed capacity , but afterwards we can proceed with that technological development at world level .
Portugal can be the Denmark of wave energy .
The question is the political will to concede that installed capacity .
This Cluster in the prospects of these companies is an inception environment that would propitiate wave energy technology development , promote local component manufacturing and assembly , eventually creating an exporting industry .
Talks are under way with steel transforming companies to join the project and new experiments with alternative wave technologies are being planned .
Pelamis Wave Energy will deploy the first water snakes ( four in total ) in their Scottish home shores next year off Orkney .
Following that , seven are planned for deployment off the northern Cornwall in 2010 .
Other sites are being considered in Spain , France , Norway , North America and even South Africa .
Click to watch a movie summarizing the concepts behind Pelamis .
The Algebra
Now , let 's go back to the black board and do a little algebra .
Last time I showed some concerns towards this project given the money involved for such a small installed capacity ( the three pelamis together do n't sum up to a state of the art wind turbine ) .
With the delays the project 's costs are now reaching 9 million € .
Using a base load factor of 30 % , the three pelamis of the Aguçadoura I project will generate in a year about 5.9 GWh ( 2.25 MW * 8760 h * 0.3 ) .
In my monthly electricity bill the kWh is rated at 0.12 € ( that accounts also for grid maintenance and management , but let 's take it at face value as an upper end estimate ) .
Hence the yearly revenue of the project will be just under 700 thousand € .
Or putting it another way , it will take 13 years for the break even , at best .
Each pelamis unit has an expected lifetime of 15 years .
Considering that those 9 million € are not counting with maintenance costs , it is not a stretch to conclude that the financial return on investment ( ROI ) is close to 1:1 .
Where that leaves EROEI is not easy to envision , but it might not be that far off .
This could be a scalability problem , being the Aguçadoura I just a mini-farm , taking much of the burden of first time tuning to the site .
But the press already has the figures for Aguçadoura II , 25 serpents ( down from the announced 34 in 2006 ) and a 70 million € budget .
This project will generated circa 49 GWh ( 18.75 MW * 8760 h * 0.3 ) of electricity per year resulting in a revenue of 5.8 million €.
Break even arrives at 12 years of operation , again with best estimates for electricity prices and without maintenance costs .
The problem ( as I stated in 2006 ) is that while a MW of installed Wind capacity costs about 0,4 million € , Pelamis is costing in the order of 4 million € per installed MW .
There is a steep development curve ahead before competitiveness , more over taking in account that offshore Wind energy has a higher load factor ( 40 % ) and operates essentially during the same periods ( waves are higher when the wind blows stronger ) .
Even if Pelamis manages to deal with low EROEI , this technology will likely stay in small market niches were Wind power does n't reach , either be it due to visual impact , water depths or implantation difficulties .
Looking long term this type of systems may be used to complement already in place Wind - farms using the space between windmills and taking advantage of the already existent electric connection to shore .
Is the future of the red serpent as clear as the sky ?

An Energy Policy Dilemma
With such prospects , why are these companies so eager to expand the project ?
The answer is simple , the state pays a feed - in - tarif of 0.23 € per kWh generated by renewable energy producers .
This appears to be a good policy , guaranteeing a price for the electricity generated in the country , speeding up the phase out of fossil fuels , that are imported in their entirety .
In that way a favourable environment is created for new energy sources to grow and develop .
But there 's a huge downside to it : this subsidy is masking the low EROEI of some of these new energy sources , that otherwise should be preventing ill fated projects from surviving in the market .
As seen from the Pelamis example , while the Aguçadoura I is an interesting development project from which architects and engineers will learn and improve , the Aguçadoura II does not represent any visibly evolution in technology , presenting essentially the same EROEI .
Still it will be a profitable business for the companies involved , at the cost of the Executive Budget , representing a tangible money transfer from tax payers to private business , some even held by foreign capital .
This dilemma faced today by the Portuguese government will be one of the most important issues energy policy makers worldwide will have to deal in the transition away from fossil fuels : how to draw a line between those new energy sources that are really helpful for society and those that are not .
Correctly measuring EROEI and determining how it evolves along the development phase of new technologies will have a crucial role in the Energy Policy of the XXI century .
I hope that this Cluster idea really turn out to be a success , and that development allows for Wave energy to became a useful part in our future energy mix .
And not only for the sake of the country 's industry but also for the negative social effects that the failure of the policies supporting it may bring .

In the new issue of Cell Stem Cell , scientists report that the same transcription factor , which is crucial for the survival of different stem cell types , can behave differently .
This study clearly showed for the first time that different types of stem cells are defined by exclusive combinations of genes working together , and this is under the influence of a single key stem cell factor ( called Sall4 ) .
The finding is timely since other researchers have recently revealed that specific genetic recipes can be used to turn non-stem cells into different stem cells that can be useful clinically .
This finding reveals important insights about how scientists may be able to manipulate and engineer different stem cells for the treatment of human degenerative disorders .
Understanding the behaviour of transcription factors , a class of gene regulators , helps pave the way for important advancements in stem cell technology and clinical research .
Stem cells are important for the cell - based therapy of many degenerative tissue disorders .
Each type of body tissue has its own unique type of stem cells whose behaviour is controlled by different sets of genes .
Given the enormous complexity of each stem cell type and the underlying genetic bases for their unique purpose , it has been a major challenge for scientists to unravel the similarities and differences between the different stem cells .
The latest research , led by Bing Lim , Senior Group Leader at the Genome Institute of Singapore ( GIS ) , focused on identifying and understanding the functions of powerful genetic molecules , also known as " stem cell factors " .
Dr. Bing Lim said , " This new discovery has provided us with important new leads and ideas on how to grow and expand various stem cells for clinical research and treatment needs . "
Dr. Daniel Tenen , Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School , and Director for Cancer Research Centre of Excellence at the National University of Singapore , said , " These studies are of great significance , as they provide important clues as to how a single transcription factor might regulate different targets in different stem cells . "
Interestingly , this stem cell factor also appeared to be associated with certain diseases , particularly leukemia .
Dr. Li Chai , Instructor at the Department of Pathology at the Harvard Medical School , added that , " as Sall4 plays an important role in both normal hematopoietic stem cell function and in leukemia stem cells , these findings may have clinical relevance ; they may lead to understanding differences between normal and cancer stem cells .

The deceptively simple chart progresses from the decidedly not - human ( a factory robot , for instance ) to something that would be indistinguishable from ourselves ( whether it 's a perfect computer graphic or these guys ) .
One might guess that as the objects in questions become more human , they become more familiar to us , and so it goes .
Until , that is , we hit the uncanny valley .
Once the robot or graphic or toy or not - quite human creature becomes too human like ( and yet not human like enough to be indistinguishable ) , we can't handle it .
Viewing these things stimulates a feeling of repulsion ( they 're familiar !

Video : Wasps remember wasp faces
Would you remember these faces after a week ?
Paper wasps can ( Image : Michael Sheehan )
Wasps can remember each other after a busy week apart , according to new research .
It ’s a level of social memory never seen before in insects , which were long thought to be too small - brained for such a feat .
Queens of the paper wasp , Polistes fuscatus , form cooperative nests after fighting to establish a dominance hierarchy .

When big - brained vertebrates like primates fight to establish dominance , they benefit from their ability to remember previous adversaries .
But insects , even those with complex social colonies , were thought to lack that kind of individual social intelligence .
Michael Sheehan and Elizabeth Tibbetts at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , tested that idea .
Tibbetts knew that wasps can recognise individuals based on colour patterns on their faces .
The next step was to see if they could remember individuals over a period of time in which they were distracted by other social interactions .
Buzz off , stranger
The researchers exposed female wasps to a new individual and then placed them in separate cages along with 10 other wasps .
After one week , the females acted much more aggressively when placed with another new individual than when placed with the wasp they had met before .
“ It ’s about how many new memories and new experiences you can have before the first memory goes out the window , ” says Sheehan .
“ In this case the wasps are remembering someone they interacted with at the same time as they ’re interacting with 10 other wasps . ”
“ This shows how we used to underestimate insect learning and cognition , ” says Reuven Dukas , an evolutionary biologist at McMaster University in Ontario , Canada , who studies insect learning .
“ The biased view that you need a giant brain to be smart is not fully correct .
Animals with small brains can do much more than we used to attribute to them . ”

If you have n't been creeped out yet today , this crazy morbid story from the scene of the recent Metrolink train disaster should do the trick .
Apparently , family members of passenger Chuck Peck received 35 calls from his cellphone throughout the night of the crash .
There was nothing but static on the other end of the line , but Peck 's fiancee used these opportunities to shout encouraging messages into the phone like " hang in there baby .
We 're gonna get you out .
You 're gonna be okay . "
The authorities managed to trace one of the calls which lead them to the first train and eventually to his body .
Unfortunately , Peck died on impact .
It is logical to assume that the phone calls were the result of a technical malfunction and not supernatural forces .
And , as far as I know , there has been no analysis of the condition of the cellphone itself .
But consider this — all 35 calls were made to close family members only : his son , brother , sister , stepmother and fiancee .
Plus , this is not the first time something like this has happened .

Ms. Pelosi sharply criticized the Bush administration on Wednesday over the $ 85 billion bailout of A.I.G. , saying it was evidence of mismanagement by President Bush .
But she expressed strong support for the automakers ’ loan guarantees , which would be used to help the companies meet new fuel efficiency standards that Congress adopted last year .
“ We see that as a way to rebuild and strengthen the technological base of America , ” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference in the Capitol .
“ It would certainly help people in the auto industry , but it ’s not only about the auto industry , it ’s about the auto industry , it ’s about our economy , it ’s about America ’s work force . ”
She added : “ We consider this a major investment in innovation . ”
Republican Congressional leaders , too , said they were in favor of helping the automakers .
Representative Adam Putnam of Florida , the third - ranking House Republican , said at a news conference that it was up to auto executives to convince lawmakers of the need for government assistance .
“ It ’s incumbent on them to make the case to Congress that it is a loan guarantee , that it is a wise investment of taxpayer dollars , and I think that they are on the Hill this week making that case , ” Mr. Putnam said .
“ The reports that I have heard from my colleagues is that they have been fairly persuasive . ”
Image Robert L. Nardelli of Chrysler said he was encouraged .

The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , expressed his own support for aid to the automakers at a news conference on Wednesday morning .
Mr. Reid said the loan guarantees , which would cost taxpayers $ 7.5 billion , were needed .
“ I think it ’s extremely important that we try to do something , ” he said .
“ These are jobs .
These are cars that we should be selling  or manufacturing in America , not someplace else . ”
Proposed fire district mergers in Calif. county face financial hurdles
As smaller agencies seek to join with the Sonoma County Fire District , officials are considering how consolidation would affect the county 's budget
Randi Rossmann
The Press Democrat , Santa Rosa , Calif .
SONOMA COUNTY , Calif. — Bodega
Bay ’s financially struggling firefighting agency could have a new name , more firefighters and more paramedics under a plan that would expand the growing Sonoma County Fire District next year — but only if the Board of Supervisors ponies up as much as $ 2.5 million a year to make it happen .
The 66 - year - old coast agency and the 100 - year - old Russian River Fire Protection District both want to join Sonoma County Fire , the latest in a series of moves meant to consolidate and modernize the county ’s far - flung and somewhat antiquated fire services network .
Sonoma County Fire Chief Mark
Heine called the changes important for firefighting but difficult for the agencies making them .
The Bodega Bay Fire Protection District is one of the fire agencies seeking to join with the Sonoma County Fire District .
County officials are considering the financial hurdles that may arise with the merging of multiple fire agencies .
( Photo / Bodega Bay Fire Protection District Facebook )
“ It ’s a very emotional thing for a board , disbanding a fire agency and combining it with another one , ” said Heine .
On the east side of the county , another merger involves the nearly 100 - year - old Glen Ellen Fire Protection District and the 39 - year - old Mayacamas Volunteer Company , both seeking to join Sonoma Valley Fire .
That would reduce the valley ’s five fire agencies to three and guarantee added firefighters to the region .
The two plans next week are slated to move to a monthslong government review and could be in place by July 1 , should they clear hurdles and be deemed beneficial to public service .
While the smaller agencies would take on a new name , engines and stations would carry both names to retain part of their heritage .
The changes for Sonoma Valley and Russian River fire are expected to pass .
But for Bodega Bay , the Board of Supervisors will need to find a major cash infusion to fill a financial gap that would result from the merger .
That hole is a result partly of the parcel tax savings that would come to residential landowners in Bodega Bay , who would see their annual charge for firefighting drop from $ 524 to about $ 180 — to match what is paid by residents throughout the sprawling Sonoma County Fire District , taking in Windsor , Rincon Valley and much of the outskirts of Santa Rosa .
That change alone would create a $ 750,000 budget loss .
Other financial pressure stems from the spike in salaries for Bodega Bay firefighters , to match those in the larger district , and the addition of firefighting and paramedic posts .
Added to ambulance , station and equipment costs , and the budget hole is about $ 2.5 million each year — an amount that ’s not available from Bodega Bay or the Sonoma County Fire District , Heine said .
“ It ’s a big ask of the county at a time when they ’re struggling financially as well , ” he acknowledged .
Supervisor Lynda Hopkins , who represents the west county , called the plan a critical consolidation that would enhance service while keeping two fire agencies — Bodega Bay and Russian River — afloat .
She acknowledged the high cost of the Bodega Bay consolidation will be difficult to cover but said an effort to find the money is underway .
“ There ’s no easy money in local government , ” Hopkins said .
This plan is seen as a major test for county supervisors , who have made fire agency consolidations a priority and have pledged funding for progress .

A U.S. military officer warned Pentagon officials that an American detainee was being driven nearly insane by months of punishing isolation and sensory deprivation in a U.S. military brig , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press .
While the treatment of prisoners at detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and in Afghanistan and Iraq have long been the subject of human rights complaints and court scrutiny , the documents shed new light on how two American citizens and a legal U.S. resident were treated in military jails inside the United States .
The Bush administration ordered the men to be held in military jails as “ enemy combatants ” for years of interrogations without criminal charges , which would not have been allowed in civilian jails .
The men were interrogated by the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency , repeatedly denied access to attorneys and mail from home and contact with anyone other than guards and their interrogators .
They were deprived of natural light for months and for years were forbidden even minor distractions such as a soccer ball or a dictionary .
“ I will continue to do what I can to help this individual maintain his sanity , but in my opinion we ’re working with borrowed time , ” an unidentified Navy brig official wrote of prisoner Yaser Esam Hamdi in 2002 .
“ I would like to have some form of an incentive program in place to reward him for his continued good behavior , but more so , to keep him from whacking out on me . ”
Yale Law School ’s Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic received the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by two attorneys Jonathan Freiman and Tahlia Townsend , representing another detainee , Jose Padilla .
The Lowenstein group and the American Civil Liberties Union said the papers were evidence that the Bush administration violated the 5th Amendment ’s protections against cruel treatment .
The U.S. military was ordered to treat the American prisoners the same way prisoners at Guantanamo were treated , according to the documents .
However , the Guantanamo jail was created by the Bush administration specifically to avoid allowing detainees any constitutional rights .
Administration lawyers contended the Constitution did not apply outside the country .

The Palin administration wo n’t release hundreds of emails from her office , claiming they cover confidential policy matters .
Then why do the subject lines refer to a political foe , a journalist , and non-policy topics ?
In June , Andrée McLeod , a self - described independent government watchdog in Alaska , sent an open records act request to the office of Governor Sarah Palin .
She requested copies of all the emails that had been sent and received by Ivy Frye and Frank Bailey , two top aides to Palin , from February through April of this year .
McLeod , a 53 - year - old registered Republican who has held various jobs in state government , suspected that Frye and Bailey had engaged in political activity during official business hours in that period by participating in a Palin - backed effort to oust the state chairman of the Alaska Republican party , Randy Ruedrich .
( Bailey has been in the national news of late for refusing to cooperate with investigators probing whether Palin fired Alaska ’s public safety commission because he did not dismiss a state trooper who had gone through an ugly divorce with Palin ’s sister . )
In response to her request , McLeod received four large boxes of emails .
This batch of documents did not contain any proof that Frye and Bailey had worked on government time to boot out Ruedrich .
But there was other information she found troubling .
Several of the emails suggested to her that Palin ’s office had used its influence to reward a Fairbanks surveyor who was a Palin fundraiser with a state job .
In early August , McLeod filed a complaint with the state attorney general against Palin , Bailey , and other Palin aides , claiming they had violated ethics and hiring laws .
Palin , now the Republican vice - presidential candidate , told the Alaska Daily News that “ there were no favors done for anybody . ”
But more intriguing than any email correspondence contained in the four boxes was what was not released : about 1100 emails .
Palin ’s office provided McLeod with a 78 - page list ( PDF ) cataloging the emails it was withholding .
Many of them had been written by Palin or sent to her .
Palin ’s office claimed most of the undisclosed emails were exempt from release because they were covered by the “ executive ” or “ deliberative process ” privileges that protect communications between Palin and her aides about policy matters .
But the subject lines of some of the withheld emails suggest they were not related to policy matters .
Several refer to one of Palin ’s political foes , others to a well - known Alaskan journalist .
Moreover , some of the withhold emails were CC’ed to Todd Palin , the governor ’s husband .
Todd Palin— a.k.a. the First Dude — holds no official state position ( though he has been a close and influential adviser for Governor Palin ) .
The fact that Palin and her aides shared these emails with a citizen outside the government undercuts the claim that they must be protected under executive privilege .
McLeod asks , “ What is Sarah Palin hiding ? ”
The list of still - secret emails includes a series of messages that circulated on February 1 , 2008 , among Palin , Bailey , Frye , and Todd Palin “ re Andrew Halcro . ”
A former Republican , Halcro ran as an independent against Palin for governor in 2006 , collecting only 9 percent of the vote .
Since then he has been a blogger who often criticizes Palin .
There is no telling what the emails said about Halcro .
But in a July blog posting , Halcro asked , “ why in the world is Todd Palin getting copied on emails [ about me ] that his wife ’s administration is classifying as confidential … .
These emails should be released to the public …. after all Todd Palin has no standing to claim executive privilege .
By including him in the email loop , the Palin administration has arguably breached any claim of executive privilege . ”
And McLeod wonders , “ What do emails about Andrew Halcro have to do with policy deliberations ? ”
The list of confidential emails includes a number of communications related to the Public Safety Employees Association , a union for the state ’s police officers and state troopers , and the headings refer to PSEA ads and a “ PR campaign . ”
Many of these PSEA - related emails were CC’ed to Todd Palin — and were also withheld under the deliberative process and executive privileges .
( Recently , John Cyr , the PSEA executive director , told The Washington Post that Sarah Palin held a grudge against the state troopers and held down their salaries and other funding because her ex-brother - in - law - the - trooper had not been fired . )
A separate email sent from Frye to Bailey and Todd Palin and headed “ I may be in trouble here guys ” was withheld because it involves a personnel matter .
In April , a series of emails with the subject line “ from Sheila Toomey ” zipped between Sarah Palin , Bailey , Frye , other Palin aides , and Todd Palin .
Toomey writes the “ Alaska Ear ” political gossip column for the Anchorage Daily News .
These emails were also withheld under the deliberative process and executive privileges .
And a string of emails titled “ Racism on the Radio ” that went back and forth between Governor Palin and her aides was blocked from release on the same grounds .
McLeod says she intends to file an appeal of the decision to withhold the emails on the 78 - page list .
Palin has denounced McLeod ’s efforts .
After McLeod filed the ethics complaint , Palin told the Anchorage Daily News , “ This is the same Andrée McLeod that follows us around at public events and camps herself out in our waiting area and hounds us for a job , asking us if there ’s a way she can … not have to go through the system to get a job with this administration . ”
Palin also called McLeod “ the falafel lady , ” because McLeod once sold falafel .
On his website , Halcro has posted excerpts of emails Palin sent McLeod between 2002 and 2005 , in which she praised McLeod .
In one of these messages , Palin wrote , “ You ’re all about accountability . ”
In another , Palin said , “ Thanks for working to instill the public trust . ”
Palin also wrote her , “ I ’m proud to know you . ”
And in one email , Palin hailed McLeod : “ Holy Moly you are powerful regarding getting the word out to the press about questionable activity . ”
“ I ’ve known Sarah for years , ” says McLeod , who moved to Alaska from New York in 1978 .
“ When the finger is pointed at somebody else , she ’s all for accountability .
When it ’s pointing at her , it ’s different .
Sarah Palin was elected on the basis of providing open and honest government .
She has failed miserably . ”
The McCain - Palin campaign did not respond to phone and email requests for a comment .
UPDATE : McLeod has filed an appeal in the case of Sarah Palin ’s secret emails .

I ’ve been asked a couple times for comparative images of the Pro-Palin rally and the Anti-Palin rallies .
So , here they are .
Here ’s the pro-Palin rally in a room with a capacity of 5000 people .
If you do n’t count security , secret service , staffers , and media , I ’m guessing a maximum of about 800 - 900 people .
Boots on the ground from the Ed Schultz Show that was in town , counted the crowd at about 500 .

As the presidential campaign entered its final month , Democrat Barack Obama issued a sharp assault on Republican John McCain ’s healthcare proposal Saturday , arguing it would lead to higher taxes for some families and knock as many as 20 million people out of their current insurance plans .
The topic provided a new focus for the campaign , as Obama launched four television ads in battleground states criticizing McCain ’s plan .
The candidates have spent the last two weeks sparring over the nation ’s financial crisis .
McCain held no public events Saturday as he prepared at his retreat near Sedona , Ariz . , for Tuesday ’s debate .
The McCain healthcare plan would significantly alter the way many Americans get their healthcare coverage .
It would eliminate tax breaks on employer - sponsored healthcare benefits and instead give Americans healthcare tax credits -- a $ 2,500 credit for individuals and a $ 5,000 credit for families .
Advertisement
Obama called the plan “ radical ” several times Saturday .
The McCain campaign argues its plan would reduce the amount most Americans spend on healthcare by creating more competition for insurance plans and better coverage options as more people seek plans in the private market .
“ John McCain trusts the judgment of the American people , ” senior policy advisor Doug Holtz - Eakin said in a conference call responding to Obama ’s speech .
“ He ’s willing to put money in their hands because they know what ’s best . ”
But campaigning in heavily contested Virginia at a park overlooking the James River , Obama argued that the Arizona senator ’s plan amounted to “ pulling an old Washington bait - and - switch . ”

“ He gives you a tax credit with one hand -- but he raises your taxes with the other , ” Obama said .
“ A $ 5,000 tax credit .
That sounds pretty good , ” Obama said .
But he noted that a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that the average cost of a family healthcare plan is $ 12,680 .
“ Where would that leave you ?
Broke , ” Obama said .
A number of independent analysts have concluded that McCain ’s plan would prompt younger workers to abandon their employer - sponsored plans to find less expensive coverage on the open market -- meaning employers could end up with a pool of older workers , whose healthcare is more expensive .
“ Many employers will drop their healthcare plans altogether , ” Obama predicted .
“ Under the McCain plan , at least 20 million Americans will lose the insurance they rely on from their workplace , ” he said , citing a recent analysis of McCain ’s plan in the journal Health Affairs .
But the Illinois senator did not mention that the same analysis found that 21 million Americans could gain coverage under the Republican nominee ’s plan .

Holtz - Eakin disputed Obama ’s 20 - million figure and called the Democratic nominee ’s assertion that employers would stop providing insurance “ patently false . ”
Employers would still be able to deduct health insurance costs , and they would still be competing to attract quality employees , he said .
“ Their incentive will be unchanged . ”
John Holahan , director of the nonpartisan Health Policy Research Center at the Urban Institute , said that though Obama ’s wording about the 20 million workers was technically correct , analyses of McCain ’s plan have shown “ the net effect is more or less a wash , or a small gain . ”
Obama ’s charge that taxes may go up under McCain ’s plan is true in some cases , Holahan said , because McCain ’s tax credit would not keep up with healthcare inflation .
“ After five to 10 years , the current tax deduction is going to be worth more than the current value of the credit , ” Holahan said .
“ Depending on your income -- you could be worse or better off . ”
Advertisement
The McCain campaign estimates , however , that less than 5 % of Americans would see their taxes rise .
“ It is the case there may be some people at the very top who have a liability greater than their health tax credit , ” Holtz - Eakin said .
But “ under the current system . . . we are having the middle class pay taxes and subsidize the gold - plated coverage of the most affluent in America . ”
Before leaving Newport News for Asheville , N.C. , where he is preparing for the debate , Obama also criticized a controversial provision of the McCain plan that would allow employers to sell insurance across state lines , which he called “ a starting gun for a race to the bottom . ”
“ Insurance companies will rush to set up shop in states with the fewest protections for patients , ” he said .
Advertisement
Holtz - Eakin called Obama ’s remarks “ cynical ” and “ deceitful , ” and emphasized that McCain ’s plan would set up a program guaranteeing coverage for high - risk patients and a mechanism allowing patients to appeal insurance company denials .
For months , McCain has sharply criticized Obama ’s healthcare approach as an expensive , intrusive expansion of government .
The Obama healthcare plan would help the uninsured get coverage through a new National Health Insurance Exchange and would provide subsidies for low - income Americans to help them purchase insurance .
The plan would also boost the number of workers who are insured by requiring employers to automatically enroll their workers in employer - sponsored health plans , but would permit employees to opt out .

Israel showed disregard for civilian life in Beit Hanoun , Tutu says A report to the UN Human Rights Council on Israel 's shelling of Beit Hanoun in Gaza almost two years ago says it may have been a war crime .
The report compiled by Archbishop Desmond Tutu casts doubt on Israel 's explanation that the shelling resulted from a flawed artillery firing system .
It calls on Israel to pay compensation to the victims , 19 of whom were killed .
Archbishop Tutu went to Beit Hanoun in May , after objections by Israel delayed his mission several times .
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the South African cleric 's report contains horrific testimony from survivors of the shelling .
She says it speaks of the dead lying in the streets , of local hospitals overwhelmed , and of the injured having to hand over cash to get through Israeli checkpoints for treatment in Israel itself .
The Israeli military , which was at the time trying to prevent rocket attacks by Palestinian militants , says its own inquiry shows the shelling of Beit Hanoun was caused by technical errors , but Archbishop Tutu 's report is sceptical .
' Regrettable ' Mr Tutu says there is evidence of a disproportionate and reckless disregard for Palestinian civilian life , contrary to international humanitarian law , which raises concerns that a war crime may have been committed .
In pictures : Beit Hanoun shelling " In the absence of a well - founded explanation from the Israeli military - who is in sole possession of the relevant facts - the mission must conclude that there is a possibility that the shelling of Beit Hanoun constituted a war crime , " his report to the UN Human Rights Council said .
The report calls for an independent investigation into the shelling .
Archbishop
Tutu will present his report to the UN human rights council on Thursday - during that debate Israel will have a chance to respond .
The council is dominated by Muslim and African nations and Israel says it ignores most human rights abuses to focus on its conduct .

What are these ?
If you are thinking of writing a web service or a client based on a WSDL , you can easily generate the code for PHP or any other language using tools likes wsdl2 php or other wsdl2xxx category tools .
Then you do n’t need to really worry about what is the schema of the WSDL or any other finer details .
But sometime it may useful to know how different schema constructs are generated in PHP level so you can have a good idea when you are using them .
This post describes
How inheritance is used in XML Schema and how it is mapped to PHP code from wsdl2 php tool in WSF / PHP .
There are several ways that one schema type can inherit another type .
Here are some names use to refer them .
SimpleType Restriction – Forming simple type by restricting another simple type
SimpleContent Extension – Forming complex type by extending a simple type
ComplexContent Extension – Forming complex type by extending another complex type
Note that here the word ‘ type ’ always refers to a schema type .
It is not straight forward to do a one to one map from these schema structures to a PHP or some other language .
But wsdl2 php tool does that keeping the simplicity and preserving the original meaning .
Lets see how it is done for each of the above mentioned methods of inheriting .
SimpleType Restriction
You can create a simple type by restricting some values of another simple type .
Here is an example .
<!-- derivedType from applying simple type restriction for xs:string --> < xs:simpleType name = " derivedType " > < xs:restriction base = " xs:string " > < xs:enumeration value = " a " />
< xs:enumeration value = " ab " /> < xs:enumeration value = " abc " /> < xs:enumeration value = " abcd " /> </xs:restriction >
</xs:simpleType >
Here the derived Type is a string , but it can only have values “ a ” , “ ab ” , “ abc ” and “ abcd ” .
This restriction have used the “ enumeration ” ( which we call a facet ) to restrict the possible values .
You can use other facets like length , minLength , MaxLength and so on .
Here are the complete list of facets in the schema specification .
So lets see hows this is mapped to a PHP code .
Here we assume this type is used in an schema element called ‘ input ’ .
/** * @var string * NOTE : $ input should follow the following restrictions *
You can have one of the following value * a * ab * abc * abcd */ public $ input ;
Note that here it does not say anything about the ‘ derived Type ’ .
Rather it says it is of type “ String ” which is a PHP type and in addition it has some restrictions , or rules when assigning values .
Although it could have been possible to use getters and setters to impose these rules , this uses just a comment about the rules because this way it is really easy the use the variable .
Say we have another type ( say derieved Type2 ) restricting the ‘ derievedType ’ , that type will have the combination of restrictions of both types .
Here is the xml schema representation of the ‘ derievedType2 ’ .
<!-- derivedType2--> < xs:simpleType name = " derivedType2 " > < xs:restriction base = " tns:derivedType " > < xs:maxLength value = " 3 " /> < xs:minLength value = " 2 " /> </xs:restriction >
</xs:simpleType >
And if input2 have that type , the php code will look like this , ( Note that it has the combination of rules ) .
/** * @var string * NOTE : $ input2 should follow the following restrictions *
You can have one of the following value * a * ab * abc * abcd *
Your length of the value should be * Greater than 2 * Less than 3 */ public $ input2 ;
I have highlighted the additional rules compared with $ input , so you can see the difference .
SimpleContent Extension
Simple Content extension is extending a simple type to make a complex type .
Say we have an element ( say with the name “ mystring ” ) and it has “ xs:string ” simple type .
< xs:element name = " mystring " type = " xs:string " />
And here is a valid xml with this schema .
< mystring > this can contain only string </ mystring >
So if I say I ’m going to make a complex type extending this simple type you may think that I ’m going to add element in to that .
In fact I will create a complex type by adding an attribute .
< mystring myint = " 3 " > this can contain only string </ mystring >
The schema to this xml will be something like this .
( Note that I have assumed there is an schema element named “ mystring ” with the type “ myStringType ” )
< xs:complexType name = " myStringType " > < xs:simpleContent > < xs:extension base = " xs:string " > < xs:attribute name = " myint " type = " xs:int " /> </xs:extension > </xs:simpleContent >
</xs:complexType >
The PHP generated code for this schema is something like this ,
class myStringType { /** * @var int */ public $ myint ; //
The " value " represents the element ' myStringType ' value ..
/** * @var string */ public $ value ; }
So as you can see it creates a PHP class for that schema type with member variables for each attributes and finally for the value of the parent type .
So in order to represent the above mentioned xml , you will use the following PHP code .
$ type = new myStringType ( ) ; $ type -> myint = 3 ; $ type -> value = " this can contain only string " ;
Next we will look at the inheritance with complexContent Extension .
ComplexContent Extension
This is to create a complex type by inheriting another complexType .
<!-- the parent type --> < xs:complexType name = " parentType " > < xs:sequence > < xs:element name = " demo3 " type = " xs:int " />
< xs:element name = " demo4 " type = " xs:string " /> </xs:sequence > </xs:complexType > <!-- the child type --> < xs:complexType name = " childType " > < xs:complexContent > < xs:extension base = " tns:parentType " > < xs:sequence > < xs:element name = " demo1 " type = " xs:int " />
< xs:element name = " demo2 " type = " xs:string " /> </xs:sequence > </xs:extension >
</xs:complexContent >
</xs:complexType >
So here the childType will inherit the ‘ demo3 ’ and ‘ demo4 ’ elements from the parent type .
We will see how is the PHP generated code looks like .
class parentType { /** * @var int */ public $ demo3 ; /** * @var string */ public $ demo4 ; } class childType extends parentType {
/** * @var int */ public $ demo1 ; /** * @var string */ public $ demo2 ; }
It has uses the PHP inheritance to reprensent the schema inheritance .
And the nice thing is you can use the childType for the places you have to use the parentType .
That is the theoy we learn at the inheritance class of other languages ( Java , C++ ) too .
So say there is another complexType ( say “ anotherChildType ” ) inheriting from the type “ parentType ” and one another complexType ( say “ nextLevelChildType ” ) inheriting this time from “ childType ” ( which in fact inheriting from the “ parentType ” as mentioned above ) .
So our types tree would be something like this .
--- parentType | +-------- childType | | | +------------- nexLevelChildType | +-------- anotherChildType
And lets say there is a schema element called ‘ input3 ’ with the type parentType .
Then the generated variable for the input3 element will be like following code segment .
/** * @var ( object ) parentType * Or one of following derived class ( es ) * childType * nextLevelChildType * anotherChildType */ public $ input3 ;
This comment tells you that you can actually use the inherited types in place of the parent type according to your preferences .
[ digg - reddit - me ] John McCain has a history of over - personalizing and overreacting during crises – which has led a number of top former military officials and others who know him to voice concerns about McCain ’s fitness .
As one general said , “
As another said , “ One of the things the senior military would like to see when they go visit the president is a kind of consistency , a kind of reliability … McCain has got a reputation for being a little volatile . ”
Conservative columnist and curmudgeon George F. Will wrote of McCain ’s reaction to the current financial crisis : “ Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high .
It is not Barack Obama … [ The more one sees of McCain ’s ] impulsive , intensely personal reactions to people and events the less confidence one has [ in him ]
… It is arguable that McCain , because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes , is not suited to the presidency .
Unreadiness can be corrected , although perhaps at great cost , by experience .
Can a dismaying temperament be fixed ? ”
A Republican Senator stated , “ The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine .
He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . ”

Japan has never bounced back from the 1980 ’s bubble .
The economic dynamics of the two countries are obviously different but even Wall Street stagnated in a tight range of trading for most of the 1970s , offering little growth .
Now that this is very much a world problem , central banks are all offering plans to rescue their system .
A global coordinated effort would be ideal though in such a climate of panic , this will be a challenge .

John McCain ’s decision to cancel a campaign event in Michigan next week was not a matter of scheduling : Mr. McCain is giving up his effort to take the state back into the red column , concluding that economic distress there has simply put the state out of reach , according to Republicans familiar with the decision .
Michigan had been one of Mr. McCain ’s top targets for two reasons : evidence that Barack Obama was having trouble connecting with blue - collar voters ( which presumably would be a problem there ) , and also because the Democratic candidates did not participate in the state ’s primary after Michigan defied Democratic party rules and held it earlier than permitted .
Republican officials said that polling suggested that Mr. Obama was building a lead there , and said they concluded that it was n’t worth spending any more campaign funds – or Mr. McCain ’s time – in the state .
Take a closer look at the electoral map and the states considered to be in play in 2008 .

At a rally in Coral Gables FL , this afternoon Barack Obama accused John McCain of being panicked over the economy and being willing to say or do anything to win the election .
Obama is starting to look like a candidate that is poised to take over this race .
Obama seized on McCain ’s changing strategy on the issue of experience .
“ This morning Sen . McCain gave a speech in which his big solution to this worldwide economic crisis was to blame me for it .
This is a guy who has spent nearly three decades in Washington , and after spending the entire campaign saying I have n’t been in Washington enough , he apparently now is willing to assign me responsibility for all of Washington ’s failures , ” Obama said .
He also pointed out that it looks like Sen.
McCain is panicking over the economic crisis , “ I think it is pretty clear that Sen.
McCain is a little panicked right now .
At this point he seems to be willing to say anything , or do anything , or change any position , or violate any principle to win this election , and I have got to say that it is kind of sad to see .
That ’s not the politics we need . ”

Obama highlighted McCain ’s weeklong flip flop over the federal bailout , “ It has also been disappointing to watch my opponent ’s reaction to this economic crisis .
His first reaction on Monday was to stand up and repeat the line he said over and over again throughout this campaign , “ The fundamentals of the economy are strong . ”
The comment was so out of touch that even George Bush ’s White House could n’t agree with it . ”
Here is the video of Obama ’s comments :
This has been a terrible week for John McCain .
His campaign would have been better served by saying nothing at all about the proposed federal bailout until after they knew what the administration was going to do .
This whole week reinforced the idea that McCain knows nothing about the economy , and even worse , ca n’t be trusted to make a decision on economic issues .
The McCain campaign is panicking , because they know as well as anyone that if this election is decided on the economy , John McCain loses .
This is why they attacked Obama this morning .
If they are to win , they have to make this a contest about character , and portray Obama as the character that ca n’t be trusted .
When they get off of that script , or are forced to discuss issues that are n’t national security or Iraq , they are lost .
Obama is in a good position to take control of this election and keep John McCain on the defensive .
Every election eventually comes down to issues , and this is where Obama will beat McCain .

John McCain has pulled out of Michigan as his support ebbed
After three weeks in which the US financial crisis has dominated the news , the political landscape of the election has been steadily changing .
There has been a consistent - and significant - shift in the national opinion polls against Republican candidate John McCain , who is now running about 5 % behind Barack Obama .
Even more important for the electoral battle has been the shift in the swing states , which is changing the landscape of the election and providing both campaigns with new opportunities and new challenges .
KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES New in 2008 : Colorado , Virgina , North Carolina , Indiana Key swing states in past elections : Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Florida US elections : Battleground map
The decision of the McCain campaign last Thursday to withdraw from Michigan - once considered a key swing state - is just one sign that the two campaigns are reconsidering their strategy with just four weeks to go before the election .
Of course , just as it seems that the economic crisis has helped boost Mr Obama 's standing , other events - such as a foreign policy crisis - could help Mr McCain .
There is a lot of defence that John McCain is going to have to play
David Plouffe , Obama campaign manager
But both camps need to take critical decisions on which states to concentrate on , where they believe the election will be decided - a decision that is particularly acute for the McCain campaign .
Mr McCain cancelled some campaign appearances and spent the weekend in his ranch in Arizona with his advisers discussing how to approach the final weeks of the battle .
Southern strategy Broadly , the new geography of key swing states has made the South and the West more important , at the expense of the traditional battleground of the industrial mid-West .
One sign of the changed landscape is in the fact that recent polls give Mr Obama a slight edge in both Virginia and North Carolina , two states rich in electoral votes which together would more than counterbalance Florida .
Both states were won by George Bush with handsome majorities in 2000 and 2004 .
It is no surprise that Mr Obama has visited North Carolina 30 times , including twice in the past week , and Virginia 22 times .
And polls in Florida , where McCain had been leading and which voted Republican in the last two elections , seem to have shifted significantly , returning the state to its traditional battleground status .
Florida has many retirees whose savings might be affected by the financial slump , and has been severely affected by the sub - prime crisis .
Mr Obama has been campaigning hard in North Carolina
The other key battleground now seems to be the Rocky Mountain states of Colorado , New Mexico and Nevada .
Mr Obama seems to be building up an unstoppable lead in New Mexico , the US state with the highest proportion of Hispanic voters .
But Colorado and Nevada - both easily won by George Bush - now seem too close to call .
In the past two weeks Senator Obama has held four rallies in Colorado : in Denver , Golden , Pueblo and Grand Junction .
Senate races
The new geography also seems to be having its effect on some Senate races .
The Democrats look set to pick up the open two Senate seats in New Mexico and Colorado previously held by Republicans .
They are also running neck - and - neck in North Carolina , where Senator Elizabeth Dole - the wife of former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole - is being challenged by another woman , Democrat Kay Hagen .
Even in Mississippi , which has been solidly Republican , the Democrats appear to have a chance to win the Senate seat that was vacated by Republican Senate leader Trent Lott when he stepped down .
Some estimates suggest that , if the Democrats pick up other marginal seats in Alaska and Oregon , they may increase their numbers in the Senate from 51 to 58 seats .
Defending his turf Meanwhile , Senator McCain is being forced to defend some states that were considered safe territory just a short while ago - especially in the " rust belt " in the North - east and Mid-west .
Economic decline has hit Michigan hard Recent polls have put both Indiana and West Virginia - which were considered strongly Republican - into the " toss - up " category - as well as Missouri , a bellwether state in national elections , where Mr McCain campaigned over the weekend .
" That is a lot of defence that John McCain is going to have to play , " said David Plouffe , Mr Obama 's campaign manager .
Meanwhile Senator Obama seems to be lengthening his lead in Iowa , won by the Republicans last time , as well as in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , while Ohio may still be close .
However , even in Ohio , where the latest opinion poll gave Mr Obama a 49 % to 42 % lead , the Democrats were sounding optimistic .
" Very confident , yet not overly so , " said Ohio Democratic Party chief Chris Redfern , who added that the financial turmoil is dreadful for the country but " politically it 's advantageous " for Senator Obama .
The political director of the McCain campaign , Mike DuHaime , accepted that the landscape was shifting .
" This overall environment we face is probably the worst environment for a Republican in 35 years , and anytime you have that , you have states that will move , " he said after announcing his campaign 's withdrawal from Michigan .
Electoral college balance
The changing landscape has produced a big change in the hypothetical balance in the electoral college if the presidential election were held today .
Several election websites predict that Senator Obama is now ahead in in enough states to have between 250 and 260 electoral votes - close to the 270 needed for victory .
Senator McCain is projected to have secured less than 200 electoral votes , while the remainder are still up for grabs .
Of course , these are only projections based on opinion polls .
Some voters could still change their minds , and others may not turn up at the polls .
So both campaigns will redouble their efforts to get out their own supporters , as well as trying to appeal to the shrinking number of independent or undecided voters .
But with voting already beginning in some key states like Ohio , it is the McCain campaign that will have to seize the initiative if it is to turn around the race .

What are these ?
MANY comparisons may be made between the devastation being wrought on America 's financial system today and the Wall Street crash of 1929 .
One similarity that the world is desperate to avoid is a repeat of the depression of the 1930s .
Hopes are pinned on the American bail - out plan that the House of Representatives is set to reconsider on Friday October 3rd .
If the fear of depression is anything to go by , the future looks bleak .
A survey of newspaper articles over the past two decades shows a sharp spike in mentions of the dreaded D - word , as commentators have started to think the worst .
The prognostications may possibly turn out to be true , or perhaps the only thing we have to fear are the fears of journalists themselves .
AP
The single word that strikes the most fear in the heart of George Bush ’s press secretaries , , especially when it emanates directly from their own mouths :
" Helen ... "
Because the next voice he 'll hear is Helen 's -- as in , Helen Thomas .
And today the queen / dean of the Washington Press corp ; the one person more than any other who has kept the spinning White House occupants and their surrogates ’ feet to the fire , turns a thoughtful and feisty 88 years .
You have to give Bush White House press secretaries a bit of credit for some nerve .
Their boss does n't seem to have any , because he wo n't dare call on Helen
While it took most every member of the White House press corp , years of unquestioned submission to the lies supporting going into an illegal war before they began to rediscover their spine , it was Helen Thomas , one who never lost touch with hers , leading the way ; even if , every so often , this president and his spokepeople forget to call on her .
" 9/11 has made reporters fearful of being called unpatriotic if they asked tough questions , " Thomas had told me .
" Then , when we were in the war , if you asked tough questions you would be accused of jeopardizing the troops .
At the same time you had some of the corporate ( owners ) breathing down their necks to not rock the boat . "
Thomas has no question that we went to war without good reason .
" It 's clear that nothing was proved and you just do n't send people to die without ( absolutes ) .
It 's very clear this president wanted to go to war . "
Thomas has never held back asking a question , but this White House has froze her out like none other .
Since Bush does n't seem to want to go to battle with Helen , j'ever wonder what she might ask if she had the chance ?
" I would ask him how he could go to war without cause , " she says , obviously at the ready with the question .
" How could you go to war without provocation ?
Of course , that 's why he does n't call on me . "
And after the president evaded the question , what would be her followup ?
" How could you ?
Do n't you know what war is ? "
Nailed , Thomas style .
" The press is the last line of defense .
If we do n't ask the questions , this president could rule like a dictator .
All presidents should be sassed .
Who are they ?
We do n't have to worship at their shrine .
They 're public officials .
We pay them .
They have to answer to us . "
And so , thank you , Helen .
Thank you for being there for the American people .
Ah , that we could have Helen Thomas around until White Houses stop spinning the truth .
That way , we ’d have her forever .
Birds fly , tortoises crawl and politicians lie , particularly when they feel cornered .
That ’s the natural order of things .
Big deal .
I do n’t waste too much indignation on it .
But what irks me , and should concern us all , is not the everyday disregard for this or that particular truth but the very assault on the idea that there is such a thing as truth at all .
Last week , John McCain ’s campaign resorted to yet another Republican attack on the media , this time the New York Times , for being “ 150 % in the tank ” for Barack Obama .
McCain ’s campaign manager , Rick Davis , was smarting from a story that revealed he had made a sizable amount of money as head of an advocacy group that represented the interests of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
And instead of attacking the veracity of the story , the campaign initially attacked the messenger and called into question everything the Times -- and , I ’d suggest , by implication the rest of the so - called liberal media -- reported on McCain ’s campaign .
The revelations and the barbs continued to fly , with the Times uncovering additional payments from Freddie Mac to Davis ’ firm through last month , and the McCain side fulminating mostly about the “ partisan paper of record ” and claiming that Davis received no remuneration or profit of any kind from his firm since 2006 .

I ’m no defender of the New York Times .
I often find its high - and - mighty tone pretentious and self - serving .
But it worries me that Republicans have made it a primary tactic to respond to negative news with immediate media smears and charges of bias .
Conservatives may have a point that the traditional media are slanted to the left , but it is also clear that they are n’t content with simple ideological balance .
What they want , as we have seen , is their own biased media , in the form of Fox News and the Washington Times .
The upshot , ironically , is that conservatives -- those who generally embrace the idea of absolutes -- have put the final nail in the coffin of truth .
To be sure , the initial assault on truth began on the intellectual left in the 1960s .
In academia , the old - fashioned idea that there were some things that we could all be certain of gave way to the postmodern worldview that held that truth does not really exist in any objective sense , but is instead created by each individual through the prism of his own background and biases .
According to this new dictum , reality itself is fragmented and the search for commonly held truths is the province of fools , innocents and fundamentalists .

In this new regime , serious thinkers are , by definition , dogmatic skeptics .
College students , as one writer put it , now feel “ safer as doubters than as believers , and as perpetual seekers rather than eventual finders . ”
On today ’s college campuses , truth is so 20th century .
As believers in the old - fashioned idea of truth , conservatives generally have found postmodernism distasteful and have vociferously protested its emergence .
In her 1995 book , “ Telling the Truth , ” Lynne Cheney , the vice president ’s wife and former head of the National Endowment of the Humanities , railed against intellectual relativism .
She blamed academic postmodernism for undermining the very purpose of learning .
In this new way of thinking , she wrote , “ There ’s only your version of events and my version of events and Charles ’ version and Harry ’s version , and the one that prevails will be that of whoever is most powerful .
This seems to fly in the face of the way scholarship has proceeded for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . ”
In that same year , Ohio pastor Dennis McCallum published his book , “ The Death of Truth . ” “ Postmodernists , ” he wrote , “ point out that we already have a cultural and social beginning point that makes objectivity impossible . ”
But “ in the absence of objective truth , there is no final bar of appeal to determine truth and reality . ”
And , ultimately , without a belief in truth , there can be no belief in God .
And the list does n’t stop there .
In one way or another , the likes of Robert Bork and William J. Bennett have argued that liberal - inspired relativism has served to erode America ’s moral clarity .

But if conservatives care so much about the truth , why then do they condone the GOP ’s constant haranguing about media bias , with its emphasis on knee - jerk , blanket charges of partisanship rather than on arguing a case ?
No doubt because it ’s a simpler - to - communicate message ; no doubt creating boogeymen is easier and perhaps more effective with voters than arguing evidence and fact .
But conservatives in particular should understand that constant discrediting of the media is one of the best ways to further the postmodernist agenda .
It erodes the belief that there is something real and solid , and it lends credence to the idea that all truth is relative because it is always filtered through the biases of its messengers .
Although this gambit may pay short - term political dividends , in the long run it only serves to further divide Americans into their ideological enclaves -- with conservatives getting their news from X and liberals from Y .
More important , by undermining the very idea of truth , it also undermines the idea that , as a nation , we can collectively and honestly describe and find solutions to the problems we all face .

What is this bailout supposed to do ?
Will it actually serve the purpose ?
What should we be doing instead ?
Let ’s talk .
First , a capsule analysis of the crisis .
1 . It all starts with the bursting of the housing bubble .
This has led to sharply increased rates of default and foreclosure , which has led to large losses on mortgage - backed securities .
2 . The losses in MBS , in turn , have left the financial system undercapitalized — doubly so , because levels of leverage that were previously considered acceptable are no longer OK .
3 . The financial system , in its efforts to deleverage , is contracting credit , placing everyone who depends on credit under strain .
4 . There ’s also , to some extent , a vicious circle of deleveraging : as financial firms try to contract their balance sheets , they drive down the prices of assets , further reducing capital and forcing more deleveraging .
So where in this process does the Temporary Asset Relief Plan offer any , well , relief ?
The answer is that it possibly offers some respite in stage 4 : the Treasury steps in to buy assets that the financial system is trying to sell , thereby hopefully mitigating the downward spiral of asset prices .
But the more I think about this , the more skeptical I get about the extent to which it ’s a solution .
Problems :
(a) Although the problem starts with mortgage - backed securities , the range of assets whose prices are being driven down by deleveraging is much broader than MBS .
So this only cuts off , at most , part of the vicious circle .
( b) Anyway , the vicious circle aspect is only part of the larger problem , and arguably not the most important part .
Even without panic asset selling , the financial system would be seriously undercapitalized , causing a credit crunch — and this plan does nothing to address that .
Or I should say , the plan does nothing to address the lack of capital unless the Treasury overpays for assets .
And if that ’s the real plan , Congress has every right to balk .
So what should be done ?
Well , let ’s think about how , until Paulson hit the panic button , the private sector was supposed to work this out : financial firms were supposed to recapitalize , bringing in outside investors to bulk up their capital base .
That is , the private sector was supposed to cut off the problem at stage 2 .
It now appears that is n’t happening , and public intervention is needed .
But in that case , should n’t the public intervention also be at stage 2 — that is , should n’t it take the form of public injections of capital , in return for a stake in the upside ?
Let ’s not be railroaded into accepting an enormously expensive plan that does n’t seem to address the real problem .
Sarah Palin is accusing Barack Obama of “ palling around with terrorists . ”
But is n’t her husband a former member of a political party which has treason against the United States as its central tenet ?
Answer : yes .
This is not intended to be an analysis of the financial or economic merits of the rescue package published by the Bush administration yesterday afternoon .
Bush Proposal is a text provided by the New York Times .
I believe this proposal should be either stopped or drastically modified , and I would hope that the reasons I identify will prompt people to contact their Representatives and Senators to contribute to that purpose .
This proposal is in the long line of unconstitutional " faits accomplis " which the Bush administration has adopted as its preferred tactic in confronting any kind of emergency .
The practices and tactics which have been advocated and pursued on behalf of the conception of the unitary Presidency and the supra-legal doctrine of the spurious powers of the Commander - in - Chief are now being applied to the field of financial and economic policy making .
The unacceptable proposals , in my view , are these following .
What is objectionable about them ought to be enough to stall the whole package pending serious discussion .
1 ) there is a grant of absolute power to the Treasury Secretary
2 ) the Treasury Secretary ’s decisions are exempt from review
3 ) the proposal attempts to forbid judicial system review of the initiative .
These powers are more far - reaching than those claimed in the original enabling act used to take the country to war in Iraq .
They attempt to enshrine the principle of absolute power , shielded from legal and political review that has been the feature of this administration .
I am not aware of any precedent for the kind of powers claimed in this document from any stage in US history , be it Lincoln ’s war against the slave interest , or World War II .
If anyone does have access to precedent they should make it available .
In both these life and death conflicts Congress and the Judiciary continued to review Executive Branch decisions and actions ( Harry Truman 's investigations of contractor malfeasance ) .
What is there about this crisis which requires the scrapping of the constitution when this has been sacrosanct and unthinkable , even in war time .
There are political and economic issues to be discussed about the financial and economic situation .
The US way has always been to discuss openly , weigh merits , consider both the informed opinion of experts as well as general opinion of electorate and population before making reasoned decisions on the merits , bearing in mind circumstances and conditions , unknowns , consequences and contingencies .
This kind of deliberative process produces prudent chooses of action not rash leaps into the unknown .
This kind of procedure is typically identified as “ democratic ” .
What has been put on the table would outlaw that approach .
What goes into decisions would be the province of the executive branch , there would be no recourse against the decisions made , nor the people involved in making them .
Neither would there be opportunity to challenge , discuss , and rebut the evidence or arguments mustered in support of such decisions .
Where such ideas come from is anybody ’s guess , but for sure they are not American .
Congress should not be stampeded into passing this kind of enabling legislation which appears to be based on retreading claims to supreme unchecked power and contentions that unprecedented emergency conditions require that proven and tested methods ( Constitutional system ) be scrapped in favor of the arbitrary , the willful , and mostly likely the unchecked and the incompetent because people with their agenda to push have decided it is now out of date .

Obama and McCain , substance and celebrity
Barack Obama brought up John McCain ’s instantly infamous campaign commercial featuring Britney Spears and Paris Hilton today , asking McCain , “ [ I ]s that the best you can come up with ?
Is that really what this election is about ?
Is that what is worthy of the American people ? ”
As it turns out , McCain was asked about the same ad today at an event in Racine , Wis .
Woman asking question : “ First of all , Sen. McCain , I want to commend you on your service for our country .
But earlier this year in April , you made comments about the mudslinging and how it had been affecting the other campaigns and how you did n’t want to do that .
But recently , especially last week when Obama went to Europe , it seems like there were a lot of campaign ads that you put out that were doing that .
And the one yesterday comparing him to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , I was like , ‘ OK . ’
So it seems like to Americans like me and other people that you may have flip - flopped on what you said earlier .
And what is your response to that ? ”
McCain : “ First of all , let me say there are differences , and we are drawing those differences .
And I said earlier , I admire his campaign .
But what we are talking about here is substance and not style .
And what we are talking about is who has an agenda for the future of America .
Campaigns are tough , but I ’m proud of the campaign that we have run .
I ’m proud of the issues that we have been trying to address with the American people ….
So , all I can say is that we are proud of that commercial . ”
A lot of reporters are seizing on the fact that McCain is “ proud ” of his ridiculous commercial , which is clearly odd .
But I was also struck by his insistence that “ what we are talking about here is substance and not style . ”
I did n’t see McCain ’s facial expression , but I ca n’t help but wonder if ( and how ) he kept a straight face .
Substance and not style ?
Has there been anything of any substance at all from the McCain campaign in months ?
I suppose there was at least some policy talk recently when McCain commented on his tax proposals , his position on affirmative action , his position on gay adoption , and his ideas for Social Security — but this “ substance ” did n’t last long , because McCain ’s campaign , in each instance , said he did n’t really mean what he was saying .
And speaking of all of this bizarre celebrity talk , Yglesias raises a point I ’ve been meaning to mention .
Pardon me if you ’ve seen this point elsewhere , but in what sense is John McCain not a celebrity ?
I ’ve seen him on the covers of magazines , on television , in newspapers , doing guest appearances on SNL , etc .
Could you possibly be a major party presidential nominee and not be a celebrity ?
But in particular , McCain actually stands out among politicians as being someone who was a famous celebrity first and then parlayed his fame into a political career , rather than merely being someone who ’s well - known for being an important politician .
Indeed , John Weaver , McCain ’s long - time friend and confidant , made a similar observation yesterday , saying , “ John ’s been a celebrity ever since he was shot down . ”
I suppose it ’s possible the McCain gang means that Obama is a celebrity in more of “ Hollywood ” fashion .
But that does n’t quite work either .
Take a look at McCain ’s IMDB page and tell me he does n’t qualify as a “ celebrity . ”
There ’s the guest role in “ Wedding Crashers , ” there ’s the film adaptation of his military career , there ’s the appearance on “ 24 , ” etc .
Put it this way — do you know who ’s made more appearances on “ The Daily Show ” than anyone in any field ?
John McCain .
Well , perhaps the McCain gang does n’t mean celebrity in a “ Hollywood ” sense , but more in the sense that people around the world admire Barack Obama , and are captivated by his candidacy .
And if that ’s what the McCain campaign means , they ’re going to have to do more to explain why that ’s a bad quality for an American president to have .
Welcome to reptile therapy - the slithery snake massage designed to help you relax
It 's a massage that is sure to make most people 's skin crawl , but one woman has got herself in a twist with her latest massage technique .
Ara Barak claims her pet snakes make the ideal masseurs as their slithering causes a massage sensation when placed on a person 's skin .
Ms Barak said she discovered her pet's ' therapeutic value ' after noticing her friends became more relaxed after holding them .
Meirav Stardinner receives a snake massage from Ada Barak who says her pets are high in ' therapeutic value '
' Some people said that holding the snakes made them feel better , relaxed , ' she said .
' One old lady said it was soothing , like a cold compress . '
The owner of Israel 's Barak 's Snake Spa said her pets are able to give massage as their slithering causes a rubbing sensation on the body .
Ms Barak had relied on exhibiting her scaly friends to make money , but found there is more cash rolling in from people wanting a massage - reptile therapy style .
Smaller snakes are used for lighter massage on areas such as the face while bigger ones are used to give deep tissue therapy
The larger snakes are used for deep massage while the smaller creatures are used to give a lighter touch - all for a mere £ 30 .
And those with a slight reluctance to have a snake massage will be pleased to know the reptiles are all non-venamous .
But if the thought of reptiles is too much , Ms Barak also offers a rodent - style massage where mouse and rats are placed on the bottom of people 's feet instead .
People are queuing up to try the unconventional massage technique
NEW YORK -
The long - awaited , breathlessly - rumored , Google - powered ( and still unavailable until next month ) G1 phone was unveiled today with a list price that undercuts Apple 's iPhone by $ 20 but with few design or software elements that had not been anticipated .
The handset is made by HTC and the service is provided by T - Mobile – but the buzz is all about the completely open source Android platform developed by Google , which allows third - party developers to create applications .
Indeed , it was the unadvertised appearance of Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin , 45 minutes into what had been a routine presentation , that energized the packed media room .
The pair skated onto the stage wearing rollerblades , perhaps taking a cue from the legendary , crowd - pleasing marketing prowess of Apple 's Steve Jobs .
“ I ’m a bit of a geek and I really like tinkering with things , ” Brin said , pulling one of the black flip phones out of his pocket ( also available in white and brown ) .
The G1 comes with three preinstalled applications that premiered in the Android developer contest : Ecorio , which measures your carbon footprint ; ShopSavvy ( formerly known as GoKart ) , which scans bar codes to compare prices ; and BreadCrumbz to create a step - by - step visual map using photos .
While it does n’t support DRM protected audio files , there is an
Amazon MP3 application with the option of purchasing music directly to the device .
One of the more interesting features is the built - in compass , which displays a 360 - degree Google Street view based on location .
Other
Google apps are also built right into the system , including support for
Gmail and YouTube videos .
As for the hardware , the 5.6 ounce device is 4.60 ” x 2.16 ” and .62 ”
thick , with a 3.17 ” display .
It is as predicted , a swivel , sidekick - like flip phone with a QWERTY keyboard , and 3.17 inch touch display screen .
The web browser is based on WebKit .
" You can think of it as ' Chrome Lite , ' " says Andy Rubin , senior director of mobile platforms .
The touchscreen works just like the iPhone , but uses what they call a “ long press ” to zoom in and select objects .
The interface is drag - and - drop .
The G1 will be released on Oct. 22 and is priced at $ 180 .
Current
T- Mobile customers can order it online today .
You need to purchase a data plan in addition to a required voice plan .
There are two service options available : a basic $ 25 limited data and SMS plan , or , for an extra 10 bucks you get unlimited messaging and internet .

A spike in salt concentration in ASEL ( left neuron ) activates expression that leads a worm to proceed in a straight line .
A dip in salt levels in ASER ( right neuron ) turns on a negative reaction that tells a worm to change to a turning movement to look around .
Graphic courtesy of Shawn Lockery
Thanks to salt and hot chili peppers , researchers have found a calculus - computing center that tells a roundworm to go forward toward dinner or turn to broaden the search .
It 's a computational mechanism , they say , that is similar to what drives hungry college students to a pizza .
These behavior - driving calculations , according to a paper published in the July 3 issue of the journal Nature , are done " in a tiny , specialized computer inside a primitive roundworm , " says principal investigator Shawn Lockery , a University of Oregon biologist and member of the UO Institute of Neuroscience .
In their paper , the researchers documented how two related , closely located chemosensory neurons , acting in tandem , regulate behavior .
The left neuron controls an on switch , while the opposing right one an off switch .
These sister neurons are situated much like the two nostrils or two eyes of mammals .
Together these neurons are known as ASE for antagonistic sensory cues .
It 's possible , Lockery said , that the discovery someday could help research aimed at treating at least some of the 200,000 people in the United States who annually seek medical treatment , according to records of the National Institutes of Health , for problems involving taste and smell .
" This computer does some nice calculus , differentiating the rate of change of the strength of various tastes , " Lockery said .
" The worm uses this information to find food and to avoid poisons . "
Lockery and colleagues predicted the existence of a derivative - crunching mechanism in the Journal of Neuroscience in 1999 based on findings that nematodes change directions based on taste and smell .
" In effect , they have two nostrils or two tongues but they are so close together that it is really like having one nostril or one tongue , and yet they find their way around quite effectively , " Lockery said .
" We knew from behavioral experiments that nematodes were doing the same thing that humans were doing , but only from the view of behavioral responses .
We did n't know what was going on in the brain . "
To get there , Lockery and colleagues used new imaging and molecular tools , along with some genetic engineering of their worms .
In one experiment , these chemosensory neurons carried a fluorescent protein that changed color based on neuronal activity .
In another experiment , the neurons carried receptor proteins that recognize capsaicin , the active component in chili peppers .
Researchers found that when concentrations of salt were high , fluorescent proteins change from blue to yellow , showing that the left neuron ( ASEL ) was active as the worms continued forward movement .
When salt levels were reduced , the right neuron ( ASER ) activated but generated a different behavior ; the worms began a turning , or searching , motion .
" At this point , we wanted to know if these neurons really are controlling behavior .
If ASEL really signals that things are getting better , then , if you could artificially activate ASEL the animals ought to go straight like a human going directly toward the pizza , " Lockery said .
" Conversely , if you activate the ASER the animals ought to turn to find their goal . "
Such was the case , according to the capsaicin - receptor experiment .
When the pepper ingredient was spread on turning worms with receptor proteins in the left neuron , they straightened their motion .
Likewise , capsaicin applied to worms with the receptors in their right neurons caused them to change from turning motion to forward crawling .
" We have discovered a tiny , specialized computer inside a primitive round worm , " Lockery said .
" The computer calculates the rate of change of the strengths , or concentrations , of various tastes .
The worm uses this information to find food and to avoid poisons . "
Evidence for such on and off switching cells in other chemosensory networks of mammals , he added , " There are strong indications that a similar device exists in the human nervous system . "

DETROIT ( AP )  Chrysler says it will cut 25 % of its salaried work force starting next month .
CEO Robert Nardelli says the moves are being made as the company " works to find new ways to operate . "
Chrysler , which has about 18,500 white - collar workers , also will cut a quarter of its contract employees — those who work for other companies under contract with the automaker .
About 5,000 workers are likely to lose their jobs , although the company would not say how many contract workers it has .
Vice Chairman and President Tom LaSorda said Friday that sales projections for the rest of this year and in 2009 are n't looking good , and he indicated more factory closings could be coming .
" We have to align our ( factory ) capacity with what 's going on at retail , " LaSorda said in an interview with Detroit radio station WWJ - AM .
" And that 's the tough decisions that we make .
And of course , there 's probably going to be more if it stays at this level . "
On Thursday , Chrysler announced it will cut 1,825 jobs by eliminating one shift at a Toledo , Ohio , Jeep plant and accelerating the closure of its sport- utility vehicle factory in Newark , Del. , because of the slowing global economy and a shift toward smaller vehicles .
" These are truly unimaginable times for our industry , " Nardelli said .
" We continue to be in the most difficult economic period most of us can remember .
The combination of troubled financial markets , difficult credit , volatile commodity prices , the housing crisis and declining consumer confidence continues to weigh on the economy .
Never before have auto industry sales contracted at such a fast rate , " he said .
Chrysler 's sales are down 25 % the first nine months of the year , worst decline of any major automaker .
In a memo to employees obtained by The Associated Press , Nardelli urged them to work hard to control expenses .
The company , he said , will eliminate some discretionary expenses and cut back others .
Details would be coming through managers , the memo said .
" As an additional cost savings measure , we also will be reducing capital expenditures , but I assure you that we are protecting all major product programs , " Nardelli wrote .
He also said the company will have to move faster to restructure .
" We recognize that in order to strengthen our competitive capability , and reduce the time and cost to achieve our objectives , we cannot operate as we have in the past , " he wrote .
" In the near future , we will be making organizational announcements as a result of restructuring actions reflecting the need to find new ways to operate . "
Chrysler 's owner , Cerberus Capital Management , is in talks to sell the company or merge with another .
Discussions are underway with General Motors Corp. and the combined Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA .

Just days after the New York Times , Scientific American , and other MSM outlets finally got wind that cannabis ’ germ - fighting properties can halt the spread of MRSA and other multi- drug resistant pathogens , along comes a second just - released study identifying several new non-cannabinoid compounds in the plant which possess anti-bacterial properties .
Investigators at the University of Mississippi report the discovery of eleven new non-cannabinoid constituents in cannabis , several of which possess “ anti-microbial ” ( think MRSA ) , “ anti-malarial , ” and “ anti-leishmanial ” ( a common skin parasite ) activity .
Scientists also reported that several of the compounds also possessed anti-inflammatory properties and acted as potent anti-oxidants .
( The US government , Depart of Health and Human Services actually holds a patent on the use of certain cannabinoids as anti-oxidants and neuroprotectants , which you can read here . )
In other words , when we speak about the healing powers of the cannabis plant , we really mean the entire cannabis plant .
We ’re not talking about isolating particular cannabinoids , and we ’re most certainly not suggesting patients be forced to consume an oral synthetic version of a single compound a la Marinol .
Therapeutic cannabis means just that — the therapeutic prowess of the whole plant .
We should not advocate for , or accept , anything less .

But is this claim really true ?
Are the lessons from this Connecticut decision ( and the California and Massachusetts marriage decisions ) really applicable to understanding Amendment 2 ?
Florida law explicitly prohibits marriage for same sex couples , and it further prohibits the recognition of same sex marriages performed elsewhere .
The question then becomes whether these laws violate the Florida Constitution .
I am pretty confident in saying that these marriage laws are in no danger of being ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court .
The proponents of Amendment 2 repeatedly argue that a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to opposite sex couples is needed to keep Florida courts from legalizing marriage for same sex couples .
They point to what happened in Connecticut just last week ( and in California last May ) , where the Connecticut Supreme Court held the ban on marriage for same sex couples violated the Connecticut Constitution .
According to a recent statement from the proponents of Amendment 2 , Connecticut 's decision is " the latest reminder of why we need Amendment 2 . "
Amendment 2 essentially has two parts : one that limits marriage to opposite sex couples , and a second that prohibits the recognition of any " legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof . "
Before I do a series of posts about the amendment 's " substantial equivalent " language , I wanted to address one of the main claims made by its proponents regarding the need to define marriage in the Florida Constitution .
Florida and Connecticut Are Not Analogous
The main problem with trying to draw lessons from Connecticut 's marriage opinion is that there is no legal support for the idea that Florida law is anywhere similar to Connecticut law , especially when it comes to those regulating LGBT individuals and their families .
The same can be said of trying to draw any analogies with Massachusetts or California law .
The recent Connecticut and California marriage cases did not just happen overnight .
In fact , these marriage opinions were based upon years of laws and court opinions that became increasingly more supportive of LGBT individuals and their families .
These states , along with their courts , have a long history of being supportive of gay rights and same sex relationships .
It is only because of this long history and full understanding of LGBT issues did these state supreme courts move toward marriage equality .
In fact , California and Connecticut have implemented some of the most extensive laws protecting and recognizing same sex relationships and their families .
• Connecticut was the first state to pass a civil unions law voluntarily ( Vermont was the first to offer civil unions , but only after the state supreme court required them to give equal rights to same sex couples ) .
• California implemented one of the first domestic partner laws , still one of the best in the country .
• California 's legislature approved a bill recognizing same sex marriage before it was vetoed by the governor .
In direct contrast , the Florida legislature and courts have not been supportive of LGBT rights .
The best you might be able to say about Florida law is that it is ambivalent about LGBT rights , but a more accurate description is that it is hostile .
Dating back to Anita Bryant in the 1970s , Florida has a long history of being hostile towards gays and lesbians .
Florida Explicitly Bans Adoption by Gays and Lesbians .
The most obvious example of Florida 's disdain for gays , lesbians , and their families is in its adoptions laws .
Florida is the only state that statutorily bans gays and lesbians from adopting children under any circumstance .
Recent attempts to change the adoption law have gone nowhere .
Almost three years ago , I attended the only state senate committee hearing that has directly addressed this issue .
I saw the children , including our own foster son , speak against this ban because it hurt them .
The bill essentially was stopped by the senate president because he deemed it " too controversial , " even though nobody spoke against it at the hearing .
The adoption ban has been upheld by state1 and federal2 courts .
Although there are current attempts to have this ban overturned , it is a long way ( if ever ) from being ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court , which is getting more socially conservative .
After years of Jeb Bush appointees ( which nobody will say were liberal on social issues ) , Florida 's current governor , Charlie Crist , has appointed two new justices with conservative records on social issues .
We ultimately do not know what the current justices will do with the adoption ban if it reaches them , but it clearly will be difficult to overturn in this environment .
One thing is pretty clear though .
If the Florida Supreme Court holds the adoption ban to be constitutional , I do n't see how it would turn around and make same sex marriage legal .
The reverse , however , is not true .
New York is a perfect example of this , where the state 's highest court extended adoption rights for a same sex co-parent while it later upheld the state 's ban on same sex marriage .
The reality is that most courts are more accepting of gays and lesbians adopting children but are not ready to make that leap to legalizing same sex marriage .
Just look at the evidence : a number of state courts have explicitly ruled that gays and lesbians can adopt , while only three states allow same sex marriage .
Florida Law is Not Heading Toward Being LGBT - Friendly .
Other legislative attempts at LGBT - friendly laws in Florida have seen similar fates as the efforts to remove the adoption ban .
The closest the legislature has come to anything gay - friendly recently is the passing of an anti-bullying ban for public school students .
The problem , however , was the legislature refused to enumerate sexual orientation as a protected class .
The best gay rights advocates have been able to do recently in this state is pass a broadly - worded anti-bullying measure that does not explicitly address sexual orientation !
This is the climate that LGBT people face in this state , so it is hard to imagine the Florida Supreme Court legalizing marriage for same sex couples .
Nobody can , therefore , credibly say Florida is anything like California , Connecticut , or Massachusetts .
These facts do n't even take into account that nobody is currently making a credible challenge to our marriage laws in the courts .
We all know how futile this would be .
In fact , a few years ago , a Miami attorney filed lawsuits challenging Florida 's marriage laws and the federal DOMA .
After losing in federal court , the lawsuits were withdrawn .
Many lawyers , including myself , cautioned that these lawsuits would only produce bad legal precedent that could later be used against the LGBT community .
Put simply , Florida 's marriage laws are in no immediate " danger " of being overturned by the Florida Supreme Court , eliminating any need for Amendment 2 .

Sarah Palin was back on the CBS Evening News with Kate Couric tonight , and she ducked , dodged , and gave half answers to questions about abortion , global warming , the environment and even what newspapers and magazines she reads to stay up on current events .
Here is the exchange between Palin and Couric over what newspapers and magazines she reads :
Palin : I ’ve read most of them , again with a great appreciation for the press , for the media .
Advertisements
Couric :
What , specifically ?
Palin :
Um , all of them , any of them that have been in front of me all these years .
Couric :
Can you name a few ?
Palin : I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news , too .
Alaska is n’t a foreign country , where it ’s kind of suggested , “ wow , how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington , D.C. , may be thinking when you live up there in Alaska ? ”
Believe me , Alaska is like a microcosm of America .
Palin was equally elusive on abortion and the morning after pill .
She refused to say if she thinks it should be illegal for a rape victim to have an abortion , “ I ’m saying that , personally , I would counsel the person to choose life , despite horrific , horrific circumstances that this person would find themselves in .
And , um , if you ’re asking , though , kind of foundationally here , should anyone end up in jail for having an … abortion , absolutely not .
That ’s nothing I would ever support . ”
In terms of tshe morning after pill , Palin refused to answer , and only said that it was a form of contraception that she would not choose to use .
Like most Christian fundamentalist conservatives , Palin seems to believe that evolution is a principle , not a fact , “ Oh , I think it should be taught as an accepted principle .
And , as you know , I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher , a science teacher , who has really instilled in me a respect for science .
It should be taught in our schools .
And I wo n’t deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth .
But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district .
Science should be taught it science class . ”
She also refused to say that global warming was completely man made , and gave the cyclical weather patterns answer , “ You know there are – there are man ’s activities that can be contributed to the issues that we ’re dealing with now , these impacts .
I ’m not going to solely blame all of man ’s activities on changes in climate .
Because the world ’s weather patterns are cyclical .
And over history we have seen change there .
But kind of does n’t matter at this point , as we debate what caused it .
The point is : it ’s real ; we need to do something about it . ”
This interview represented some progress for Palin , because when she did answer a question she expressed watered down versions of her views .
It seems that the McCain campaign is trying to moderate her views , because she appears to be a garden variety social conservative in the mold of George W. Bush .
This nothing maverick in her answers , just a whole lot of the same views on the issues that we have been hearing from the current White House for eight years .
Palin still dodged too many questions , and is running off of her script too often .
The reality is that the more America hears from Sarah Palin , the more she sounds like more of the same .

How the FDA extorts money from nutritional supplement companies
The Consent Decree
The truth is now subject to FDA approval
FDA tyranny unleashed
Surprise inspections , secret police and non -stop persecution
This brand of tyranny is reserved for health supplement companies
Sign this or you 'll be arrested
The FDA 's campaign of health illiteracy and enforced ignorance
It 's time to stop the FDA 's reign of terror over health supplements
We must stop the FDA now
What you can do right now to help halt the FDA 's reign of terror
Grab your cameras , folks
The Full Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction
( NaturalNews ) NaturalNews has learned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is running a criminal extortion racket designed to drain cash from health supplement companies and shift it into the pockets of top FDA contractors .
This organized crime operation has been running for years , and it has operated with impunity because each company targeted by the scam feels isolated and alone , unable to face the astronomical legal bills of going to court and battling the FDA .
So one by one , they agree to " settle " with the FDA for crimes they never committed .
Part of the settlement , of course , involves the payment of FDA employees or contractors who pocket the money extorted from health companies .
NaturalNews has interviewed executives from three different companies who have been targeted for extortion by U.S. Food and Drug Administration employees .
At their request , the names of those companies are being kept confidential until legal action being taken against them is resolved .
Interviews have been recorded , with permission , with two of those companies and will be released to the public at a later date .
Documents proving this FDA extortion racket are included here .
The FDA extortion racket works like this : FDA employees use keyword - scanning software to scan the web pages of natural health product and supplement companies , searching for terms like cancer , cures , treatment , remedies and other " forbidden " words .
FDA employees then review the discovered pages to determine if they contain any words that might inform consumers of the health benefits of the nutritional products .
FDA employees also look for links that might point web users to scientific articles from peer - reviewed medical journals that further explain the health benefits of specific foods , supplements or nutrients .
When offending words or links are found by the FDA , their extortion team goes into full swing .
First , they contact the company and warn them to remove all information and links from their websites .
This is the most important step from the FDA 's standpoint , because by doing this , they can keep the health - conscious public in a state of nutritional ignorance about the scientifically - supported healing properties of natural supplements .
Cherry products , for example , cannot link to scientific articles explaining the simple biological fact that cherries ease inflammation in human beings .
Such links are considered " drug claims " by the FDA .
NaturalNews has even learned that companies are now being targeted for simply posting customer testimonials , even when those testimonials make absolutely no health claims .
FDA and FTC agents are now threatening the owners of such companies with imprisonment if they do not immediately remove all customer testimonials from their websites and marketing materials .
If the company being targeted for extortion refuses to fully comply with the FDA 's requests to remove all educational information from their website , the FDA then escalates the extortion tactics by threatening the company principals with arrest and seizure unless they agree to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to top FDA contractors and sign a " consent decree " where the company " admits " to committing various crimes ( see below ) .
This consent decree is a blatant violation of the Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens , of course , and it violates numerous sections of the Bill of Rights ( Amendments # 1 and # 5 , at the very least ) .
The FDA employees or contractors receiving the extorted money , it is claimed , are being paid to " review web pages " to make sure they do n't contain anything that might inform consumers about the scientifically - validated benefits of the health products being sold .
FDA extortion agreements specify that FDA employees should be paid the rate of $ 100 per hour , with no limit on the number of hours they may bill the company for .
The extortion agreement also requires companies to pay for all the following : • $ 100 per hour for the travel time of FDA employees . •
Hotel rooms for FDA employees .•
Storage fees for all products seized by the FDA .
The same agreement also requires the company to comply with FDA demands by never placing any links or " illegal " information on its website , where " illegal " means anything that offers an accurate description of the health benefits offered by natural health products .
Part of the FDA 's strategy for oppression and control is to force targeted companies to sign a " consent decree " where they admit to crimes they never committed .
NaturalNews obtained a copy of a public court document the FruitFast company was forced to sign due to FDA threats and extortion tactics .
You can view this document yourself at : https://www.naturalnews.com/investigations/Fr...
This document requires the FruitFast company to admit to crimes it did not commit ; namely : What " drugs " did the FruitFast company introduce that were " misbranded ? " , it turns out .
Cherry juice concentrate was being sold with the accurate statement that it helped eliminate gout ( which it does ) .
This , according to the FDA , was enough to magically transform cherry juice into an " unapproved drug " and cause it to be " misbranded .
"
It also requires targeted companies to contractually agree that they have :
This means , of course , that these companies can no longer even LINK to other websites , including websites of scientific journals that discuss the proven health benefits of such natural products ( foods , herbs , etc . )
Once a company removes all educational information and links from their website , they are then required to submit to draconian measures of " censorship enforcement " by the FDA .
This is fully explained in this section of the FDA 's Consent Decree : ( bolding added for emphasis ) Furthermore , the FDA then requires that the company being targeted by the extortion racket hire a person ( called the " expert " ) to enforce all this censorship the company has agreed to .
As you 'll note in the language below , this " expert " must be paid $ 100 an hour , for an unlimited number of hours , to conduct surprise inspections of the company 's administrative offices , warehouses and fulfillment centers :
In other words , this section requires the company being targeted to pay the " Expert " huge fees to make sure it does n't " illegally " link to other websites that might tell the truth about the health products in question .
So what happens if the company slips up and does something illegal like , let 's say , posting a clickable link to a science journal that discusses research citing the health benefits of cherries ?
As you 'll see below , , including the seizure of all company assets and the arrest of its principals .
Specifically , the Consent Decree forces company owners to agree to the following : Just to keep the targeted company in a state of constant fear ( which is why I have labeled the FDA a terrorist organization ) , the FDA forces it to agree totake any other measures necessary to monitor and ensure continuing compliance with the terms of this Decree .
During such inspections , FDA representatives shall be permitted prompt access to buildings , equipment , in - process and finished materials , containers , labeling and other materials therein ; ; to take samples of Defendants ' finished and unfinished materials and products , containers , labels , labeling , and other promotional materials ; and to examine and copy all records relating to the receipt , manufacture , processing , packing , labeling , promoting , holding , and distribution of any and all Defendants ' products in order to ensure continuing compliance with the terms of this Decree .
The inspections shall be permitted upon presentation of a copy of this Decree and appropriate credentials .
The inspection authority granted by this Decree is separate from , and in addition to , the authority to conduct inspections under the Act , 21 U.S.C. § 374 .
And just to make sure the company is further driven into bankruptcy , the FDA requires them to PAY for all these surprise " compliance " investigations !
As stated in the Consent Decree : Are you getting the picture here ?
The FDA can simply show up on a " surprise " inspection , bring ten FDA agents , bill the company for thousands of hours , and bankrupt the company while padding its own pockets .
Does n't this sound a lot like the King 's Consent Decree against the American colonies ?
The FDA 's agreement reads amazingly like a document a King might force his subjects to sign as he 's taking over their land and gold , imprisoning them in his kingdom .
But it gets better :
The FDA also requires the Defendants to reveal all sorts of details about their business operations :
And finally , just to make sure everybody knows who 's in charge , here 's what the agreement says about final judgment :
In other words , the FDA is the King .
It is above the law .
It answers to no one but itself .
Welcome to the United States of Tyranny , FDA style .
The full text of the FDA 's agreement , including the names of the top FDA criminals who signed it , is included at the end of this article .
While the FDA gives drug companies a free pass of easy approval for dangerous drugs , this Consent Decree is the kind of treatment it slams down upon health product companies .
As you can see from the text in the decree , above , this isAny company signing this document gives the FDA all the tools it needs to drive that company completely out of business .
Sadly , dozens of companies have signed this in just the last year .
The FDA 's reign of terror is working .
It 's putting health companies out of business and forcing them to censor themselves .
It even forces them toto information sources like NaturalNews.com or peer - reviewed science journals .
This is all part of the FDA's .
It is a secret war being fought out of the view of the mainstream media ( which refuses to report this story ) and far from the scrutiny of the U.S. Dept. of Justice ( which does n't care about the real tyrants running loose in this country ) .
As I have often stated here on NaturalNews.com , .
By itself , it is negligent in the deaths of tens of millions of Americans , and it has taken it upon itself to increase the body count by making sure consumers have zero access to honest , truthful , scientifically - validated information about the healing properties of health supplements .
The FDA , by any account , is a much greater threat to the security and safety of the American people than any terrorist group , and if the U.S. really wanted to fight terror and tyranny , it would start by arresting top FDA officials at gunpoint .
Those targeted for arrest and prosecution should also include the lawyers and paper pushers involved in this very agreement ( see their names on the legal documents at the end of this article ) .
In my view , these people are the real criminals at work here .
They are the masterminds of this campaign of extortion and terror being leveled against health companies by the rogue U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Much like Hitler 's top generals , they play an important role in the mass disinformation that 's resulting in the needless death of millions of people .
By any account , they are all guilty of crimes against humanity and should be arrested and prosecuted as such .
We should all be so fortunate to live to the day where we can see these white - collar criminals behind bars , perhaps sharing their jail cells with other war criminals from the Bush Administration .
What you have n't yet seen in all this is the barrage of threats leveled against companies if they do n't sign this Consent Decree !
Company executives receive both written and verbal threats from top FDA " enforcement officers " who claim they will " throw you in prison " if you do n't sign the agreement .( much like a Nazi Gestapo officer ) whose job it is to walk the show floor and threaten companies into compliance .
This includes shows like Expo West and Expo East , where show organizers also serve as de facto FDA agents themselves , barring the participation of exhibitors who dare to tell the truth about their natural products .
This smacks of KGB secret police operations in the former Soviet Union .
But secret FDA police are now a reality in the United States of America .
NaturalNews has learned of numerous verbal threats from FDA compliance officers directed at health supplement companies during trade shows , including threats to " put you out of business , " " throw you in prison " or " take every last dollar you 've ever earned . "
FDA compliance officers are the foot soldiers of the agency 's war against the truth .
They seek out any health claim that might inform consumers about the properties of nutritional supplements , then they work to squash such statements before they become too well known .
In essence , they are censorship officers who enforce nutritional illiteracy and prevent knowledge from being shared .
As such , they are acting not merely as secret police on a mission to destroy small American businesses ; they are actually agents of disinformation , bent on destroying knowledge and enforcing a system of mandatory ignorance .
This is entirely consistent with the FDA 's history of ordering the destruction of recipe books that promoted the use of the natural herb stevia , among many other examples of information suppression .
It is the FDA 's position that there is no such thing as any food , beverage , supplement or herb that has any health benefit whatsoever .
Merely making such a claim instantly qualifies your product as a " new and unapproved drug , " according to the FDA .
Officially , the FDA claims all health products are inert and have no properties other than their macronutrients ( fiber , carbohydrates , protein , etc . ) .
There is only one class of substances that have any biological effect on the human body , the FDA claims : Pharmaceuticals .
Only those patented , synthetic chemicals are allowed to be described as having benefits to human health .
This convenient position is entirely consistent with the protection of the profits of drug companies .
It 's no coincidence that the drug companies fund the FDA through " user fees , " and most FDA employees are dependent on drug company money ... except , of course , those FDA people earning their living by extorting millions of dollars from health product companies .
The upshot of the FDA 's campaign against health supplements is that most of the American people remain nutritionally illiterate , oblivious to the scientifically - validated health benefits offered by tens of thousands of different nutrients , plants , supplements and products .
To say that zinc speeds healing , or that vitamin D prevents cancer , or that resveratrol lowers high cholesterol is common sense in the scientific community , but it 's a crime in the eyes of the FDA .
It is time to end the FDA 's extortion racket , restore Free Speech rights to health supplements , and bring the organized crime kingpins at the FDA to justice .
NaturalNews is organizing a list of companies who wish to help fund legal action against the FDA .
We intend to take part in a lawsuit against the FDA that would reign in the FDA 's control over nutritional supplements and defend health freedoms for American consumers .
To do this , we need to gather information from those companies who are willing to help fund this legal action , which may cost several hundred thousand dollars .
at [ email protected ]
Simply email us your name and contact phone number .
We 'll contact you to continue the conversation .
Any information sent to us is kept strictly confidential .
We will refuse to turn over such information even with a court order .
With enough support from the natural products community , we will take part in the reporting and grassroots organization of this legal action .
It is the belief of NaturalNews that , using the exact same extortion tactics as the Mob .
Through intimidation , censorship and threats of imprisonment , the FDA is right now extorting tens of millions of dollars from the very same health supplement companies you depend on to bring you lifesaving , disease - reversing products .
Even worse , the FDA is getting away with it .
Backed by the threat of imprisonment and the ability to conduct armed raids against health product companies ( see the history of armed FDA raids against vitamin companies here : https://www.naturalnews.com/021791.html ) , the FDA is able to overpower health product companies when they stand alone ..
A lone villager cannot defend himself against a band of marauders , but an organized and well - defended band of villagers can fight off attackers many times their size .
If it wishes to survive , the natural products industry must band together and defend itself against the FDA .
It must take back its right to tell the truth about health supplements , and it must forever banish censorship and ignorance from the health products marketplace .
The FDA will not stop its reign of terror , you see , until every health supplement companies is silenced , every company founder is imprisoned and every consumer is enslaved in a state of outright nutritional illiteracy .
They will seize products and let them rot in warehouses ; they 'll recruit armed law enforcement personnel to conduct SWAT - style raids on vitamin shops ; they 'll extort millions of dollars from health companies and pocket the profits ; and they 'll do it all while burning taxpayer dollars and claiming they 're working to " protect " consumers from natural health products like , which is of course so incredibly dangerous that we need an entire government agency just to make sure we do n't find out it might ease arthritis inflammation .
As a consumer , you can use your voice to help stop the FDA from destroying the natural products marketplace .
Simply go to www.ReformFDA.org and sign the petition there .
It 's sponsored by the American Association for Health Freedom ( AAHF ) , an organization fighting to end the FDA 's tyrannical rule over the health of the American people .
Sign that petition and spread the word : NaturalNews and the AAHF are working together to bring back honesty , freedom and free speech to the health supplements industry , and we need your help to get it done .
You can also .
Contact them and insist that they support efforts to end the reign of FDA tyranny and reestablish Free Speech rights for nutritional supplement companies .
Notably , Rep. Ron Paul has sponsored the Health Freedom Protection Act , which you can read here : http://www.StopFDACensorship.org
Finally , NaturalNews urges those in the natural health community to go out andand start snapping photos of rogue FDA agents arresting people , seizing products , accepting bribes or other outrageous acts .
We cannot simply lie down and let the FDA march in to our company warehouses and seize products ..
It 's up to you to get that video recorded and get it to us here at Natural News .
Use our feedback form to contact us : www.NaturalNews.com/feedback.html
We 've also opened up an audio tips line , where FDA employees who wish to leak information to Natural News can anonymously call us and leave a message : ( 323 ) 924-1664 With your help , we will soon start publishing videos and photos showing FDA agents directly engaged in acts of tyranny against health companies .
And for those who'd like to earn some extra money snapping photos , for photos of FDA " compliance officers " walking trade show floors where they threaten companies in person .
Contact us for details if you 're a photographer with a long lens who would like to start earning money snapping photos of FDA agents engaged in their dirty work .
It 's time to shed light on the real actions of the FDA .
We can no longer sit back and allow this criminal organization to operate in secret .
But grabbing the public 's attention all comes down to .
This is the YouTube era .
If it 's not on video , it does n't exist .
But if it 's on video , we can likely get it on mainstream news .
( I can see it now : the FDA raids a warehouse and handcuffs the screaming , crying business owner .
And why ?
Because their bottle said , " Eases inflammation . "
The public wo n't stand for it . )
The FDA , of course , will have its own people doing the same thing to people like me .
They 're trying to catch us eating at McDonald 's or going through the local pharmacy drive - thru .
All I can say about that is they 'll be waiting a long , long time to see that day !.
We the People must either prevail in this fight for our freedom , or we will all end up illiterate , imprisoned or silenced .
The FDA will take away your rights , your speech and your health , and it will laugh all the way to the bank while it steals your hard - earned money .
It will break every law , ignore every court order and commit every crime necessary to bring health companies into line ...
UNLESS we fight back and do our part to end this grave threat to our health , safety and freedoms .
The FDA is the enemy of the People .
It is a criminal organization bent on destroying American freedoms and consumer health .
It operates with impunity , using its own secret compliance officers , wreaking death and destruction across our nation like a dark plague unleashed .
If we hope to ever regain our health , our freedoms and the basic human right to tell the truth about the healing properties of simple foods , then we must bring this agency to justice and prosecute its mob bosses for their many crimes against the People .
It is time to stand up for your health freedoms , or lose them forever .
Please join me in this courageous stand against tyranny and oppression . -

Hey , what did Larry King ever do to anybody ?
Nothing , aides to Senator John McCain said .
Still , Mr. McCain will no longer be sitting down with Mr. King on CNN on Tuesday , as punishment for what his aides said was an unfair interview of a McCain campaign spokesman by the network host Campbell Brown on Monday night .
Wolf Blitzer , the CNN anchor , announced the news on Tuesday afternoon , saying , “ A senior McCain adviser tells CNN the interview has been pulled because of a segment CNN ran last night during Campbell Brown ’s ‘ Election Central . ’ ”
In that segment , Ms. Brown had sharply questioned Tucker Bounds , a campaign spokesman , after he said that the role of Mr. McCain ’s running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard was an example of executive experience that Senator Barack Obama of Illinois did not have .
“ Can you tell me one decision that she made as commander in chief of the Alaska National Guard , just one ? ” Ms. Brown asked .
Mr. Bounds responded , “ Any decision she has made as the commander of the National Guard that ’s deployed overseas is more of a decision Barack Obama ’s been making as he ’s been running for president for the last two years . ”
Ms. Brown pressed again , saying : “ So tell me .
Tell me .
Give me an example of one of those decisions . ”
To which Mr. Bounds said , “ Campbell , certainly you do n’t mean to belittle every experience , every judgment she makes as commander . ”
The argument devolved from there , with no real resolution .
Mr. Blitzer said , “ CNN does not believe that exchange was over the line . ”
It was just one of several arguments the campaign had with news organizations over various reports about Ms. Palin on Tuesday , including with ABC News and The New York Times .
“ As a presidential campaign , we reserve the right to adjust Senator McCain ’s media schedule in order to ensure the most effective use of his time , ” said Maria Comella , a spokeswoman .
“ After a relentless refusal by certain on - air reporters to come to terms with John McCain ’s selection of Alaska ’s sitting governor as our party ’s nominee for vice president , we decided John McCain ’s time would be better served elsewhere . ”
She added that the campaign meant no offense to Mr. King .
Explica la Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana que el déficit en competitividad frena el desarrollo de México
La crisis financiera internacional no significa el fracaso del modelo de libre competencia , pues en la recuperación de sus principios está la solución , afirmó el presidente de la Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana ( Coparmex ) , Ricardo González Sada .
En la inauguración del Encuentro Empresarial de la Coparmex , responsabilizó a monopolios públicos y privados de hacer mucho daño al país , igual que " la cultura de privilegios y de cotos de poder " .
Pidió abandonar tradiciones cerradas " de privilegios y corporativismo clientelar " , ya que mientras otros países aceptaron las nuevas reglas y se preparan para competir , " aquí seguimos boicoteándonos unos a otros , se obstruye cualquier tentativa de cambio sólo para mantener beneficios exclusivos o de grupo " .
Muchas de las causas de las crisis y de los problemas de México se deben al olvido y a la distorsión de los principios de competencia genuina , cuando la solución está en recuperar esos principios y adaptarlos a los nuevos tiempos , dijo González Sada .
" Así como un marco de competencia desvirtuado genera estancamiento , inequidad social y crisis económica , la competencia genuina beneficia al consumidor y produce prosperidad para todos " , aseguró el dirigente de la Coparmex .
Los empresarios , añadió , quieren una competencia donde no haya obstáculos que limitan el acceso al mercado , " donde se garantice la libertad y la equidad en las condiciones de participación , donde haya reglas que den visibilidad y pongan la cancha pareja " .
Advirtió que el déficit en materia de competitividad es uno de los grandes frenos para México , y confió que esta crisis represente para los mexicanos oportunidades para aprender y asimilar , " para cambiar y unirnos en lo esencial y en lo que a todos nos conviene " .
Son momentos decisivos para lograr acuerdos y concretar las decisiones que no se pudieron tomar cuando hubo holgura para hacerlo .
La tarea , insistió , es afinar el marco de competencia para hacer más competente al país .
" Si nos resistimos a la corriente o hacemos cambios cosméticos ( en competencia ) , sólo vamos a posponer las soluciones que tal vez con otra crisis tendremos que tomar inevitablemente y en una posición más difícil " .
El presidente de la Coparmex reconoció que son momentos difíciles , pero aseguró que hay elementos para resistir los embates , por lo que pidió no perder las expectativas y aprovechar la coyuntura para salir fortalecidos .

After the unbearably painful performance by Palin during her recent interview with Katie Couric , it ’s obvious to most that she is not ready for the Vice Presidential debate next week .
Whether the interview is the reason , or only part of the reason that McCain has fled his own debate with Barack Obama scheduled for Friday is n’t entirely clear .
The McCain camp has requested that the Presidential debate be moved to the date of the Vice Presidential debate , conveniently delaying the Vice Presidential debate to an unknown date in the future .
Presumably this will give Palin some much - needed extra time to bone up on all the things she would have learned if she had ever studied or participated in international diplomacy , and matters outside the state of Alaska .
It ’s also not clear yet , whether this “ delay tactic ” is going to work .
Barack Obama has said that if McCain does n’t show up to the debate , he ’ll be there to hold a Town Hall meeting instead , leaving the Vice Presidential debate to go on as scheduled .
Interesting …
“ Delay ” is apparently the theme of the day for our Republican VP nominee .
Today we hear that Palin has requested , and received a four day extension for the disclosure of her personal finances .
The new release date for these forms ?
October 3rd , the day AFTER her scheduled debate with Joe Biden .
Trevor Potter , general counsel for the McCain - Palin campaign , told the FEC that the campaign initially thought it had until Oct. 4 to file the report but then learned the FEC set an earlier due date .
Oops .
They forgot to check the date .
Those silly McCain people …
I bet they felt really stupid .
But now that they ’ve got their dates straight , they ’ve got to tread very carefully with this one .
Ask indicted Alaska Senator Ted Stevens , who is facing seven felony counts for filing false financial disclosure forms .
Ask Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich who just got in a little hot water himself because his federal and state forms did n’t match .
[ The forms will ] show whether she and her husband , Todd , hold any mortgages for real estate investments , and roughly how much any property held for investment purposes is worth .
The financial reports that Sarah Palin filed as Alaska governor list property the couple held at that point , but not how much it was worth ; how much , if any , profit they made on real estate sales ; or how much , if any , mortgage debt they held .
Such information is a standard part of the personal financial disclosure reports that members of Congress , administration officials and federal candidates must file each year .
The reports allow the public to see whether politicians may be receiving favorable financial treatment from people with issues before government or have any potential conflicts of interest .
They also offer a glimpse of their ability to manage their personal finances .
Another extension may be filed , but the last possible date for the extension is October 6 .
Will there be any interesting little surprises there ?

LOGGING on to Gmail or other e-mail service has become a routine of daily life , completed without a thought .
What would you do , however , if you woke up tomorrow , plugged in your user name and password as you always do , but then received an unfamiliar message : “ User name and password do not match ” ?
If you ’re a Gmail user , what you ’ll want to do after a few more unsuccessful , increasingly frantic attempts is to speak with a Google customer support representative , post haste .
But that ’s not an option .
Google does n’t offer a toll - free number and a live person to resolve the ordinary user ’s problems .
Discussion forums abound with tales of woe from Gmail customers who have found themselves locked out of their account for days or even weeks .
They were innocent victims of security measures , which automatically suspend access if someone tries unsuccessfully to log on repeatedly to an account .
The customers express frustration that they can’t speak with anyone at Google after filling out the company ’s online forms and waiting in vain for Google to restore access to their accounts .
Tom Lynch , a software entrepreneur who lives near Austin , Tex. , discovered early last month that he had been locked out of both Gmail accounts he used ; he had no idea why .
He received boilerplate instructions for recovering his accounts that did not apply to his particular circumstances , which included his failing to maintain a non-Gmail e-mail account as a back - up .
He said it took him four weeks , including the use of a business directory and talking with anyone he could find at Google , before he succeeded in having service restored .
Linux Foundation is organizing a end user collaboration summit this week .
A major topic will be a presentation on the new upcoming filesystems – Ext4 and Btrfs .
Ted Tso , who is a Linux kernel filesystem developer on a sabbatical from IBM working for Linux Foundation for a year , has talked about the two - pronged approach for the Linux kernel , taking a incremental approach with Ext4 while simultaneously working on the next generation filesystem called btrfs .
Read more for details .
Ext4 , a incremental revision of ext3 is built from the same codebase and compatible to it while providing better performance and scalability but there are limitations to what can be done in a compatible manner .
Btrfs is now a multi-vendor effort from Red Hat , HP , IBM and Oracle allowing a common pool to save costs of development and will provide a number of additional features which requires a fundamental redesign .
These new features are expected to include storage pools , writeable recursive snapshots , fast file checking and recovery , easy large storage management , proactive error management , better security , large scalability and fast incremental backup .
In reality most users do n’t have databases large enough to require some of the most advanced functions but like so many technology battles , it comes down to bragging rights and engineering pride .
While Ext4 has long been merged into the Linux kernel as a development filesystem , it is getting closer to being marked as stable and beginning to see adoption from Linux distributions .
Fedora 9 already includes ext4 as a technology preview and Fedora 10 will make it simpler for end users to adopt it as well although ext3 remains the default for Fedora and many major distributions .
Andrew Morton , a core Linux developer has indicated that he would like to get btrfs merged as early as 2.6.29 though it will be marked as a development or experimental feature for a while .
This will allow btrfs to progress further as part of the Linux kernel development and will likely be the default for major distributions sometime in the future .
The next method I ’m going to cover in Enumerating Enumerable — the series of articles in which I try to do a better job of documenting Ruby ’s Enumerable module than Ruby - Doc.org does — is inject , a.k.a. reduce .
Not only is it one of the trickiest methods to explain , it ’s also one of the cornerstones of functional programming .
I thought that I ’d take a little time to explain what the function does .
inject
The term inject comes from Smalltalk and is n’t terribly descriptive .
I remember reading the documentation for it and being all confused until I saw some examples .
I then realized that I ’d seen this function before , but under two different names .
reduce
The second name by which I encountered this function is reduce , and it was at Burning Man 1999 .
I was to start a new job the week after Burning Man , and I had to learn at least some basic Python by then .
So along with my camping gear , accordion and a kilo of candy for barter , I also brought my laptop ( a 233 Mhz Toshiba Sattelite with a whopping 96 MB of RAM ) and O’Reilly ’s Learning Python and noodled during the downtime ( early morning and afternoon ) on Python 1.6 .
When I got to covering the reduce function , I was confused until I saw some examples , after which I realized that I ’d seen that function before , but under a different name .
( You may have also heard of reduce through Google ’s much - vaunted MapReduce programming model . )
fold
The first name by which I encountered this function is fold , or more specifically , “ fold left ” or “ foldl ” , and it was at the “ Programming Paradigms ” course I took at Crazy Go Nuts University .
“ Programming Paradigms ” was a second - year course and had the reputation of being the most difficult course in the computer science curriculum .
The intended purpose of this course was to provide students with an introduction to functional programming ( these days , they use Haskell and Prolog , back then , it was Miranda ) .
Its actual effect was to make most of the students swear off functional programming for the rest of their lives .
In spite of the trauma from this course , I ended up remembering a lot from it that I was able to apply , first to Python and now to Ruby .
One of these things is a cute little trick for cememnting in your mind what fold does .
What Ruby - doc.org Says
Before I cover that cute little trick , let ’s take a look at what Ruby - doc.org ’s documentation has to say about Enumerable ‘s inject method .
One thing you ’ll find at Ruby - doc.org is that as of Ruby 1.8.7 and later , inject gained a synonym : the more familiar term reduce .
As for the description of the inject / reduce method , I do n’t find it terribly helpful :
Combines all elements of enum by applying a binary operation , specified by a block or a symbol that names a method or operator .
If you specify a block , then for each element in enum < i > the block is passed an accumulator value ( < i > memo ) and the element .
If you specify a symbol instead , then each element in the collection will be passed to the named method of memo .
In either case , the result becomes the new value for memo .
At the end of the iteration , the final value of memo is the return value fo the method .
If you do not explicitly specify an initial value for memo , then uses the first element of collection is used as the initial value of memo .
( Yes , those stray < i > tags are part of the text of the description for inject .
Hopefully they ’ll fix that soon . )
This confusing text becomes a little clearer with some examples .
The most typical example of inject / reduce / fold in action is the classic “ compute the sum of the numbers in this range or array ” problem .
There are a number of approaches you can take in Ruby , all of which use inject / reduce :
( 1..8 ) .reduce ( :+) => 36 ( 1..8 ) . reduce {|sum , number| sum += number} => 36 ( 1..8 ) .reduce (0 ) {|sum , number| sum += number} => 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ( 1 .. 8 ) . reduce ( : + ) = > 36 ( 1 .. 8 ) . reduce { | sum , number | sum += number } = > 36 ( 1 .. 8 ) . reduce ( 0 ) { | sum , number | sum += number } = > 36
The reduce method takes some kind of operation and applies it across the enumerable to yield a single result .
In this case , the operation is addition .
Explaining how that operation is applied is a little trickier , but I do just that in the next section .
Demonstrating inject / reduce / fold With a Piece of Paper and Literal Folding
To explain what ’s happening in the code above , I ’m going to do use a piece of paper .
I ’ve folded it into 8 even sections and then numbered each section , as shown in the photo below :
Think of the paper as the range ( 1..8 ) .
We ’re now going to compute the sum of the numbers in this range , step by step , using a literal fold — that is , by folding the paper .
I ’m going to start folding from the left side of the paper , and when I do , I ’m going to add the numbers that I ’m folding into each other .
In the first fold , I ’m folding the number 1 onto the number 2 .
Adding these two numbers yields 3 , which I write on the back of the fold :
For the second fold , I fold the first number 3 onto the second number 3 .
The sum of these two numbers is 6 , and I write that on the back of the resulting fold :
I fold again : this time , it ’s the number 6 onto the number 4 , the sum of which is 10 .
I write that number down on the resulting fold :
Next , I fold 10 onto 5 , yielding the number 15 :
I then fold 15 onto 6 , which gives me 21 :
Next comes 21 folded onto 7 , which makes for a sum of 28 :
And finally , 28 folded onto 8 , which gives us a final total of 36 .

If past elections are any indication , over 1.5 million Canadians just voted in the 2008 federal election without ever seeing the Conservative party ’s plan for the country .
Across Canada , advanced polling stations were open for voters on October 3 , 4 , and 6 .
But the Conservative Party did not issue its platform for the 2008 federal election until Tuesday ( October 7 ) .
The Bloc Québécois , Greens , Liberals , and New Democrats all released full - length party platforms before the end of September .
Susan Friend , an Elections Canada spokesperson for B.C. , told the Straight that the official number of Canadians that voted early will be available on Wednesday or Thursday ( October 8 or 9 ) .
But if past elections are any indication , the number will surpass 1.5 million .
According to statistics made available by Elections Canada , 1,561,039 Canadians took advantage of early polling station in the 2006 federal election .
183,861 of those votes were cast by British Columbians .
The number of Canadians voting early has increased every election for as far back as Elections Canada makes statistics available .
In the 1997 federal election , 704,336 Canadians voted early ; in 2000 , that number was 775,157 ; in 2004 , it was 1,248,469 ; and , in 2006 , 1,561,039 ballots were cast before the official election date .

Bell Canada Inc. has been illegally charging ExpressVu television customers a monthly late fee , an Ontario court has ruled in a case that has implications for other service providers .
In a ruling released late Monday , Ontario Superior Court Justice Paul Perell found the company 's $ 25 late fee — which is tacked on top of interest charges — was illegal under the Criminal Code .
The company has been charging the fee to about 33,000 of its 1.7 million ExpressVu satellite customers each month , according to court documents .
The class - action lawsuit was filed in 2005 by Peter De Wolf , a resident of Braeside , Ont. , near Ottawa .
De Wolf said he paid the fee 10 times between January 2001 and May 2006 and , coupled with interest charges , it totalled more than 60 per cent of his bill , an amount that is illegal under federal law .
De Wolf 's lawyer said the decision was a big win for consumers .
" It 's going to have implications well beyond this particular service provider charging late fees , " she said .
" We 're aware that Bell ExpressVu 's competitors engage in the same practice ....
We certainly know the late fees levied are comparable . "
Mark Langton , a spokesman for Bell , said the company was still reviewing the decision .
He would n't say whether the company will appeal .
Rebate to be determined
A separate hearing will be held to determine how much money Bell is on the hook to repay .
Bell had argued the late fee was not an interest charge but rather a cost the company incurred for collecting overdue bills , a position Justice Perell found had little basis in fact .
" I regard this as an absurd result that reveals that ExpressVu 's argument is unsound , " he said in his decision .
Bell is embroiled in a host of other class - action lawsuits .
Along with Canada 's other wireless companies , Bell is being sued for allegedly misrepresenting the system access fee charged to cellphone subscribers as a government charge .
It is also being sued for throttling internet speeds and , along with Telus Corp. , for imposing charges on incoming text messages .

WASHINGTON --
The Food and Drug Administration released proposed guidelines on how to regulate genetically engineered animals , in a move that is expected to pave the way for them to enter the food supply .
The biotech industry has long sought to use such technology on fish , pigs , cattle and other animals to produce ones that grow faster or possess desirable traits , such as high fiber content or resistance to illnesses such as mad -cow disease .
According ...
It is illegal to make false claims in a TV or radio commercial unless you are running for political office .
If you ’re selling toothpaste , your claims must be vetted by legal and medical professionals .
But not if you ’re selling a candidate .
If you ’re selling a candidate , not only can you lie about his record , but more to the point , you can lie about his opponent .
These lies are seen and heard by millions , not only when they run as paid advertisements , but also when they are run again for free on 24 - hour news networks hungry for controversy .
And after they are run for free , they become talking points in an “ unbiased ” conversation that pretends there are two sides to every story , even when one side is lies .
Two words : Swift Boat .
Lies , and a candidate ’s embarrassing efforts to brush them aside , fill the news cycle and constitute the national discourse .
And this terrifying and morally indefensible rupture from reality persists even when the country is on its knees .
If networks refuse to accept cigarette advertising , how can they readily approve dishonest political advertising ?
Cigarettes kill individuals , but lying political ads hurt the whole country .
No democracy can afford this , let alone when the country is at war , and under existential threat from terrorists , and in economic free fall .
So here ’s my idea .
One that could actually work , if America ’s networks remember they are Americans first , revenue seekers second .
Just as they once united to stamp out cigarette advertising , radio and TV stations and advertisers must get together and agree that false statements in political advertisements will not be tolerated .
If you run a political ad that proves to be a lie , your network will pay a steep fine , and the advertiser will pay an even steeper one .
To avoid these crushing fines , networks will insist on proof of statements made in political advertisements , just as they demand proof of statements made in sugarless chewing gum commercials .
Political advertisers will not be able to lie about opponents .
They will either have to attack opponents honestly , or talk about the actual issues facing the country , and how their candidate will solve those issues .
Imagine .
We might hear ads about the banking crisis and how each candidate will address it .
Candidates might summarize their positions on Iraq and Afghanistan and end with links to more detailed positions on their websites .
The public might discuss the real issues facing us instead of manufactured Entertainment - Tonight - style “ controversies . ”
People might even vote for candidates based on their resumes and positions on the issues .
It would be just like democracy .

[ Original story , by David J. Pollay ]
Sixteen years ago I learned an important life lesson , in the back of a New York City taxi cab .
I hopped in a taxi , and we took off for Grand Central Station .
We were driving in the right lane when , all of a sudden , a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us .
My taxi driver slammed on his brakes , skidded ,
and missed the other car by mere inches !
The driver of the other car , the guy who almost caused a big accident , whipped his head around and started yelling bad words at us .
My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy .
And I mean , he was actually friendly !
So , I asked him , " Why did you just do that ?
This guy almost ruined your car and could 've sent us to the hospital ! "
And this is when my taxi driver told me about what I now call , " The Law of Garbage Trucks . "
" Many people are like Garbage Trucks .
They run around full of garbage , full of frustration , full of anger , and full of disappointment .
As their garbage piles up , they need a place to dump it , and if you let them , they 'll dump it on you .
When someone wants to dump on you , do n't take it personally .
Instead , just smile , wave , wish them well , and move on .
You 'll be happier because you did . "
Wow .
That really got me thinking about how often do I let Garbage Trucks run right over me ?
AND , how often do I then take their garbage and spread it onto other people : at work , at home , on the streets ?
It was that day I resolved , " I 'm not going to do it anymore . "
Since then , I have started to see Garbage Trucks everywhere .
Just as the kid in the Sixth Sense movie said , " I see dead people , " I can now say , " I see Garbage Trucks . " :)
I see the load they 're carrying ... I see them coming to drop it off .
And like my Taxi Driver , I do n't make it a personal thing ; I just smile , wave , wish them well , and I move on .

A New York charity says it has turned down a share of a $ 3 million lottery jackpot because accepting the money could send the wrong message to gambling addicts .
The Lighthouse Mission , which helps feed 3,000 hungry Long Island residents a week , had been chosen to share an anonymous donor 's jackpot last month .
The donor gave the winning ticket to the True North Community Church , which said it would share the money with other charities .
The mission 's pastor , James Ryan , says he appreciates the offer but had to turn it down because his organization counsels against addictions , including gambling .
He did not say what the mission 's share of the prize would have been .

More than 120 of the county ’s top climate scientists have signed their names to an open letter calling for Canadians to “ vote strategically for the environment ” in the October 14 federal election .
“ While it ’s clear the public accepts that global warming is a threat , it seems people have simply no idea how serious this issue is , ” the October 7 letter reads .
“ Many may not realize that even if we immediately stabilized atmospheric greenhouse gases at current levels , the Arctic would still go ice free in the summer , between 10 % and 25 % of the world ’s species would still be committed to extinction , and weather will continue to become more extreme . ”
The letter slams the Conservative government for obstructing global efforts to deal with climate change and describes Canada ’s participation in recent conferences on climate change as an “ international embarrassment ” .
Emphasized is the importance of the upcoming 15th United Nations Conference of Parties to the Climate Change Convention scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen , Denmark .
The letter states that it is “ absolutely critical that Canada play a constructive role in negotiations leading up to this event ” .
The letter does not tell people what party or which politicians they should vote for .
However , Andrew Weaver , a UVic climate scientist , member of the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , and signatory to the letter , was recently quoted in the Straight recommending that people vote strategically to prevent a reelection of the Conservatives .

Asked if an AIG bankruptcy were possible , he said if the company does n't get a bridge loan , new capital , or relief from rating agencies , " then there 's no alternative , and that would be a disaster . "
Greenberg , who has much of his own personal wealth tied up in AIG , said he has written a letter to the company offering his help , but complained that he has been rebuffed .
Watch Greenberg interview at left .
The former CEO has been at odds with the company since he left in 2005 amid charges of financial misconduct leveled by then - New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Greenberg denied wrongdoing .
Greenberg 's company C.V.
Starr said , in a filing with the SEC , that it is working with its adviser , investment bank Parella Weinberg Partners , on strategic options , including buing assets from AIG , taking it private , or trying to buy it in a proxy fight .
In order to take such steps , Greenberg would have to receive approval from the New York Department of Insurance , given strict laws governing those who hold more than 10 percent of an insurer 's stock .
A spokesman for New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo was not immediately available for comment .
Monday 's rating downgrades will make it much more difficult for AIG Chief Executive Robert Willumstad to raise cash , and could trigger demands that the company come up with nearly $ 20 billion .
The insurer has suffered $ 18 billion of losses in the last three quarters tied to guarantees it wrote on mortgage - linked derivatives .
It ended June with $ 1.05 trillion of assets .
Its failure would likely be larger than that of Lehman , which said it ended August with about $ 600 billion of assets .
Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher halved his price target on AIG to $ 3 , citing a " heightened probability " of a bankruptcy filing .
" While there is a chance the company can work its way through its liquidity problems if it can secure substantial bridge financing , we think this will be challenging to execute in the current onerous credit environment , " he wrote .
AIG ended 2007 with 116,000 employees , more than four times as many as Lehman .
Too Big to Fail ?
Late Monday , Standard & Poor 's cut AIG 's long - term credit rating three notches to " A - minus " from " AA - minus , " citing " reduced flexibility in meeting additional collateral needs and concerns over increasing residential mortgage - related losses . "
This is not another humor post , but just a comparison between the searches on the terms C# and Ruby using Google Trends .
Apart from the number of searches on the term C# which are double the ones on the term Ruby , it ’s funny to notice the trend in the various days of the weeks :
Ruby stays constant throughout all the week , while C# drops to half the volume during weekends .
There might be a few explanations for this :
Ruby is used by people that do n’t have a personal life and spend the weekend developing stuff
C# is used by people that develop only on their 9 - 5 , Mon-Fri job
Any other guess ?

States ' Purges of Voter Rolls Appear Illegal Wednesday 08 October 2008
by : Ian Urbina , The New York Times
( Illustration : Matt Mahurin / Rolling Stone )
Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law , according to a review of state records and Social Security data by The New York Times .
The actions do not seem to be coordinated by one party or the other , nor do they appear to be the result of election officials intentionally breaking rules , but are apparently the result of mistakes in the handling of the registrations and voter files as the states tried to comply with a 2002 federal law , intended to overhaul the way elections are run .
Still , because Democrats have been more aggressive at registering new voters this year , according to state election officials , any heightened screening of new applications may affect their party 's supporters disproportionately .
The screening and trimming of voter registration lists in the six states - Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina - could also result in problems at the polls on Election Day : people who have been removed from the rolls are likely to show up only to be challenged by political party officials or election workers , resulting in confusion , long lines and heated tempers .
Some states allow such voters to cast provisional ballots .
But they are often not counted because they require added verification .
Although much attention this year has been focused on the millions of new voters being added to the rolls by the candidacy of Senator Barack Obama , there has been far less notice given to the number of voters being dropped from those same rolls .
States have been trying to follow the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and remove the names of voters who should no longer be listed ; but for every voter added to the rolls in the past two months in some states , election officials have removed two , a review of the records shows .
The six states seem to be in violation of federal law in two ways .
Some are removing voters from the rolls within 90 days of a federal election , which is not allowed except when voters die , notify the authorities that they have moved out of state , or have been declared unfit to vote .
Some of the states are improperly using Social Security data to verify registration applications for new voters .
In addition to the six swing states , three more states appear to be violating federal law .
Alabama and Georgia seem to be improperly using Social Security information to screen registration applications from new voters .
And Louisiana appears to have removed thousands of voters after the federal deadline for taking such action .
Under federal law , election officials are supposed to use the Social Security database to check a registration application only as a last resort , if no record of the applicant is found on state databases , like those for driver 's licenses or identification cards .
The requirement exists because using the federal database is less reliable than the state lists , and is more likely to incorrectly flag applications as invalid .
Many state officials seem to be using the Social Security lists first .
In the year ending Sept. 30 , election officials in Nevada , for example , used the Social Security database more than 740,000 times to check voter files or registration applications and found more than 715,000 nonmatches , federal records show .
Election officials in Georgia ran more than 1.9 million checks on voter files or voter registration applications and found more than 260,000 nonmatches .
Officials of the Social Security Administration , presented with those numbers , said they were far too high to be cases where names were not in state databases .
They said the data seem to represent a violation of federal law and the contract the states signed with the agency to use the database .
Last week , after the inquiry by The Times , Michael J. Astrue , the commissioner of the Social Security Administration , alerted the Justice Department to the problem and sent letters to election officials in Alabama , Georgia , Indiana , Nevada , North Carolina and Ohio .
The letters , which express concern that voters will be blocked from voting because of the inappropriate use of Social Security information , ask the officials to ensure they are complying with federal law .
In three states - Colorado , Louisiana and Michigan - the number of people purged from the election rolls since Aug. 1 far exceeds the number who may have died or relocated during that period .
States may be improperly removing voters who have moved within the state , election experts said , or who are considered inactive because they have failed to vote in two consecutive federal elections .
For example , major voter registration drives have been held this year in Colorado , which has also had a significant population increase since the last presidential election , but the state has recorded a net loss of nearly 100,000 voters from its rolls since 2004 .
Asked about the appearance of voter law violations , Rosemary E. Rodriguez , the chairwoman of the federal Election Assistance Commission , which oversees elections , said they could present " extremely serious problems . "
" The law is pretty clear about how states can use Social Security information to screen registrations and when states can purge their rolls , " Ms. Rodriguez said .
Nevada officials said the large number of Social Security checks had resulted from county clerks entering Social Security numbers and driver 's license numbers in the wrong fields before records were sent to the state .
They could not estimate how many records might have been affected by the problem , but they said it was corrected several weeks ago .
Other states described similar problems in entering data .
Under the Help America Vote Act , all states were required to build statewide electronic voter registration lists to standardize and centralize voter records that had been kept on the local level .
To prevent ineligible voters from casting a ballot , states were also required to clear the electronic lists of duplicates , people who had died or moved out of state , or who had become ineligible for other reasons .
Voting rights groups and federal election officials have raised concerns that the methods used to add or remove names vary by state and are conducted with little oversight or transparency .
Many states are purging their lists for the first time and appear to be unfamiliar with the 2002 federal law .
" Just as voting machines were the major issue that came out of the 2000 presidential election and provisional ballots were the big issue from 2004 , voter registration and these statewide lists will be the top concern this year , " said Daniel P. Tokaji , a law professor at Ohio State University .
Voting rights groups have urged voters to check their registrations with local officials .
In Michigan , some 33,000 voters were removed from the rolls in August , a figure that is far higher than the number of deaths in the state during the same period - about 7,100 - or the number of people who moved out of the state - about 4,400 , according to data from the Postal Service .
In Colorado , some 37,000 people were removed from the rolls in the three weeks after July 21 .
During that time , about 5,100 people moved out of the state and about 2,400 died , according to postal data and death records .
In Louisiana , at least 18,000 people were dropped from the rolls in the five weeks after July 23 .
Over the same period , at least 1,600 people moved out of state and at least 3,300 died .
The secretaries of state in Michigan and Colorado failed to respond to requests for comment .
A spokesman for the Louisiana secretary of state said that about half of the numbers of the voters removed from the rolls were people who moved within the state or who died .
The remaining 11,000 or so people seem to have been removed by local officials for other reasons that were not clear , the spokesman said .
The purge estimates were calculated using data from state election officials , who produce a snapshot every month or so of the voter rolls with details about each registered voter on record , making it possible to determine how many have been removed .
The Times 's methodology for calculating the purge estimates was reviewed by two voting experts , Kimball Brace , the director of Election Data Services , a Washington consulting firm that tracks voting trends , and R. Michael Alvarez , a political science professor at the California Institute of Technology .
By using the Social Security database so extensively , states are flagging extra registrations and creating extra work for local officials who are already struggling to process all the registration applications by Election Day .
" I simply do n't have the staff to keep up , " said Ann McFall , the supervisor of elections in Volusia County , Fla .
It takes 10 minutes to process a normal registration and up to a week to deal with a flagged one , said Ms. McFall , a Republican , adding that she was receiving 100 or so flagged registrations a week .
Usually , when state election officials check a registration and find that it does not match a database entry , they alert local election officials to contact the voter and request further proof of identification .
If that is not possible , most states flag the voter file and require identification from the voter at the polling place .
In Florida , Iowa , Louisiana and South Dakota , the problem is more serious because voters are not added to the rolls until the states remove the flags .
Ms. McFall said she was angry to learn from the state recently that it was her responsibility to contact each flagged voter to clear up the discrepancies before Election Day .
" This situation with voter registrations is going to land us in court , " she said .
In fact , it already has .
In Michigan and Florida , rights groups are suing state officials , accusing them of being too aggressive in purging voter rolls and of preventing people from registering .
In Georgia , the Justice Department is considering legal action against officials in Cobb and Cherokee Counties who sent letters to hundreds of voters stating that their voter registrations had been flagged and telling them they cannot vote until they clear up the discrepancy .
On Monday , the Ohio Republican Party filed a motion in federal court against the secretary of state to get the list of all names that have been flagged by the Social Security database since Jan .
1 . The motion seeks to require that any voter who does not clear up a discrepancy be required to vote using a provisional ballot .
Republicans said in the motion that it is central to American democracy that nonqualified voters be forbidden from voting .
The Ohio secretary of state , Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , said in court papers that she believes the Republicans are seeking grounds to challenge voters and get them removed from the rolls .
Considering that in the past year the state received nearly 290,000 nonmatches , such a plan could have significant impact at the polls .

Web loggers who are campaigning against Senator Obama 's presidential run are accusing Google and Obama supporters of silencing them after their Web logs were marked as spam and their accounts temporarily frozen .

A bicyclist rides by a sign outside of the Google headquarters July 17 , 2008 at Mountain View , California .
On Thursday , hours after publishing a post about an online petition demanding that Mr. Obama publicly produce his birth certificate , an associate professor of business administration at Brooklyn College , Mitchell Langbert , found that he could no longer access his Web log .
Google 's Blogger hosting service had suspended " Mitchell Langbert 's Blog , " which Mr. Langbert describes as " two - thirds academic stuff I 'm working on and one - third politics , " until it could verify the Web log was not a " spam blog , " or a site designed solely to increase the page views of associated Web sites .
A day later Google lifted the block on the account , but the incident and earlier Web log freezes in late June have led Mr. Langbert and other anti-Obama bloggers to accuse the Illinois senator 's supporters of intentionally identifying their blog addresses to Google as spam blogs .
They also say the company has reflexively suspended the sites .
" These tech - savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you do n't like , you can do some damage to a person , " Mr. Langbert said .
A spokesman for Google , Adam Kovacevich , said in a statement that an overzealous antispam filter was responsible for the blocks .
" We believe this was caused by mass spam e-mails mentioning the ' Just Say No Deal ' network of blogs , which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e-mails as spam , " he said .
" We have restored posting rights to the affected blogs , and it is very important to us that Blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression . "
Several of the blogs that were blocked , including hillaryorbust.com and comealongway.blogspot.com , are part of the " Just Say No Deal " network of anti-Obama blogs .
But Mr. Langbert 's blog is not , leading him to conclude that Obama supporters had targeted him .
On her right - leaning blog " Atlas Shrugs , " Pamela Geller keeps a list of blogs that Google has temporarily blocked .
" The blockings do come in waves , " she said .
" The last wave was this past week , and now it got very quiet . "
Some writers have had their blogs unblocked , while others have moved them to WordPress , a rival blog host .
" I do n't think " Google has " malicious intentions at all , it 's just that spammers can literally overrun a service if you 're not careful , so their defenses have become overzealous , " a spokesman for WordPress , Matthew Mullenweg , said in an e-mail .
" We always have human review before turning off an active blog , " he said .
" People invest so much time into their blogs , to treat it with anything less than the utmost respect is criminal . "

It 's amazing what people will do with vegetables these days .
For the past five years , Schnepf Farms in Queen Creek has been cutting mazes through corn fields in the likenesses of celebrities including Larry King , Oprah Winfrey and Jay Leno .
Whose face would be temporarily etched into the living fields of Schnepf Farms this year was the question hanging on the lips of a crowd of press and on - lookers waiting in a small clearing for the approaching helicopter to land .
Emerging from underneath the slowing blades of the landed bird was none other than Muhammad Ali .
Muhammad Ali in maze form .
“ Muhammad Ali is a perfect designee , partly because he loves visiting the farm for peach and apricot season but also who better to carve into a 10 - acre field after the Olympics than a former Olympian and world Champion , ” said Mark Schnepf .
Ali and his wife Lonnie , who are Scottsdale residents , shook hands and posed for photos during which the champ received a call from Larry King .
" All the great things that Muhammad Ali has attained in his life , the world championships , being one of the best known people in the world , a fighter who has gone beyond his sport to attain immortality - all those things , nothing will top his face in a corn field at Schnepf Farms , " King said .

Today , John McCain called Hillary Clinton a pig .
Essentially .
For all intents and purposes .
Advertisements
According to his own words …
Barack Obama , while on the campaign trail this morning , told his audience to beware of McCain ’s brand of change , which only came about after the Democratic National Convention hit upon the theme so well .
Obama said , “ You can put lipstick on a pig , but it ’s still a pig .
You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change .
It ’s still going to stink after eight years . ”
After word got out , the McCain campaign became “ incensed ” and demanded Obama immediately apologize for calling Sarah Palin a pig .
Say what ?
When did Obama call Palin a pig ?
Where in Obama ’s statement did he even reference Palin ?
He was talking about McCain ’s sudden fondness with the campaign theme of change .
The fact that McCain ’s people are so ticked off is due to their realization that their one shiny , custom - made , applause - getting line from Palin ’s specially - designed speech during the convention just got turned on them .
And they do n’t like it one bit .
They wanted to be able to own “ lipstick ” somehow .
But let ’s take McCain ’s campaign at their word ; let ’s say using the phrase “ you can put lipstick on a pig but it ’s still a pig ” does indeed magically transfer to the person being criticized ( and in this case , Obama was n’t even criticizing Palin ) .
John McCain and his people need to go back about a year or so and recall what McCain himself said while criticizing Hillary Clinton ’s proposals on health care change in America .
McCain linked her new health plan back to the one she proffered some sixteen years ago .
At that time , McCain said , and I quote , “ I think they put some lipstick on a pig , but it ’s still a pig . ”
Why , John McCain , I do believe you called Hillary Clinton a big fat pig .
Maybe you should apologize immediately .
This outburst and feigned incredulity is just more proof of a campaign that knows it can’t win on discussing issues so it is desperately grasping on to any little thing that might make the news and possibly continue their ugly spin that Democrats are sexists while Republicans [ suddenly ] love women [ and unwed mothers ] .

Syria has dismissed allegations of a secret nuclear programme
The head of Syria 's nuclear programme has said that the country 's military sites will remain off - limits to international nuclear inspectors .
Damascus said it would co-operate with an International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) inquiry only if it did not threaten its national security .
The watchdog is investigating claims of a secret Syrian nuclear programme .
Syria 's announcement comes after it dropped a bid to win a place on the board of the IAEA .
The IAEA investigation follows US allegations that Damascus was close to completing a nuclear reactor at a secret location , which was bombed by Israel last year .
Syria has denied the allegations as " ridiculous " .
Ibrahim Othman told the IAEA that his government was " co-operating with the agency in full transparency " .
" However , this co-operation will not be in any way at the expense of disclosing our military sites or causing a threat to our national security , " he added .
' Good co-operation '
Damascus allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the site at al - Kibar in June but has refused any follow - up trips .
On Friday , Syria dropped its bid for a place on the IAEA board , leaving the post open to Western - backed Afghanistan .
Both had been vying for the same seat on the board , representing the Middle East and South Asia ( Mesa ) group .
The body had been facing a divisive and unprecedented vote on the issue .
IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei said Syria 's co-operation had been " good " , but it needed to show " maximum co-operation " for the agency to draw any conclusions .
A Syrian officer reported to have been in charge of facilitating the IAEA probe was killed in unexplained circumstances last summer , further delaying the proceedings .
On Wednesday Iran , also accused by some countries of clandestine nuclear activity , dropped its bid for a seat on the IAEA board , saying it wanted to make way for regional ally Syria to join instead .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has disagreed fundamentally with John McCain 's saber - rattling against Russia and at the same time put himself in opposition to all of the civilian leadership of the Bush administration except perhaps his boss , Bob Gates .
" I believe we 've got to have a relationship with Russia , " Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said in Los Angeles .
" I do n't believe we should discontinue engagement on the military side because that relationship is going to be very important in the future , " Mullen said .
...
" We need to approach this in a measured way and do it in a way that recognizes we have mutual interests with Russia , " he told a gathering organized Town Hall Los Angeles , a nonprofit group that sponsors debates on topical issues .
Mullen 's measured remarks chimed with comments last week by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who said Russia did not pose a threat on a par with the Soviet Union .
They stand in contrast to harsher rhetoric from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and particularly Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain , who has said Russia would face severe consequences for its actions in Georgia .
One of the areas where Mullen said the US and Russia must continue co-operation is nuclear non-proliferation , including safeguarding loose nuclear materials which might fall into the hands of terrorists .
However , the Bush administration does n't think that 's as important as tough talk for domestic consumption .
Some high - level meetings have been postponed indefinitely , including a trip to Russia by John Rood , the acting undersecretary of State for arms control and international security , to discuss various security issues and to negotiate a new pact to replace the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START .
And the congressionally appointed Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism has been asked to not go on its upcoming fact - finding visit to Moscow .
Hat tip to Cheryl Rofer at WhirledView , who notes that START I is due to expire at the end of 2009 .
It provides the only means by which the Moscow Treaty , which limits the number of nuclear warheads Russia and the U.S. can posses , can be verified .
But the neocons wanted an excuse to dump START - they hate treaties - and this hasty excuse of the Georgia conflict is just more convenient than outright abrogating it with no cause .
Then there 's that Congressional factfinding trip .
That 's just as outrageous as the Commission was set up " to build on the work of the 9/11 Commission ... to assess our nation ’s progress in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism . "
The Bush administration ( and John McCain ) need to be asked which they think is more important : petty diplomatic posturing - when even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs thinks Russia / US co-operation is crucial to US national security - or the threat of unsecured nuclear material falling into terrorist hands .

Some wacky weather provided some unusual videos last week .
This rare red Colorado tornado is one of four tornadoes that touched down near Denver at the start of the Democratic National Convention .
This one was captured on film near Parker , Colorado .
The geological nature of the Rocky Mountains inhibit the formation of many tornadoes , although other parts of Colorado frequently receive their fair share of twisters .
The red twister arrived a day after a rare tornado touched down in the mountains west of Denver .
That tornado tossed campers around and slightly injured four people at Witcher Cove Campground , The Denver Post reported .
" I 've never seen anything like it , " Park County Coroner Sharon Morris told the newspaper .
" And I 've been here 25 years . "
The red Colorado soil plus the length of time the twister remained in the same area made for an unusual video :
In Apache Junction , Arizona , flood waters tripped up the motorist in the next video and almost dragged her and the child with her under water .
For some unexplained reason , this woman drove her car right into the flood waters , endangering a small child in the process .
A couple good Samaritans aided in their dramatic rescue .
The woman and child were very , very lucky .
That car almost completely submerged just before it hit the bridge .
The weight of the engine was pulling the vehicle down into the water , but the back end was held up , perhaps because it was lighter than the front .
This might well have ended tragically .
The Bush administration would press the Iraqi government to adopt an oil trust fund for distributing revenue or risk economic assistance under a bill proposed by Sens. Hillary Clinton and John Ensign , Ben Lando reports for United Press International .
The New York Democrat and the Nevada Republican see their legislation as an end - around the Iraqi political debate over an oil law and a measure to rally Iraqis while ensuring oil transparency .

A French newspaper is claiming some Mac Pro owners are at risk of developing leukemia and other ills from breathing in toxic materials emitted from Apple 's top - of - the - line PCs .
According to Paris newspaper , Libération , an odd odor given off by some Mac Pros could be the result of several toxins used in the machines , including benzene .
The original report ( in French ) is available here .
Libération cites an anonymous researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research , who originally purchased a Mac Pro in order to study molecules in 3D .
He soon noticed a strong odor when using the machine .
Ten days later , his eyes , nose , and throat were irritated .
" The computer emitted fumes which , after a week of use , caused a pronounced irritation of the cornea and respiratory passages , " he told Libération .
The researcher first contacted Apple , which sent a technician to change the power supply – but the problem persisted .
After exchanging the computer for a new one , the second unit had the same strange odor .
Searching the internet , he found his case was n't unique .
Libération claims Apple forums in Germany , Great Britain , and the United States are full of testimonials complaining about a " new car smell " or an odor similar to a " rotting carpet . "
There 's also complaints of smell causing migraines , nausea , and dizziness .
ZDNet also dug up this a complaint on Apple 's Mac Pro support forums discussing a " musty odor . "
Several people in the post also claim to detect an odd odor coming from their Mac Pros .
Others on the Mac Pro forum seem to think their computer smells like someone smoking cannabis .
Libération said the researcher contacted Greenpeace , which sent word to the Analytica analysis lab .
" We have identified seven volatile organic contaminants , " the lab 's Bernard Tailliez is quoted saying .
The notable ingredients are styrene , benzene , and its derivatives .
The publication claims it then passed the analysis to the French National Institute for Risk in the Industrial Environment .
" Benzene can affect bone marrow .
Imagine if a person worked eight hours per day for two months breathing in these vapors , some people could very well develop leukemia , " Annie Leszkowicz , a chemical risks expert from the French agency , told the publication .
Emails to Apple seeking comment were not immediately returned .
( Nor frankly , does El Reg expect them to be returned . )
Libération claims that after contacting Apple France , they were told " engineers are working on the problem . " ®

To read palms , first locate the heart line , which is located at the top of the hand in the center of the palm .
It 's the closest line to the bottom of the fingers .
If the heart line starts under the index finger , that means the person is content with their relationships .
If it starts under the middle finger , they may struggle with interpersonal relationships .
Under the heart line is the head line .
If it ’s straight , the person is more traditional , but if it 's wavy , they may be a little more progressive .
Next , find the life line , which is the line under the head line that starts at the thumb and angles down toward the wrist .
This line represents the person 's journey through life .
A long life line means that their life will be filled with exciting , rich experiences , while a short line means that they 'll experience independence and comfort throughout their life .
If their life line is straight , their experiences will make them cautious and nervous .
If it 's curvy , their life will be eventful and full of vigor .
Next to the life line in the center of the palm is the fate line .
The fate line shows how dramatically a person ’s life will be influenced by things that are out of their control .
A thin , perfectly vertical fate line means that the person is totally in control over what happens in their life .
Any broken or scarred lines could be a sign of past trauma and pain .
To learn how to interpret what the lines on someone 's palms mean , keep reading !
I ’ve been preparing for some upcoming Java SE 7 Preview presentations I ’m doing on the No Fluff tour in Reston , VA and Chicago , IL .
I worked up some JSR 203 ( the new new I / O JSR ) examples and thought I would drop them here in case they were useful .
These are based on the latest Javadocs available on the project page ( b97 ) .
I ’m not putting much context here .
You can read a well written summary from Elliotte Rusty Harold or watch the JavaOne presentation .
Or come see my talks . :)
I actually did a talk like this about 18 months ago and went back and looked at it and the API has changed a lot since then .
In many ways , it ’s been simplified and consolidated much to its overall benefit .
In just the last few months , there ’s been a lot of polishing , especially making better use of enums and little things like that .
Some of those changes are good and some are pretty long - winded in use .
Path is the new File .
It ’s a little more nuanced than that , but Path is definitely the center of the new filesystem API .
Here ’s some basic fiddling with it : [ source : java ]
import java.nio.file .*;</ p>
// FileSystems -> FileSystem ->
Path
FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.getDefault ( ) ;
Path homeDir = fileSystem.getPath ( “ / Users/amiller ” ) ;
// Shortcut with Paths helper class
Path homeDir = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller ” ) ;
// Resolve one path in terms of another
Path relativeTemp = Paths.get ( “ temp ” ) ;
Path absoluteTemp = relativeTemp.resolve(homeDir ) ;
// Get relative path from a base
Path absoluteProfile = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller/.profile ” ) ;
Path relativeProfile = absoluteProfile.relativize(homeDir ) ;
assert relativeProfile.isRelative ( ) ;
assert relativeProfile.getNameCount( ) == 1 ;
[ / source ]
And here ’s an example of opening and appending to a file :
[ source : java ]
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file .*;
import static java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption .*;
Path journal = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller/journal.txt ” ) ;
OutputStream stream = journal.newOutputStream( CREATE , APPEND ) ;
try {
writeEntry( stream ) ; // normal stuff
} finally {
stream.close ( ) ;
}
[ / source ]
One nice thing is that copy and move are built - in ( at long , long last ) :
[ source : java ]
import java.nio.file .*;
Path home = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller ” ) ;
Path secrets = home.resolve ( “ secrets.txt ” ) ;
// Steal secrets
secrets.copyTo(home.resolve(“ stolenSecrets.txt ” ) ) ;
// Hide secrets
secrets.moveTo( Paths.get (“ / Users/dvader/secrets.txt ” ) ) ;
[ / source ]
There is lots of support now for walking directories – here are some internal and external iterator versions :
[ source : java ]
Path music = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller/files/music ” ) ;
// External iterator
DirectoryStream mp3s = music.newDirectoryStream (“*.mp3 ” ) ;
try {
for ( Path entry : mp3s )
System.out.println(entry.getName ( ) ) ;
} finally {
mp3s.close ( ) ;
}
// Internal iterator
Files.withDirectory(music , “ *.mp3 ” , new FileAction ( ) {
public void invoke( Path entry ) {
System.out.println(entry.getName ( ) ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
And there is even a visitor pattern for walking a directory recursively ( with support for following symbolic links , checking for cycles , etc ) :
[ source : java ]
Path itunes = Paths.get ( “ / Users/amiller/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music ” ) ;
public class Mp3 Visitor extends SimpleFileVisitor {
private Path root ;
public Mp3 Visitor ( Path root ) {
this .root = root ;

System.out.println(root.relativize( file ) ) ;

}
Files.walkFileTree(itunes , new Mp3 Visitor ( itunes ) ) ;

And of course , we also finally have support for accessing posix file attributes as part of the API ( and some other common attribute sets and extensible support for other pluggable file systems ) :
[ source : java ]
Path file = Paths.get ( “ /usr/bin/perl ” ) ;
// true here means follow symbolic links
BasicFileAttributes attrs =
Attributes.readPosixFileAttributes( file , true ) ;
Set perms = attrs.permissions ( ) ;
System.out.format( “ %s %s %s ” , PosixFilePermission.toString(attrs.permissions ( ) ) , attrs.owner ( ) , attrs.group ( ) ) ;
// rwxr - xr-x root wheel
[ / source ]
Finally , there is now support for generic “ watch services ” to watch file events in a directory ( with efficient support depending on the platform ) : [ source : java ]
import static java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKind .*;
Path deploy = Paths.get ( “ deploy ” ) ;
WatchService watcher = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService ( ) ;
WatchKey key = deploy .
register ( watcher , ENTRY_CREATE , ENTRY_DELETE , ENTRY_MODIFY } ) ;
for ( ; ; ) {
key = watcher .
take ( ) ; // blocks , also can poll
for( WatchEvent <?> ev : key.pollEvents ( ) ) {
switch( event.kind ( ) ) {
case ENTRY_CREATE :
Path file = ( Path) ev.getContext ( ) ; //relative to deploy
// deploy new stuff
case ENTRY_MODIFY : …
case ENTRY_DELETE : …
}
}
key.reset ( ) ; // reset after processing

Investors have endured a white - knuckle ride in recent weeks .
World stock markets have plunged after government bank bail - outs in the US and Europe failed to stem fears of slower global economic growth .
On Wall Street , the Dow Jones fell 370 points , ending below 10,000 for the first time since 2004 .
UK and French indexes also suffered big falls .
And Asian shares continued the trend early on Tuesday , with Tokyo's Nikkei opening 1.38 % down .
Investors fear that official action might not be enough to stem the crisis .
This was despite a $ 700 bn ( £ 398 bn ) US bank bail - out being passed late last week , and efforts by several European countries including Germany and Denmark to boost confidence in their banks .
" The fact is people are scared and the only thing they 're doing is selling , " said Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer 's Investment Research .
" Investors are cleaning out portfolios and getting rid of everything because nothing seems to be working . "
In New York , the Dow fell 369.88 points , or 3.58 % , to end at 9,955.50 .
At one point the blue - chip index had been down more than 800 points .
London 's key UK share index lost 7.85 % - its biggest percentage fall since 1987 and in Paris the Cac - 40 suffered its largest fall on record .
The Nikkei's fall on Tuesday followed its 4.3 % drop on Monday , which saw it close at its lowest since February 2004 .
Restoring confidence President George W Bush said on Monday that it would take some time for the rescue plan to restore confidence to the financial system .
He said it was important that the programme was implemented properly and did not waste taxpayers ' money .
" We do n't want to rush into this situation and not have the programme be effective , " he said .
Stock markets are falling ... and it's the troubles of Europe 's banks , and the messy response of the authorities , that 's to blame

Read Robert 's blog Interactive map : How European governments have reacted " It 's going to take a while to restore confidence in the financial system . "
The Treasury has appointed Neel Kashkari , 35 , an assistant secretary and a former employee of Goldman Sachs , to head the Office of Financial Stability that will run the rescue programme .
In an attempt to reassure investors , the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets said on Monday that it was moving quickly to exercise the new powers it had been given as part of the Wall Street rescue package .
The group , which was formed after the 1987 stock market crash , said it would move " with substantial force on a number of fronts " .
As one of the first effects of the rescue plan , the Federal Reserve announced that it would start paying interest on the reserves that banks are forced to deposit at the central bank .
' Collective action '
In Europe , analysts said that Germany 's increased 50 bn - euro ( $ 68bn ; £ 38.7 bn ) bail - out of Hypo Real Estate , the country 's second - biggest commercial property lender , had alarmed investors .
Earlier , Germany had appeared to announce an unlimited guarantee for private savings - though it later said this was not the case and it had instead given only a " political commitment " that savers would not lose deposits .
However , Denmark had already moved to offer full protection , while Sweden massively increased the level of protection it offered .
Late on Monday the parliament in Iceland passed a bill giving the state the power to intervene at will in the banking system .
" We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy , " said Prime Minister Geir Haarde .
Other developments on Monday included : EU leaders issued a joint statement saying they would take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors
BNP Paribas has taken a controlling interest in Fortis Trading in shares of Benelux bank Fortis was suspended , on the day BNP Paribas took a controlling interest in the troubled finance group under an emergency deal with the Belgian and Luxembourg governments
Central banks across Europe - including the ECB and Bank of England - offered more than $ 74bn to banks in short - term loans in separate efforts aimed at trying to making cash available for the banking sector
International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said Europe needed a collective response to the financial crisis and warned countries not to act alone
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and French President Nicolas Sarkozy arranged meetings with the heads of their respective countries ' main banks to discuss the global financial crisis - and said the two leaders would meet later this week .

GreenFuel Technologies Announces First Commercial Algae Plant
October 21st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The promise of commercial algae fuel is getting closer to reality with GreenFuel Technologies ’ announcement today of a $ 92 million deal to build algae greenhouses .
The project will capture CO2 emissions from a cement plant in Jerez , Spain and use them to grow algae for food , fuel , and feedstock .
Currently , GreenFuel and partner company Aurantia SA have a 100 square - meter prototype plant running .
GreenFuel hopes to have a full - scale 100 hectare plant ready by 2011 .
The larger plant is expected to absorb 50,000 tons of metric carbon and produce 25,000 tons of algae each year .
For some perspective , 25,000 tons of algae will produce 1.3 million gallons of algae oil annually .
The prototype plant began testing six weeks ago .
If all goes well , GreenFuel wants to ramp up the project to 1,000 square meters .
I ’m confident that the project will be successful — I just hope falling oil prices do n’t discourage even more algae fuel investments .

Perspectives on the economy , with Christian Thwaites , Sentinel Asset Management and Jeffrey Saut , Raymond James
Opponents of a campaign to ban same - sex marriage in California said Tuesday that a new poll shows them in danger of losing -- unless people step forward with more contributions to pay for No on 8 television commercials .
The opposition has enjoyed a healthy lead in several surveys taken by polling organizations that do not have a stake in the campaign .
But officials with the No on 8 campaign held a conference call with reporters Tuesday to announce that their own poll showed the measure would pass by four points .
Opponents attributed the result to fewer television ads , which is , in turn , a result of the No on 8 campaign falling behind in fundraising .
Although the Yes on 8 campaign has not yet posted its latest fund - raising report , supporters said Tuesday that they have raised at least $ 25 million , compared with $ 15.75 million raised by the other side .
“ As a result of not being able to match dollar for dollar , we have seen a change , ” said Geoff Kors , the executive director of Equality California , which is fighting Proposition 8 , the proposed amendment to the state Constitution that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman .

The announcement pleased supporters of Proposition 8 .
“ I can understand their concern , ” said Sonja Eddings Brown , spokeswoman for the Protect Marriage Coalition .
Although other polls throughout the summer have consistently shown Proposition 8 failing , she pointed to another recent poll , from CBS and SurveyUSA , which showed the measure leading slightly .
Typically , campaigns do not release their internal polling information .
But opponents of Proposition 8 are clearly hoping to spur donations by dramatizing the threat to same - sex marriage .
Steve Smith , campaign manager for No on 8 , said he wanted to be able to “ match [ opponents ] dollar for dollar .
If we do n’t get there , voters wo n’t hear our messages . ”

Smith also said his forces are being outspent in part because of a surge in contributions from Mormon Church members .
“ I do n’t think we have ever seen a single religion in the state . . . so significantly participate in one political campaign , ” Smith said .
Officials with the Mormon Church did not respond to e-mails seeking comment .
Meanwhile , gay and lesbian Mormons are criticizing members of their faith who support Proposition 8 , pointing out that Mormons were once persecuted for defining marriage outside the traditional view of one woman and one man .

“ The Mormon Church teaches that we should be building families , ” said David Melson , assistant executive director of Affirmation , a group of gay and lesbian Mormons .
“ Through measures like Proposition 8 , they are working to tear families apart . ”
It is unclear how far ahead backers of Proposition 8 are in terms of fund - raising .
The campaign tried to file its latest finance report Monday , the deadline for making the disclosure .
But Kate Folmar , spokeswoman for Secretary of State Debra Bowen , said the report was so voluminous that the state ’s computer could not handle it .
Technicians were working on the problem Tuesday , Folmar said .
Also this week , both campaigns ramped up their outreach to Latinos .
The Yes on 8 side began airing a commercial on dozens of Spanish television stations that warned that children would be taught about gay marriage if the proposition was not approved .
The spot features a little girl whose class reads a fairy tale about a prince who ca n’t find a princess to marry -- so instead he marries a prince .
Campaign officials said the ad would begin airing in English soon too .

The No on 8 campaign announced rallies in Latino neighborhoods .
Los Angeles Unified School District board President Monica Garcia and others will gather at noon today for a rally and to open an office in East Los Angeles .

Times staff writers Dan Morain and Duke Helfand contributed to this report .
We ’ve never met Travis Wright , but we imagine that he hates you – otherwise he would n’t be deliberately provoking you like this .
You see , Travis Wright is one of the writers of Eagle Eye – the movie that ’s top of the American box office despite looking like it was crapped out by a puppy with a gammy tummy – and for his next trick he says he ’s working on a script for Blade Runner 2 .
Obviously Travis Wright writing a Blade Runner 2 script is a terrible idea .
Not because of the important cultural significance of the original or anything , though .
No , we ’re dead against the idea of Blade Runner 2 for one reason and one reason only – it ’ll probably end up having bloody Shia LaBeouf in it , wo n’t it .
If you were to make a list of films that nobody should ever think about giving a sequel to , Blade Runner would be right at the top , along with The Godfather and James Bond .
Blade Runner was an especially singular film ; both direct enough to work as an action movie and vague enough for its audience to interpret it however it wanted .
The last thing it needs is a sequel .
But tell that to Travis Wright , one of the co-writers of Eagle Eye .
According to an email received by Slashfilm , he ’s working on a sequel to Blade Runner himself right now :
“ I recently attended a Q&A session with one of the writers of ‘ Eagle Eye ’ after a free screening organized by the magazine Creative Screenwriting .
During the Q&A , the writer said that he and whomever it was that helped him co-write the ‘ Eagle Eye ’ screenplay were in the process of writing a sequel to Blade Runner , and had already contacted the producers of the original , etc . ”
Best of all , according to the email , the full title of Wright ’s script is Blade Runner 2 : Meet The Deckards ! and proposes that Eddie Murphy will star as all of Harrison Ford ‘s extended family .
That ’s a lie .
Actually the Blade Runner 2 script is still going to be set in 2019 , but with Phillip K Dick ‘s technologically dystopian worldview reduced into something a bit more realistic - seeming to audiences of 2008 .
To mirror this , during the movie ’s climax , when Harrison Ford kills another replicant who looks a bit like Rutger Hauer , the replicant gives this stirring soliloquy :
“ I ’ve seen things you people would n’t believe .
A cat in a shoe on the internet .
A drunk man trying to bum a Landrover at lunchtime .
A Nintendo Wii .
All those moments will be lost in time , like tears in rain … ”
That ’s a lie as well .
In fact , by all accounts it seems as if Blade Runner 2 has n’t got any sort of studio backing whatsoever , and that Travis Wright is just writing it in the dim hope that someone one day will want to pay for it .
That ’s fairly unlikely to happen – not many people are stupid enough to want to sully a classic like Blade Runner with an rashly thought - out sequel – and so the fate of Blade Runner 2 is set .
It ’ll be filmed in the woods on someone ’s mobile phone and star a couple of blokes from accounts and the HR lady ’s sister , the way all good sci - fi sequels should be .

Exclusive : Eagle Eye Co-Writers Working on Blade Runner 2 – Slashfilm
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the global financial crisis shows the world failed to learn from the " greed is good " era of the 1980s .
In a speech to a group of business leaders at the weekend , Mr Rudd linked the turmoil in global financial markets with the 1987 Oliver Stone film Wall Street and its infamous lead character , stockbroker Gordon Gekko .
Mr Rudd said the " greed is good " era of the 1980s brought on the stockmarket crash of 1987 and played a part in global recession of the early 1990s .
" It is perhaps time now to admit that we did not learn the full lessons of the greed is good ideology .
And today we are still cleaning up the mess of the 21st Century children of Gordon Gekko , " he said .
Mr Rudd says the credit crisis highlights a lack of values among corporations and executives .
" We 've seen the triumph of greed over integrity , " he said .
" The fact is that much of the root cause of the sub prime crisis came down to our financial markets rewarding people for taking extravagant risks . "
The Prime Minister called for countries to get together to better regulate financial markets and promised to keep a close eye on Australia 's financial system .
Federal Minister for Small Business Craig Emerson has told NewsRadio , Mr Rudd 's call is directed at global markets , and Australia 's financial system is not in need of major regulatory changes .
" Our financial system is properly regulated , it 's probably the envy of the world but for example in the United States regulation has proven to be very poor indeed , " he said .
Former ACCC chairman Allan
Fels says it is inevitable there will be tighter controls on the corporate sector after a decade of deregulation .
However , Mr Fels also warned that regulation is not failsafe , pointing towards regulatory failures such as the collapse of HIH and US company Enron .
" I think the Prime Minister has identified an important need to get a better regulatory hold on the financial sector , " he told NewsRadio .
" I would just want to point out that it will be quite a difficult challenge for the regulators but it will be necessary for them to address those issues and I think the public wants it . "
In recent days Mr Rudd has been forced to defend the Government 's position on not forcing Australia 's four big banks banks to pass on any cut in interest rates in full .
It is expected that the Reserve Bank board tomorrow will cut interest rates and there has been some speculation it could be by as much as 50 basis points .
4 Ways to Add a Gas Mileage Display to Any Car
Whenever someone signs up on the EcoModder forums , the first question they get is “ do you have any fuel economy instrumentation ? ”
So I ’m asking the same thing to you today , and also offering some solutions .
Instrumentation is important for anyone trying to get better mileage since it ’s the only way to get real - time feedback on your driving habits .
Automakers are realizing this and ( also motivated by consumer demand ) are starting to add mpg displays on newer vehicles .
However , if you ’re not one of those luck few , fear not !
There is a solution out there for most of you .
4 aftermarket gauges to help you save gas
1. MPGuino
Okay , I ’ll be upfront .
The MPGuino is first because its what I use and it ’s an EcoModder original .
It ’s great because it can be configured to work with almost any electronically fuel injected vehicle and only costs $ 30 - 40 to put together .
The downside , however , is that it ’s completely DIY , so you ’ll have to know how to solder and how to wire it into your car ( and it might like kind of ugly if you do n’t make a nice case ) .
It may seem a little cumbersome , but it ’s open source and pretty much the only option for pre-1996 vehicles .
However , for the tweakers out there this is definitely the best choice .
Find more information on the MPGuino :
2. Scangauge II
The Scangauge II is the most popular mpg gauge out there , and for good reason .
It ’s easy to install ( just plug it into your OBDII port under the dash ) and easy to use .
The backlit display shows four pieces of data at once and it can check engine codes and aide other diagnostics .
It ’s best qualities are definitely the ease of set up and used , but the $ 160 + price tag can be a lot for people to swallow , even though some ecodriving can win that money back in relatively short order .
3. PLX Kiwi
The PLX Kiwi is a new kid on the block , but it definitely looks interesting .
The big differences between the Kiwi and the Scangauge II is that the Kiwi has a big color screen and can also “ teach ” you how to drive efficiently by rating your driving habits and making ecodriving suggestions .
These features do burden it was a $ 300 price tag , though .
Like the Scangauge , this is only for 96 + vehicles .
Expect to hear more about the Kiwi on the EcoModder blog in the near future , as a forum member is currently getting a test model from the company that he can try out on several of his cars .
4. Dashhawk
The Dashhawk , a lesser known display from MSD seems like a neat device .
Even though I do n’t know anyone who owns one it appears attractive and looks like it works much the same way as the Scangauge .
Unfortunately , the $ 300 price tag is a little scary .
I will be requesting a test model from MSD to see if it ’s worth its beans , so stay tuned .
Like the Scangauge and Kiwi , this is only for 96 + vehicles .
Moral of the story
If you ’re interested in saving some gas , the environment , or even some money , you ’re probably driving a car that can accept some type of fuel economy instrumentation .
It may seem expensive , but the payback is real and these devices retain their value well if you ever want to hit eBay with it .

Palin husband among 13 subpoenaed in Troopergate probe Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday September 12 , 2008
Print This Email This
The husband of GOP vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin is among 13 witnesses subpoenaed by Alaska lawmakers , the Associated Press reports .
The subpoenas are " part of the investigation into whether the Republican vice presidential candidate abused her power in trying to get her former brother - in - law fired , " writes Gene Johnson for the AP .
Johnson quotes retired prosecutor Stephen Branchflower saying of Todd Palin : " He 's such a central figure .
... I think one should be issued for him . "
He adds that Branchflower " said he wants to interview Palin herself , but did not ask for a subpoena for her . "
Rhonda Schwartz and Justin Rood at ABC News ' " Blotter " blog described the proceedings that led to the subpoenas :
In a nondescript conference room filled to capacity , a Republican - dominated panel of lawmakers voted to issue subpoenas to force testimony by Alaska ' First Gentleman ' Todd Palin and a dozen current and former state officials , including aides to Gov. Palin , to determine whether she had misused her authority in firing one of her commissioners in July .
The so - called " Troopergate " probe , write Schwartz and Rood , " was prompted by Palin 's July 11 firing of her former public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan , after he refused to dismiss Mike Wooten , a state trooper who was Palin 's ex-brother - in - law .
" Wooten and Palin 's sister had gone through a lengthy and bitter divorce and custody battle in 2005 , during which Palin herself had accused Wooten of threatening her and her father , " they continue , adding that Wooten has denied the accusations .

Although it defies all logic and common sense , the McCain campaign continued to paint Sarah Palin as more experienced and qualified to be president than Barack Obama .
What is laughable is that the McCain campaign thinks that people are stupid enough to buy the argument that Palin is even remotely qualified to be on this ticket .
Obama was asked on Anderson Cooper 360 about the McCain campaign ’s charge that Palin has more executive experience .
He replied , “ Well , my understanding is that Governor Palin ’s town of Wasilla has I think 50 employees .
We ’ve got 2,500 in this campaign .
I think their budget is maybe $ 12 million a year .
You know , we have a budget of about three times that just for the month .
So I think that our ability to manage large systems and to execute I think has been made clear over the last couple of years . ”
This led Tucker Downs of the McCain campaign to retort , “ For Barack Obama to argue that he ’s experienced enough to be president because he ’s running for president is desperate circular logic and it ’s laughable .
It is a testament to Barack Obama ’s inexperience and failing qualifications that he would stoop to passing off his candidacy as comparable to Governor Sarah Palin ’s executive experience managing a budget of over 10 billion dollar dollars , and more than 24,000 employees . ”

The Sarah Palin tall tale continues to grow .
Now she has foreign policy and budgetary experience .
What ’s laughable is that the McCain campaign keeps trying to pass off this big lie .
Here is the way budgeting works .
The fiscal year runs from September 30 - September 30 .
Palin has only been governor for a year and half .
The budget for her first year in office was already passed before she was elected , so she has dealt with exactly one state budget .
When you compare this to people like Tim Pawlenty , Mitt Romney , and Tom Ridge , her resume looks quite thin .
I understand the point the point that Obama was trying to make , but all he really has to say is I ’ve had four years in the US Senate , and eight years in the Illinois state senate .
He should say that the Republicans are running a candidate with zero federal experience , who may have to abruptly replace a 72 year old man who has already had cancer twice .
Obama ’s argument was weak , because campaigning and governing is not the same thing .
George W. Bush ran a tight , well organized campaign in 2000 , but he has run one of the most undisciplined unorganized , inept administrations ever .
Obama does n’t need to say anything .
Palin is already the gift that keeps on giving for the Democrats .
The McCain campaign is the one with the problem , as according to the most recent polls 33% - 39 % of those surveyed believed that Palin is n’t qualified to be president .
She will help McCain with his base , but the Republican base is not big enough to win in November .
It is now clear that she was n’t even McCain ’s first or second choice , and it is my guess that we are only at the beginning of the Sarah Palin debacle .
Republicans talk about Democratic fractures , but McCain had to make a running mate choice just to appease the base .
There are real problems with this ticket , so Barack Obama should just sit back and watch it all unwind .
Yesterday , I published an article arguing that John McCain 's policies had contributed significantly to the sorry state of broadband in this country .
In it , I mentioned prominently McCain 's opposition to the 1996 Telecommunications
Act and other efforts to make sure that people can choose from multiple broadband providers .
My argument is that broadband is a market where you need government intervention to create competition .
You want companies to compete with Verizon ; but you can't have every competitor tearing up streets and installing new lines into people 's homes .
So , Verizon should be forced to lease their lines to competitors .
That 's what the 1996 Act asked , in exchange for allowing Verizon and the other Bells to go into long - distance markets .
But the provision was n't enforced and then it was rolled back .
That 's why there 's almost no competition in the market today .
In response , a smart commentator pointed out that there were tons of reasons for opposing the 1996 Telecom Act .
Most of the debate , in fact , centered around censorship and the Communications Decency Act .
Was blocking competition and helping the Bell 's really McCain 's motive in voting nay ?
Well , looking at McCain 's history it sure seems that way !
For starters , he seemed to fundamentally misunderstand that the telecom market is one where regulation is required to create competition .
In the markup of the Act , he wrote :
“ Congress must create free and open markets " ( good ! ) but then ,
" Experience shows . . . that a deregulated market is not long dominated by a few giants , but rather that competitors come along and devise ways to run circles around the giants . "
( Lots of people knew that was wrong then for this industry ; everyone should realize it 's wrong now ! )
Perhaps more important , in the negotiating over the Act , he took the extreme pro-Bell position : arguing that they should be allowed into long distance without opening their local lines .
He also sponsored a failed amendment to the Act that would have knocked out the pro-competition elements of the bill in three years .
Then , in ' 98 , he proposed eliminating all regulations on Bells within a year ; 1999 brought us the " Internet Regulatory Freedom Act of 1999 " to prohibit the FCC from requiring the Bells to lease their wires to competitors ; in 2002 he supported the " Consumer Broadband Deregulation Act , "
which would have vastly limited the rights that states have to regulate broadband , blocked any new laws requiring the leasing of broadband lines , and stopped the FCC from requiring telephone companies to lease fiber to competitors .
In 2005 , he was an original co-sponsor of the “ Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act ” that would have eliminated all managed competition in the broadband market .
And , of course , he ’s the man who brought us FCC chair Michael Powell , who did have some virtues , but who also played a big part in rolling back competition in the market .
John McCain has been very good on some tech issues .
He 's opposed just giving away spectrum , and he acted very honorably in supporting the rights of cities to build municipal wifi networks .
Still , his record on broadband competition is clear and damning : John McCain is a big reason that the Internet in this country is so slow and a big reason why customer service at your DSL or cable provider is so bad .
With the high cost of gasoline and diesel fuel impacting costs for automobiles , trucks , buses and the overall economy , a Temple University physics professor has developed a simple device which could dramatically improve fuel efficiency as much as 20 percent .
According to Rongjia Tao , Chair of Temple 's Physics Department , the small device consists of an electrically charged tube that can be attached to the fuel line of a car 's engine near the fuel injector .
With the use of a power supply from the vehicle 's battery , the device creates an electric field that thins fuel , or reduces its viscosity , so that smaller droplets are injected into the engine .
That leads to more efficient and cleaner combustion than a standard fuel injector , he says .
Six months of road testing in a diesel - powered Mercedes - Benz automobile showed that the device increased highway fuel from 32 miles per gallon to 38 mpg , a 20 percent boost , and a 12 - 15 percent gain in city driving .
The results of the laboratory and road tests verifying that this simple device can boost gas mileage .
" We expect the device will have wide applications on all types of internal combustion engines , present ones and future ones , " Tao wrote in the study published in Energy & Fuels .
Further improvements in the device could lead to even better mileage , he suggests , and cited engines powered by gasoline , biodiesel , and kerosene as having potential use of the device .
Temple has applied for a patent on this technology , which has been licensed to California - based Save The World Air , Inc. , an environmentally conscientious enterprise focused on the design , development , and commercialization of revolutionary technologies targeted at reducing emissions from internal combustion engines .
According to Joe Dell , Vice President of Marketing for STWA , the company is currently working with a trucking company near Reading , Pa. , to test the device on diesel - powered trucks , where he estimates it could increase fuel efficiency as much as 6 - 12 percent .
Dell predicts this type of increased fuel efficiency could save tens of billions of dollars in the trucking industry and have a major impact on the economy through the lowering of costs to deliver goods and services .
" Temple University is very excited about the translation of this new important technology from the research laboratory to the marketplace , " said Larry F. Lemanski , Senior Vice President for Research and Strategic Initiatives at Temple .
" This discovery promises to significantly improve fuel efficiency in all types of internal combustion engine powered vehicles and at the same time will have far - reaching effects in reducing pollution of our environment . "

October 8 , 2008 --
The economic and financial crisis , whose epicentre is found in the United States , has to be utilised by Latin American countries to build an integration favourable to the peoples and at the same initiate a partial delinking from the world capitalist market .
We need to learn the lessons of the 20th century in order to apply them at the beginning of this century .
During the decade of the 1930s that followed the crisis that exploded on Wall Street in 1929 , 12 countries in Latin America suspended for a prolonged time repayment of their foreign debt , prinicipally to North American and western European bankers .
Some of them , such as Brazil and Mexico , imposed on their creditors a reduction of between 50 % and 90 % of their debt some 10 years later .
Mexico was the one that went the furthest with its economic and social reforms .
During the government of Lazaro Cardenas , the petroleum industry was completely nationalised without any compensation for the North American monopolies .
Moreover , 16 million hectares of land were also nationalised and in large part handed over to the indigenous population .
During the 1930s and up until the middle of the 1960s , various Latin American governments carried out very active public policies with the aim of seeking a partially self - centred development , known later as the model of industrialisation via substitution of imports .
On the other hand , beginning in 1959 , the Cuban Revolution attempted to give a socialist content to the Bolivarian project of Latin American integration .
This socialist content began to appear in the Bolivian revolution of 1952 .
Brutal US intervention , backed by the dominant classes and the local armed forces , was necessary to put an end to the ascending cycle of social emancipation during this period .
The blockade of Cuba since 1962 , the military junta in Brazil from 1964 , US intervention in Santo Domingo in 1965 , the Banzer dictatorship in Bolivia in 1971 , the Pinochet coup in Chile in 1973 , and installing dictatorships in Uruguay and Argentina .
The neoliberal model was put in practice first in Chile with Pinochet , and with the intellectual guidance of the Chicago Boys of Milton Friedman , and afterwards was imposed on all the continent , aided by the debt crisis that exploded in 1982 .
With the fall of the dictatorships in the 1980s , the neoliberal model continued in force , principally through the application of structural adjustments programs and the Washington Consensus .
The governments of Latin America were incapable of forming a common front , and the majority applied the recipes dictated by the World Bank and the IMF in a docile manner .
This ended up producing a large popular discontent and a recomposition of popular forces that led to a new cycle of elections of left or centre - left governments , beginning with Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1998 , who committed himself to installing a different model based on social justice .
Two projects of integration
At the beginning of this century , the Bolivarian project of integration of the peoples of the region has gain new momentum .
If we want this new ascending cycle to go further it is necessary to learn the lessons of the past .
What was particularly missing in Latin America during the decades of the 1940s to the 1970s was an authentic project of integration of economies and peoples , combined with a real redistribution of wealth in favour of the working classes .
We need to be conscious of the fact that in Latin America today there is a dispute between two projects of integration , that have an antagonistic class content .
The capitalist classes of Brazil and Argentina ( the two principal economies of South America ) are partisans of an integration based on their economic domination over the rest of the region .
The interests of Brazilian companies , above all , as well as Argentine ones , are very important in all the region : oil and gas , large infrastructure works , mining , metallurgy , agrobusiness , food industries , etc .

The European construction , based on a single market dominated by big capital , is the model that they want to follow .
The Brazilian and Argentine capitalist classes want the workers of the different countries in the region to compete among themselves in order to obtain maximum benefit and be competitive on the world market .
From the point of view of the left , it would be a tragic error to fall back on a policy of stages : support a model of Latin American integration according to the European model , dominated by big capital , with the illusionary hope of giving it a socially emancipatory content later on .
Such support implies putting oneself at the service of capitalist interests .
We do not have to involve ourselves in the capitalist ’s games , trying to be more astute and letting them dictate the rules .
The other project of integration , that falls within Bolivarian framework , wants a social justice content to integration .
This implies public control over natural resources in the region and over large means of production , credit and commercialisation .
The levelling from above of the social conquests of the workers and small producers , at the same time as reducing the differences between the economies in the region .
The substantial improvement of communication between countries of the region , rigorously respecting the environment ( for example , developing railway lines and other means of collective transport before highways ) .
Support for small private producers in numerous activities , agriculture , artisan , trade , services , etc .
The process of social emancipation that the Bolivarian project of the 21st century is pursuing aims to liberate society from capitalist domination , supporting forms of property that have a social function : small private property , public property , cooperative property , communal and collective property , etc .
At the same time , Latin American integration implies the creation of a common financial , judicial and political architecture .
Losing precious time
The current international conjuncture , favourable for developing countries that export primary products , needs to be utilised before the situation changes .
The countries of Latin America have accumulated close to US $ 400,000 million in reserves .
This is no small amount in the hands of Latin American central banks and which needs to be utilised at an opportune moment in order to help regional integration and shield the continent from the effects of the economic and financial crisis that is unfolding in North America and Europe , and that threatens the whole planet .
Unfortunately , we should not create illusions : Latin America is losing precious time , while governments , beyond the rhetoric , pursue a traditional policy of signing of bilateral agreements on investment , acceptance or continuation of negotiations over certain free trade agreements , utilisation of reserves to buy bonds from the US Treasury ( that is , lending capital to the dominant power ) or credit default swaps whose markets have collapsed with Lehman Brothers , AIG etc. , advance payments to the IMF , World Bank and the Paris Club , acceptance of the World Bank tribunal – the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes -- as a way to resolve differences with transnational corporations , continuation of trade negotiations within the framework of the agenda of Doha , maintenance of the military occupation of Haiti .
Following a loud and promising start in 2007 , the initiatives announced in regards to Latin American integration seem to have come to a halt in 2008 .
Bank of the South
In regards to the launching of the Bank of the South , this has already been delayed quite a bit .
Discussions have not progressed .
We have to get rid off any confusion and give a clearly progressive content to this new institution , whose creation was decided upon in December 2007 by seven countries in South America .
The Bank of the South has to be a democratic institution ( one country , one vote ) and transparent ( external auditing ) .
Before using public money to finance large infrastructure projects that do n’t respect the environment and which are carried out by private companies whose objectives are to obtain maximum benefit , we have to support the efforts of the public powers to promote policies such as food sovereignty , agrarian reform , the development of studies in the field of health , the establishment of a pharmaceutical industry that produces high - quality generic medications , collective rail - based means of transport , alternative energy to limit the impact on depleted natural resources , protection of the environment and the development of integrated education systems .
Cancel the debt
Contrary to what many think , the problem of the public debt has not been resolved .
It is true that the external public debt has been reduced , but it has been replaced by an internal public debt that , in certain countries , has acquired totally huge proportions ( Brazil , Colombia , Argentina , Nicaragua and Guatemala ) to the point that it diverts a considerable part of the state budget towards parasitically financial capital .
It is very worthwhile following the example of Ecuador , which established an auditing commission to study the external and internal public debt , with the aim of determining the illegitimate , illicit and illegal parts of the debt .
At a time when , following a series of adventurous operations , the large banks and other private financial institutions of the United States and Europe are wiping out dubious debts with an amount that by far surpasses the external public debt that Latin America owes them , we have to constitute a united front of indebted countries in order to obtain the cancellation of the debt .
Nationalise the banks without compensation
Private banks need to audited and strictly controlled , because they run the risk of being dragged down with the international financial crisis .
We have to avoid a situation where the state ends up nationalising the losses of the banks , as has happened many times before ( Chile under Pinochet , Mexico in 1995 , Ecuador in 1999 - 2000 , etc. ) .
If some banks on the brink of bankruptcy have to be nationalised , this should be done without paying compensation .
Moreover , numerous litigation cases have emerged in the last few years between the states of the region and multinationals , from the North and the South .
Rather that taking them to the ICSID , which is part of the World Bank dominated by a handful of industrialised countries , the countries of the region should follow the example of Bolivia , which has pulled out of the organisation .
They should create a regional organisation for the resolution of litigation initiated by other countries or private companies .
How can we continue to sign loan contracts or trade contracts that state , in the case of litigation , that the only jurisdictions that are valid are those of the US , United Kingdom or other countries of the North ?
We are dealing here with an inadmissible renouncement of sovereignty .
It is worthwhile establishing strict control over capital movements and exchange rates , with the goal of avoiding capital flight and speculative attacks against currencies in the region .
For the states that want to make the Bolivarian project of Latin American integration for greater social justice a reality , it is necessary to advance towards a common currency .
Integration has a political dimension
Naturally , integration has to have a political dimension : a Latin American parliament elected by universal suffrage in each one of the member countries , equipped with a real legislative power .
Within the framework of political construction , we have to avoid repeating the bad example of Europe , where the European Commission ( that is , the European government ) has exaggerated powers in regards to the parliament .
We have to move towards a democratic constituent process with the goal of adopting a common political constitution .
We also have to avoid reproducing the anti-democratic procedure followed by the European Commission that attempts to impose a constitutional treaty elaborated without the active participation of citizens and without submitting it to a referendum in each member country .
On the contrary , we have to follow the example of the constituent assemblies of Venezuela ( 1999 ) , Bolivia ( 2007 ) and Ecuador ( 2007 - 8 ) .
The important democratic advances achieved in the course of these three processes will have to be integrated into the Bolivarian constituent process .
Likewise , it is necessary to strengthen the powers of the Latin American Court of Justice , particularly in matters regarding the guaranteeing for the respect of inalienable human rights .
Until now , various processes of integration coexist : the Community of Andean Nations , Mercosur , Unasur , Caricom , Alba .
It is important to avoid dispersion and adopt a integration process with a social - political definition based on social justice .
This Bolivarian process should bring together all the countries in South America , Central America and the Caribbean that adhere to this orientation .
It is preferable to commence this common construction with a reduced and coherent nucleus , rather than with a heterogeneous set of states whose governments follow contradictory , if not antagonistic , social policies .
Partial delinking from the world capitalist market
Bolivarian integration should be accompanied with a partial delinking from the world capitalist market .
We are dealing with trying to progressively erase the borders that separate the states that participate in the project , reducing the asymmetries between the member countries , especially thanks to a mechanism of transfer of wealth from the ``richer ’’ states to the ``poorer ’’ .
This will allow for the considerable expansion of the internal market and will favour the development of local producers under different forms of property .
It will allow for the putting into action of a process of development ( not only industrialisation ) with substitution of imports .
Of course , this implies the development , for example , of a policy of food sovereignty .
At the same time , the Bolivarian project made up of various member countries will partially delink itself from the world capitalist market .
This means , in particular , the repealing of bilateral treaties in areas of investment and trade .
The member countries of the Bolivarian group should also pull out of institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and the World Trade Orgaisation ( WTO ) , at the same time as promoting new democratic global institutions that respect inalienable human rights .
As was mentioned before , the member states of the new Bolivarian group would equip themselves with new regional institutions , such as the Bank of the South , which would develop collaborative relations with other similar institutions created by states from other regions in the world .
The member states of the new Bolivarian group will act with the maximum number of third states in favour of a radical democratic reform of the United Nations , with the objective of ensuring compliance with the United Nations Charter and the numerous international instruments that defend human rights , such as the international pact on economic , social and cultural rights ( 1996 ) , the charter on the rights and responsibilities of states ( 1974 ) , the declaration on the right to development ( 1986 ) , the resolution on the rights of indigenous people ( 2007 ) .
Equally , it would lend support to the activities of the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice in The Hague .
It would act in favour of reaching understandings between states and peoples with the goal of acting to limit climate change as much as possible , given that this represents a terrible danger for humanity .

Heavy early voting in Harris and Galveston counties Voters turn out in force for historic campaign

Energized by disputes over a collapsing economy , foreign wars , a female vice - presidential hopeful and a historic first African - American presidential candidate , thousands of area voters trooped to the polls this morning for the first day of early balloting .
The result was part exercise in statesmanship , part circus .
But it clearly seemed a day few of the participants would forget .
As of 1 p.m. , Harris County early voting totals had already surpassed the first - day total in 2004 of 20,868 , according to the County Clerk 's office .
Lines began forming long before the polls opened at 8 a.m. , and tempers ran short at a few locations as glitches caused delays in the process .
Harris County election officials said the problems were not widespread and were being resolved .
Among the problems was a malfunction in the machines that scan voters ' identification at the Acres Homes Multi-Service Center , where about 300 people stood in line waiting to cast ballots this morning .
" This is inexcusable , " U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee said as she talked with voters and officials at the polling place .
" I came out here just expecting to shake people 's hands and it's pandemonium . "
Jackson Lee , a Democrat from Houston , complained that election officials had plenty of time to prepare and should have been able to avoid such problems .
The malfunction was resolved after about 90 minutes , but heavy voter turnout led to long lines at the center at 6719 W. Montgomery .
Another electronic problem halted voting in the polling place at the Houston Community College Southeast Campus about 10:30 a.m .
About 20 voters were in line at the site , at 6815 Rustic , when election worker Cruz Lemus announced that the connection to the system at the Harris County Clerk 's Office had been lost .
Lemus said election workers were trying to get permission to turn their equipment off and then on again in hopes of re-establishing the connection , but she could not estimate how long the delay would last .
County Clerk Beverly Kaufman said she was unaware of that problem , but added : " It 's Monday morning blues , Monday morning jitters and we have some problems to work out .
But I 'm confident that , by noon , we will be at 100 percent . "
Kaufman said about 6,000 people cast ballots in the first two hours of voting , mostly without problems .
At the East End Multi-Service Center , where Kaufman cast her own ballot , a printer malfunctioned and workers had to check her in by hand .
In response to reports from other locations that electronic voting machines were reversing votes cast in the presidential election , she said , " We tested those aspects of the system in a formal way with party officials and that did not occur .
I still cannot urge people enough to check your work and keep your focus on what you 're doing . "
Her office was informed early today that some of the first voters had cast straight - ticket Democratic ballots and then discovered that the electronic machines listed them as voting for John McCain in the presidential election .
Hector de Leon , spokesman for the County Clerk 's Office , said problems such as those reported with the identification scanning system likely reflected poll workers ' inexperience in operating the new equipment .
" The system reads a bar code and it's meant to expedite the process , " he said .
" Voters can still be processed in the regular way . "
De Leon noted that , while about 6,000 voters had turned out in the first two hours of balloting today , a total of about 20,000 voters cast ballots on the first day of early voting in the 2004 elections .
" Usually , on the first day of early voting and on Election Day , we experiernce some minor problems , " de Leon said .
" We find the phones or the printers were n't properly connected .
But by noon , things generally are running smoothingly . "
The heavy turnout in some locations contrasted sharply with the early hours at Ripley House , a charter school on Navigation on the city 's east side , where volunteers outnumbered voters and there was no waiting to cast ballots .
Sandra Cruz , 34 , an administrative assistant , brought her 3 - year - old daughter along .
" I did n't want to be caught up in the chaos of last - minute voting , " said Cruz , who had the day off .
Poll workers said about five people were waiting to vote when they opened this morning .
The first voters at Palm Center , in the 5300 block of Griggs Road on Houston 's south side , arrived at 5:30 a.m. — more than two hours before the polls opened .
By 7 a.m. , the line had grown to about 100 .
Spirits were high and those waiting cheerfully critiqued the candidates and weighed the issues .
State Rep. Rick Noriega voted for himself in the U.S. Senate race this morning , saying he was trying to make the point that all voters should vote early to avoid any problems on Nov. 4 .
" Mañana is today , " the Democrat said .
" We have to take our destiny and grab it and run with it . "
Noriega voted along with his parents , Joe and Tommie , at the Houston Community College Southeast Campus in the district he serves in the Texas House of Representatives , as well as the neighborhood in which he grew up .
The early voting lines were short at the polling station , in contrast to reports that some of the other 35 locations in the county were deluged with early voters .
Noriega 's election opponents include Republican incumbent John Cornyn .
Early voting started out ``heavy all over '' in Galveston County today , said elections director Douglas Godinich .
He said things were going smoothly .
With 14 early voting sites , and two more to be opened over the weekend , Godinich said the county expects the heaviest early voting turnout it has ever had .
Galveston County voters can cast early votes at any of the 14 sites , no matter where their home precincts are , Godinich said .
On election day , when lines are expected to be much longer , voters must cast ballots in their home precinct .
In Brazoria County 1,196 votes had been cast by 11 a.m. and seemed to be heading toward topping the 3,140 total votes cast the first day of early voting four years ago , said Susan Cloudt , the county 's head election clerk .
No major problems had been reported .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It took two tumultuous weeks of moral and fiscal debate , but Congress and the Bush administration on Friday finally put a capstone on the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial system .
President Bush signed the bill less than two hours after the plan , which had been amended and passed by the Senate on Wednesday , was approved by the House .
The changes the Senate made include the addition of a host of tax break extensions and some new provisions intended to help individuals and businesses .
Here 's a breakdown of some of the economic rescue plan 's main provisions :
Attacking credit crisis :
The core of the plan the House voted on is the same as what it rejected on Monday : the Treasury 's proposal to let financial institutions sell to the government their troubled assets , mostly mortgage - related .
It will allow the Treasury access to the $ 700 billion in stages , with $ 250 billion being made available immediately .
Protecting taxpayers :
The final law is also similar to the original House bill in that it includes a number of provisions that supporters say will protect taxpayers .
One will direct the president to propose a bill requiring the financial industry to reimburse taxpayers for any net losses from the program after five years .
And the Treasury will be allowed to take ownership stakes in participating companies .
In addition , over time , supporters say , taxpayers are likely to make back much if not all of the money the Treasury uses because it will be investing in assets with underlying value .
The law includes a stipulation that the Treasury set up an insurance program - to be funded with risk - based premiums paid by the industry - to guarantee companies ' troubled assets , including mortgage - backed securities , purchased before March 14 , 2008 .
Curbing executive pay :
The law will place curbs on executive pay for companies selling assets or buying insurance from Uncle Sam .
For example , any bonus or incentive paid to a senior executive officer for targets met will have to be repaid if it 's later proven that earnings or profit statements were inaccurate .
Oversight :
The rescue plan will set up two oversight committees .
A Financial Stability Board will include the Federal Reserve chairman , the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , the Federal Home Finance Agency director , the Housing and Urban Development secretary and the Treasury secretary .
A congressional oversight panel , to which the Financial Stability Board will report , will have five members appointed by House and Senate leadership from both parties .
Tax breaks :
The Senate - version of the bill that the House passed on Friday included three key tax elements designed to attract House Republican votes .
It extends a number of renewable energy tax breaks for individuals and businesses , including a deduction for the purchase of solar panels .
The law also continues a host of other expiring tax breaks .
Among them : the research and development credit for businesses and the credit that allows individuals to deduct state and local sales taxes on their federal returns .
In addition , the law includes relief for another year from the Alternative Minimum Tax , without which millions of Americans would have to pay the so - called " income tax for the wealthy . "
New accounting rules :
The bailout plan underlines the Securities and Exchange Commission 's power to change accounting rules on how banks and Wall Street firms value securities , and directs the agency to study the issue .
Some observers argue that tight accounting rules are a major reason for the credit crisis in the first place .
Others contend that changing the so - called mark - to - market rules will just bury problems lurking beneath the surface and could further shake investor confidence in the already battered financial sector .
( More about the rules . )
Shielding bank deposits :
The law temporarily raises the FDIC insurance cap to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
It allows the FDIC to borrow from the Treasury to cover any losses that might occur as a result of the higher insurance limit .
Federal bank regulators , who first floated the idea to Congress late Tuesday , said that bumping up the insurance limits will help improve liquidity at banks across the country .
It may also provide a much - needed dose of confidence for consumers who may be worried about the health of their bank .
( More about FDIC rules . )
The plan will also temporarily increase the level of federal insurance for credit union savings to $ 250,000 .
Mitigating foreclosures :
The new law calls on federal agencies to encourage loan servicers to modify mortgages by a number of means - including reducing the principal or interest rate .
It also extends a temporary provision that exempts from federal income tax any debt forgiven by a bank to a borrower in a foreclosure .
Cost :
The law 's tax provisions - the bulk of which come from the addition of tax breaks from other legislation - may reduce federal tax revenue by $ 110 billion over 10 years , according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation .
More than half of that is due to the one - year extension of AMT relief .
The Congressional Budget Office said it cannot estimate the net budget effects of the troubled asset program because of the many unknowns about that piece of the bill .
However , the agency noted in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday , it expects the program " would entail some net budget cost " but that it would be " substantially smaller than $ 700 billion . "
Overall , the CBO said , " the bill as a whole would increase the budget deficit over the next decade . "

Two Washington
Post writers acknowledged the infighting among conservatives in today ’s columns .
E. J. Dionne gets to the core :
Conservatism has finally crashed on problems for which its doctrines offered no solutions ( the economic crisis foremost among them , thus Bush ’s apostasy ) and on its refusal to acknowledge that the “ real America ” is more diverse , pragmatic and culturally moderate than the place described in Palin ’s speeches or imagined by the right - wing talk show hosts .
Conservatives came to believe that if they repeated phrases such as “ Joe the Plumber ” often enough , they could persuade working - class voters that policies tilted heavily in favor of the very privileged were actually designed with Joe in mind .
It is the McCain / Palin campaign , of course , that has really opened the rift .
None of them is pleased with the campaign , either because McCain is n’t sufficiently nasty to appease the “ social conservatives ” or because his choice of Palin was such a ridiculous move .
But , as Dionne observes , the “ conservative elite ” has finally had to pay the price for their long practice of catering to the Far Right at election time .
Then there are those conservatives who see Palin as a “ fatal cancer to the Republican Party ” ( David Brooks ) , as someone who “ does n’t know enough about economics and foreign policy to make Americans comfortable with a President Palin ” ( Kathleen Parker ) , as “ a symptom and expression of a new vulgarization in American politics ” ( Peggy Noonan ) .
These conservatives deserve credit for acknowledging how ill - suited Palin is for high office .
But what we see here is a deep split between parts of the conservative elite and much of the rank and file .
For years , many of the elite conservatives were happy to harvest the votes of devout Christians and gun owners by waging a phony class war against “ liberal elitists ” and “ leftist intellectuals . ”
Suddenly , the conservative writers are discovering that the very anti-intellectualism their side courted and encouraged has begun to consume their movement .
The cause of Edmund Burke , Leo Strauss , Robert Nisbet and William F. Buckley Jr. is now in the hands of Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity — and Sarah Palin .
Reason has been overwhelmed by propaganda , ideas by slogans , learned manifestoes by direct - mail hit pieces .
One conservative who is n’t joining the rush overboard , and has promised to “ go down with the McCain ship ” is Charles Krauthammer , also at the Post .
It ’s too much to hope that Krauthammer really will sink below the waves after the McCain ship goes down , but today ’s column succeeds in demonstrating how detached he and his fellow conservative loyalists are from reality .
First , I ’ll have no truck with the phony case ginned up to rationalize voting for the most liberal and inexperienced presidential nominee in living memory .
The “ erratic ” temperament issue , for example .
As if McCain ’s risky and unsuccessful but in no way irrational attempt to tactically maneuver his way through the economic tsunami that came crashing down a month ago renders unfit for office a man who demonstrated the most admirable equanimity and courage in the face of unimaginable pressures as a prisoner of war , and who later steadily navigated innumerable challenges and setbacks , not the least of which was the collapse of his campaign just a year ago .
McCain the “ erratic ” is a cheap Obama talking point .
The 40 - year record testifies to McCain the stalwart .
Krauthammer pulls out the POW card immediately and makes his usual dishonest attempt to redefine the “ erratic ” comment .
No , Chuck , it was n’t made solely in reference to McCain ’s inept and contradictory moves when the economy tanked ( although his habit of switching back and forth in the matter of hours on the subject certainly did n’t help ) .
The “ erratic ” label refers to his behavior over the last few months , flipping back and forth on virtually every issue under discussion — except that he was a POW .
Having redefined McCain ’s role in the economic crisis ( and completely ignoring the looming idiocy of the Palin nomination ) , Krauthammer plays the only card he has : fear .
Who do you want answering that phone at 3 a .m.?
A man who ’s been cramming on these issues for the past year , who ’s never had to make an executive decision affecting so much as a city , let alone the world ?
A foreign policy novice instinctively inclined to the flabbiest , most vaporous multilateralism ( e.g. , the Berlin Wall came down because of “ a world that stands as one ” ) , and who refers to the most deliberate act of war since Pearl Harbor as “ the tragedy of 9/11 , ” a term more appropriate for a bus accident ?
Or do you want a man who is the most prepared , most knowledgeable , most serious foreign policy thinker in the United States Senate ?
A man who not only has the best instincts but has the honor and the courage to , yes , put country first , as when he carried the lonely fight for the surge that turned Iraq from catastrophic defeat into achievable strategic victory ?
Wah ?
McCain is the “ most prepared , most knowledgeable , most serious foreign policy thinker in the United States Senate ” ?
Is that supposed to be a joke ?
Could we get a little evidence to support this ludicrous claim , Chuck ?
Oh , here it is : McCain ’s “ lonely fight for the surge ” . . .
Wah ?
Do n’t you mean George Bush ’s lonely fight ?
Or General Petraeus ’?
Or maybe Joe Lieberman ?
Or the whole baying pack of conservative pundits that have been slavering about “ the surge ” for more than a year ?
If McCain was “ lonely ” it was only because he failed to show up on the Senate floor .
Can anyone ever again take Krauthammer seriously after the manifest stupidity of this column ?
Maybe Davy Jones needs a columnist , Chuck .
Otherwise , it ’s more than time to jump ship , it ’s time to get a real job .
You suck at this one .

Stuart Shepard of Focus on the Family asked people to pray for torrential rain to start exactly two minutes before Obama ’s acceptance speech in Denver , because he wants our next president to be against abortion and gays .
I ’m not kidding :
Strangely , Obama ’s speech had perfect weather .
Which makes Hurricane Gustav extremely ironic .

Conservative Columnist Calls For Palin To Withdraw From Race
Created : September 26 , 2008 11:08 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The National Review ’s Kathleen Parker — an early champion of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ’s candidacy for vice president — is now calling for Palin to withdraw from the ticket , in the wake of weak nationally televised interview performances .
As we ’ve seen and heard more from John McCain ’s running mate , it is increasingly clear that Palin is a problem .
Quick study or not , she does n’t know enough about economics and foreign policy to make Americans comfortable with a President Palin should conditions warrant her promotion …
It was fun while it lasted .
Palin ’s recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity , and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , I ’ve been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I ’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .
Palin filibusters .
She repeats words , filling space with deadwood .
Cut the verbiage and there ’s not much content there .
Here ’s but one example of many from her interview with Hannity : “ Well , there is a danger in allowing some obsessive partisanship to get into the issue that we ’re talking about today .
And that ’s something that John McCain , too , his track record , proving that he can work both sides of the aisle , he can surpass the partisanship that must be surpassed to deal with an issue like this . ”
When Couric pointed to polls showing that the financial crisis had boosted Obama ’s numbers , Palin blustered wordily : “ I ’m not looking at poll numbers .
What I think Americans at the end of the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and see who ’s more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change , and who ’s actually done it ? ”
If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself .
Ouch !
So Ms. Parker , what is the solution ?
McCain can’t repudiate his choice for running mate .
He not only risks the wrath of the GOP ’s unforgiving base , but he invites others to second - guess his executive decision - making ability .
Barack Obama faces the same problem with Biden .
Only Palin can save McCain , her party , and the country she loves .
She can bow out for personal reasons , perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn .
No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first .
But the McCain campaign is in a Catch - 22 .
If Palin stays on , they basically have to keep her muzzled as much as possible — clearly , there has been a very good reason for hiding her from the press .
But continuing to keep her quiet will only invite more criticism .
If Palin withdraws herself from the ticket , it will invite “ others to second - guess McCain ’s executive decision - making ability , ” as Parker fears .
Whatever happens , unless Palin somehow turns this thing around , people are second - guessing McCain ’s decision to pick her as a running mate .
Palin withdrawing herself may be the campaign ’s best move — we wo n’t really know for sure until November — but it would be the best of a bunch of bad options .
If Palin bows out with just 38 days left until the election , McCain could find himself starring in a re-run of George McGovern ’s debacle with Thomas Eagleton in 1972 .
It ’s hard to feel sorry for him — McCain created this mess himself , by cynically choosing someone who he thought would help him get elected , rather than help him govern .
Two days after Barack Obama drew 100,000 supporters to a rally in St. Louis , John McCain attracted about 2,500 people to a field in this nearby suburb Monday , a visible symbol of the challenge the Republican nominee faces in this crucial state .
McCain barnstormed Missouri , hammering his opponent on taxes , healthcare and foreign policy in hopes of rebuilding the coalition of rural conservatives , evangelicals and others who helped deliver the state twice to President Bush .
The Arizona senator gave his standard campaign speech here in a key Republican stronghold and later flew to Columbia to have lunch with a dozen or so supporters .
He ended with a sparsely attended , late - afternoon rally in Belton , outside Kansas City , one of the Republican - held suburbs where McCain needs a huge turnout .
Carol Wessel , GOP chairman in Lincoln County , insisted McCain would win the state despite losing his lead in polls .
She dismissed the low turnout at his morning rally .

“ It ’s Monday , ” she said .
“ Most people are working . ”
Others are n’t so sure .
Missouri is the ultimate presidential bellwether :
It has voted with the winning party all but once in the last century .
Sen. John F. Kerry , the Democratic nominee , had pulled his TV ads and essentially given up at this point four years ago .
This year , Missouri is suffering its worst unemployment in 17 years , and voters harbor a deep suspicion of the $ 700 - billion bailout of financial institutions .
Obama ’s campaign also appears to be swamping McCain ’s effort in the state .
Advertisement
The Democrat has opened 40 offices , compared with 16 for McCain and the state GOP .
Obama also is spending twice as much on TV ads , officials say .
More importantly , perhaps , a Democratic registration drive has added about 250,000 new voters in St. Louis and Kansas City .
Campaign aides expect McCain to run up a lead in the state ’s rural southwest , a strongly conservative area .
Both sides are fighting for the densely populated suburbs of St. Louis and Kansas City that will decide the state .

In his rally here , 20 miles northwest of St. Louis , McCain reached out to the conservative GOP base .
McCain blamed the “ feminist left ” for criticizing Sarah Palin since he announced his choice for a running mate .
His surrogates portrayed the race in more apocalyptic terms .
“ This election is a referendum on socialism , ” said Rep. Todd Akin ( R - Mo. ) , who introduced McCain .
After noting that Americans long ago cast off the chains of slavery , Akin said Obama ’s tax policies would impose “ the golden chains of socialism . ”
McCain again cited Joe the Plumber , as he calls the Ohio man who confronted Obama over his proposed tax policies .
His aides are convinced that Obama ’s comment that taxes help “ spread the wealth ” has helped stop McCain ’s slide in the polls .
Advertisement
“ God bless Joe the Plumber , ” one aide said .
McCain portrays Joe Wurzelbacher as a symbol for all Americans struggling to get by .
Among them , to hear McCain tell it , are Phil the Bricklayer , Wendy the Waitress and Rose the Teacher .
On Monday , he added Ed the Dairyman .
Jessica Turntine , 24 , a registered nurse , said McCain ’s approach made sense to her .
“ I do not want to spread the wealth , ” she said after the rally .
“ I want to keep my money . ”

McCain returned to the theme after lunch with supporters in the Buckingham Smokehouse Bar - B - Q restaurant in Columbia .
“ These are Joe the Plumbers , writ large , ” he said , as the group stepped outside to announce their jobs .
“ These are the pediatricians , these are the small - business owners . . . the painters . . . and the pharmacists . . . and the cosmetic distributor and land developers .
These are the backbone of America ’s economy . ”
In a rally that barely filled the corner of a high school football field in Belton , McCain derided comments by Joe Biden , Obama ’s running mate .
Biden said , if elected , Obama would be tested by an international crisis within his first six months and would need supporters to “ stand with him ” as he made difficult and perhaps unpopular decisions .
McCain portrayed the remarks as a gaffe that proved Obama was too risky to send to the Oval Office .
Advertisement
“ We do n’t want a president who invites testing from the world at a time when our economy is in crisis and Americans are already fighting two wars , ” he said .
David Wade , an Obama spokesman , accused McCain of twisting Biden ’s comments .
“ Biden referenced the simple fact that history shows presidents face challenges from Day One , ” he said .

WASHINGTON -- Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are drawing up plans to toughen oversight of the financial industry and considering introducing another economic - stimulus package in the wake of the government 's decision to buy stakes in major U.S. banks .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is mulling recommendations from several economists that Congress act on an economic - recovery package that would cost taxpayers $ 300 billion , according to congressional aides , equivalent to about 2 % of the country 's gross domestic product .

It has been obvious for quite some time that they felt they were at risk of LOSING this election and relinquishing control over the things they want control over and baaaaaaaaby ... they are SCARED !
Scared enough to throw a hail mary pass in the forth quarter .
It 's all about WINNING .
NEVER about the best thing for the country .
IN MY OPINION .
For the Republican party as of late ... the only thing that seems to matter is WINNING .
CONQUERING .
Reminds me of the history my father taught me because it was n't in the school books .
The history of the REAL DEAL regarding the Native Americans and how they were CONQUERED .
I know the Republican party of the past 8 years is not the party for me .
I never thought for one second that Bush was EVER qualified to be President and I knew he did n't have my best interests at heart from the beginning .
Therefore ... he NEVER got my vote .
Ain't no way in East Egypt is anyone going to convince me they knew about this pregnancy ish .
I do n't give a rat 's azz WHAT they say .
The holier than thou smugness of that party , CURRENTLY , would DIE before they let something as ugly as teenage pregnancy have a White politically recognized face attached to it .
These same people BOYCOTTED Nick TV and Disney to put pressure on them to get rid of that Spears girl and that Solange chick .
That ish was all OVER and they MEANT that ish !
You think they were playing ?????
HELL.NO .
I bet Laura Bush ( whom I have respect for because she is TRULY a lady from what I 've seen and heard ) is in turmoil about Gov. Palin .
I mean REALLY .
A Bush and a Palin ?
Holding hands and ish ?
REALLY ? Mmmm...okay .
But 18,000,000 wanted Hillary for President and all they see is the number 18,000,000 .
All they want ?
TO.WIN .
Hail .
Mary .
Better yet ... a woman who is a working MOTHER cuz that 's what feminists mainly care about ( ACCORDING TO THEIR STATISTICS ) .
They mainly care about being treated as equal in the workplace so they can continue to lay claim to being equal and being able to do anything a man can do .
THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICAN'S ARE BANKING ON .
This election being broken down to attack THAT ISSUE ALONE .
Let 's find a woman we can't connect to the past 8 years IN ANY WAY and we can sell it .
Yup .
We can make her out to be LESS about politics and MORE about being a woman and how women have it so.damn.hard .BUT WE CAN HELP THEM OVERCOME !
Americans are a being used in an elaborate scheme , ONCE AGAIN , to stop thinking about the REAL issues such as the economy , healthcare , our troops and the war .
THE ISSUES THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE FAILED , FAILED , FAILED , FAILED at MIGHTILY these past 8 years .
So what to do ?
Create a full on media BLITZ to get those issues off the minds of the people because those issues are too complicated .
They are too hot to touch .
Let 's get the American people something MUCH simpler to answer .
A whole new LESS COMPLICATED issue .
Can a woman be President .
The answer ?
Quite simply ... is YES .
And that is what the Republicans are banking on .
That in this world of instant everything .
Of Google .
Of quick and EASY answers .
They are banking on our lack of patience to sit and listen for the answers to the TOUGH questions .
They are banking on our wanting INSTANT results for at least ONE question .
CAN A WOMAN BE PRESIDENT .
The answer ?
Quite simply ... is YES .
My father would have laughed his azz off at this one in his delight and glee at the pure PLAYANESS of it .
Pure defense of a flank attack .
He 'd label it a Jedi Mind Trick of the most BRILLIANT kind !
See ... he was a chess player and believed in strategy , strategy , strategy with the end result being to win .
That 's all that counts .
Winning .
For your oil buddies .
Your special interest buddies .
The people who are FIRMLY entrenched in way things are CURRENTLY .
They are so damn confident ... they have n't even THOUGHT of a Plan B because if the last two elections were any indication ... they got this cuz they think Americans are DUMB .
And hell ... they just might be .
Gov. Palin has not been allowed to answer one question from the press yet .
Why ?
I think it 's because they are in the process of getting the team from Sandra Bullock 's " Miss Congeniality " to fix her up a bit .
Give the ALLUSION that she has the confidence and grace of being PRESIDENTIAL .
Her whole dang family + Levi. SHOULDERS BACK .
CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH CLOSED .
NO UNDERAGE DRINKING .
ONLY " THOSE " PEOPLE ARE HAPPY ABOUT A BABY COMING TO AN UNWED MOTHER SO STOP SMILING DAMMIT !
18,000,000 cracks on the glass ceiling .

Two Fridays ago , Lyda Green , the president of the Alaska state senate , awoke at about 6 A.M. to a call from one of her aides .
“ She started yelling , ” Green said last week , over the telephone from Wasilla , Alaska .
“ I said , ‘ I ca n’t hear you .
What are you saying ?’
She finally got it out : ‘ McCain has chosen Palin as his running mate ! ’
I was just silent . ”
Since the Palin announcement , a number of intriguing critics of the Governor have gained notoriety .
There ’s Anne Kilkenny , a voter registrar and housewife who observed Palin up close on the Wasilla city council in the nineteen - nineties .
She wrote a long antiPalin missive that coursed through the Internet last week with the speed of one of those viral e-mails tarring Obama .
And there ’s Mudflats , the anonymous Alaskan blogger who has become a go - to source for Palin muckraking in the liberal blogosphere .
But in the competitive world of Alaskan Palin critics Green stands apart .
She ’s sixty - nine years old , a conservative Republican who represents Palin ’s home town .
Palin supported Green when she first ran for the state senate .
Unlike some partisan critics , when Green speaks ill of Palin she sounds more like a disappointed grandmother than a political hit woman .
Her official biography lists her interests as “ family , reading , bridge , piano , traveling , tennis , ” and on the morning of the Palin announcement she was sleeping in past six only because she had been up late sewing .
A reporter from the Anchorage Daily News called later that Friday morning , and Green did n’t think twice about rendering her judgment on Palin .
“ She ’s not prepared to be governor , ” she said , in comments soon posted on the paper ’s Web site .
“ How can she be prepared to be vice president or president ?
Look at what she ’s done to this state .
What would she do to the nation ? ”
Green and Palin were friends and ideological allies throughout the nineties .
“ If you had looked at our résumés , as far as being pro-life , pro-N.R.A. , pro-family , pro-parental control , saving taxpayer dollars , keeping government out of our lives , we would have been identical , ” she said .
She traces the chill in their relationship to her decision not to endorse Palin in her 2006 gubernatorial primary .
( She stayed neutral . )
As governor , Green says , Palin , unlike her predecessors — Democrats and Republicans — has ignored leaders in the legislature and turned every policy disagreement , whether a dispute over a tax on studded tires or a recent debate on rebate checks , into a personal vendetta .
“ That became her style : in the media implying a negative picture of the legislature , ” Green said .
The animosity became public last January , when Palin turned up on an Anchorage shock - jock radio program , “ The Bob and Mark Show . ” Bob Lester said that he knew Palin believed Green was “ a bitch ” and “ a cancer . ”
Palin laughed at the comments .
“ Sarah can be heard in the background tittering , hee - heeing , ” Green said , “ never saying , ‘ That ’s not appropriate , let ’s not talk like that , let ’s change the subject , ’ or anything . ”
Green was devastated .
“ I worked through it , ” she said .
“ The difficult thing about it was when my children read about it online .
They were dumbfounded , because they had known Sarah .
I had breast cancer in ’97 and had a radical mastectomy .
Sarah certainly knew I had breast cancer , because she sent me flowers when I was ill . ”
Green insists that she ’s not the only Republican who is stunned by McCain ’s decision ; she ’s just the most vocal about it .
Privately , she says , many other Alaskans are as critical as she is .
That ’s not how it looked down on the floor among her state ’s delegates the night that Palin spoke in St. Paul .
The Alaskans , who earlier in the week had undergone media training to learn how to stay positive when talking to reporters about Palin , raised “ Palin Power ” signs and chanted “ Drop the puck ! ” ( something to do with hockey ) .
When Palin walked onstage , they yelled , “ We love you ! ”
Asked what he thought of Palin ’s speech , Lyda Green ’s husband , Curtis , said that he and his wife did n’t see it .
“ No , ca n’t stand to watch her , ” he said .
Lyda was more diplomatic .
“ I had a previous engagement , ” she said .
“ I was watching the U.S. Open . ” ♦
As a technical director for the SCEA Santa Monica studio I do a lot of interviewing and , to a lesser degree , hiring of programmers for the God of War team .
At some point during any hiring process the issue of salary inevitably comes up — as it should .
Often that bit is painless and company and candidate will find an offer that makes both parties happy .
Occasionally , though , there will be a difference in what someone is asking and what a company is willing to pay .
There are several reasons this can happen , but one particular reason I wanted to address through this post : a lack of knowledge of prevailing wages in the industry on behalf of the candidate .
Today , there really is no reason for people to not have a reasonably good idea of prevailing wages in our industry based on the resources out there .
Some of them you might know about , but some you might not .
[ SCEA job links deleted — all jobs filled ! ]
Friends and industry forums
When it comes to statistical data there ’s two ( three ? ) key things to care about : strength in numbers , and fairness and accuracy in reporting .
Interestingly , but perhaps not surprisingly , people usually first turn to friends and industry forums for salary information .
For example , on The ChaosEngine ( an industry - only forum ) you can find salaries discussed in the North America Programmer Salary Poll and Salary Amnesty threads .
I say “ interestingly ” because I ’m not sure I ’d really recommend these sources , certainly not as a single data point .
The sampling is limited , you often do n’t get an accurate job title posted with the salary data point , there are sampling biases , etc .
All these issues compound to make extrapolation from the given data points hard , if not impossible .
Job and salary websites
You can also turn to dedicated job and salary websites for information .
Unfortunately , few of these provide effective means of filtering for the games industry .
For example , Glassdoor seems of limited value ( right now ) , perhaps unless you ’re looking at working for Electronic Arts .
At the time of writing they list 73 salaries for Electronic Arts , 10 for Activision , 5 for THQ , 2 for SCEA , 1 for Take - Two , and that seems about it .
Salary.com seems completely useless ; it does n’t seem to know any of the terms “ games programmer ” , “ tools programmer ” , “ graphics programmer ” or similar .
Better is indeed where you get hits for all three terms along with some suggested salary ranges , based on ranges given in some of the job ads .
And speaking of ranges given in the job ads , another place to look is at the various job posting places , like e.g.
CreativeHeads .
net where you can find ads like this one for a tools programmer in El Segundo for $ 80 - 110 K , or CyberCoders where you ’ll see e.g. a search for graphics programmers return a listing for Boston , MA , in the range $ 60 K - 120 K .
Dice is another site that lists game development jobs , sometimes with salary ranges .
The Game Industry Salary Survey
Quite accurate ( based on statistical significance , and match with H - 1B data given below ) is the Game Industry Salary Survey that is conducted by Game Developer / Gamasutra / CMP
Media every year ( for several years in a row now ) .
It ’s people like you and me who contribute data points to this survey , and the more industry people who contribute the more accurate it gets .
A summarized version of the data is released for free online .
If you want the full survey you have to pay CMP Media quite a bit of money , sadly .
For 2008 , 2007 , and 2006 , the Game Industry Salary Survey has that programmers , on average , are making this much in salary :
( 2008 ) < 3 years 3 - 6 years > 6 years Programmer / engineer $ 57,665 $ 75,070 $ 94,525 Lead programmer $ 75,761 $ 77,418 $ 103,409 Technical director $ 80,833 $ 111,250 $ 128,676
( 2007 ) < 3 years 3 - 6 years > 6 years Programmer / engineer $ 57,913 $ 74,707 $ 88,841 Lead programmer $ 73,311 $ 80,132 $ 98,152 Technical director N/ A $ 91,944 $ 119,142
( 2006 ) < 3 years 3 - 6 years > 6 years Programmer / engineer $ 52,989 $ 73,618 $ 90,658 Lead programmer $ 76,848 $ 81,591 $ 100,528 Technical director N/A $ 107,738 $ 121,071
If you ’re not a programmer , follow the links above and see the salaries listed for other job categories ( sorry , but this is a programming blog after all ) .
The one thing you do n’t get with this survey is access to individual data points .
You also do n’t get a breakdown per region , or any number of other type of reports that could be interesting .
( The full report probably has many of these , but who wants to pay lots of money for that ?
Not me . )
Salary information from the H - 1B database
Well , guess what , turns out you can create your own little survey , with data points from the H - 1B Data Disclosure website !
There anyone can download the “ H - 1B Efile Data ” ( or “ H - 1B Fax Data ” ) applications for the years 2002 - 2007 .
( Before you do , though , a warning : these are massive files and not easy to comb through .
I downloaded the 2007 Efile text file , which is 30 MB , but uncompresses to a 143MB (! ) text file . )
The Efile text file contains something like over 90 % of all issued H - 1B visas for the year , with information about the company applying for the visa , what the position is , how much salary is offered , etc .
A gold mine for the statistics buff .
Thanks goes to the blogger at the Casually Hardcore devlog for alerting us to the existence of the H - 1B database !
As I said , I downloaded the 2007 data and mined it for game company entries .
I ’m not sure I got them all , but I got a decent sampling .
Specifically , in 2007 , across 28 CA games ( and film / graphics ) companies , I got that the average programmer salary across all applications was $ 87 K .
The average for senior programmers was $ 103 K , and for lead programmers $ 109 K .
Note how this data matches fairly well with the Game Industry Salary Survey , especially considering that programmers brought in on visas are often of above - average skill ( otherwise , why bother ) .
The table below shows the programmer salary data I extracted .
( Note : to compile the data I had to convert some entries giving hourly and weekly salaries to yearly salaries , which I did by multiplying by 37.5 * 52 and 52 , respectively .
This will have affected the data somewhat , but likely not significantly ) .

Again , sorry , the table above is just the programmer data .
That said , here ’s a zipped Excel file containing all the 2007 H - 1B game developer data I was able to mine from the 2007 Efile , including data for artists , designers , producers , programmers , as well as a few other odd professions ( e.g. a “ supply chain analyst ” at Activision ) .
Hourly and weekly salaries have not been converted to yearly salaries in this file .
Playing around with Excel on this file could help you answer , say , if people in Northern CA are paid more or less than people in Southern CA , or any other question you ’d like to pose .
I was going to do the same for the Efiles for previous years to get a larger pool of data , but ran out of steam .
It would be cool if someone actually bothered to do it ( and post a link here ) .
To mine the file I basically just “ grepped ” the text file for known game company names ( from a big list of company names ) and then manually cleaned up the resulting file .
Summary
I do n’t really have much more to add at this point , other than that I hope this information is useful to you .
If you have any other good ( reliable ) sources , please post them in the comments .
Oh , actually , sorry to end on a bum note , but do remember that not every programmer is top talent and will command top dollar .
Assuming a gaussian distribution ( which seems reasonable ) , roughly half of all programmers are below average .
Make sure you ’re not one of them before you start demanding a higher salary based on this data !
Rails has an AtomFeedHelper that I just helped improve .
If you look at a feed , it contains things like authors , ids , links , dates , and text .
Rails already knows about ids , links , and dates , so it can provide reasonable defaults for these that you can override if you need to , but otherwise generally do n’t have to worry about .
That leaves only authors and text for a minimal but complete feed .
Author information generally either comes naturally from the data , or is something that you set once at the feed level .
That leaves text .
Unless you are writing blog software , an ActiveRecord does n’t have typically have “ content ” .
This means that you have to synthesize a summary from the data .
Of course , one can do this via string concatenation and interpolation , but this gets messy quick if you are talking about loops .
Builder provides a much cleaner way .
atom_feed do |feed| feed .
title " Who bought #{@product.title } " feed.updated @orders.first.created_at for order in @orders feed . entry ( order ) do |entry | entry .
title " Order #{order.id} " entry.summary : type => ' xhtml ' do |xhtml| xhtml .p " Shipped to #{order.address} " xhtml.table do xhtml.tr do xhtml.th ' Product ' xhtml.th ' Quantity ' xhtml.th ' Total Price ' end for item in order .
line_items xhtml.tr do xhtml.td item.product.title xhtml.td item.quantity xhtml.td number_to_currency item.total_price end end xhtml.tr do xhtml.th ' total ' , : colspan => 2 xhtml.th number_to_currency order.line_items.map(&:total_price ) .sum end end xhtml .p " Paid by #{order. pay_type} " end entry .
author do |author| entry.name order.name entry.email order.email end end end end
Expect to see this example in the next beta of Agile Web Development With Rails , Edition 3 .
A New Jersey man has admitted he participated in January 's high - profile cyber attack on the Church of Scientology that took its website offline and caused as much as $ 70,000 worth of damage .
Dmitriy Guzner , 18 , of Verona , New Jersey , helped carry out the crippling distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) assault because he believed it furthered the goals of the anti-Scientology group " Anonymous , " to which he claimed to belong , according to court documents filed in federal court .
He has agreed to plead guilty to a single felony charge of unauthorized impairment of a protected computer .
He agreed to pay $ 37,500 in restitution , a fee he is " jointly and severally liable " for with others who participated in the attack .
He faces a maximum of 10 years in federal prison .
A sentencing hearing has not been scheduled .
Guzner is a student who participated in , but did not organize , the attacks , said his attorney , Jeffrey Chabrowe , of The Blanch Law Firm in New York .
The attacks , which at times rendered Scientology 's website unreachable , were said to be in retaliation for its misuse of copyright and trademark law in censorship of criticism against the church .
The DDoS attacks , which take websites offline by bombarding them with more traffic than they can handle , were largely unsophisticated brute force , floods , security experts have said .
The Church of Scientology responded by moving its systems to a managed service run by security firm Prolexic .
Assistant US Attorney Wesley
Hsu declined to provide additional details about the attack except to say that Guzner was located on the east coast while participating in the attack and that the Scientology servers were located in California .
This is the second time this month that an operative claimed to be linked to Anonymous has been hauled into court for hacking crimes .
Last week , the son of a Tennessee legislator pleaded not guilty to charges he illegally broke in to the Yahoo Mail account of US vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
Screenshots from Palin 's account eventually were posted to the Wikileaks website , an act Anonymous took credit for .
Guzner was tracked down by the US Secret Service , the FBI , the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office .
The US Attorney 's Office in Los Angeles is prosecuting the case . ®
A panel set up to review Denver 's marijuana policies has recommended that police refrain from busting adults who fire up during the Democratic National Convention .
Police will have to deal with numerous security issues next week when thousands of people - ranging from protestors to delegates - descend on Denver , said Mason Tvert , leader of a group that sponsored a law mandating that marijuana be a low - enforcement priority .
" It is absolutely absurd for the police to be spending any of their time worrying about adults using a drug that is less harmful than alcohol , " he said today .
Tvert , who also sits on the Marijuana Policy Review Panel , said he would deliver the recommendation to Mayor John Hickenlooper , Police Chief Gerald Whitman and Denver City Council president Jeanne Robb .
[ Denver Post ]
Police in Denver must be so sick of Mason Tvert .
But in case they have n't noticed , he 's not gonna stop calling them out until they stop wasting valuable public safety resources on petty pot busts :
Of course , this conversation would n't even be happening if Denver police just listened to the people they serve .
The citizens of Denver voted against petty marijuana enforcement not once , but twice , first legalizing possession of up to an ounce , and then calling on police to make marijuana enforcement the lowest priority .
Is there anything confusing or ambiguous about that ?
If the community makes a statement about what type of policing they want , it is law - enforcement 's job to make it work .
Anything less renders the police department a rogue agency , abusing the very population whose tax dollars pay police salaries .
Zimbabwe , once a regional bread - basket , now relies heavily on aid About half the population of Zimbabwe could soon be in need of constant food aid and medical assistance , the UN 's humanitarian chief has told the BBC .
John Holmes said three million people were already reliant on aid , and that figure could rise to five million .
He said the situation was already grave and deteriorating .
However , he acknowledged that access for aid agencies had improved greatly since a political power - sharing deal was signed two weeks ago .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) and President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF agreed to work together after years of political and economic crises .
There is massive shortage of seeds and fertilisers
UN's John Holmes
Harare diary : Daydreaming over Lie of Zimbabwe 's land
In the grip of hunger Under the deal , Mr Mugabe remains president while MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai - who pulled out of a presidential election earlier this year , citing violence - will become prime minister .
On Monday , the president said he expected a unity government to be formed by the end of this week , but the MDC says talks have failed as Zanu - PF wants all the key ministries .
Farming worries
The hope is that a new government can overcome the acute economic crisis .
The planting season starts in five or six weeks Zimbabwe 's official inflation rate is still about 11 million per cent and there are severe food shortages .
Just ahead of the power - sharing agreement , the government lifted a ban on the distribution of food aid which had stopped aid agencies going to rural areas .
Critics had accused the ruling party of not distributing aid to opposition areas .
Mr Holmes warned that preparations needed to be made for next year 's harvest to avoid millions more people becoming reliant on aid .
" Planting season for the next harvest starts in five or six weeks ' time , at least for maize , and there is massive shortage of seeds and fertilisers in the country because of the economic situation , " he told the BBC 's World Today programme .
" We 're looking to see whether we can accelerate even at this late stage and get some of those seeds and fertilisers and other imports into the hands of small farmers . "
He said he hoped the farmers would plant more seeds " so they can harvest more , so we have less of a food assistance problem next year " .

How much money is Google making from the world 's typo-squatters ?
God only knows .
Or rather : God , Eric Schmidt , Sergey Brin , Larry Page , and a few Oompah Loompahs inside their Mountain View Chocolate Factory .
According to a recent study from McAfee and Harvard prof / cyber watchdog Ben Edelman - which relies on web data from May 2008 - at least 80,000 domains are typo- squatting on America 's 2,000 most popular web sites , just waiting for innocent web users to misspell or mistype their next url .
And 80 per cent of those typo- squatting domains are funded through Google AdSense .
For instance , the study ( PDF ) says , 742 domains sit just a few misplaced characters from freecreditreport.com , and 327 are shadowing cartoonnetwork.com .
" Cartoon Network with three Os. Cartoon Network with two Ts. Cartoon Network that starts with a k .
More ways to misspell Cartoon Network than you ever imagined , " Edelman tells The Reg .
" And almost all of them serve Google ads . "
In the US , typo - squatting is against the law .
The 1999 Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act ( ACPA ) prohibits anyone from " registering or using " domains misleadingly similar to a trademark or famous name .
Yet Google is making money from typo - squatters - most likely a great deal of money .
The trouble - as usual - is that there 's no window into Google 's black box of an ad platform .
At least not yet .
Edelman is among the team of lawyers that filed a class action suit against Google in June 2007 , accusing the ad broker of violating the ACPA , and he 's confident that as part of the suit 's discovery process , Google will have no choice but to reveal how much it 's pulling in from typo -squatters .
In October 2007 , Dell brought suit against 16 so - called domain parkers , claiming they were squatting on its trademarks , and a court freeze order indicated those 16 outfits were raking in as much $ 2 m a month from Google ads - after Google took its cut .
Under the freeze , Google was ordered to shuttle a portion of the defendants ' ad revenue into an account for safe keeping .
Each month , the order said , the first million should go into the frozen account and the second million should go to the defendants .
If revenues top $ 2 m , the order said , half of what 's left should be frozen too .
But that 's just 16 companies .
And who knows how high those revenues really went .
PARIS ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s top handset maker Nokia Oyj expects the role of the Linux operating system in its product portfolio to increase as the role of its Internet - focused devices grows , company officials said .
The Nokia Research and Development Centre is seen in Helsinki April 11 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Bob Strong
Linux has so far had little success on cellphones , but its role is increasing as more new Linux - based models reach the market , while Google Inc gave it a vote of confidence by using it to build its Android platform on .
Nokia itself has used Linux for years in its Internet tablets , large phone - like devices used to access Internet on the go , but lacking calling functionality .
“ We will expand that range , and we believe that the role of Linux will grow , ” said Nokia spokesman Kari Tuutti .
Linux is the most popular type of open source operating system which is available to the public to be used , revised and shared -- meaning it has a large developer community which could result in more attractive programs and lower costs for the likes of Nokia .
Nokia has used the tablets to target technology - savvy consumers or support emerging technologies like WiMAX .
“ It ’s going to be terribly important , ” Nokia ’s Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson told an investor conference when asked about the role of Linux - based tablets .
He said the company has been developing the next generation of Linux - based products , which are starting to come to the market .
The market for software platforms on cellphones is led by Nokia ’s S60 , built on the Symbian operating system , well ahead of Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile .
However , many mobile industry heavyweights , including Vodafone , Motorola , NTT DoCoMo , Samsung Electronics , Huawei and LG Electronics , have joined Linux alliances .
Linux suppliers earn money selling improvements and technical services and Linux competes directly with offerings from Microsoft , which charges for its Windows software and opposes freely sharing its code .
Stationary bike designed to create electricity Workouts on specially designed stationary bike generate electricity

Like a number of highly motivated people , David Butcher starts every day with a workout .
His poison : 45 minutes on a stationary bicycle .
Fitness is part of the incentive , but Butcher 's primary motivation is a long - standing , and possibly obsessive , quest to generate his own electricity .
So Butcher 's stationary bike , which is wedged in a corner of his detached garage , is not your standard - issue exercise machine :
It 's a homemade power plant .
Butcher designed his ingeniously simple pedal generator for maximum comfort and efficiency :
As the rider pedals , a wooden flywheel drives an electric motor , which generates an electric current that flows into a bank of salvaged lead - acid batteries for storage .
A buried cable connects the batteries to a set of conspicuous orange outlets ( denoting the off - the - grid energy source ) in Butcher 's home office , where he works as a Web design consultant .
The orange outlets power several devices , including a computer monitor ( but not the computer ) , cell phone chargers , a high - efficiency area light and a small Roomba robotic vacuum .
Last year , Butcher 's electricity bill was zero .
In fact , he pumped $ 150 worth of electricity back into the grid .
But here 's the catch :
It was n't the pedaling that did it .
Although Butcher 's daily workouts produce 1.8 kilowatt - hours a month , that translates into just 18 cents worth of electricity at today 's rates - about 1 percent of his average monthly usage .
Instead , Butcher 's energy - efficient house contributed 1,500 kilowatt - hours into the grid after a recent retrofit added photovoltaic panels to the roof .
His cedar - shingled bungalow on a quiet , tree - lined street in San Jose also makes use of skylights and other energy - saving devices , and it now produces far more electricity than it consumes .
" It 's not a monetary payoff , " Butcher says of his pedal project .
" And if you want your pedal power to do anything meaningful , you have to run efficient devices . "
Hence , Butcher 's home is tricked out with both high - tech and low - tech energy savers :
-- Large windows in the rear of the house provide passive solar heating .
-- Devices called X10 modules kill electrical " vampires , " such as microwave oven clocks and other " always - on " electronics .
Remotely controlled by Butcher 's computer , X10 modules ( each outlet has one ) turn appliances on and off according to when they 're needed .
For example , since Butcher does n't run his dishwasher during the day , the computer does n't turn on the dishwasher outlet until nighttime .
-- Suntubes ( tubular skylights ) illuminate the interior of the house during the day .
-- LEDs ( light - emitting diodes ) in lamps use even fewer watts than CFLs ( compact fluorescent lamps ) .
Oil spill sparked interest
Butcher , who lives alone after a divorce , traces his environmental leanings to the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill , which marred miles of coastline with 200,000 gallons of crude oil .
Butcher was 14 at the time and witnessed it firsthand .
He built his first pedal generator when he was in his early 20s .
" I was always interested in alternative energy and solar in particular , " he says .
" I was living in Portland , Ore. , where solar is not as much of an option .
So I thought , ' What else could I do ? '
" I 'd been on a swim team for years and I was in pretty good shape , and I thought there must be a way to get some power going . "
Butcher 's prototype bicycle was chain - driven and featured a welded steel frame .
Today 's version , with its simplified drivetrain and bolted frame , can be assembled with basic hand tools .
When he took up his pedaling regimen two years ago , Butcher tipped the scales at 180 pounds .
Today , at age 53 , he weighs a lean 150 and possesses a pair of legs that would n't look out of place on the Olympic cycling squad .
Butcher 's pedaling has become so efficient that he has pretty much abandoned his car ( electric , incidentally ) in favor of bicycling , reducing his carbon footprint still further .
Whenever people ask why he does n't sell the pedal generator plans to gyms , Butcher 's answer reflects his simple philosophy : " If you want to save energy , do n't drive to the gym . "
The combination of these positive impacts inspired Butcher to market the plans for his invention , and to date he 's sold more than 300 sets of blueprints around the world .
Butcher built a second bicycle generator for demonstration purposes , with energy fairs - and , apparently , journalists - in mind .
While his everyday pedal generator is set up to charge batteries , the exhibition model is tricked out with extras ( an ultracapacitor , a digital meter and an inverter ) to supply power to various devices directly .
This way , riders can get a sense of how much physical effort it takes to power , say , a lightbulb versus a television set versus a coffeepot .
Although the two generators are similar in design , the exhibition model sports a sleek Plexiglas flywheel and dual electric motors .
Wires connect the motors ( inexpensive units used in electric scooters ) to an ultracapacitor , which modulates the electrical current .
A digital meter displays the energy statistics of each workout .
An inverter changes the current from DC to AC , relaying it to several electrical outlets .
Butcher designed the generator for maximum efficiency , which is key , because , as I was about to learn , generating electricity is a lot of work .
A cup of java
With Butcher 's blessing , I hop on and start pedaling .
I 've been pedaling up San Francisco hills for 15 years , so how hard can this be ?
Butcher instructs me to keep the output steady at 12 volts .
I 'm cruising at an easy clip when he switches on a compact fluorescent lamp .
As the bulb winks on , the numbers fluctuate slightly on the meter readout , indicating an energy draw , but because the CFL is so efficient , it does n't add any perceptible drag to the flywheel .
I realize there 's something fundamentally gratifying about making your own electricity .
You spin a wheel , a light goes on : It 's magic .
The fact that it 's good for the environment is an added bonus .
After powering the CFL for several minutes I 'm ready to up the ante .
" Want to try to make some coffee ? "
Butcher asks mischievously .
He retrieves a pint - sized drip machine from the garage .
As I charge up the ultracapacitor , Butcher fills the coffeemaker reservoir with water and throws the switch .
I rev up the flywheel , preparing to blow the coffeepot away .
" Do n't overreact , " he warns .
" Just gradually ramp up as it starts asking for more power . "
The voltage dips ominously on the readout .
" Now , you wo n't really feel the draw until you try to start preventing that from dropping . "
The voltage slips : 11 ... 10 ... 9 .
" Do n't let that drop anymore , " he cautions .
The coffeemaker needs a constant 12 - volt supply to do its thing .
I pedal my way back to 12 volts and valiantly try to maintain it , but as the coffeepot 's electrical appetite adds resistance to the flywheel , my leisurely ride begins to feel like an uphill sprint .
" Hold it steady , " he says .
Two minutes in , my legs are on fire .
" How 's the coffee coming ? " I gasp .
" Well , unfortunately , you 've got to heat a substantial amount of water before the first drop comes out , " he says .
At three minutes , I call it quits , wheezing like a mule with a punctured lung .
" No coffee for you , " Butcher says sympathetically .
As I catch my breath , Butcher explains that heating water takes a tremendous amount of energy , and that without abundant , cheap electricity , we could all kiss our lattes goodbye .
Butcher already has .
He brews his coffee cold , in a French press .
" It really brings it home to actually feel how hard you have to pedal to make something go , " Butcher says , " and that 's something that people will occasionally ask me on the Web site : ' So do you actually have to pedal harder when you 're pedaling bigger things like TVs ? ' "
( I can testify that , yes , one does . )
" And it shows that the concept of work , that electricity is doing work as opposed to just being off or on , is not familiar to people . "

Along with the Germans and others , Russian leaders contend that poorly regulated American markets caused the current crisis .
While it is hardly a new sentiment , in Russia there is a gloating quality , as the American crisis deepens .
There has been a drumbeat of pronouncements in recent days on this theme .
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin made a speech about what he called American financial “ irresponsibility ” on Wednesday , blaming non-Russian causes for Russia ’s stock plunge of more than 50 percent .
Of the financial crisis , he said , “ This is not the irresponsibility of some people but the irresponsibility of the system , which as it is known , claimed to be the leader . ”
In contrast to the Europeans who have also criticized lax American regulation , however , Russians are facing a financial system that has been in such chaos that regulators suspended trading on the stock market three times last month .
The global credit crisis could trim about 1 percent from Russian growth next year , said the finance minister , Aleksei L. Kudrin .
As in other emerging markets , investors are pulling money out of Russia and depositing it in United States Treasury securities because they are considered the safest place to park money .
By the time Mr. Medvedev spoke on Thursday , investors had pulled about $ 52 billion in net private capital out of Russia since the second week of August , when the war in Georgia and political tension with the West heightened concern about political risk here .
The criticism of American finance coincided with a rise in Russian military bluster that has been viewed by some in the West as a resurgence of the Kremlin ’s cold - war mentality .
On Thursday , Russian generals announced plans for the largest air force exercise since the collapse of the Soviet Union , called Stability 2008 , to be held next week .
Also on Thursday , the deputy commander of Russia ’s navy said the country would build eight new nuclear submarines before 2015 .

By using at least one private email account for state business , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has virtually guaranteed that most of the emails she sent as governor –which are subject to the state ’s Open Records Act–will not be publicly released before Election Day .
After Senator John McCain , the GOP presidential nominee , picked Palin to be his running mate , a number of news organizations , including Mother Jones filed Open Records
Act requests for copies of emails Palin had received or sent .
( For a comprehensive list of all the requests received by Palin ’s office , see here . )
On September 22 , in response to the Mother Jones request , Palin ’s office replied that it would cost $ 2,249.46 to conduct a search of her official email account .
This did not include copying fees .
The fee was later reduced to $ 590.06 .
But money was not the issue .
Palin has used at least two private email accounts in addition to her state account .
That posed a serious challenge to the record - keepers in her office : how to find the emails to and from these accounts .
The information managers had easy access to the emails she generated and received with her official account .
But they did not have access to a Yahoo account she used for official communications and another private account she might have used for state business .
In a September 25 email to Mother Jones , Linda Perez , the administrative director of the office of the governor , noted :
We are unable to access records from the non-state email accounts as we are not the account owner or customer of the providers .
My access to copies of emails sent from ( or received by ) private accounts would be through the state email accounts that sent or received emails to or from the private accounts .
To retrieve those email messages , we could expand our email search to include other state employees ’ email accounts and run a sub- search on those email accounts ’ incoming and outgoing emails to identify those that include particular words , i.e. , particular private email addresses or individual names or subjects .
Perez noted there would be an additional charge of $ 960.31 for each state email account searched .
And , she said , there were 68 email accounts within the executive offices of the governor .
That meant Mother Jones would be charged $ 65,000 for a search seeking emails between Palin ’s private accounts and the official email accounts of officials and employees within the governor ’s office .
In other words , Palin had essentially placed her emails beyond public scrutiny for anyone unable or unwilling to pay a large sum .
In response , Mother Jones replied , “ This search is necessary only because the Governor decided to conduct state business on a private email account . ”
It asked that these onerous search fees be waived in the public interest , as the Open Records Act allows .
Ten days later , Perez informed Mother Jones that the governor ’s office was returning its initial check for $ 5690.06 and that there would be no fees at all for any of the searches regarding Palin ’s various accounts .
It was not “ appropriate , ” she said , to charge requesters for locating Palin ’s official emails :
“ It is our responsibility to get these collected in one location . ”
And she said that her office had worked out a two - step plan for responding to the requests for Palin ’s emails .
First , the governor ’s IT team would search state accounts for emails sent to or from ( or CC ’ed to ) Palin ’s private accounts , and these records , once found , would be lumped together with the easy - to - retrieve emails sent to and from Palin ’s state account .
Next , all of these emails would be printed out and sent to the state ’s Department of Law , which would review each one and decide if any should be withheld .
After that , the non-withheld emails would be released –with requesters being charged copying fees .
( Palin ’s office says the rate will be 29 cents a page . )
How long might this take ?
Perez said the computer experts in the governor ’s office figure that they need about two weeks –starting this week –to conduct the search to find Palin ’s private account emails .
And how much time will the subsequent legal review require ?
“ I ca n’t even begin to estimate , ” Perez said , with a sigh .
The math , though , is obvious .
The search will likely produce thousands of emails .
A review could easily–and justifiably –take two weeks or more .
That would mean no release of any of Palin ’s emails until after all the votes are cast in the presidential election .
( Palin ’s office presumably could begin a review of the emails to and from her official account right away and possibly finish that before the election . )
And this process will not capture any emails relating to official business that may have zipped between Palin ’s private accounts and the private accounts of other state officials .
“ We do n’t have access to the stuff , ” Perez noted .
She said that it may be possible to retrieve emails from a private vendor–such as Yahoo–but that she did not know what might be available and under what conditions such emails could be requested .
The bottom line is that Palin appears to have benefited from her decision to conduct state business using private channels .
As governor , she has touted the need for accountability and transparency ( even though she has withheld about 1100 emails involving her aides , citing dubious justifications ) .
But because Palin used one or more non-state email accounts for official communications –perhaps improperly –she has created a costly mess for her administration ’s information officers and a situation in which emails from all her accounts will likely not become public before November 4 .
If her emails contain any information that might not reflect well upon Palin , the McCain - Palin campaign need not worry .
Palin , wittingly or not , has engineered a delay that is the functional equivalent of a cover-up .
" Christianity reaches more people than healthcare , " Stephen Waititi , a former church deacon and the medical director of Milmay Centre , an HIV / Aids clinic in Kampala , pointed out recently .
What the churches say matters : not just because of their reach , but because of their authority .
The message from the pulpit shapes the climate .
The role of the church in the HIV / Aids epidemic is central .
From the first recognition of the threat posed , above all , to the poor of the developing world , the churches have been at the forefront of the effort to provide care for the sick and to educate the healthy .
The exception was the Christian evangelical movement , which by 2000 claimed not just the Ugandan president and his wife , Yoweri and Janet Museveni , but George W Bush , the president of the United States .
Jerry Falwell , then the leading US televangelist , called Aids " God 's judgment on promiscuity " , while senator Jesse Helms , a powerful Congressional ally of the evangelicals , argued against Aids funding for homosexuals because of their " deliberate , disgusting , revolting acts " .
But , as Helen Epstein charts in her brilliant article in the New York Review of Books , the evangelical right soon saw that however morally reprehensible , HIV / Aids opened new avenues .
" It is true , " wrote Ken Isaacs , of Samaritan 's Purse , an evangelical charity run by Billy Graham 's son , Franklin , " that when we choose to act outside of God 's mandate for sexual purity , we should be prepared to deal with the consequences .
" However , " he went on , " God calls Christians to tell others of the redeeming love of Christ and the eternal life they can have through him . "
And , with so many people on the verge of death , " AIDS has created an evangelism opportunity for the body of Christ unlike any in history . "
The evangelical approach is now threatening Uganda 's astonishing success in reining in HIV transmission .
From the mid 1980s and the late 1990s , the number infected fell from an average of 17 % of the population ( and 30 % in some urban areas ) to little more than 6 % .
Academics , examining the phenomenon , pointed to the swift appreciation of Museveni of the challenge the country faced , the open and frank nature with which the epidemic was discussed and the extensive public education programme that was conducted in a non-judgmental tone in a wide range of mediums .
But perhaps most important to the sense of urgency was the extent of the pandemic .
HIV and Aids was affecting the whole country .
Everyone knew someone , often in their own family , who was living with HIV or who had died from Aids .
There was no room for doubt that something had to be done .
By the end of the 1990s , Uganda was being held up as a shining example of what could be achieved .
At about the same time , the evangelical wing of the Christian churches started to make rapid inroads among the faithful and the lapsed of Uganda 's towns and villages .
By some accounts , as many as half of Uganda 's Christians are now " born again " .
Of all the messages about halting the spread of HIV and Aids , one particularly appealed to the evangelicals .
" As simple as ABC " , declared the billboards , and Abstain , Be faithful and Condom use - simple and memorable - came to be singled out as the key to Uganda 's unequalled success .
A message that changing personal behaviour in line with the church 's teaching brought salvation in this world was elevated and refined until , for young people , it became encapsulated in a single imprecation : Abstain .
The person most identified with the message in Uganda is the president 's wife , Janet .
In 2003 she took the " True Love Waits " message to Washington in support of Bush 's bid to Congress for $ 15bn of Aids funding .
Although the great bulk of the funding was for the provision of antiretrovirals , $ 1bn was to support programmes promoting the message of abstinence - a message Bush was also encouraging to combat teen pregnancy in US schools .
" Religious organisations played a major role in prevention [ of HIV / Aids ] and had a strong influence , " Janet Museveni told a Baptist conference in Washington DC .
" When we adopted the True Love Waits slogan , we found that the most important thing was focusing on our spiritual foundation and values . "
At the international Aids conference in Bangkok in 2004 the message was repeated by the Ugandan president , despite widespread criticism of the apparent downgrading of the importance of condom use , particularly in a country like Uganda that is in effect polygamous , and where women might abstain or be faithful , but with no confidence that their husbands will have done either .
By 2006 , the evangelical focus on abstinence was being challenged by other Christian churches , which recognised that the inequality of women made negotiating either abstinence or safe sex impractical .
Supported by the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with Aids , a wider approach was devised , which included the core message of abstinence and fidelity , but in a non-hierarchical context .
HIV is a disease , they argued , not a moral issue .
SAVE ( acronyms seem indispensable ) stands for Safer sex , Available medication , Voluntary counselling and testing , and Empowerment and negotiation .
In 2006 , to strong criticism from the evangelicals , it was adopted by the charity Christian Aid .
Beatrice Ware , a prominent Ugandan HIV campaigner , who has been infected with HIV by her husband , says : " ABC stigmatises HIV positive women .
It allows people to conclude that we are either promiscuous or unfaithful . "
Winnie Sseruma , a Ugandan who works for Christian Aid , says it also leaves children born with HIV in despair .
" How did I get it , they ask ?
They wonder what they did wrong . "
But evangelicals , like those in Anglican Mainstream group , accuse Christian Aid of succumbing to political correctness .
Not for the first time , the Christian churches find themselves torn between a compassionate approach and a strictly moral one .
Sseruma believes it is not only the abstinence message promoted by evangelical Christians that is behind the halt in the fall of HIV transmission in Uganda .
" The evangelical churches distort the message around healing , " she says .
" People take it to mean that prayer alone can heal , but it should be made clear that God can't do it alone .
People must keep taking their medication . "
Most intractable is the fate of homosexual Africans , condemned by society in general and evangelicals in particular , unable to seek treatment and often compelled by peer pressure into marriage , ensuring the cycle of transmission is renewed .
Sseruma fears that , encouraged by the evangelical churches , society is becoming less and less tolerant of those living with HIV .
Individuals convicted of infecting someone can now be imprisoned .
Soldiers are denied promotion .
The open , non-judgmental approach to HIV education and treatment that saw such success in the 1990s is being progressively undermined in a politico - religious movement that is financially endorsed by Bush 's Republicans .
In the past few weeks an odd trend has come across my radar : I 've seen a number of hardcore Mac geeks experiment with the classic editors , and I 've seen others who wonder why people would give up the comfort of a " modern program " for them .
I hesitate to write on the topic because posts that do so often up as flame - bait , but it actually sounds like some folks are genuinely curious and want to learn rather than just repeat the same holy wars of the past , so I will try to stay in the same frame of mind .
One of the complaints you see leveled over and over is that Emacs on OS X does n't feel " Mac - like " .
This is asserted as if it's a tragic shortcoming of Emacs , and the person stating it never specifies what advantages would arise if it were " fixed " ; it 's assumed to be obvious .
This usually comes across as cultural elitism , but I do n't think that 's the intent , any more than Ray Smuckles intends to offend the Russian people when he observes that the Cyrillic alphabet " looks like they commissioned a smartass to make fun of our letters , " — he 's just being Ray .
That is to say , there are some deeply - held assumptions at work here that are never questioned .
It 's pretty easy to explain why a buffer list is more effective than a tabbed interface , ( an explanation is given below ) but I 've never heard the reasoning why supposedly a modal file open dialog box is better for text files than reading a location unobtrusively from the minibuffer .
It 's always just set forth as something the user will grudgingly put up with , even though it has many advantages over what they 're used to .
I agree that there are some advantages to a standardized set of conventions for user interfaces that apply across a whole operating system .
Lowering the number of context switches involved in day - to - day usage is a definite win .
But the problem with standards like these is that they can turn restrictive .
If something comes along that is objectively better and the standard does n't allow for it , the standard is acting as a hindrance .
Conventions Compared
The most obvious example is to compare the modern convention of multi-document tab - switching to the buffer - switching mechanisms you see in Emacs .
Once you start opening a significant number of tabs , the number of documents you can open and see at the same time is limited by the width of your screen .
For Firefox on this machine , the number is twelve [ 1 ] when it 's running full - screen .
Even if you can see every document , the title of each will need to be sharply truncated to fit on the small visible tab , making it harder to identify a tab without switching to it .
To find the tab you want , you need to just press control - pageup over and over again .
When the ido buffer switcher that comes with Emacs is invoked , it shows a limited number of targets to switch to , just like the tab system .
So far the only difference is that the buffers are in order of when they were used last , so it 's much more likely that the one you want is at the front of the list .
But the big win is that you can just start typing a few letters , and the list will narrow down to only the options that match what you 've typed .
So once you invoke the buffer switcher it rarely takes more than five keystrokes to find what you want even when you have a large list of open buffers , whereas with tabs you 'd have to search linearly for your target .
With predictable frequency we get folks dropping by the #emacs freenode channel asking things like " can I get a tabbed interface in Emacs ? " , and the answer is always " of course you can , but you do n't want to ; try this instead " .
This probably comes off as cultural elitism too when the enquirer insists that he really does want a tab bar , but I think the motivation is more " we do n't want to spend the time explaining in painstaking detail the advantages of this way to someone who does n't want to listen " than " we do n't need the likes of you around here " .
The other big under - appreciated advantage is the capability to redefine or add functionality on the fly .
I 'm fairly sure this can't really be understood until you try it [ 2 ] , but the thought of going back to apps that do n't allow self - modification is usually met with a grimace .
In Action
Take the example of the version control interface .
It 's got a bit of historic baggage , being designed around a single - file - at - a - time mindset encouraged by the version control systems of yore .
It 's recently been rewritten to work better with multiple files at a time , but since it provides a uniform interface over all the different backends it supports , I noticed a problem with working with git repositories .
When you add a file to the repository , it checks to make sure it has n't been registered yet .
This is pretty reasonable with most VCSes , but with git re-registering a file is a common operation when you want to add a single change to the staging area .
If you did n't have the ability to modify functionality on the fly , you 'd probably just bite the context - switching bullet and drop into the shell for this ( or worse , just quit using git 's ability to build up a patch chunk by chunk and just commit with the " - a " option ) since it does n't seem like it 's worth fixing .
But it 's really trivial to fix in Emacs :
( defun my - vc - add - or - register () " Register the file if it has n't been registered , otherwise git add it . " ( interactive ) ( if ( eq ' Git ( vc- backend buffer - file - name ) ) ( vc - git - register buffer - file - name ) ( vc-register ) ) ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C- x v i " ) ' my - vc - add - or - register )
This took less than two minutes to write , and I was actually able to use the functionality I just wrote to add the change to my dotfiles repository instantly [ 3 ] , bootstrapping - style .
If you have to use some tacked - on " plugin mechanism " to customize it , then you ’re going to be limited at the very least by the imagination of the author of the plugin mechanism ; only the things he thought you would want to do with it are doable .
But if you ’re using the exact same tools as the original authors were using to write the program in the first place , you can bet they put all their effort into making that a seamless , powerful experience , and you 'll be able to access things on an entirely new level .
However
I do n't want to say that there are n't any problems with the system I use .
The default key bindings are more an accident of history without much advantage from the more standard conventions .
The M-x customize interface is frankly pretty embarrassing and comes across as an attempt to shield users from the act of writing and reading code , but this is easy to avoid .
The lack of concurrency is a very real problem , though not one that 's going unnoticed by the developers .
[ 4 ]
The rendering engine is very text - centric ; it 's hard to get it display other things .
But these are problems that people are working together to address , and it 's remarkable how approachable some of them are to someone who knows a little elisp .
And the capability to examine and change running code on the fly makes them much easier to deal with .

The Pentagon wants to be able to peer inside your apartment building – picking out where all the major rooms , stairways , and dens of evil - doers are .
The U.S. military is getting better and better at spotting its enemies , when they 're roaming around the streets .
But once those foes duck into houses , they become a whole lot harder to spot .
That 's why Darpa , the Defense Department 's way - out research arm , is looking to develop a suite of tools for " external sensing deep inside buildings . "
The ultimate goal of this Harnessing Infrastructure for Building Reconnaissance ( HIBR ) project : " reverse the adversaries ' advantage of urban familiarity and sanctuary and provide U.S. Forces with complete above - and below - ground awareness . "
By the end of the project , Darpa wants a set of technologies that can see into a 10 - story building with a two - level basement in a " high - density urban block " – and produce a kind of digital blueprint of the place .
Using sensors mounted on backpacks , vehicles , or aircraft , the HIBR gear would , hopefully , be able to pick out every room , wall , stairway , and basement in the building – as well as all of the " electrical , plumbing , and installation systems . "
Darpa does n't come out and say it openly .
But it appears that the agency wants these HIBR gadgets to be able to track the people inside these buildings , as well .
Why else would these sensors be required to " provide real - time updates " once U.S. troops enter the building ?
Perhaps there 's more about the people - spotting tech , in the " classified appendix " to HIBR 's request for proposals .
There are already a number of efforts underway , both military and civilian , to try to see inside buildings .
The Army has a couple of hand - held gadgets that can spot people * just * on the other side of a wall .
Some scientists claim that can even catch human breathing and heartbeats beyond a barrier .
Darpa 's Visibuilding program uses a kind of radar to scan structures .
The problem is n't sending the radio frequency ( RF ) energy in .
It 's " making sense of the data produced from all the reflected signals " that come back , Henry Kenyon wrote in a recent * Signal * magazine article .
Besides processing data from the inside a structure , the system also must filter a large amount of RF
propagation in the form of randomly reflected signals .
Although radar technologies exist that can track people in adjacent rooms , it is much more difficult to map an entire building .
“ Going through one wall is not that bad , but a building is basically an RF hall of mirrors .
You ’ve got signals bouncing all over the place , ” Darpa program manager Dr. Edward J. Baranoski says .
Field trials are supposed to get underway this fall .
Bike camping is n't as hard as it looks / Bay Area mass transit gives bicyclists a leg up on reaching destinations
Recommended Video :
Surely , you 've marveled at them .
While driving along the coast highway , or on some Sierra byway , suddenly you spot a few bicycles ahead draped with packed bags , the riders jouncing off their seats to invest body weight on a pedal push as they crank their way slowly uphill .
As your car whisks by , you twist up the stereo , or the air conditioner , then glance at your companions and say ( or think ) , " Whew !
I could never do that . "
That type of sighting highlights the steep slope any prospective bicycle camper must face : Mount Perception .
" In truth , it 's far less difficult than it looks , " said June Dershewitz , 34 , a freelance database analyst who 's one of San Francisco 's dedicated bicycle campers .
" The hardest thing is just getting out the door with everything on your bike .
Once under way , you barely notice the load .
It becomes an incredibly freeing experience , since you 've got all you need to be out on your own . "
" I remember the first time I tried bike camping , " Anna Sojourner said .
Sojourner , 38 , is an engineering geologist from the Mission District .
" I was supposed to go to Angel Island with friends .
I had my panniers ( saddle bags ) filled up with bike gear and food for three people for two days .
I thought I 'd never make it .
" Well , I rolled down Shotwell Street for a block and a half .
Suddenly I busted out laughing , " Sojourner said .
" Not only was it easy to ride , I found a loaded bike is more stable , not less .
By the time I pedaled through Golden Gate Park , I knew I 'd never go camping using a car again .
" With a car , you do n't really feel like you 're camping until you finally reach a site and unload .
But on a bike , in minutes , you already enjoy fresh air , and seeing animals and trees , and all the stuff you want to go camping for . "
If you have n't observed or sampled the pleasures of bike touring , you can acquire a notion of what 's involved -- and the sort of discoveries enabled along the way -- by checking the current stories of The Chronicle 's rolling columnist , Steve Rubenstein , in the paper or at SFGate.com ( www.sfgate.com/podcasts/bigride/).

Bike camping is n't as hard as it looks / Bay Area mass transit gives bicyclists a leg up on reaching destinations 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Sojourner has not only bike - camped more than 100 times in the decade since her revelation on Shotwell Street , she wrote a tutorial about Bay Area bike - camp techniques for the Tube Times , the newsletter of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition .
A key point she made is that the bay 's bike - friendly mass - transit options give any pedal - powered camper a leg up on reaching far - flung destinations .
There are ferries to Angel Island , of course , but also to Vallejo , Sausalito and Larkspur .
BART trains can deposit riders in Fremont ( access to Mount Hamilton ) , Pleasanton ( Del Valle Regional Park ) , Pittsburg ( the delta ) or Millbrae ( the Peninsula ) .
Add in buses , such as Golden Gate Transit , with its exterior bike racks on many vehicles , and communities such as Santa Rosa come easily into range .
Consider Amtrak trains to stations such as Truckee ( access to Lake Tahoe region ) and Modesto ( Yosemite ) , and you can see that your prospects are limited only by imagination .
Many campgrounds have hike - in or bike - in sites that can be used without a reservation and cost considerably less than sites designated for vehicle camping .
You will need gear and camping accessories .
But in this respect , you 're especially in luck , because backpacking equipment in recent years rapidly has become ever lighter , more packable and inexpensive .
A visit to a local outdoors shop will reveal stoves that fold smaller than a deck of cards , good sleeping bags that wad up to the size of a loaf of bread and tents that weigh four pounds or less and sleep two comfortably .
Acquiring stuff you need does not necessarily mean melting a credit card .
There are creative ways around every problem -- and concocting solutions is one pleasure of the endeavor .
Laura Lent , 51 , the collections development manager for the San Francisco Public Library , is also a longtime bike camper .
She said , " People who are into speed often feel like they must have fancy equipment .
But our group is far more casual .
One guy attaches plastic construction buckets instead of rear panniers on his bike .
They 're waterproof , then when he gets to camp , he has something nice to sit on .
" I like a tent , but one person just rolls himself up in a tarp when it 's damp .
Calls it his burrito . "
By talking with bike campers when you encounter them , tricks of the traipse can be harvested .
For example , Lent swears by two bibles : the Krebs bike - route maps for Northern California ( www.krebscycleproducts.com), and the " California Camping " encyclopedia by Chronicle outdoor columnist Tom Stienstra ( www.tomstienstra.com).
One Sojourner tip is to bring silk long johns , because they pack small , dry quickly and easily add a welcome layer of warmth .
Another is to plan a last stop at a country store just before camp .
There she scores fresh vegetables , heavier food items and her favorite sports - recovery drink : beer .
Dershewitz says any old beater bike can be utilized for an initial launch into camping ; should it lack eyelets for bolting on gear racks , simply stick some hose clamps on the frame .
The Bay Area boasts another resource for those drawn to top - flight bike touring and camping : Rivendell Bicycle Works in Walnut Creek ( www.rivendellbicycles.com).
Using four bays in a corrugated steel building , Rivendell makes ( among other models ) the Atlantis , a long wheelbase , steel - framed wonder that totes loads elegantly down road or trail .
Dershewitz and Sojourner are both Atlantis pedalers .
" Wear wool , sit on leather , ride lugged steel , " reads a cryptic sticker on the Rivendell shop door .
It summarizes the philosophy of founder Grant Petersen , 52 , who persists in making slim but stout frames brazed together with lugs ( metal sleeves ) in a cycling world now mired in a love - fest with welded aluminum alloy and moulded carbon - fiber frames , as well as a swelling tide of titanium widgets .
" People might call me a Luddite , or hopelessly retro , " Petersen said .
" I 'm not doing this to be old - fashioned , but because the stuff is proven as a better value .
" Leather saddles simply feel more comfortable for long rides .
Our merino wool jerseys outperform synthetics in just about every area you can think of .
And lugged steel is extremely strong , reliable and shock - absorbing .
" Most people nowadays think cycling 's got to be some Tour de France scene .
Go ultra - light , dress in tight Spandex , carry a Camelback full of sports pop drink and sports candy bars , " Petersen continued .
" Well , I 've got nothing but respect for Lance ... but I do n't necessarily think that relentless focus on going fast on pavement fosters a lifelong love of bicycling . "
Alternatively , Petersen presents a Rivendell gear line that blends his whimsy with hard - nosed practicality -- bikes with numerous eyelets ( bolt mounts ) for adding racks ; packs of tough canvas and wool to attach to the racks ; and comfy clothes of cotton and wool to stuff in the packs .
One standout is a seersucker shirt .
It looks like a dress garment , but functions as a breathable , cooling sun and wind shell that 's made of cotton fabric stout enough to provide some protection in event of a fall .
Besides his goods , Petersen offers a few tips to potential bicycle campers .
One is to toast bread before making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for a snack ; that keeps it from getting soggy .
Another is to bring a bag of frozen vegetables ; they 'll keep themselves fresh while they thaw in time for dinner .
His best tip is to begin camping with a run that he calls an " S - 24 - O " -- a sub - 24 - hour outing .
Such an overnight need n't be a huge production , it 's easy to recover from errors in packing or navigation , and it's a manageable re-initiation into a magical activity many adults might remember only dimly from youth : exploring this wide , wild world on your very own bike .

What would Tom say ?
Katie Holmes ' gets surprise visit from first love Joshua Jackson '
As Dawson 's Creek couple Joey and Pacey they were inseparable , with an onscreen love that spilled over into real life .
But while Katie Holmes now lives an A list lifestyle with superstar husband Tom Cruise in Los Angeles her first love Joshua Jackson has a quieter time with his actress girlfriend Diane Kruger in New York .
The two had lost touch , until Jackson popped in to see the actress with a big bunch of flowers , as she rehearsed for her Broadway debut All My Sons this week .
Katie Holmes received a surprise visit from ex-flame Joshua Jackson this week
According to reports in Grazia magazine he had become concerned after seeing recent photographs of the working mother looking gaunt and tired , with black circles under her eyes .
' Katie has been looking skinny and depressed and , like any concerned friend , rather than do nothing Joshua wanted to check everything was OK , ' the source told the magazine .
' They have n't spoken in a while and , naturally , he was worried .
' So he just decided to drop by .
It was really sweet , he just turned up unexpectedly with a bunch of flowers and said : ' Hello stranger . '
Katie was shocked , but so happy to see him .
It was a wonderful surprise .
She gave him such a big hug . '
Breakthrough role : Katie Holmes as Joey and Joshua Jackson as Pacey
The source added that Jackson wanted to reassure the 29 - year - old that she still had friends of her own age and outside of Scientology , the religion that she joined after falling in love with Cruise .
The source continued : ' Joshua made it clear she was n't alone .
He 's not out to cause trouble .
Her life is truly bizarre now , but having some friends supporting her who have nothing to do with her LA set - up could make all the difference .
' Josh would love to see Katie as the carefree and relaxed woman he once knew . '
Because of her acting commitments Katie and daughter Suri have been living in New York while Tom has continued to live in Los Angeles .
The family have made a huge effort to keep in close contact , frequently flying across country to spend time together .
Katie dated Jackson for just over a year before splitting in 1998 .
She later told Rolling Stone magazine : ' I fell in love , I had my first love , and it was something so incredible and indescribable that I will treasure it always . '
But the two had barely been in touch since they worked on the show five years ago .
In an interview with USweekly .com Jackson recently confessed it was hard keeping in touch with his old friends .
He said : ' I mean I talk to Michelle Williams every once in a while .
I talk to Busy Philipps every once in a while .'
Then , when quizzed over whether he was going to see Katie on stage , Jackson , who is currently appearing in Lost creator JJ Abram 's new project Fringe , said : ' Of course , of course . '
Now it appears the two could start seeing more of each other .
Jackson has apparently extended a dinner invitation to Katie and her 46 - year - old husband .
Sept. 12 , 2008  --
Substances harvested from cannabis plants could soon outshine conventional antibiotics in the escalating battle against drug - resistant bacteria .
The compounds , called cannabinoids , appear to be unaffected by the mechanism that superbugs like MRSA use to evade existing antibiotics .
Scientists from Italy and the United Kingdom , who published their research in the Journal of Natural Products last month , say that cannabis - based creams could also be developed to treat persistent skin infections .
Cannabis has long been known to have antibacterial properties and was studied in the 1950s as a treatment for tuberculosis and other diseases .
But research into using cannabis as an antibiotic has been limited by poor knowledge of the plant 's active ingredients and by the controversy surrounding its use as a recreational drug .
Now Giovanni Appendino of the Piemonte Orientale University , in Italy , and Simon Gibbons of the School of Pharmacy at the University of London , U.K. , have revisited the antibiotic power of marijuana by systematically testing different cannabinoids ' ability to kill MRSA .
MRSA , short for methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , is a bacterium that can cause difficult - to - treat infections since it does not respond to many antibiotics .
Many healthy people carry S. aureus on their skin , but problems arise when multi- drug - resistant strains infect people with weak immune systems through an open wound .
In the worst cases , the bug spreads throughout the body , causing a life - threatening infection .
To make matters worse , resistance to antibiotics is rapidly increasing , and some strains are now even immune to vancomycin , a powerful antibiotic that is normally used only as a last resort when other drugs fail .
But when Appendino , Gibbons , and their colleagues applied extracts from five major cannabinoids to bacterial cultures of six strains of MRSA , they discovered that the cannabinoids were as effective at killing the bugs as vancomycin and other antibiotics .
" The cannabinoids even showed exceptional activity against the MRSA strain that makes extra amounts of the proteins that give the bugs resistance against many antibiotics , " says Gibbons .
These proteins , he explains , allow the bacteria to " hoover up unwanted things from inside the cell and spit them out again . "
Conveniently , of the five cannabinoids tested by the researchers , the two most effective ones also happen to be nonpsychoactive , meaning that they cannot cause a high .
" What this means is , we could use fiber hemp plants that have no use as recreational drugs to cheaply and easily produce potent antibiotics , " says Appendino .
In an attempt to discover how the cannabinoids kill MRSA , the team manipulated several chemical groups within the compounds .
Most of the changes did not affect the antibiotic activity at all , and those that did seemed to influence only how well the cannabinoid is taken up by the bacterial cells .
" Everything points towards these compounds having been evolved by the plants as antimicrobial defenses that specifically target bacterial cells , " says Gibbons .
" But the actual mechanism by which they kill the bugs is still a mystery .
We 've tested whether the cannabinoids affect common antibiotic targets like fatty acid synthesis or the [ DNA - bending enzyme ] DNA gyrase , but they do n't .
I really cannot hazard a guess how they do it , but their high potency as antibiotics suggests there must be a very specific mechanism . "
Appendino and Gibbons say that cannabinoids could quickly be developed as treatments for skin infections , provided the nonpsychoactive varieties are used .
" The most practical application of cannabinoids would be as topical agents to treat ulcers and wounds in a hospital environment , decreasing the burden of antibiotics , " says Appendino .
Whether the cannabinoids could also be delivered in the form of an injection or in pills is less clear , the pair says , because they may be inactivated by blood serum .
Frank Bowling of the University of Manchester , who has had success treating MRSA - infected wounds with maggots , says that " any alternative treatment that removes MRSA from the wound and prevents it from spreading into the body is fantastic and preferable to using antibiotics that have strong side effects and against which resistance is already developing . "
He cautions , however , that the researchers still need to show that the cannabinoids are safe to use .
This is not something that Appendino is too concerned about : " The topical use of cannabis preparations has a long tradition in European medicine , and no allergies have been reported . "
Mark Rogerson of GW Pharmaceuticals , a U.K. - based company that develops cannabinoid - based drugs to treat severe pain caused by multiple sclerosis and cancer , says that the discovery that cannabinoids kill MRSA " really underlines the potentially great diversity of medical applications that cannabis - based medicine can have .
You can almost think of the cannabis plant as a mini pharma industry in its own right . "
But Rogerson says that it is unlikely that existing cannabis - based medicines could be used to treat MRSA because the exact effect will depend on the correct combination and dosage of cannabinoids .
Meanwhile , Appendino and Gibbons hope that antibacterial effectiveness could also make cannabinoids suitable preservatives for cosmetics and toiletries .
" The golden standards of preservatives are parabens and chlorinated phenols , " says Appendino , but these compounds do not degrade well in the environment and are strongly suspected to be hormonal modifiers .
He also argues that , since all major cannabinoids are similarly effective , complete purification of a single compound is n't necessary .
So semipurified cannabinoid mixtures extracted from nonpsychoactive plants could make a cheap and easy alternative to conventional preservatives .
Goddamn , it 's about fucking time .

Editor 's note : Darrell M. West is vice president and director of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C. and the author of " Air Wars : Television Advertising in Election Campaigns , 1952 - 2004 . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Negative attacks are as American as apple pie .
Since the early days of the republic , candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire .
In the 1800 presidential election , for example , Thomas Jefferson and John Adams criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior .
Later campaigns were n't much better .
Critics of Andrew Jackson in 1836 accused him of murdering Indians .
In 1884 , Grover Cleveland was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child .
William Jennings Bryan was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy .
Despite these historical precedents , the 2008 campaign has reached all - time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals .
Even Karl Rove , the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns , has complained about the tenor of this year 's campaign .
John McCain broadcast an ad taking Barack Obama 's words out of context and suggesting Democrats were trying to compare GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to a pig .
The McCain campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming Obama favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners .
Democrats have not been above reproach either .
After McCain secured the GOP nomination this spring , outside groups falsely claimed the Republican supported a 1,000 - year war in Iraq and therefore was not worthy of the presidency .
These misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate , party , and group claims .
Generally , the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates .
These organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter 's fears and anxieties .
Some of the worst ads in recent memory , such as the Willie Horton ad in 1988 , have been broadcast by these kinds of groups .
In past years , the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of ads .
Since reporters police campaign appeals , the ads generally stick to the issues and rely on factually - accurate information .
Ad sponsors and candidates realize they will be held accountable for unfair ad content .
However , commercials run this year represent a break with this general pattern .
Attack ads broadcast in recent months have twisted the truth , lied about personal background , taken statements out of context , and clearly sought to manipulate voter sentiments .
Most worrisome from a factual standpoint is McCain 's claim that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class .
Although Obama has pledged to increase income taxes on those earning more than $ 250,000 , he has been careful not to make proposals that would raise taxes on the middle class for fear of being labeled a tax - and - spend liberal .
McCain 's tax claims have been condemned by leading editorial boards and surely will attract considerable attention in upcoming debates .
With all the factual inaccuracies that have taken place , voters need to protect themselves from efforts at political manipulation .
Non-partisan
Web sites such as www.factcheck.org represent one source of unbiased information .
They analyze ads and compile factual information in support of or in opposition to ad claims .
Other trustworthy fact - checkers include ad watches and reality checks run by leading news organizations .
These features dissect candidate claims in regard to accuracy , strategy , and impact .
But the best thing for voters to do is to watch the candidate debates and judge for themselves .
Study the statements and the factual bases of policy claims .
Pay attention to how the candidates speak and what they say .
Find out what non-partisan groups think and see what they have to say regarding the major issues .
By the time the campaign is over , the presidential candidates are expected to have spent 55 percent of their overall budget on ads .
Strategists put together spots very carefully and pre-test major messages on small groups of voters .
Most of this money will be devoted to television spots .
But increasingly amounts are being targeted on radio , direct mail , and Internet appeals .
In the end , voters are going to have to decipher competing charges and counter - charges amid considerable noise from all sides .
The 2008 election is unusual in having so many big issues on the agenda : the economy , the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , health care , taxes , immigration , education and climate change .
It is an election that truly matters because of the stark differences between the parties and the closeness of the campaign .
Voters need to pay serious attention to the facts in order to make a wise choice .

Cartoon characters such as Tony the Tiger that promote foods high in salt , fat and sugar are disappearing from TV but appearing more frequently in press , radio and the internet , prompting the government to warn it will " keep an eye " on advertising .
Companies targeting children with " junk food " ads have significantly cleaned up their act over the past five years , according to a government report by the Department of Health , revealed exclusively today by MediaGuardian.co.uk .
Child - themed food advertising across all media fell 41 % between 2003 and 2007 .
The government said the report will be of critical importance in measuring the impact of advertising as its battles against childhood obesity .
In 2003 , companies spent £ 103 m on food advertising to children , which included using licensed characters , film tie-ups , free toys or a link to a children 's TV programme , the report found .
By 2007 , that figure had fallen by 41 % to £ 61 m .
The drop was most notable in TV advertising , as companies cleaned up their marketing policies and Ofcom moved to introduce regulations last year to protect children from junk food ads .
The report showed a 46 % decrease in junk food TV ads targeting kids in the last five years , from nearly £ 100 m in 2003 to about £ 55 m last year .
However , advertisers increased child - themed press adverts by 42 % .
And food adverts aimed at children across radio , the internet and cinema advertising rose 11 % over the same period .
" I am pleased that there are now fewer ads on TV that are tempting our children into bad eating habits , " said the public health minister , Dawn Primarolo .
" But we must keep our eye on other types of media .
I hope the industry will continue to play its part in reducing the exposure that children have to the promotion of food which is high in fat , salt or sugar " .
Between 2003 and 2007 , according to the study , there had been 71 % decrease in fast food promotion , a 62 % decrease for confectionery ads , a 52 % drop for non-alcoholic drinks and a 37 % drop for cereal .
The report , which comes as Ofcom conducts a review of junk food TV advertising rules , forms part of a wider governmental strategy , under the banner " healthy weight , healthy lives " including a three - year , £ 75 m anti-obesity campaign due to start in January .
The governmental findings will provide the industry with ammunition following two reports put out in recent weeks by consumer body Which ?
criticising Ofcom 's advertising restrictions and the tactics of advertisers .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Women constitute more than half of registered U.S. voters , and issues close to their hearts and wallets reveal key difference in the platforms of Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain .
Last week , in the middle of presidential campaigning that has focused on the bleeding economy , a group of more than 30 economists issued a report card for Obama and McCain on their stance on 10 issues such as pay equity and paid family leave .
The criteria that the economists used reflects the view that the government has an appropriate role to play in supporting economic security , and that some individuals cannot achieve success without some support , according to Vicky Lovell , acting research director with the Institute for Women 's Policy Research .
Nancy Folbre , a noted feminist economist and a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst , chaired the group , and said its intent was " pretty nonpartisan . "
In the end , however , the report came close to damning to McCain :
" It 's not unfair to describe McCain as a firm enemy of many measures that would bring progress for women , while there is hope that under an Obama presidency , their situation could advance substantially , " a statement from the group 's vice chair said .
Obama came out on top , with an overall grade of " B , " while McCain received a " D , " according to the Economists ' Policy Group for Women 's Issues .
With the ongoing disparity in pay between men and women -- last year women 's median weekly earnings for full - time wage and salary workers were $ 614 , or 80 % of men 's $ 766 -- it 's no wonder that economists are concerned about women 's financial health .
Given that in the last presidential election 54 % of voters were women , they should carry some weight .
Women were also more likely to be registered than men ( 74 % to 71 % ) and more likely to vote ( 65 % to 62 % ) .
It seems that the parties are beginning to catch up to the voter population -- this presidential race produced the first woman on a GOP ticket , as well as a historic battle between a woman and an African - American for the Democratic nod .
Lovell said the report card on women 's issues reflects a key difference between Obama and McCain 's philosophies about how individuals should access help .
" McCain sees it to be entirely an individual 's responsibility -- if a worker needs more flexibility at work and does n't have it , they should find a different job , " she commented .
" Whereas Obama recognizes that they can't get a job with more flexibility , that there are n't enough jobs available with flexibility . "
Pay and employment equity
When it comes to pay and employment equity , the economists gave Obama a " B " and McCain an " F . "
Among other actions , to earn an " A , " economists said the candidates must support a piece of legislation named after Lilly Ledbetter , a retiree who had worked for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. for almost two decades before an anonymous tipster informed her she was paid less than male co-workers .
She sued after she learned of the disparity , but in a narrow interpretation of the Civil Rights Act , the Supreme Court decided that Ledbetter had waited too long to file a charge because she did not complain within 180 days of when the discriminatory pay decisions were made .
The Ledbetter legislation would amend the Civil Rights
Act by spelling out that each new paycheck could be counted as a discriminatory act , opening a new window to file charges after each and every paycheck .
The legislation was blocked in the Senate earlier this year .
Obama voted to move forward with it , while McCain did n't cast a vote , but has said he opposes the bill because of litigation concerns -- a stance that hurt his grade .
Obama did n't get an " A " because the economists said his pay - equity programs stop short of providing a " comprehensive approach " to reduce employment and pay discrimination .
Diana Furchtgott - Roth , director of the Center for Employment Policy at the Hudson Institute , a conservative think tank , backed McCain 's view , and said that the Ledbetter legislation would just be a boon to trial lawyers .
" It would impede opportunities for women because it would mean that each woman when she is hired would carry with her the potential for litigation decades after the hire , " Furchtgott - Roth commented .
Paid time off
When it comes to paid time off , Obama earned a " B+ " and McCain a " D. "
To earn an " A " candidates must : advocate comprehensive paid family leave ; support requiring employers to provide vacation and sick days ; and support expanding the unpaid Family and Medical Leave Act .
" The vast majority of developed nations guarantee paid sick days and paid vacations for most employees , " the economists wrote .
" Absent these provisions , many financially strapped employees cannot take time work to care for either themselves of their children when illness strikes . "
The economists fault McCain for not supporting an expansion of the unpaid provisions of Family and Medical Leave Act , and for not supporting federal legislation to require paid sick days for most workers , among other issues .
Obama does support an extension of the Family and Medical Leave Act , and proposed legislation to require most employers to provide up to seven days of paid sick and family care leave .
Why is this a women 's issue ?
" Because of the number of mothers that are in the workforce now , and how few children have a parent at home full time , " Lovell said .
" The reason it 's so important is that if a child is sick and a parent needs to take time off , a lot of workers face losing their job or losing their pay . "
Furchtgott - Roth said mandating paid time - off benefits would make women less desirable hires because they would come with a " higher price tag " than men .
" The reason why women are so successful is because companies do n't have higher mandated benefits for them , " she added .
Retirement security
On retirement security , Obama earned a " B , " and McCain a " D , " according to the economists .
To earn an " A " the candidates would have to oppose privatizing Social Security and support expanding subsidized savings plans for low - income adults , among other stances .
" Older women rely more on Social Security because they have fewer sources of income and fewer assets , " Lovell said .
" For women to be economically secure in retirement it 's critical that there be some strong safety net . "
McCain is " hard to pin down " when it comes to Social Security , according to the economists .
" McCain 's past support for proposals that would privatize Social Security make his current plans suspect .
...
He promises to work with Congress to put the system on a sustainable basis , but does not offer any specific proposals , " according to the report card .
The economists gave Obama a high mark because he has " consistently " opposed privatizing Social Security , and has plans to provide a retirement savings subsidy for those earning less than $ 75,000 a year , among other proposals .

My Way
“ and ” the Highway
Texas Politician’s
Hidden Agenda
By Tedd Peck &
Edward Snook
Investigative Reporters
Dallas , Texas -
Poll after poll shows that a majority of Texans are dead set against the Texas Department of Transportation ’s ( TDOT ) agenda to build toll roads that are tied into the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) highway .
According to Lou Dobbs of CNN there is a plan , Security and Prosperity Partnership , to connect Mexico with Canada via the Trans Texas Corridor ( TTC ) .
This corridor is planned to start at Laredo and head toward Dallas and Houston then north parallel with Interstate 35 and on into Oklahoma , Kansas , Missouri and all points north .
It has been reported that the Bush Administration is deeply involved with this master agenda but he scoffs at the mention of a superhighway .
Go to http://www.nauwarroom.org and do your own research regarding the prime movers of a North American Union .
The incongruities of the majority of Texans not wanting new highways and TDOT pushing this concept through are abundant .
Cash strapped
Texans say they want their gas tax dollars used to repair old roads , not in building new toll roads run by foreign entities .
However , the politicians controlling this nefarious agenda are spending money to plan and design this unwanted superhighway .
If the citizens of a democracy are against this plan why is it going forward and who is moving the agenda ?
What about public opinion ?
The Hidden Agenda of Senator John Carona
One person , who has the power to control the unfolding of the NAFTA highway , letting public opinion be damned , is Texas State Senator ( District 16 ) John Carona .
As chairman of the Transportation Committee , in close company with TDOT , it has been reported that he is a strong supporter of TTC - 69 and 35 .
Those in opposition to his stance for a master highway plan , avers it will allow eminent domain to run-amuck in rural Texas in pursuit of tax revenue .
Most of the proposed route , to be managed by Cintra Group of Spain and the Macquarie Group from Australia , would be toll roads , adding costs to already high gas prices for Texans .
Carona makes it sound like a progressive idea to eliminate future gridlock for Texans .
To the undiscerning eye it might be , but to those property owners facing eminent domain proceedings resulting from these toll road projects , it is a plan from hell .
The corridors to be built are 1200 feet wide containing twelve lanes of traffic , right - of - ways for railroads , pipelines and power lines .
Contrary to interstate highways being required to provide overpasses over existing county roads and include ingress and egress ramps every few miles for local traffic , corridors are only required to provide overpasses for U.S. , state , interstate highways and they ignore local access to the superhighway , thereby literally cutting communities in half .
A rancher living a few miles from a school , hospital or public safety provider would be cut off due to the impassability of the corridor .
Fire fighters would be forced to drive thirty miles to cross the highway in order to fight a fire one mile away as the crow flies .
Carona has written articles appearing in the Dallas Morning News presenting his concern regarding wasted man hours and wasted fuel caused by gridlock on freeways without addressing the dark side of their vision .
Carona ’s handling of two legislative bills aptly demonstrates his true agenda .
HB 1892 would have mandated a solid two year moratorium on all facets of the TTC , providing needed time to carefully study the impact of such a plan and to give both sides time to state their respective cases .
After all , public opinion is at stake here but unwanted if it flies in the face of the power elite like Carona and friends .
Although Carona praised HB1892 in public he was one of the few that voted against it in the Senate .
Having passed both houses with overwhelming majorities it was reported that Governor Perry held the bill until the last possible moment before its death by veto .
Transportation Commissioner Ric Williamson said this : “ Once the Governor decided that this is where we needed to head , he wanted to remove it from the political flow of the state , he wanted it to become policy as opposed to politics , and that was one of the reasons he asked us to move so fast , and we 've done an admirable job .
. . . ”
Is it any wonder why Perry presented his bill SB792 to his chief sycophant Carona , chairman of the Transportation Committee , with the threat of calling the legislature back into special session again and again until they capitulated to his will ?
Carona dutifully passed SB792 through his committee with three readings in the same day in order to comply with legislative rules and ensured the bills passage , thereby gaining favor with campaign donors in his upcoming reelection bid .
Always follow the money and forget about your constituency when expedient .
Hank Gilbert from Texans Uniting for Reform & Freedom ( TURF ) described this bill as , “ A junk bill since the only moratorium in that bill was for certain sections of TCC - 69 and stopped nothing on TCC - 35 and lower TCC - 69 . ”
All projects connected to these two routes in the metroplex counties surrounding DFW were exempted in both bills by Carona and his hometown delegation .
Not only doing away with the moratorium language , the bill presented a new way to determine toll rates by a process called “ market valuation . ”
This is a euphemism for what ever the market will bear , instead of paying off the cost of the indebtedness of the toll road .
State Highway 130 circling Austin , TX is a foreign run toll road that charges $.25 per mile in some locations and $ 2.50 per mile in other segments .
Carona ’s main financial supporters are people connected to the North American SuperCorridor Coalition ( NASCO ) .
Some of these people , not unlike Fort Worth Mayor Mike Moncrief and NASCO board member Judge Glen Whitely , were reported by Mr. Gilbert to be strong promoters of the NAFTA Superhighway .
The same highway Carona now says he is against .
NASCO , “ is a non-profit , trade and transportation coalition working to make international and domestic trade more efficient and secure … running north and south through the central U.S. , Canada and Mexico ” according to its website .
Similar to the NAFTA Highway and North American Union ( NAU ) these organizations are strongly endorsed by George W. Bush and his close friend Governor Perry and are incrementally being set into stone through contracts , thereby avoiding the U.S. Senate oversight necessitated by formal treaties .
International contracts are placing American soil into the hands of international interests for the sake of private profit at our citizens ’ public expense , aided and abetted by men like Carona and Perry .
Recently , during a meeting regarding TTC - 35 in Fort Worth all of the people present spoke out against the proposed project except Moncrief and Whitely .
It was reported that these two men were booed out of the coliseum .
They were definitely in the minority but yet their master plan prevails .
The problem , therefore , must be with politicians who say one thing but take countermanding action .
Where there is a will , there is usually a way and in this situation Carona ’s opponents found a glitch in the state law in the form of State Statute 391 , which allows for the formation of governmental entities called sub regional planning commissions .
Gilbert reports that two of these commissions have been formed on the TTC - 35 corridor and five commissions on the TCC - 69 corridor , basically shutting them down .
Proponents of the corridors , including Carona are throwing fits because they did not know this statute existed .
“ More of them are springing up like flies , ” states Gilbert and he reported that Perry wants to do away with this legal impediment when the state legislature comes to order .
With this possibility looming on the horizon the citizens against toll roads are organizing commissions as fast as they can so they will be grandfathered , in defiance to the Governor ’s master plan that involves policy at the expense of public opinion .
In addition , the commissions are enlisting the Environmental Protection Agency in demanding revised impact studies .
When asked what Carona will do to assist Perry , Gilbert states emphatically , “ No matter what kind of legislation is necessary to do away with the 391 committees , Perry will have to introduce it through Carona ’s Senate transportation committee and Carona will fast track it through the Senate .
Carona is completely sold out ; he ’s nothing but a mouth piece for the transportation lobby . ”
He went on to add , “ It has also been written that Carona is against the TTC , which goes to the heart of the matter by illustrating his duplicity by working diligently to promote the highway at the bidding of the transportation lobbyists . ”
Is he now publicly against it because the issue has become a hot potato which columnist and commentator Alan Stang wrote in a February 17 , 2008 , article about Governor Perry and his Republican friends ’ intentions to steal property via eminent domain to build this ill thought out super highway ?
So in the latest tally the majority has won or at least slowed down the assault of the minority .
Can their majority be maintained - only time will tell ?
Policy vs. Politics !
Why Would Texas Trial Lawyers
Support Carona
In the up - coming race for Texas State Senate , District 16 , the trial lawyers have backed their pal John Carona , with time and money .
So this reporter asks , why a Republican and not one of their own ?
A logical explanation would be he is more like them than the Democratic candidate .
What we do know is that Carona is clever almost to a fault .
As mentioned above Carona has sold out to the highest bidder and used his office to enhance his property management company , pillaging Homeowner Associations ( HOA ) - another story waiting to be told .
After the flirtation came the fatwa .
With some overly friendly comments to Gov. Sarah Palin at the United Nations , Asif Ali Zardari has succeeded in uniting one of Pakistan 's hard - line mosques and its feminists after a few weeks in office .
A radical Muslim prayer leader said the president shamed the nation for " indecent gestures , filthy remarks , and repeated praise of a non-Muslim lady wearing a short skirt . "
Feminists charged that once again a male Pakistani leader has embarrassed the country with sexist remarks .
And across the board , the Pakistani press has shown disapproval .
What did President Zardari do to draw such scorn ?
It might have been the " gorgeous " compliment he gave Ms. Palin when the two met at the UN last week during her meet - and - greet with foreign leaders ahead of Thursday 's vice presidential debate with opponent Sen.
Joe Biden , the Democratic vice presidential nominee .
But the comments from Zardari did n't end there .
He went on to tell Palin : " Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you . "
" You are so nice , " replied the Republican vice presidential hopeful , smiling .
" Thank you . "
But what may have really caused Pakistan 's radical religious leaders to stew was his comment that he might " hug " Palin if his handler insisted .
Though the fatwa , issued days after the Sept. 24 exchange , carries little weight among most Pakistanis , it 's indicative of the anger felt by Pakistan 's increasingly assertive conservatives who consider physical contact and flattery between a man and woman who are n't married to each other distasteful .
Though fatwas , or religious edicts , can range from advice on daily life to death sentences , this one does not call for any action or violence .
Last year , the mosque that issued the fatwa , Lal Masjid ( Red Mosque ) in Islamabad , condemned the former tourism minister , Nilofar Bahktiar , after she was photographed being hugged by a male parachuting coach in France .
Clerics declared the act a " great sin " and , though less vocal about it , similar sentiments were shared by many among Pakistani 's middle classes .
The Red Mosque gained international infamy in July 2007 after becoming the focal point of a Pakistan Army operation .
For the feminists it 's less about cozying up to a non-Muslim woman and more about the sexist remarks by Zardari .
" As a Pakistani and as a woman , it was shameful and unacceptable .
He was looking upon her merely as a woman and not as a politician in her own right , " says Tahira Abdullah , a member of the Women 's Action Forum .
Dismissing the mosque 's concerns as " ranting , " she , however , adds : " He should show some decorum – if he loved his wife so much as to press for a United Nations investigation into her death , he should behave like a mourning widower , " in reference to former Pakistani premier Benazir Bhutto , a feminist icon for millions of Pakistani women .
The theme of decorum was picked up by English daily Dawn , whose editorial asked : " Why do our presidents always end up embarrassing us internationally by making sexist remarks ? "
The incident bears some resemblance to yet another charm offensive by a senior Pakistani politician .
Marcus Mabry 's biography of Condoleezza Rice includes a passage in which he relates a meeting between former Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and Ms. Rice , in which Mr. Aziz was said to have stared deeply into the secretary of State 's eyes and to have told her he could " conquer any woman in two minutes . "
There are some , however , who see things as having been blown out of proportion .
" It was a sweet and innocuous exchange played as an international incident on Pakistani and rascally Indian front - pages with one English daily [ writing ] it in a scarlet box , half - implying Mrs. Palin would ditch Alaska 's First Dude and become Pakistan 's First Babe .
As if , " wrote columnist Fasih Ahmed in the Daily Times .
For most , it will soon be forgotten in a country dealing with terrorism , rising food prices , and a struggling economy .
" We do n't care that much how they [ politicians ] behave – what really matters is keeping prices down , " says Nazeera Bibi , a maid in Lahore .
My fellow Alaskans have vouched for Palin as a charming , interesting person .
I can add to that that she is perfectly friendly .
But now she is running for the highest office and so it must be noted that Sarah Palin the Friendly Neighbor is different from Sarah Palin the Executive .
The latter is a woman with intense agendas guided by a narrow set of culturally conservative and extreme religious values .
She believes that abstinence should be the only form of sex education taught to teenagers ; she believes that creationism should be taught alongside science in our schools ; she is against a woman ’s right to choose even in the cases of incest and rape ; and her church believes gay and lesbian Americans can and , one assumes , should be corrected by prayer ( “ pray away the gay ” is their cheery slogan ) .
When she was mayor of my hometown , these extreme views came off as petty and irrelevant to people like me who did not share them .
There seemed little cause for alarm .
Most Alaskans are happy to live and let live ; we do n’t think of ourselves as Republican or Democrat .
Besides , as mayor , it ’s not like she had the power to wiretap our phones , amend our constitution , or send us to war .
But she did try to use her power to ban books .
Wasilla ’s popular public librarian rightly objected , and the community rightly backed the librarian .
The books were never banned , though Mrs. Palin did fire the librarian for not agreeing with her political views , then rescinded the firing after it was clear she ’d made an unpopular decision .
Sarah Palin ’s behavior is revealing : in a state as isolated as Alaska , in a town as small as Wasilla , books are vital to the culture and to the education of its residents .
The small town values I learned growing up included attending story hour at the public library .
Those values most certainly did not include trying to ban books that the mayor ’s church friends did n’t think other people should read .
It will be interesting to see what effect Gov. Palin ’s penchant for reform will have on the McCain campaign .
Will she put one of Cindy McCain ’s private jets on eBay ?
Maybe one of the McCain ’s seven houses ?
It certainly has n’t meant she ’ll answer any questions from voters or the press .
Her very first media interview wo n’t come until later this week .
The reason is clear : she ’s not ready to answer questions about the housing crisis , foreign policy or healthcare .
So far she ’s been allowed into public view only to deliver a speech similar to the one she gave at her party ’s convention , the one in which , with the sass and smile of a punch line , she ridiculed community organizers who step up to help less fortunate communities whose government has allowed them to fall through the cracks .
Her speech made for good television , something the McCain camp felt they desperately needed .
And it sure fired up the folks at the Republican National Convention .
Who can blame them ?
They finally have a candidate who can shoot a gun , drink a beer AND speak in complete English sentences .
This is real change for them .
In recent days , Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin have directed accusations of elitism at the Democratic ticket as well as at the media , suggesting that there is something undesirable about a presidential candidate with extensive knowledge of foreign policy , inner city community struggles , constitutional law , and the complexities of the major domestic crises .
This is baffling .
Do n’t we want an elite leader ?
Do n’t we want a White House made transparent by an elite press ?
We are a large and complex nation with large and complex problems .
Common sense suggests , and the last eight years have shown , that perhaps the president should be something of an elite leader .
Barack Obama studied international relations at Columbia ( he also has a law degree and has taught constitutional law ) before returning to Chicago to be a community organizer .
Meanwhile , Mrs. Palin ran for Miss Alaska ( she placed second ) and then received a Bachelor ’s degree in communications - journalism from the University of Idaho .
She returned to Alaska and became a reporter at a television station ’s sports desk .
For just 22 months Sarah Palin has been the governor of a state of just 680,000 people that is “ awash ” in money ( as former Alaska governor Tony Knowles put it ) and receives more pork - barrel money per capita than any other state .
Alaska has no tricky border or immigration issues with the remote parts of British Columbia and the coast of Siberia .
There are no inner cities struggling with poverty and daily violence .
There is a lot of drunk driving ( Alaska is dark and cold much of the year ) , though the state police force is well funded and the road system they patrol is startlingly simple ; I ca n’t think of a stretch of highway lasting 15 miles that has more than 4 lanes .
To use a metaphor from track ( a sport the Palins are fond of ) , putting Gov. Palin on a presidential ticket is like Coach McCain sending a promising high school long - jumper to compete for Team USA in the Olympic decathlon .
It ’s a really bad coaching decision .
And by all accounts McCain ’s vetting process was hasty and impulsive .
John McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin shows that he is moving farther and farther to the right of mainstream America .
If he ’s doing it for political reasons , he ’s no maverick .
If he ’s doing this for reasons of principle , he is merely out of touch with most Americans .
Ninety percent of the delegates to the Republican National Convention were white .
That might resemble the America that the Republican party sees , and it certainly resembles the demographics that shaped Gov. Palin over the many years she ’s lived in Alaska .
But it ’s not the America most Americans live in .
Not only is Sarah Palin ’s executive experience inadequate , her worldview is not possibly diverse or nuanced enough to appreciate either the domestic challenges or international complexities that a VP must grasp at the most basic level .
A McCain / Palin administration would be risky at best , and potentially disastrous .
I ’m sick of Republicans suggesting I ’m unpatriotic while they ruin my reputation around the world .
I ’m sick of people casting votes of fear because of threats that are mischaracterized and exploited by their own political leaders .
I ’m sick of distorted television commercials being my country ’s primary method of public discourse .
And I ’m sick of being told that straight , white , Evangelical family values are better for my country than my family ’s values .
Anyone who has paid lip service to the idea that America ’s strength relies upon its diversity , be warned : it ’s actually true , and it will be even truer in the future .
I think my generation will be known as the diversity generation .
We get America .
We are ready to be leaders for the world community .
We are motivated .
We think .
We are patriotic .
And if we vote , we can not be outnumbered .

TBILISI , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A grim Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Friday that he signed a cease - fire agreement that requires the immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces from Georgian soil .
Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili announces Friday he signed a cease - fire agreement with Russia .
The agreement includes a provision for independent monitors and an eventual reconstruction plan for Georgia 's economy , said U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who brought the documents to Tbilisi , Georgia 's capital .
The two met for almost five hours , the Georgian president said .
Later Friday , the office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who brokered the agreement , said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had confirmed Russia 's cooperation .
" His country will sign a cease - fire accord with Georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements , including a troop withdrawal , " Sarkozy 's office said .
Fighting that started last week has died down in the region , but Russian forces remain .
The warfare raged for several days until Sarkozy 's diplomatic efforts helped lessen the violence .
Sarkozy undertook the role because he holds the rotating presidency of the European Union .
Saakashvili opened a news conference announcing the agreement with a bitter tirade against what he characterized as European nations ' appeasement in advance of a Russian invasion last week .
NATO 's decision in April not to admit Georgia as a member encouraged Russia to build up forces and attack Georgia with impunity , he said .
" Who invited the trouble here ? " he asked .
" Who invited this arrogance here ?
Who invited the innocent deaths here ?
Not only those people who perpetrated this are responsible , but also those people who failed to stop it . "
Rice emphasized that all Russian troops must return to the positions they held before the conflict began .
Watch as Rice says , " This is no longer 1968 " »
Georgia last week launched a military incursion into South Ossetia to rout separatist rebels .
Russia , which supports the separatists , responded the next day , sending tanks across the border into South Ossetia .
The conflict quickly spread to other parts of Georgia and to Abkhazia , another breakaway region .
" We support Georgia 's sovereignty ; we support its independence ; we support its territorial integrity ; we support its democracy and its democratically elected government , " Rice said .
She said an independent monitoring force must be put in place as soon as possible and that talks were under way to assemble one .
" Never , ever will Georgia reconcile with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory , " Saakashvili said .
Saakashvili had hesitated Thursday evening when asked whether he was ready to sign the cease - fire papers Rice was carrying .
" We 'll have to see what she has to bring , " Saakashvili said on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
" We are still in the negotiating process . "
In Washington , President Bush chided Russia on Friday for Cold War - style behavior , saying , " bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century . "
Bush said the United States stands " with the people of Georgia and their democratically elected government . "
He said the country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity " must be respected . "
" We will not cast them aside , " he said .
Bush said Russia 's invasion of Georgia has " damaged its credibility . "
" Russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors , " Bush said , calling Georgia a " courageous democracy . "
Watch Bush explain why Georgia matters »
Bush said he has been receiving updates from his national security team about the situation .
Bush said Rice would travel to his ranch near Crawford , Texas , where the two will confer .
He said Defense Secretary Robert Gates is briefing him on humanitarian assistance and that he is working closely with " our partners in Europe and other members of the G - 7 to bring a resolution to this crisis . "
Administration officials said this week the United States and its allies were considering kicking Russia out of the Group of Eight , the group of the world 's most important international economies , as punishment for its actions in Georgia .
" Moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all Georgian territory , " Bush said .
He said Georgia has been part " of an inspiring and hopeful new chapter in Europe 's history , " and he noted that Europe " has moved beyond " the world wars and the Cold War , the standoff between Soviet - style communism and the West .
iReport.com : Did you experience the Cold War ?
" Unfortunately , Russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests , " Bush said .
" The opposite is true .
Free and prosperous societies on Russia 's borders will advance Russia 's interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity . "
The United States is hopeful that Russia will embrace " a future of cooperation and peace " that would help all parties , he said .
" The Cold War is over , " Bush said .
" The days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us .
A contentious relationship with Russia is not in America 's interest .
And a contentious relationship with America is not in Russia 's interests . "

The multiplicity of selves becomes more intuitive as the time span increases .
Social psychologists have found certain differences in how we think of ourselves versus how we think of other people — for instance , we tend to attribute our own bad behavior to unfortunate circumstances , and the bad behavior of others to their nature .
But these biases diminish when we think of distant past selves or distant future selves ; we see such selves the way we see other people .
Although it might be hard to think about the person who will occupy your body tomorrow morning as someone other than you , it is not hard at all to think that way about the person who will occupy your body 20 years from now .
This may be one reason why many young people are indifferent about saving for retirement ; they feel as if they would be giving up their money to an elderly stranger .
One can see a version of clashing multiple selves in the mental illness known as dissociative - identity disorder , which used to be called multiple - personality disorder .
This is familiar to everyone from the dramatic scenes in movies in which an actor is one person , and then he or she contorts or coughs or shakes the head , and — boom ! — another person comes into existence .
( My own favorite is Edward Norton in Primal Fear , although — spoiler alert — he turns out in the end to be faking . )
Dissociative - identity disorder is controversial .
It used to be rarely diagnosed , then the number of reported cases spiked dramatically in the 1980s , particularly in North America .
The spike has many possible explanations : the disorder was first included as a specific category in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , just as an influential set of case studies of multiple personalities was published .
And increased popular interest was fueled by the 1973 novel Sybil and its 1976 movie adaptation , which starred Sally Field as a woman with 16 different personalities .
Some psychologists believe that this spike was not the result of better diagnosis .
Rather , they say it stemmed in part from therapists who inadvertently persuaded their patients to create these distinct selves , often through role - playing and hypnosis .
Recent years have seen a backlash , and some people diagnosed with the disorder have sued their therapists .
One woman got a settlement of more than $ 2 million after alleging that her psychotherapist had used suggestive memory “ recovery ” techniques to convince her that she had more than 120 personalities , including children , angels , and a duck .
Regardless of the cause of the spike , considerable evidence , including recent brain - imaging studies , suggests that some people really do shift from one self to another , and that the selves have different memories and personalities .
In one study , women who had been diagnosed with dissociative - identity disorder and claimed to be capable of shifting at will from one self to another listened to recordings while in a PET scanner .
When the recordings told of a woman ’s own traumatic experience , the parts of the brain corresponding to autobiographic memory became active — but only when she had shifted to the self who had endured that traumatic experience .
If she was in another self , different parts of the brain became active and showed a pattern of neural activity corresponding to hearing about the experience of a stranger .

Bush says 'we will come through this together '
Berlusconi suggests world markets could be shut
Blind panic swept through the City and Wall Street today as shares collapsed following huge losses all around the globe .
Traders were in a state of ' paralytic fear ' in London when the Stock Market fell through the floor on opening , losing £ 250 million each second for the first seven minutes .
During the day , it climbed back to close down 8.9 per cent but even this surpassed Monday 's record sell - off .
In one week , the FTSE has dived a massive 21 per cent .
It is its worst seven days since the Black Monday Crash of 1987 .
The extraordinary scenes were echoed across the Atlantic when the Dow Jones opened in New York this afternoon and immediately plunged almost 700 points .
Free -fall : Traders around the world could only look on aghast as shares plunged .
In London , they fell 440 points within seven minutes of trading
President Bush , in an emergency statement after Wall Street opened , tried to calm the growing panic and insisted the world would pull through the financial crisis together .
He said the US was working ‘ closely with our partners from around the world ’ to steady the markets .
‘ We ’re in this together and we ’ll come through this together , ’ said the grim - faced president .
He added that the U.S. government 's financial rescue plan was aggressive enough and big enough to work although it would take time to fully kick in , but investors remained panicked .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi revealed political leaders believed they might have to close the world 's financial markets while they work out a solution .
Speaking in Naples today , he said : ' The idea of suspending the markets for the time it takes to rewrite the rules is being discussed . '
Shares across the board fell today , proving fears of a global recession as well as concerns about the stability of the financial sector are now coming home to roost .
There is growing panic that , despite drastic action in the U.S. and Britain and an emergency rates cut , nothing so far has managed to stop the crisis in its tracks .
In the red : From London to Sydney , stocks tumbled
Any hopes Gordon Brown's £ 500 billion package might steady the ship were dashed when inter - bank lending rates rose today , proving the credit markets are still frozen .
The overnight rate for sterling rose 0.4 per cent to 5.81 and the three - month lending rate - a key measure in pricing mortgages - was up 6.281 to 6.285 .
Everywhere from Japan to Australia , stocks fell by huge margins leaving desolate traders with nothing to do but pray their fortunes might improve .
Russia , Iceland , Austria , Romania and Ukraine all suspended their markets to prevent further losses .
Henk Potts , director of investment strategy at Barclays Stockbrokers , said : ' I think it 's very close to panic .
We are drowning in a sea of red numbers . '
In the UK , Gordon Brown urged world leaders to find a ' global solution ' to the crisis as Chancellor Alistair Darling discussed rescue measures with finance chiefs in Washington .
From the White House , the U.S. President tried to reassure his people after last night 's collapse on Wall Street saw stocks fall 7.3 per cent and drop below 9,000 for the first time since 2003 .
He promised the Government was doing absolutely everything to save its crippled economy and people 's livelihoods , detailing each rescue measure in turn .
' This is an anxious time but the American people can be confident in our economic future , ' he declared .
' We know what the problems are and we have the tools to fix them and we are working quickly to do so ...
We all share the determination to solve this problem and that is exactly what we are going to do . '
The U.S. was working closely with ' partners around the world ' to make sure any bail - out was co-ordinated and effective , he added .
' With these efforts the world is sending an unmistakable signal : we are in this together and we will come through this together . '
Defending his $ 700 billion banking bail - out , he insisted it was ' aggressive ' and the ' right plan ' but admitted it would take time to have an effect .
On the FTSE , bank shares were among the biggest losers and in early trading just one company managed to stay in the red .
By lunchtime , HBOS was down down 17 per cent , RBS 16 per cent , HSBC 13 per cent and Barclays 15 per cent .
David Buik , of brokers BGC Partners said : ' It ’s official .
It ’s a bloodbath .
Just pure blind panic .'

Glum : A Wall Street trader looks on as it plunges 7.3 per cent to below 9,000 for the first time since 2003 .
The drop unleashed fresh panic around the globe
Meanwhile , Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley suffered another alarming plunge in its share price today .
The embattled investment bank lost as much as 30 pc of its value after ratings agency Moody 's threatened to downgrade the firm 's credit rating .
The move intensified fears that Morgan Stanley , which employs around 5,000 staff in the UK , could get frozen out of the wholesale lending markets , putting it in danger of going bust .
As fears of a lengthy recession deepened , the price of oil also dropped to below $ 80 for the first time in a year .
Adding to the general panic was the fact that today is when credit default swaps related to the debts of collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers are to be decided .
Experts have estimated claims by creditors of the firm could run to $ 400 billion which will hit banks , hedge funds , insurers and other financial institutions with fresh woes .
And in Britain , there was further gloom because the pound has now slumped to a five - year low against the dollar .
Across the world , shares were in the red .
In Europe , benchmark indexes in France and Germany also plunged almost 10 per cent in early trading .
Both were still down around six per cent towards the close .
Spain 's
Ibex stock index also fell more than six per cent .

Meanwhile , in Australia , experts dubbed it ' Black Friday ' after its stocks tumbled 8.34 per cent in its biggest ever one - day loss .
In New Zealand , shares fell 4.72 per cent .
' There 's no bottom to the stock markets now , ' added Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong .
' There 's no clue when it will stop . '
Traders were reduced to praying for calm .
In Singapore , where shares plunged seven per cent , they flocked to stroke the belly of a 7ft Buddha statue in the hope some good fortune would rub off .
' I came down here on my lunch break to get some luck for me and for the whole world , the economy , everything , but there are some things even Buddha can't help , ' said Albert Goh , a 60 - year - old accountant .
He can't look :
The Hang Seng in Hong Kong plunged more than 1,200 points
The sell - off on Wall Street last night took place exactly one year to the day after the Dow enjoyed a record high of 14,164 .
Since then , frozen credit markets , rocketing levels of mortgage defaults , job losses and outright fear have knocked 39 per cent from its value .
On paper , the losses are worth $ 8.3 trillion .
A temporary ban on short - selling in the U.S. - the practice of making money from falling share prices - has also now expired , adding to the turmoil .
David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor 's in New York said : ' Right now the market is just panicked .
Nobody wants to take on any risk .
Everybody just wants to get their money and put it under the mattress . '
The world 's economic powers are under huge pressure to act boldly together in a bid to try and stop the crisis from escalating further .
Mr Darling was discussing a way forward with other financial leaders from the G7 group of the world 's richest countries this afternoon .
' Politicians must be scared by now , looking at stock markets and the problems in the credit markets , ' said Dariusz Kowalczyk , chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour Ltd in Hong Kong .
' Much more needs to be done , ' he said .
' The G7 has to announce that they will provide massive capital injections and guarantees for the inter - bank market . '
Singapore : Buddhists rub the face and belly of the ' Laughing Buddha ' statue in the hope it might bring them some good fortune
At the centre of a financial crisis , now almost a month old , credit markets remain in deep distress because banks are so desperate to hang onto the money they have .
Until they start to lend to each other , there is little hope of relief for people in need of money for mortgages or to keep their businesses going during the slowdown .
In the latest attempt to ease the panic , the U.S. and Dutch governments are preparing to follow Britain 's lead and shore up the capital of banks .
The U.S. Treasury plans to start injecting capital in banks as early as this month , according to a source close to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
This would mean an even larger role for the U.S. government , making it the lender and investor of last resort .
Until this week , American policy had been to focus on buying up banks ' ' toxic ' mortgage debts but experts hope recapitalisation might be a more direct strategy .
Total Solar Eclipse of 2008 August 01
On Friday , 2008 August 01 , a total eclipse of the Sun is visible from within a narrow corridor that traverses half the Earth .
The path of the Moon 's umbral shadow begins in Canada and extends across northern Greenland , the Arctic , central Russia , Mongolia , and China .
A partial eclipse is seen within the much broader path of the Moon 's penumbral shadow , which includes northeastern North America , most of Europe and Asia .

Google Map of the Path of Totality
An implementation of Google Map has been created which includes the central path of the 2008 total solar eclipse .
This allows the user to sellect any portion of the path and to zoom in using either map data or Earth satellite data .
General Maps of the Eclipse Path
The following maps show the overall regions of visibility of the partial eclipse as well as the path of the total eclipse through North America , Europe and Asia .
They use high resolution coastline data from the World Data Base II ( WDB ) .
Each map was chosen to isolate a specific region along the land portion of the eclipse path .
Curves of maximum eclipse are included as well as the outline of the umbral shadow .
Each map is available in two resolutions : ' Low ' ( web resolution ) and ' High ' ( 300 dpi print resolution ) .
You may need to set your printer to 25 % reduction in order to print ' High ' resolution figures on a single page .

A Police State in Minneapolis and St. Paul ?
Using the the phrase “ police state ” could seem a little incendiary in itself , but the rash of house raids and questionable arrests taking place all over Minneapolis and St.
Paul in the past few days is chilling .
I first heard about it from a friend living in Minneapolis last Saturday , who sent me some links and video of the aftermath of the police raids on at least four houses in the area .
Dressed in full SWAT gear with assault rifles drawn , the police referred to themselves during the raid with pseudonyms such as “ terminator ” and “ the executioner ” – I guess for that full “ SWAT ” effect .
Occupants where handcuffed and forced to lay on the ground while police confiscated computers , personal journals , and other common household items ( that theoretically could be used to make bombs – have you looked around in your garage lately ? ) .
>> More convention coverage at RG&B >>
Some of those detained say the police refused to show a warrant until after they were done raiding the houses .
The only reason given for this thug - like police action from the Ramsey County Sheriff , FBI , and Minneapolis police is a “ suspicion of conspiracy to commit riot ” .
To be clear , “ protest ” is not “ riot ” .
Freedom of speech and of assembly are guaranteed in the 1st amendment to the Constitution – unless , perhaps , you ’re just a bit too close to the Republican Convention .
The Sustainable Living Bus is Goin ’ Down
On Saturday evening , in an act of confused jurisdiction , Minneapolis police pulled over the “ Sustainable Living ” bus in St. Paul .
The bus is fully licensed and legal in the state of Montana .
Several other law enforcement agencies were involved in impounding the bus and detaining its passengers .
When asked how the Minneapolis police could be involved in a “ common traffic stop ” in St. Paul , the answer was “ we ’re all working together ” .
Working together to accomplish what ?
Impound a bus full of peaceniks from Montana spreading the word of non-violence and permaculture ?
When asked on what ground the bus was being impounded , riders were told that the “ warrant would be executed later ” .
If there ’s one thing we ’ve learned in the past eight years , it ’s that those currently in power do n’t cotton too well to any sort of protest or civil disobedience – legalities and constitutions be damned .
Take that Sustainable Living Bus !

Here ’s Rick Davis explaining that he did n’t lobby for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for $ 2 million .
He only headed up the lobbying organization .
He did n’t lobby , just ran the lobbying organization .
This is from the McCain conference call this morning .
And following Davis , here ’s McCain enforcer Steve Schmidt .
He realizes Davis ’s answer is laughable .
So he does n’t even try to defend Davis and launches off on the Times ( note : audio has had spittle removed for your protection ) …
Getting pegged as liars makes Schmidt and Davis really , really mad .
Late Update : For more on why Davis and Schmidt are upset , note the quote from the former Fannie Mae spokesman who notes that Davis “ did n’t really do anything ” for the money .
“ The value that he brought to the relationship was the closeness to Senator McCain and the possibility that Senator McCain was going to run for president again . ”

Public Service Announcement
It occurred to me today that voter registration deadlines are going to start coming up soon , and that that being the case , it might be a good idea for someone to post them .
And since I am the change I ’ve been waiting for , I thought : why not me ?
After all , some of my readers might inexplicably have failed to register to vote , and others might feel like going out and doing voter registration but not have gotten around to it yet .
So , below the fold , I have posted the deadlines for all the states and DC .
I put links to the actual calendars ; do check them , since while I did try to be careful , I ’d hate for some typo of mine to disenfranchise anyone .
The Obama and McCain campaigns can probably set you up to do voter registration .
On the Obama site , if you do n’t want to do it in your area , click here , then click the state you ’re interested in , and you will be able to find its various campaign offices .
( Useful for people like me , who live in safe states and within driving distance of swing states . )
[ UPDATE : On closer inspection , it ’s only really easy to find your local office in some states .
All have lots of info on events , etc. , but not all have the useful ‘ Find your local office ’ button on the right , under ‘ Take Action ’ .
The ones with the useful button seem to be swing states , as one would expect .

Forget about plastic bags and turning down the thermostat - the real cause of global warming is , as you may have heard before , cow farts ( do n't tell them , but I do n't think it 's just the cows - I might be partially responsible ) .
Basically it seems ( from my skim reading of this piece ) that the profligate luxurious living of our generation is taking down the environment , and unless we all cut back on meat and milk and go back to the ways of our grandparents .
Good luck persuading people about this one .
Once again I can only conclude that the world is fucked .
We 've got used to living like medieval kings , eating meat every day and getting exotic fruits flown in , for us to let go rotten in the bowl and then throw away .
I just can't see people going back on this .
Not just the consumers , but is Macdonald 's really going to cut back on the beef ?
Are you going to be happy drinking a litre of milk a week ?
Would you go back to rationing ?
No you wo n't .
Not even to save the world .
Because you 've got too used to consuming stuff and then chucking it away when it breaks and you 're not going to change even if the sky starts falling in ( which by the way , wo n't happen even in the worst case scenarios ) .
Perhaps the credit crunch will hit us so hard that we 'll be sent back to Amish times and by 2009 we 'll be driving around in carts and using grain towers as methods of execution .
Who'd have thought that the Amish had the right idea all along .
The Amish and the vegetarians .
Though we 'll probably have to get rid of the animals all together , which I do n't think is what they actually wanted .
Maybe we should just start with the flatulent men .
Because my guess is it is them who are eating too much meat and rich food .
So if we just take them out then the atmosphere will clear up and food will be simpler and maybe a few of the cows and sheep can live .
I do n't know why I am advocating this policy , because if they start killing flatulent men then I will be first against the wall .
Though with a bit of luck I 'll manage to blow a hole in the wall and escape before they shoot me .
Nothing much happened today .
I suspect you did n't need me to tell you that .
Obama - baiter of the moment Joe the Plumber has signed up with a PR company specialising in country music
It truly is the American dream in action .
Just three weeks after gaining the world 's attention by challenging Barack Obama over his tax proposals on an Ohio street , Joe the Plumber is a household name , with his very own PR agent and now … a record deal ?
The American website Politico claims that Joe the Plumber , who does not have a plumbing licence and is not actually called Joe , is being " pursued for a major record deal . "
The article states that Joe , real name Sam Wurzelbacher , has " just signed with a Nashville public relations and management firm to handle interview requests and media appearances , as well as create new career opportunities , including a shift out of the plumbing trade into stage and studio performances . "
Wurzelbacher 's new representative Jim Della Croce says he plans to extend the brand of " Joe the Plumber " beyond the allotted 15 minutes of fame .
" He is a dynamic speaker and an everyman who has become an overnight celebrity , " said Croce .
" It 's going to be our job to find Joe 's strengths and give him some options . "
Though the specifics of the " record deal " are not made clear , Della Croce does have form in the music industry .
He represents numerous country artists , including Aaron Tippin , who formed a friendship with Wurzelbacher when both appeared on Fox News .
But can he sing ?
According to Politico , Wurzelbacher is " a long - time country music fan " who " knocks around on the guitar . "
And in a country where Sarah Palin could find herself a heartbeat away from the presidency , these meagre qualifications are probably more than enough to secure Joe the Plumber a five - album deal .
Several years ago I was privy to a conversation that did n't make much sense to me .
The topic was whether or not PCs could be sold like cars , by model year instead of focusing on specs .
The holy grail of PC sales has always been distilling the myriad of system specifications down to a simple , easy to understand number .
Intel used to offer its iCOMP rating for microprocessors on PCs sold in stores , benchmarks like 3D Mark have attempted to do the same thing as well .
It 'd be far easier however if consumers simply purchased based on model year ; buying a 2008 model year PC would be better and faster than a 2007 .
The idea obviously did n't go anywhere and it did n't make a whole lot of sense to me given that , unlike cars , computers are generally not as emotional of a purchase .
I think Apple has managed to change that .
Nearly every year or so we get a redesigned Mac , iMac or MacBook , and in many cases while they are no faster than their predecessor - they introduce one or two new features or a new design that makes you want them , with all logic cast aside .
It 's a lot like buying a car .
Apple sells its computers not only based on functionality , but largely based on the form and design .
Now all manufacturers do this to an extent , it 's just that none of the mainstream PC OEMs do it as much or as well as Apple .
Apple 's focus on design makes a lot of sense .
All PCs can be created equal , these days Apple and Dell use the same components , so the only differences that Apple has to play with are the OS and the design .
Thus investing more money into the OS and system design is the right move for a company like Apple .
The MacBook , MacBook Air and MacBook Pro
Last week Apple announced its updated MacBook , MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lineup .
As expected the changes were largely aesthetic and the new machines look great .
But there were also some pretty significant departures under the hood , thus giving me something to do here other than comment on how the curved corners are nice to pet .
There are benchmarks to be run , battery life to be tested and something very unexpected to uncover about OS X vs. Vista at the end .
I wo n't dilly dally for too long here , so let 's get right to it .
Design Changes / Build Quality
It turns out that all of the extra money Apple is spending on its notebooks goes into materials and build quality .
It looks like there are two areas where that money is used : the aluminum chassis and the glass display cover .
The MacBook and MacBook Pro are now made like the MacBook Air : carved out of a single piece of aluminum .
That 's actually a bit misleading , there are multiple pieces of aluminum that go into the construction of these things , but looking at the keyboard from above you see a single block of aluminum that has been shaped to look like a MacBook .
The PowerBook G4 and the first MacBooks had the keyboard built into a piece of aluminum that sat on top and there was another piece of aluminum that made up the bottom half of the notebook .
The two screwed / snapped together and what you had was an aluminum notebook .
The old MacBook Pro ( left ) vs. the new MacBook Pro ( right ) , note how the old MBP does n't fit together nearly as well as the new one
With the new MacBook / MacBook Pro , Apple has effectively flipped its manufacturing process upside down .
Instead of having a bottom that curves upwards and is capped off with a keyboard , the new models have a top that curves downwards with two plates that cover the bottom .
The distinction is subtle but the difference is noticeable .
Rounded corners , it 's like a big MacBook Air. Cute .
Rigidity is one of the biggest factors in making a notebook feel like it 's well built .
This is one of the things that IBM got very right with its Thinkpads early on , and something that Apple honestly did an incredible job with on the MacBook Air .
The problem with building light notebooks is that the lighter you go , the flimsier the materials and the worse they hold up over time .
By making sure the part you come in contact with the most is made out of a single piece of aluminum , Apple helps convey a sturdier built product .
Look ma , no latches !
Also gone is the bothersome latch from the MacBook Pro , the screen magnetically attaches to the keyboard surface when you close it .
The latch on the old MBP was the cheapest feeling part of the machine , so I 'm glad they fixed it .
The old latch , ugh .
Apple also made it easier to access the hard drive on these things , there 's a nifty removable panel underneath the notebook that unlatches without a single screw .
With the cover removed you can replace the battery or , after removing a single screw , remove the hard drive ( you 'll need to take out four more screws to actually swap out the drive though ) .
This is n't quite as easy as the removable HDD trays you 'd find in a Dell , but it does look better .
The design is far from perfect however , the new battery / HDD cover tends to rattle and definitely reduces the solid feeling of the notebook .
Thankfully the parts of the notebook you interact with the most feel the most solid , it 's just worth pointing out the imperfections .
Look out , bad boys .
OnStar has just launched its Stolen Vehicle Slowdown Service , which tracks a vehicle that has been reported stolen , contacts authorities , and , if the vehicle is still being driven when the authorities catch up to it , cuts power to the vehicle so that the cops can nab the bad guy .
OnStar has offered a stolen - vehicle tracking system for years ; this service is the latest evolution of the technology .
When a vehicle is reported stolen , OnStar can use the vehicle ’s GPS to pinpoint its location and report it to the local authorities .
When the cops catch up to the stolen car , identify it , and verify that the coast is clear , OnStar sends a message to the car to flick on the four - way flashers ( which is not indicated inside the vehicle ) and gradually reduce engine power to an idle but retain power to the brakes and steering system so that the confused thief can pull the car over — and presumably try to either find his weapon , hide his stash , or both .
This new technology represents one more cool OnStar application , and we think it will be all sorts of fun to see dash - cam recordings of furious thieves having just been outmaneuvered by OnStar operators working in call centers hundreds of miles away .
There are , however , ominous , Orwellian overtones to the idea that all someone can stop your car with a phone call .
How long before OnStar ’s service - update e-mails start to include traffic infractions from every speed trap you pass ?

Private investor / capitalist extraordinaire George Soros has a suggestion for the Treasury Department and Congress — think before you act .
Soros goes on to propose an alternative to the existing discretionary bailout plan : a recapitalization of the banking system , injecting “ high - powered ” equity capital into banks — not a blank check for the culprits .
Dig out Wikipedia , it ’s Econ -101 time .
George Soros in the Financial Times :
The emergency legislation currently before Congress was ill - conceived – or more accurately , not conceived at all .
As Congress tried to improve what Treasury originally requested , an amalgam plan has emerged that consists of Treasury ’s original Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( Tarp ) and a quite different capital infusion programme in which the government invests and stabilises weakened banks and profits from the economy ’s eventual improvement .
The capital infusion approach will cost tax payers less in future years , and may even make money for them .
Two weeks ago the Treasury did not have a plan ready – that is why it had to ask for total discretion in spending the money .
But the general idea was to bring relief to the banking system by relieving banks of their toxic securities and parking them in a government - owned fund so that they would not be dumped on the market at distressed prices .
With the value of their investments stabilised , banks would then be able to raise equity capital .
The idea was fraught with difficulties .
The toxic securities in question are not homogenous and in any auction process the sellers are liable to dump the dregs on to the government fund .
Moreover , the scheme addresses only one half of the underlying problem – the lack of credit availability .
It does very little to enable house owners to meet their mortgage obligations and it does not address the foreclosure problem .
With house prices not yet at the bottom , if the government bids up the price of mortgage backed securities , the taxpayers are liable to loose ; but if the government does not pay up , the banking system does not experience much relief and cannot attract equity capital from the private sector .

Even though polls are showing that the American people find the McCain less and less credible as a candidate as he focuses more and more on smearing Obama and not on what concerns them , that does n't stop the McCain Media Brigade from trying to spin his desperate and flailing campaign choices .
On last night 's Anderson Cooper 360 , David Gergen tries to spin that while the NY Times ( accusing McCain of race baiting ) had some validity , really , McCain is n't that desperate , because he did n't bring up Ayers at the debate :
GERGEN : I think the New York Times has a serious point and should be considered .
The good news , Anderson , is that over the past twenty four hours or so , there have been very encouraging signs from John McCain himself .
You know he did not bring up Bill Ayers last night .
He has put Reverend Wright off limits , for his campaign and after the debate last night , his top aides told Politico that he did not intend to bring up Bill Ayers .
He was n't going to go down that road and he wanted to keep Reverend Wright off the ... out of the campaign .
The issue has been what 's been going on at Sarah Palin 's rallies .
That 's where the real trouble is because it's ... it's the combination of her rhetoric -- which is whipping up these crowds -- and these ugly scenes that have occurred at these rallies .
When Obama 's name came up , has been used it not only brought these boos but , you know we have reports now of somebody yelling out " terrorist ! " about Obama .
At another rally , someone yelling out " kill him , kill him " .
And at another rally the ... you have people shouting racial epithets .
COOPER : You can't control though what people say in a crowd , can you , David ?
GERGEN : Yes .
You can , and it's ... Yes .
It 's up , it 's up to the , Sarah Palin , at her rally and for John McCain to tell her if she does n't start doing this to stop right there and take issue with what 's been said and say this has no place in our campaign and we do not condone this and please let 's show more respect .
I think it 's up to her .

And again I think we should give credit to John McCain for not going down this road himself last night in the debate and for making it clear he does n't want to go down the road in the next few days .

In some ways , it was n't a fair contest .
John McCain was facing not one but two opponents .
One was the Democratic nominee sitting on the bar stool across the red-carpeted stage from him .
The other was his own veep nominee - who drew 70 million viewers to her debate against Joe Biden last week .
For McCain to " win " , Obama would 've had to slip on a banana peel during one of his ambles - whether rhetorical or actual .
He did n't come close .
Andrew Romano , Newsweek.com Status quo in Nashville Debate as it happened
Sarah Palin understood clearly the techniques that work on television .
The substance is not what matters most ; rather it 's the optics , and the angles , and the ability to project affability and warmth through the lens of the camera perched over the moderator 's shoulder .
That lesson was lost on John McCain in Nashville on Wednesday , who seemed to think that a town hall debate on television was the same as a town hall debate in a real town hall .
He paced up and down in fits and starts as he spoke .
He leapt from subject to subject , soundbite to soundbite .
Between answers , he sat down and scribbled page after page of notes , then jumped up and paced around silently .
Early on , he seemed ill at ease in engaging with his questioners ; how close should he stand ?
And how much should he look at them ?
His approach seemed to present a serious challenge to the show 's producers , as they struggled to find the best way to frame McCain 's interactions .
There was no questioning the Republican nominee 's energy level ; he seemed to have enough pent - up force to power a sub-station .
Pressure on McCain Barack Obama , by contrast , barely touched his note pad , sat firmly in his seat when he was n't answering , picked a spot to stand in addressing his questioner and stuck to it .
He did n't light the place up with his energy level , and critics will maintain that his cool demeanour still does n't connect with Main Street voters .
But he moved easily about the stage , and seemed far more comfortable without a podium than his rival did .
Which is unusual , given McCain 's professed love of the town - hall setting .
It was the McCain camp , after all , that had proposed a town - hall forum every week during early discussions about the debate schedule .
Despite McCain 's attacks , Obama seemed more at ease Given the instant polls gauging the outcome Tuesday night , McCain ought to be grateful that Obama said no : a CNN poll showed a 24 - point lead for Obama .
Heading into the showdown in Nashville , the pressure was largely on McCain .
Trailing in national polls and in a number of the key battleground states , he knew he needed to play up his national security credentials , raise questions about Obama 's experience - and try to reverse voters ' rising confidence in the Democratic Party 's ability to address their economic concerns .
He came out swinging , as he had done in the first debate .
He bashed Obama on earmarks , and hit him again over his diplomatic posture vis-a - vis talks with Iran .
But at times , McCain seemed to sense that the audience might not be buying it - as though he was aware of the risks of attacking when many surveys suggest that the blows have driven his own negatives up .
Addressing a question that touched on the Bush administration 's energy legislation , he said : " By the way , my friends , I know you grow a little weary with this back and forth .
It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies , and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney .
You know who voted for it ?
You might never know .
That one , " McCain said , pointing to Obama .
" You know who voted against it ?
Me . "
With that , he grinned like he'd just hit the jackpot on the slots .
Family values Obama smiled through the attacks , but he was less generous with his praise than he'd been during their previous meeting in Mississippi .
Gone were the frequent nods to " John " being " right " , or absolutely right , on a whole host of issues .
At one point , he feinted in that direction , allowing that his opponent regarded him as " green behind the ears " ( cliche police : that 's green , senator , or wet behind the ears ) .
But even as McCain called out a thank you , Obama wheeled and stuck in the shiv , reminding audiences that the supposedly mature one on stage had been the guy who once sang " Bomb Iran " to the tune of a Beach Boys ditty , and called for the " annihilation of North Korea . "
Obama also seemed determined to defuse another line of criticism - that he fails to connect with voters on a personal and emotional level .
He talked about how his mother had scrapped with insurance companies on her death bed , how the family had been on food stamps , and how his grandmother scrimped so that the family could afford to give him a first - class education .
And he sought to express empathy with his questioners as they described their own financial struggles .
He hardly rivalled Bill Clinton 's ability to feel their pain - but he did express some of his own .
McCain remains a formidable presence - a tough debater relentlessly on the attack .
But he needed a knockdown Tuesday night to help change the narrative of the campaign .
At the end , Obama was still standing , and smiling .
On to Round Three .

Both rockets will operate from SLC - 40 , and payloads to Earth and Geostationary orbits and beyond will include commercial satellites , cargo and crew supply missions to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , and future orbiting destinations .
As a winner of the International Space Station ( ISS ) when the Space Shuttle retires in 2010 .

As the only COTS contender with the capability to return cargo and crew to Earth , ISS .
Founded in 2002 , the In its press release dated September 9 , 2008 ( see below ) , Space Exploration Technologies Corp . ( SpaceX ) disclosed that it had been granted an Operational License from the US Air Force for the use of Space Launch Complex 40 ( SLC - 40 ) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the Florida coast .
This marks a significant breakthrough for a private company to use a US government facilities for development , testing , and future commercial space flights , something that private industry has been working for over the years .
Some have referred to this as the “ stranglehold ” NASA has wielded over the commercial development by limiting contracts for major vehicles , propulsion and guidance systems , and launch / recovery facilities to the major corporations such as Boeing , et al. , all under the NASA umbrella .
SpaceX was the winner of the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) competition and is now in a position to help fill the gap in US spaceflight to the ) when the Space Shuttle retires in 2010 .
SpaceX has developed three vehicles — Falcon 1 , designed for small satellite and other payloads , and Falcon 9 and Falcon 9
Heavy for large payloads and human crew , and the human crew / cargo capsule named Dragon .
Development of Falcon 9
Heavy will be expedited because it uses the same engines as Falcon 9 and needs only additional structural modifications that have already been engineered .
Despite three Falcon 1 launch mishaps , SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is confident that , like Thomas Edison who said “ I have not failed .
I 've just found 10,000 ways that wo n't work , ” the problems with the Falcon 1 stage separation have been identified and will be fixed before the next launch .
Falcon 9 uses nine liquid oxygen / rocket grade kerosene fueled engines ( hence the name “ Falcon 9 ” ) which were successfully tested at full power at its Texas Test Facility outside McGregor , TX on July 30th .
A second firing on August 1st completed a major NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) milestone almost two months early .
Further evidence of real progress toward successful commercial operation lies in work already completed at Cape Canaveral .
A huge oxygen storage tank has been moved to SLC - 40 , and Brian Mosdell , Director of Florida Launch Operations for SpaceX said “ …we expect to complete construction of our hangar later this year .
” The fourth test launch of Falcon 1 is scheduled for September or October 2008 from the Kwajalein Pacific island launch site , with the first test flight of Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral before the end of 2008 .
Far from the usual enthusiastic speculation and ambitious promises , SpaceX appears to have taken serious realistic steps toward commercial operations in the next frontier .
PRESS RELEASECAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . -- ( Business Wire ) -- Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ( SpaceX ) has been granted an Operational License by the US Air Force for the use of Space Launch Complex 40 ( SLC - 40 ) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the Florida coast .
Receipt of the license , in conjunction with the approved Site Plan , paves the way for SpaceX to initiate Falcon 9 launch operations later this year .
" We are developing Falcon 9 to be a valuable asset to the American space launch fleet , " said Elon Musk , CEO and CTO of SpaceX .
" The support we received from General Helms and the US Air Force has been immensely helpful in developing the pathfinder processes necessary for SpaceX to realize commercial space flights from the Cape .
" " Our developments at Complex 40 continue with great speed , " added Brian Mosdell , Director of Florida Launch Operations for SpaceX .
" We have moved our massive oxygen storage tank into place , and expect to complete construction of our hangar later this year .
" Mosdell cited other supporters instrumental to SpaceX 's efforts including the members of the Florida congressional delegation , the USAF Space Command , Col. Scott Henderson , Commander , 45th Launch Group , Col. ( ret. )
Mark Bontrager , formerly Commander of the 45th Mission Support Group , the public - private partnership Space Florida , and the Space Coast Economic Development Commission .
In operation since 1965 , and located south of NASA 's launch sites for the Apollo moon missions and Space Shuttle flights , SLC - 40 has hosted numerous historic launches , including the departure of two interplanetary missions : the Mars Observer satellite , and the Cassini spacecraft now exploring the rings and moons of the planet Saturn .
SpaceX is developing a family of launch vehicles , Falcon 1 , Falcon 9 and Falcon 9
Heavy , to increase the reliability and cost effectiveness of both manned and unmanned space transportation , ultimately by a factor of ten .
Falcon 9 is a two - stage , liquid oxygen and rocket grade kerosene powered launch vehicle , offering breakthrough reliability derived from the nine - engine , single tank first stage configuration .
Falcon 9 is the first American launch vehicle since the Saturn V to offer true engine out redundancy and reliability .
Falcon 9 can deliver up to 12,500 kg to low Earth orbit ( ) and 4,640 kg to Geostationary Transfer Orbit ( GTO ) , while the Falcon 9 Heavy can loft 29,610 kg to and 15,010 kg to GTO .

As a winner of the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition ( COTS ) , SpaceX is in a position to help fill the gap in U.S. spaceflight to the ) when the Space Shuttle retires in 2010 .
Under the existing Agreement , SpaceX will conduct three flights of its Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft for NASA , culminating in Dragon berthing with the .
As the only COTS contender with the capability to return cargo and crew to Earth , NASA also has an option for SpaceX to demonstrate crew transport services to the Founded in 2002 , the SpaceX team now numbers more than 500 , located primarily in Hawthorne , California , with four additional locations : SpaceX 's Texas Test Facility in McGregor near Waco ; offices in Washington DC ; and launch facilities at Cape Canaveral , Florida ; and the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific .
The SpaceX manifest currently lists 11 missions , plus indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity ( IDIQ ) contracts with NASA and the US Air Force .
