The Hollensbury Spite House
The Richardson Spite House
The Skinny House
The Edleston Spite House
The Tyler Spite House
Human emotion is a crazy thing .
It can lead people to do irrational , silly and even spiteful things .
So spiteful , in fact , they would erect an entire house just to irritate someone .
A spite house is exactly what it sounds like – a building that was built or altered for the sole purpose of exacting revenge .
A person would have to be pretty seriously spiteful to spend the time , effort and money to construct a whole building in the name of anger .
Let 's look at a few edifices that were born out of those emotions .
I can imagine that in 1830 , having horses constantly trod near your house would get pretty irritating .
The noise , for one thing , but all of those road apples being dropped would n't be too pleasant , either .
And that 's exactly how John Hollensbury of Alexandria , Va. , felt about the alley next to his house that constantly received horse and foot traffic .
So , to prevent people from using the alley , he built a seven - foot wide , 25 - foot deep , two - story house .
He actually used one wall of the existing house to construct the new house , so as a result the living room of the Spite House has deep gouges in the brick wall from the wheels of carriages brushing up against it .

In Manhattan , at Lexington and 82nd , imagine a tiny apartment building created just to tick someone off .
In 1882 , two neighbors each owned a small plot of adjacent land .
Each plot was only about 104 feet long and five feet wide .
One of the men , Hyman Sarner , offered to purchase the land from his neighbor , Joseph Richardson , for $ 1,000 .
Richardson countered that the land was worth at least $ 5,000 .
When they failed to reach an agreement , Richardson built a rather impractical four - story apartment building on his tiny rectangle of land .
It was demolished in 1915 , unfortunately – I 'd love to see that tiny little apartment building dwarfed by the huge buildings and museums near 82nd and Lex today .
I bet the rent would be outrageous .
The Skinny House in Boston is pretty well - known , at least in the area .
The story goes that in 1874 , a couple of brothers had a fight over the land they had jointly inherited from their father .
Instead of properly settling the fight , one brother built a large home on the land while the other brother was away in the military .
When the traveling brother returned home , he decided to spite his greedy brother and build a small house on what was left of the land they both owned , blocking his brother 's nice view .
It still stands today and is occupied .
At its widest point , the Skinny House is just over 10 feet wide .
The narrowest point in the house is only 6.2 feet wide .
Spiteful construction might seem like an American phenomenon , but it 's really not .
England has seen its share of spite as well .
In 1904 , the Edleston family owned a plot of land next to the church yard of St. Mary 's in Gainford , England , where they attended church .
When Joseph died , the family asked to build a monument in the churchyard in Joseph 's memory – he was a very active member of the church and had been for 41 years .
The church said that the churchyard was already too full , but that the family could donate their land to the church and build something on that .
Irked , the family built a house on the land next to the church , complete with a 40 foot column that pointed a V - sign ( victory ? ) toward the church .
The house is still there today , although I unfortunately could n't find any pictures of it .
You 've been reading these and thinking " That 's great , but what I would really like to do is spend the night in a spite house , " have n't you ?
Well , you 're in luck .
The Tyler Spite House in Frederick , Md. , is now a bed and breakfast .
In 1814 , Dr. John Tyler was the first American physician to perform a cataract operation .
When the city made plans to extend a street directly through Tyler 's land , he did a little research and found that a local law prohibited building a road if work was under way on a " substantial " building in the path of the new road .
He found this law just in time – he immediately had a building foundation poured on the small piece of his property that the new road would run through and effectively stopped the road from being built .
Ten days ago , I noted the reckless assertion of Barack Obama ’s former pastor that the United States government had deliberately engineered AIDS to kill blacks , but I tried to put it in context by citing a poll showing that 30 percent of African - Americans believe such a plot is at least plausible .
My point was that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright is not the far - out fringe figure that many whites assume .
But I had a deluge of e-mail from incredulous whites saying , in effect :
If 30 percent of blacks believe such bunk , then that ’s a worse scandal than anything Mr. Wright said .
It ’s true that conspiracy theories are a bane of the African - American community .
Perhaps partly as a legacy of slavery , Tuskegee and Jim Crow , many blacks are convinced that crack cocaine was a government plot to harm African - Americans and that the levees in New Orleans were deliberately opened to destroy black neighborhoods .
White readers expressed shock ( and a hint of smugness ) at these delusions , but the sad reality is that conspiracy theories and irrationality are n’t a black problem .
They are an American problem .
“ He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation , and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation . ” ~ Declaration of Independence
Like the German mercenaries known as the Hessians who fought with the British against Americans in the Revolutionary War , soÂ now American mercenaries Â are coming to a country near you .
Since 9/11 , the United States has granted citizenship to over 32,000 foreign soldiers .
Thanks to a generous citizenship to foreigners plan , about 8,000 foreigners join the U.S. military every year .
Then we transport these “ large armies of foreign mercenaries ” overseas to do our dirty work .
Last week plenty of rumors were floating around about a potential Microsoft / Netflix partnership .
The announcement was supposedly going to happen during the keynote address ( by Xbox Live exec John Schappert ) at the Game Developer ’s Conference in San Francisco last Wednesday .
The concept : make it so Netflix ’s 7,000 available “ Watch Instantly ” movies would be viewed easily on your TV via the Xbox 360 .
But sadly , this rumor did n’t prove to be accurate ( yet ) ; no such announcement was made even if the excitement surrounding the news was anything but restrained .
Just check out the comments on any of the sites I linked to above .
I could n’t find anyone thinking this possibility was a bad idea for the consumer .
Instead , there was plenty of this :
“ I do n’t even use Netflix right now , but I would sign up in a second if I could stream their catalog to my 360 !
Do it now !!! ” ( via Gizmodo )
“ I would reactivate my NetFlix account if this was going to happen soon . ” ( via Gizmodo )
“ I ’d probably sign up for Netflix again if this happens .
What about you guys ? ” ( via CrunchGear )
“ I would definitely get netflix again if I could get it over my 360 . ” ( via CrunchGear )
“ I totally agree .
I have often considered Netflix but never did it for one reason or another .
THIS , sells me . ” ( via Engadget )
“ This would force me to buy a subscription .
Do it netflix .
You ’ll be rolling in $ $ $. ” ( via Engadget )
Now , it ’s interesting to note that most comments focused on this being a benefit for Netflix ( in terms of gaining new customers ) .
Microsoft has already been renting movies through its Xbox Live service for over a year even if the catalog is pretty weak : 300 movies .
But I ’m doubting that feature has been behind many Xbox 360 purchases .
Netflix , on the other hand , currently has 7,000 movies and TV shows available via its Watch Instantly service .
That may seem small compared to the more than 90,000 DVDs in its library , but that 7,000 is on the rise and has more than doubled since the online service went live a little over a year ago .
Plus , it ’s still a much larger library than most other video - on - demand services available through cable companies .
Of course , most all the sources I quoted above include a relatively tech savvy audience already likely to have an Xbox 360 .
And I personally think the potential ( again , in terms of gaining new customers ) is just as strong for Microsoft and wanted to take the chance to agree with this MSNBC article :
“ But Netflix is a household name .
My parents have a Netflix membership .
The company has fended off ( at least so far ) competitive attempts by everyone from Wal - Mart to Blockbuster .
And it has 7.5 million subscribers , many of whom might be convinced to buy an Xbox 360 for the sheer convenience of true on - demand movies – and to not have to mail back those DVDs anymore . ” ( emphasis added ) .

In a way , you have to feel for Paul Carroll .
Not because he was busted for the minor crime of spray - painting the interior of a campus elevator .
But for what happened to him after he was charged with a gross misdemeanor .
As Matt Snyders , writing for City Pages , tells it Carroll was asked to meet with an FBI agent in a local coffee shop .
Carroll , not the vandal ’s real name , was offered an assignment by FBI Special Agent Maureen E. Mazzola , apparently her real name : to work as an informant .
For me , Carroll ’s story serves up a large dose of déjà vu , taking me momentarily back to the early 1970s when the FBI , under COINTELPRO , did this sort of stuff on a regular basis .
As an antiwar activist , I witnessed a lot of this as Nixon , the FBI , the CIA , and military intelligence attempted to “ neutralize , ” as the FBI liked to call it , people exercising their First Amendment right to petition the government .
Back in the day , as you may likely assume , such petitioning concerned the war in Vietnam , in particular Nixon ’s attack into Cambodia , which he announced on April 30 , 1970 .
A year later , a “ Citizens Committee to Investigate the FBI ” removed secret files from an FBI office in Media , Pennsylvania , and released them to the press .
In short order we learned about the FBI ’s dirty tricks , including infiltration of political groups , psychological warfare against targeted activists , harassment through the legal system , and even “ extralegal ” violence directed at dissidents , especially the Black Panthers , members of the American Indian Movement , and Puerto Rican activists .
In dealing with the latter folks , nothing was out of the ordinary , including assassination .
For instance , on December 3 , 1969 , Fred Hampton of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party was drugged by the FBI and then assassinated by the Chicago cops .
After the Citizens Committee spilled the beans on the FBI , the Church Committee was empaneled and after hearings and a published report we were told the FBI had reformed and the FBI had dismantled COINTELRPO a couple years before , in 1971 .
As members of the Church Committee discovered , under COINTELPRO ’s “ key activist ” program , specific antiwar activists were put under “ intensive investigation , ” that is to say they were to be “ neutralized , ” not for specific or prosecutable criminal acts but because they opposed the Vietnam War .
“ Neutralization , as explained on record by the FBI , does n’t necessarily pertain to the apprehension of parties in the commission of a crime , the preparation of evidence against them , and securing of a judicial conviction , but rather to simply making them incapable of engaging in political activity by whatever means , ” writes Paul Wolf .
Soon enough , though , the FBI would not need lurk around in the dark in order to betray the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
On December 4 , 1981 , Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order 12333 , essentially legalizing COINTELPRO .
According to Ross Gelbspan in his book Break - Ins , Death Threats And The FBI , activists who opposed U.S. policy in Central America “ experienced nearly 200 incidents of harassment and intimidation , many involving … break - ins and thefts or rifling of files . ”
Gelbspan is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist .
He utilized thousands of pages of FBI documents secured through the Freedom of Information Act .
In particular , according to a former FBI informant , Frank Varelli , the FBI went after CISPES , or the Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador .
The FBI found it “ imperative to formulate some plan of attack against CISPES , ” not because of its suspected involvement in terrorism or criminal activity , but because of its association with “ individuals [ deleted ] who defiantly display their contempt for the U.S. government by making speeches and propagandizing their cause , ” in other words individuals who dared exercise their First Amendment right .
And then , in the 1990s , there was “ Operation Thermcon ” ( “ Thermite Conspiracy ” ) against environmental activists , specifically Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney , victims of a car bombing allegedly pulled off by the FBI .
“ My own knowledge is that the FBI along with other Federal law enforcement agencies has been involved in a campaign of bombing , arson and terrorism in order to create in the mass public mind a connection between political dissidence of whatever stripe and revolutionaries of whatever violent tendencies , ” former FBI agent provocateur David Sannes told WBAI radio .
That was then , this is now .
Now we live in the wake of September 11 , 2001 , and a lot of people expect the government to go after terrorists , even American terrorists opposed to the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
Of course , this makes sense , as there really is a dire shortage of Muslim terrorists lurking in the shadows here in America , and besides , first and foremost the FBI has served since its inception as a political police for the government , assigned to take down opponents .
In fact , when the Justice Department created the Bureau of Investigation of its General Intelligence Division in 1919 , headed up by a young and ambitious J. Edgar Hoover , one of its first assignments was to go after anarchists and “ radical leftists . ”
This assignment was known as the Palmer Raids , named after Alexander Mitchell Palmer , Woodrow Wilson ’s AG .
Ever since , the FBI has served as a political police .
In the intervening years the CIA and military intelligence have piled on .
So this brings us back to Paul Carroll and FBI Special Agent Maureen E. Mazzola .
“ She told me that I had the perfect ‘ look , ’ ” Carroll told Snyders of City Pages .
“ And that I had the perfect personality — they kept saying I was friendly and personable — for what they were looking for . ”
And what precisely was the FBI looking for ?
“ What they were looking for , Carroll says , was an informant — someone to show up at ‘ vegan potlucks ’ throughout the Twin Cities and rub shoulders with RNC protesters , schmoozing his way into their inner circles , then reporting back to the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force , a partnership between multiple federal agencies and state and local law enforcement .
The effort ’s primary mission , according to the Minneapolis division ’s website , is to ‘ investigate terrorist acts carried out by groups or organizations which fall within the definition of terrorist groups as set forth in the current United States Attorney General Guidelines , ' ” guidelines obviously at odds with the Constitution , specifically the following , set out in the First Amendment : “ Congress shall make no law … abridging … the right of the people … to petition the Government for a redress of grievances , ” you know , grievances such as the government invading small helpless countries and killing hundreds of thousands if not millions of people .
Considering all of this , it is perfectly rational to assume there are “ perfect look ” informers and , for lack of a better word “ neutralizers , ” in the antiwar , patriot , and 9/11 truth movements , people unable or unwilling to turn down the likes of FBI Special Agent Maureen E. Mazzola and the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force , as did Mr. Carroll , or whatever his real name is .
On occasion , such people rise to the surface and reveal themselves , as a certain provocateur does every time We Are Change visits Ground Zero in New York .
In fact , it appears , at least within the ranks of the patriot and 9/11 movements , there is no shortage of “ neutralizers , ” informers , provocateurs , and disinfo agents .
As the above instance reveals , the FBI is actively attempting to recruit people to discredit and even tag as terrorists demonstrators at the RNC .
Of course , the same is underway in regard to the Democrat convention in Denver , Colorado .
It ’s called “ Recreate 68 ” and promises to rival the bloody 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and the so - called “ Days of Rage . ”
It may well do so , and thus discredit the larger antiwar movement , as the SDS and other infiltrated , compromised , and commandeered groups did in the 1960s and 70s at the behest of the government .
For as Paul Carroll ’s story sadly reveals , some things never change .

The time has come for Congress to rethink ethanol , an alternative fuel that has lately fallen from favor .
Specifically , it is time to end an outdated tax break for corn ethanol and to call a timeout in the fivefold increase in ethanol production mandated in the 2007 energy bill .
This does not mean that Congress should give up on biofuels as an important part of the effort to reduce the country ’s dependency on imported oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
What it does mean is that some biofuels are ( or are likely to be ) better than others , and that Congress should realign its tax and subsidy programs to encourage the good ones .
Unlike corn ethanol , those biofuels will not compete for the world ’s food supply and will deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gases .
Last year ’s energy bill required that 36 billion gallons of biofuels be produced annually by 2022 .
Of that , 21 billion gallons would be “ advanced ” biofuels that are still mostly in the experimental stage ; the rest would be the corn - based variety beloved by farmers , Midwestern politicians and presidential candidates .
This mandate comes on top of a 51 - cents - a - gallon subsidy to ethanol blenders enacted when the industry was small and oil prices low .
The industry is no longer small  seven billion gallons and climbing rapidly  and oil is over $ 120 a barrel , making ethanol not only competitive but a bargain .

The cycle of economic boom in China , the world 's fastest - growing major economy , would last until at least 2020 , said an expert with the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) , the top economic planner .
The cycle , which started in 1978 when the reform and opening - up drive was launched , saw the country 's economy grow 9.88 percent annually during the past 30 years , said Chen Dongqi , vice president of the NDRC's Academy of Macroeconomic Research .
" China 's economy saw a marked slow down in the first quarter as the US credit crunch bit , " Chen told a recent forum held in Nanning , capital of the southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region .
The economic growth slowed to 10.6 percent in the first quarter from 11.7 percent a year earlier , because of slower export growth and the worst winter in more than five decades .
Last year , the economy expanded 11.9 percent , the fifth year of double digit growth .
" Industrial output in the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas , the nation 's two most important growth engines , rose at an marked slower pace , " he stated .
" Many small - and medium - sized companies , particularly the exporters of low - end products , are faced with huge growth difficulties . "
The rapidly - rising yuan and raw materials and labor costs have also put the squeeze on profits of local businesses .
Chen , however , acknowledged the economy still had much room for growth despite the current negative factors .
" ( We ) do n't need to worry about the long - term economic boom just because of the short - term impact , " he said .
" The growth will be robust at least till 2020 , especially in regions such as the West and the Beibu Bay Economic Zone in Guangxi .
" The economy is rather dependent on exports , but we still have huge room to deepen and expand the opening - up , " he noted .
" The investment in the rapid urbanization process will also be a strong driver behind the economic growth . "
The expert added the rapidly growing tertiary sector and an increasingly larger proportion of the new workforce would also make bigger contributions to the economic boom .

It may surprise you to learn that Daniel Burd does not consider himself an environmentalist .
The Canadian teenager has become bit of an environmental hero over the past few days , as word of his potentially revolutionary science fair project has spread .
In case you missed it , Burd managed to isolate the naturally occurring microbes that degrade plastic bags in landfills , cutting degradation time from lifetimes to mere months .
Maybe anyone could have done it , but no one else has .
And that , says Burd , is part of what inspired him to pursue the project , which he started researching at the end of 2006 .
“ As I began to research more and more , I found out we ’re not doing too much , ” he told me in a phone call from his home in Ontario .
He is , in his words , “ just a scientist trying to solve a huge problem . ”
“ In the end , all problems come back to us , ” he says .
“ The plastic bags in the water , they do n’t dissolve , and they attract hydrophobic chemicals .
Fish or other organisms may eat polluted plastic bags , and then we have millions of marine animals dying .
If they do n’t die , then we may eat these fish , and then we have a statistical increase in healthcare problems directly attributable to that pollution .
That ’s why everybody should be concerned . ”
“ I would hope that through my project I ’m able to , first of all , show a viable solution , economical and doable , and then get people more aware of it , ” he says .
“ Then we can fix it . ”
I was n’t the first person to call Burd — far from it .
Since news of his project broke , he says that his high school and the local newspaper have been fielding constant calls from journalists , scientists , and “ concerned citizens , ” all interested in what he ’s going to do to make his discovery viable on an industrial scale .
A scientist since he first planted a tomato seed to see if it would grow , Burd says he ’s completely dedicated to pursuing the project and improving his method using some of his scholarship and prize money .
For now , however , he ’ll have to balance his continuing work with other obligations .
Like , um , high school .

Hundreds of larger and smaller ISPs all over the world try to limit BitTorrent traffic on their networks .
Unfortunately , most companies are not very open about their network management solutions , with Comcast as the prime example .
Thanks to the Glasnost project , you can now test wheter your ISP is one of the bad guys .
A while back we posted about the plugin Azureus had developed , which allowed people to check whether their ISP is interfering with their traffic .
The results showed that indeed quite a few ISPs were , but the plugin did n’t provide the user with direct feedback .
The new tool developed by the “ max planck institute for software systems ” can be used without having to run your BitTorrent client , and compares BitTorrent traffic to regular traffic .
On top of that , it will give you more information than the Azureus plugin does .
“ The goal of our Glasnost project is to make access networks , such as residential cable , DSL , and cellular broadband networks , more transparent to their customers , ” the Glasnost team writes .
We could n’t agree more of course , as we have said many times before .
The way it works is pretty straightforward .
The Java applet developed by the Glasnost project uploads and downloads data via BitTorrent for a few seconds , and compares that to your regular download speed .
It detects if your ISP is limiting all BitTorrent traffic , or just traffic on well known BitTorrent ports .
All in all this tool should be able to tell you whether your ISP is messing with BitTorrent traffic or not .
Please keep in mind that the degree of traffic shaping varies a lot between different ISPs .
Some ISPs only limit BitTorrent traffic during certain times of the day or do not throttle until the customer has exceeded a certain data threshold , others only slow down traffic in specific regions .
More advanced tools have to be developed to detect these methods .
Thus far , over 5,300 users have performed the test , and the preliminary results show that at least 10 ISPs in the United States are slowing down BitTorrent .
We asked the researcher for some more details ( names ) but we have n’t heard back from them .
However , on their website , they promise to provide more detailed results later , once the code is peer - reviewed .
We encourage you to do the test , if the test results show that your ISP is limiting BitTorrent traffic , please let us know .
We will add a lits of offenders at the bottom of this article .
The test servers seem to have limited capacity .
If it shows up as “ busy ” , please bookmark this article and try again later .

What experience and history teach is this -- that people and governments never have learned anything from history , or acted on principles .
George Wilhelm Hegel
I would like to stipulate for this essay that Barack Obama is honorable and really wants to do the right thing for this country and this world .
But I also want to go back in that so easily manipulated concept called " history . "
Barack Obama glorified the Vietnam debacle by honoring two war criminals , John McCain and Colin Powell during the coronation ceremonies in DC and he honored those who fought " for us " at Khe Sahn … so are we now officially re-writing history that Vietnam was an honorable war and that it was justified or moral in any way ?
That the 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese who were killed were killed for a " noble cause ? "
No war is honorable or noble , no matter if it is " legal or justified , " but our religion of state is WAR and the robber class 's god is PROFIT and if Obama was the stipulated honorable man of this essay he would reject it , not glorify it .
I realize how seductive the mantra of " looking forward " is and how tempting it would be to want to forget the history of the last eight years and move on from the horror , but we cannot move on when we are smack dab in the middle of the horror that has in no way alleviated , nor will , if we continue to put blinders on and not face reality to avert pending disaster .
President Obama was asked about the possibility of a truth commission to investigate the crimes of the Bush criminal regime and he said : " no one is above the law … but it is my general orientation to get it right moving forward . "
As Constitution Law Professor , Jonathan Turley said in an interview on MSNBC's Countdown about this : " if President Obama believes that no one is above the law then he cannot block a war crimes ' investigation … this is not a principled position .
If we fail to prosecute then Bush 's crimes become our crimes and Bush 's shame becomes our shame . "
We cannot ignore the history of felonious behavior being perpetrated in the highest office in our country .
We must not ignore that presidents have been allowed to commit the most detestable war crimes and crimes against humanity from the comfort of the Oval Office and then be allowed to build libraries and lead luxurious lives with stolen money when their sentence is up .
Then when the president dies we are told to mourn a " great statesmen " instead of facing the reality that he was most probably a villain .
If we continue to allow this , then we also become the war criminals .
We are living in apocalyptic ( uncovering , revealing , or widespread disaster ) times and certainly the American Dream , if not dead , is on life support and to millions of people in this country and millions more around the world , the Dream has turned into ( or has always been ) a living Nightmare .
We can not put this country back together if we continuously ignore the malignant cancer of " poverty , racism and militarism " ( Martin Luther King , Jr in his " Beyond Vietnam " speech ) that is killing us and if Barack Obama stupidly turns his back on the disease by only trying to treat the symptoms , like Professor Turley says , he is no different or better than his predecessor .
There can be no prosperity , equality , or peace without justice .
The bloodied souls of millions of people around the world are crying out for this justice .
The law is already there , it has been created to punish the Hitlers and Husseins of the world and to try and prevent the Bushes and Cheneys .
We must use it on Bush and Cheney to really prevent evil in the future .
Philosopher George Santayana also famously said this :
Those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it .
This is the history that we have been doomed , or cursed , to repeat throughout the relatively brief life of the USA :
" War , economic panic , war , economic panic , war…rinse , repeat . "
Ad nauseum … We have a unique opportunity to break this cycle , but only if we the people work together to cure the cancer once and for all .
Another meaning of " apocalypse " is when " good triumphs over evil . "
Justice is good , injustice which is followed by non-justice is a foundational evil .
Apocalypse nigh ?

While doing some research on how software companies recruit new graduates I came up with a strategy to break firms into separate categories depending on which universities they targeted for recruitment .
The results of this research threw up an interesting anomaly – while in general it followed the pattern one might expect ( “ high - prestige ” technical firms going after the best unis , defence and consultancy firms after the next tier , misc business apps the next tier , and so on ) .
However there was one notable exception to this pattern .
Microsoft .
Despite the firms bad reputation among “ geeks ” Microsoft is still a prestigious technical firm to work for , one which has a number of notable researchers and developers in a number of fields .
Yet when it comes to recruiting students Microsoft seems to have given up believing in itself and is now targeting “ average ” computer science students rather than the best and the brightest .
But before I go further I ’d like to explain my methodology .
I built up a database recording which universities are targeted by software companies and used the The Times League Table for Computer Science as a benchmark to rank computer science departments .
The actual information about where firms hire most of their graduates is unfortunately not available to the public , however we do have a good proxy measures .
We can see the universities that firms target ( i.e universities where they run recruitment talks , events , etc. ) , which due to these activities very nature is public information .
Using this information we can cluster firms together based upon the ranks of the universities they target .
To show by example :
Here we show the universities target by three “ prestigious ” technical firms ( Microsoft , Google and Data Connection ) .
Google is obviously a “ hot ” destination for Computer Science graduates and is well known for wanting to hire the smartest people .
Data Connection is a telecoms software firm with a very strong reputation in the UK for software development excellence , they ’re frequently ranked as one of the most desirable firms to work for in the UK .
The average ranking for a Computer Science department targeted by Google is 5.5 , for Data Connection a slightly higher 9.6 .
For Microsoft it ’s 36.2 .
The difference is staggering .
Google and Data Connection are targeting the top-tier of universities , Microsoft are targeting third / fourth / fifth tier unis , it ’s as if they ’ve given up on getting the best and have settled for the “ average ” in - order to avoid having to compete at the high - end .
That ’s not to say Microsoft do n’t recruit students from the top- tier , but I ’d be willing to bet they recruit a lot more from the middling unis .
And it ’s not to say that there are n’t good computer science students at the middling universities , there are .
But there are a lot more ( possibly a majority of ) “ top ” computer science students in the top - tier than the middle - tiers .
There was a time not that long ago when a number of very smart people came through the graduate recruitment of Microsoft , many of them are prominent in the field today , but it seems now that Microsoft has given up trying to hire the best and develop them into superstars .
And I think that ’s a shame for both Microsoft and the industry as a whole .
[ Incidently if any of the Google recruitment team read this – please sort out your recruitment events calendar – it ’s incredibly poorly designed and nearly impossible to use ]
Russia , China challenge US with proposal to ban space weapons David Edwards
Published : Tuesday February 12 , 2008

Print This Email This China and Russia challenged the United States at a disarmament debate Tuesday by formally presenting a plan to ban weapons in space  a proposal that Washington has called a diplomatic ploy by the two nations to gain a military advantage .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the 65 - nation Conference on Disarmament that " weapons deployment in space by one state "  a reference to the U.S.  could cause a " new spiral in the arms race both in space and on Earth . "
Lavrov 's call came with an implied threat , noting that the Soviet Union caught up with the U.S. after World War II by developing its own nuclear weapons .
" Let us not forget that the nuclear arms race was started with a view to preserving a monopoly of this type of weapon , " Lavrov said .
" But this monopoly was to last only four years . "
" Without preventing an arms race in space , international security will be wanting , " Lavrov told the conference .
" The task of preventing an arms race in space is on the conference 's agenda .
It 's time ... to start serious practical work in this field . "
Concerns over a new arms race in space have been growing since China tested an anti-satellite missile last January , sparking a diplomatic outcry .
The United States also has its own anti-satellite programme ranging from laser cannon to satellite destroying missiles .
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 bans the build up or stockage of military weapons -- including nuclear arms or weapons of mass destruction -- in orbit and their installation on the moon , but not the shooting down of satellites .
" Weapons deployment in space by one state will inevitably result in a chain reaction .
And this , in turn , is fraught with a new spiral in the arms race both in space and on the earth , " Lavrov said .
The Russian minister also reiterated his criticisms of the United States 's plans for an anti-missile shield in Europe .
" We can not but feel concerned over the situation where ... there are increasing efforts by the United States to deploy its global ABM ( anti- ballistic missile ) system , " Lavrov said .
" The desire to acquire an anti-missile ' shield ' while dismantling the ' sheath ' , where the nuclear ' sword ' is kept is extremely dangerous , " he added .
Washington is currently negotiating with Warsaw and Prague on the possible installation of 10 interceptor missile sites in Poland by 2012 and associated radar stations in the Czech Republic .
The US says the sites are needed as part of a gradually - developing shield to ward off potential attacks by what it calls " rogue states , " notably Iran .

Obama 's gains
A pretty stunning gain out of Iowa for Obama , where an Iowa Democratic official confirmed to me just now that the county convention results will translate into a 25 - 14 - 6 edge for Obama over Clinton and Edwards .
That 's a gain of nine for the Illinois senator over the results reported in January , while Clinton lost one delegate .
( Edwards lost eight . )
It 's a welcome — and meaningful — gain for Obama on a tough weekend , and a result both of his long , hard work in Iowa and of a situation in which Clinton 's attacks seem to be turning off party activists .
An anonymous reader points out an article up at Science News on a question that , remarkably , is still being debated after a few thousand years : is mathematics discovered , or is it invented ?
Those who answer " discovered " are the intellectual descendants of Plato ; their number includes Roger Penrose .
The article notes that one difficulty with the Platonic view : if mathematical ideas exist in some way independent of humans or minds , then human minds engaged in doing mathematics must somehow be able to connect with this non-physical state .
The European Mathematical Society recently devoted space to the debate .
One of the papers , Let Platonism die , can be found on page 24 of this PDF .
The author believes that Platonism " has more in common with mystical religions than with modern science . "
Clinton in ' largely symbolic ' win in West Virginia RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 13 , 2008

Print This Email This CHARLESTON , W.Va . - Hillary Rodham Clinton reached out for a largely symbolic victory in the West Virginia primary Tuesday over Barack Obama , front - runner in a historic Democratic presidential race nearing an end .
Shortly after polls closed at 7:30 PM
Eastern , major media declared victory for Clinton .
CNN described her win as " impressive " in its margin , but noted that the result would not put a significant dent in Obama 's considerable delegate lead .
With 97 percent of precincts reporting , Clinton was ahead 67 % - 26 % with over 232,000 votes to Obama 's 89,000 .
Obama conceded defeat in advance in the state , looking ahead to the Oregon primary later in the month and the campaign against John McCain .
" This is our chance to build a new majority of Democrats and independents and Republicans who know that four more years of George Bush just wo n't do , " he said at a campaign appearance in Missouri , which looms as a battleground state in the fall .
" This is our moment to turn the page on the divisions and distractions that pass for politics in Washington , " added the man seeking to become the fist black presidential nominee of a major party .
Interviews with West Virginians leaving their polling places showed an overwhelmingly white electorate comprised of the kinds of voters who favored Clinton in past primaries .
Nearly a quarter were 60 or older , and a similar number had no education beyond high school .
More than half were in families with incomes of $ 50,000 or less .
Clinton 's aides contended that her strength with blue collar voters  already demonstrated in Ohio , Pennsylvania and Indiana  made her the more electable candidate in the fall .
Even before the polls closed , spokesman Mo Elleithee said the primary showed voters " do n't want to be told that this thing is over .
The people of West Virginia rejected the rush to call this thing over .
They sent a very clear message tonight that Hillary Clinton is the best person to take on John McCain in the fall . "
West Virginia had 28 delegates at stake , to be awarded proportionally according to the popular vote .
The delegate tally aside , the former first lady struggled to overcome an emerging Democratic consensus that Obama effectively wrapped up the nomination last week with a victory in the North Carolina primary and a narrow loss in Indiana .
He picked up four superdelegates during the day , including Roy Romer , former Democratic Party chairman .
" This race , I believe , is over , " Romer told reporters on a conference call .
He said only Clinton can decide when to withdraw , but he added : " There is a time we need to end it and direct ourselves to the general election .
I think that time is now . "
Clinton and Obama briefly shook hands on the Senate floor Tuesday after interrupting their campaigns for a few hours to vote on energy - related bills .
With wire services .
Something 's been bugging me for a little while .
I was n't able to put my finger on it exactly , but I think it 's getting clearer recently .
The election season has brought it out into the light .
What is it , you ask ?
It 's the " regular guy " thing .
Chris Matthews of MSNBC is particularly useful in illustrating this point as he takes pride in his regular guy credentials .
He talks about his Philadelphia roots and loves the people who " tell it like it is . "
It 's a kind of homage to the Philly brand of blue collar , street vendor coffee , hockey jersey wearing , bar stool street cred that turns Matthews on .
There 's a different version of this regular guy myth depending on where your from , but it 's out there .
It 's more than that though .
The other half of the equation is the imaginary formula that constitutes irregular guyness or non-regular guyness , or however you 'd like to put it .
If you have a job in an office , drink coffee from Starbucks , wear a polo shirt on weekends , and drink wine with your dinner you 're some kind of " namby pamby " wuss .
At least , that 's the implication .
You do n't count for a real , down to earth , honest to goodness opinion on the " stuff that really matters . "
The problem with the " regular guy " theorists , like Matthews , is that they disdain the elitist , intellectual , white collar sensibility but set up an elitist position of their own in doing so .
In effect , they are the grand champions of the dumbing down of the American middle class .
Speaking in terms of the properties of media , television works best when it sets up either / or propositions .
It deals with issues in black and white , setting up false choices at every turn .
In that respect it serves propagandists and PR specialists perfectly because it narrows our perspective and sets us up in a position of extreme polarization .
Wonder why we have red and blue states ?
Thank you CNN .
George Bush is a " regular guy " because he clears brush , talks kinda dumb , and used to be an alcoholic .
Al Gore was a latte - drinking , Prius driver " non-regular guy " cause he likes to answer questions and stuff .
The ultimate sign of a non-regular guy ?
Nobel Prize .
Ed Rendell is a regular guy cause he looks kind of burly , " tells it like it is " , and does n't care what people think about it .
Barack Obama is n't a regular guy because he can't bowl , speaks real good , and was President of the Harvard Law Review .
Forget Hillary Clinton .
Women obviously can't be regular guys , but whatever the equivalent might be for them it must include taking no offense to being called " honey " or " dear " by regular guys .
The way I see it , the whole phenomenon is a direct result of the extreme reliance on demographics in marketing , advertising , and politics .
In order to capitalize on trends in spending we 've become slaves to targeted messaging that defines the boundaries of personal identity .
While ad execs are busy dissecting the psyche of every possible sub -group of American society , they are also reinforcing the psychological boundaries of identity that they seek to understand .
It works perfectly for an industry that wants to identify and hold a particular audience in place in order to target it most effectively .
This works to define identity in general , but reserves a particularly insidious place when it comes to politics .
The excellent book " What 's the Matter with Kansas ? " by Thomas Frank describes the phenomenon very well , saying :
" Over the last thirty - five years the Republicans have transformed themselves from an aristocratic minority into the nation 's dominant political party , a brawling , beer - drinking buddy of the working man .
The strategy by which they have won this triumph is instantly familiar and yet so bizarre it 's sometimes hard to believe it 's actually happened :
Think of Richard Nixon extolling the virtues of the " silent majority , " or Ronald Reagan shaking his head at those crazy college professors , or George W. Bush sticking up for the " regular Americans , " or the army of pundits who have written so eloquently in recent months about the humble folk of the " red states . " "
That quote identifies the shift in the political environment perfectly , except that I think it overly emphasizes the Republican identity .
Yes , the GOP managed to take control of the electorate using this strategy to convince blue collar America to abandon the labor union , embrace cultural identity , and vote against their own economic interest .
The entire political landscape is now dominated by this line of thinking from Republican to Democrat and everywhere in between .
In fact , the Lou Dobbs brand of everyday man mythology targets the large number of independent voters who are disillusioned by the whole process .
In an age when everything is branded , packaged , marketed , targeted , spun , and carefully managed the ultimate quest for authenticity is the defining characteristic of our modern world .
The irony is , the definition of authenticity takes place by the identical process used to brand , package , market , target , spin , and carefully manage everything else .
Authenticity is now the province of the mass media .
I 'm on the cusp of my first graduate degree .
I like wine .
I like espresso .
I 'm inclined to buy a hybrid if and when I buy my next car .
I take pride in my ability to express myself intelligently .
I read the New York Times .
I speak Japanese .
I 'm a vegetarian and I like to eat at expensive restaurants with foreign names .
Chris Matthews is writing me off as I make this list .
The thing is , I like street vendor coffee for a dollar .
I prefer to wear jeans and Timberlands .
Beer is good .
Whisky and tequila , too .
If you crowd me on the subway , I 'm gonna say , " Get outta my fucking space . "
I 'm a fan of clearing brush and stacking wood .
Put on the game and I 'm likely to jump through the roof when something happens good or bad .
I love boxing and I think motocross is about the most exciting sport to watch in the world .
Sit me down at a diner and I 'll order the greasiest thing on the menu .
What does all that tell you Lou Dobbs ?
It tells me that there is no such thing as a " regular guy . "
The myth of the regular guy sells all of us short .
It counts on us all being zombies .
It counts on men favoring their more base selves and women favoring their submissive side .
Humanity is best for its complexity and we demean our American culture by boiling it down to false choices .
Reinforcing these choices by framing our national political discourse as a battle between the regular guy and the elitist intellectual class is a distortion of the truth and robs us all of a deeper vision of who we are and what problems face us as a people .
Next time you hear someone playing this " regular guy " game , ask yourself what the truth is .
Ask yourself what 's missing in their portrayal of the issues and the culture itself .
I 'm sure you 'll find it lacking .

May 19 , 2008

Public Citizen Sues to Force U.S. Trade Office To Release Details of WTO Internet Gambling Deal
WASHINGTON , D.C. “ “ The Bush administration is illegally withholding the details of its offer accepted by the European Union to bind more sectors of the U.S. economy to World Trade Organization ( WTO ) jurisdiction as part of a settlement relating to a WTO ruling against the U.S. ban on Internet gambling , Public Citizen contended today in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
After a 2007 WTO ruling authorized trade sanctions because the United States had failed to conform U.S. gambling law to WTO rules , the Bush administration announced it would remove the gambling sector from WTO coverage .
But to do so , WTO rules require that the U.S. must negotiate compensation for other WTO countries .
Although it has announced that deals have been reached with the European Union and other countries , the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative ( USTR ) has refused to release the details of its compensation agreements .
In December , the USTR provided a hint at the scope of the deals by revealing that they involved new U.S. WTO commitments for “ warehousing services , technical testing services , research and development services and postal services relating to outbound international letters . ”
” Americans have a right to know what kinds of trade concessions the U.S. government is granting other countries , especially when those deals have a significant impact on domestic policy and may be worth billions of dollars , ”  said Bonnie I. Robin - Vergeer , a Public Citizen attorney .
“ The Bush administration ’s decision to withhold the agreement under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) has more to do with its desire to prevent public and congressional scrutiny of the settlement before it is enshrined in a new WTO schedule than it does with national security .
FOIA requires the agreement ’s release . ” 
Submitting new U.S. service sectors to the WTO ’s authority would constrain U.S. federal , state and local government ’s ability to regulate in these sectors and expose existing and future domestic policies in these sectors to challenge before WTO tribunals , as occurred with the U.S Internet gambling ban .
The USTR claims the settlement is classified and cannot be released as a matter of national security .
Public Citizen is representing journalist Ed Brayton , who filed a FOIA request for the compensation deal .
The USTR denied Brayton ’s request and his administrative appeal , contending that the settlement was properly classified in the interest of national security .
In 2005 , the WTO ruled for Antigua and Barbuda in a challenge to U.S. laws banning online gambling and ordered the United States to make changes to its laws to conform to WTO rules .
After a 2007 WTO panel authorized sanctions in retaliation for the U.S. refusal to alter its gambling laws , the Bush administration announced that it would withdraw gambling and betting services from WTO jurisdiction .
To modify its schedule of commitments in the WTO ’s General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) , the U.S. was required under GATS Article XXI to negotiate agreements or else proceed to arbitration with affected WTO members to compensate them for lost revenues as a result of the removal of the gambling and betting sector from the schedule of U.S. WTO commitments .
Compensation talks behind closed doors yielded the U.S. settlement with the European Union , along with other WTO members .
The U.S. offer to commit new sectors of the U.S. economy to WTO jurisdiction “ “ and thus to guarantee access under favorable terms by foreign firms “ “ is rumored to be worth billions of dollars and may have serious implications for U.S. domestic policy .
However , neither Congress nor the public can know the details of the agreement and whether it is in the public interest unless it is released .
Brayton , who writes for the Michigan Messenger , is a fellow with the Center for Independent Media .
He has written extensively about U.S. online gambling restrictions and their effect on international trade .
The suit asks the court to find that the USTR is illegally withholding the settlement agreement and to order the agency to provide Brayton a copy of the agreement .

Apparently not , according to Eric Felten of the Wall Street Journal :
EGU VILLAGE , Ethiopia ( CNN ) --
A year of drought and soaring food prices has threatened the lives of tens of thousands of Ethiopian children .
Tens of thousands of Ethiopian children are facing a severe risk of famine .
" We have nothing to feed our children , " said Egu 's village elder .
" We are losing our children day by day . "
Ethiopia 's Health Ministry , along with UNICEF , monitors the health of thousands of children here , but the number of areas they have been able to regularly visit has been cut in half this year .
The small rains that normally allow Ethiopian farmers to plant a second crop each year did not come this year , adding to a critical food shortage .
" It 's an open crisis , and there are more people than we expected , than the government expected , who need additional food , " said Bjorn Ljungqvist , head of UNICEF Ethiopia .
There is a crucial shortfall in the supply of therapeutic foods used to treat children with severe acute malnutrition , the UNICEF official said .
The U.N. 's children 's agency is appealing for $ 50 million to pay for emergency needs .
UNICEF estimates that 6 million Ethiopian children under the age of 5 are at risk and that more than 120,000 have only about a month to live .
Do n't Miss
Aid sought for African farmers
The World Food Program supplies the emergency food for UNICEF , but rising food prices mean it could not guarantee aid for all the areas in need .
" Unless you get immediate assistance the risk is , you fall into severe malnutrition and eventually death , so unless our supporters come in immediately for this , we fear that is what is going to happen in the country , " said Jakob Mikkelse , the program 's nutrition and education chief .
Egu is a village UNICEF is no longer able to visit regularly .
" If we were not here , those children who we had found now with severe acute malnutrition would have died at home , " UNICEF Emergency Nutrition Project Officer Samson Dessie said .
As the relief workers depart Egu , they leave behind a few emergency food packs and a promise to return .
The Ethiopian government has worked with UNICEF since 2004 on the Enhanced Outreach Strategy to provide food for child survival .
The effort distributes child survival packages that include vitamin A supplementation , de-worming , measles catch - up , nutritional screening and referral to supplementary or therapeutic feeding programs .
" EOS is really very important from many perspectives with regard to child survival , " Dessie said .
" The first is it brings high - impact , low - cost child survival packages like vitamin A , which can reduce child mortality by up to 35 percent . "

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( or DSM ) is like the bible of American psychiatry , but it 's been pretty controversial , as far as what 's been included about sexual behaviors .
( Up until the mid 1970s , homosexuality was listed in the DSM as a mental disorder . )
The last DSM was published in 1994 , and it was announced recently that the American Psychiatric Association is picking members to contribute to the development of the newest edition of the DSM , which will be published in 2012 .
The DSM is super important , as it's the standard on what we view as deviant behavior , so certain groups want to make sure that issues like Gender Identity are handled with great care and sensitivity .
( A bunch of crap also needs to be removed from the manual , particularly paraphilias like transvestism , sexual sadism and sexual masochism .
Like really , who still thinks S&M is a mental disorder when it 's like such a clichéd , cheesy kink ?
For real , S&M is like the Hot Topic in the mall of sexuality .
It 's trying to be different , it 's trying to freak you out , it 's trying to piss off parents , but in the end , it 's really kind of …normal . )

A story on MSNBC today delves into the controversy erupting among members of the APA working on the development of the new DSM , reporting that " at least one petition , spearheaded by transgender activists , is being circulated to oppose the appointment of some members to the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders work group and its chair , Kenneth Zucker , head of the Gender Identity Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto , Canada . "
With regards to the definition of normal vs. disordered sex , it seems to me that " sane " eroticism is anything that is enjoyable and consensual for all parties involved , whether it be in missionary position with a partner of the opposite sex , or hanging by nipple clamps while a group of men in panties beat off into a pair of shoes .
Because while the latter may not be right , it 's okay .

March 11 , 2008  -- Adm. William Fallon , the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East , has resigned , citing a magazine article which suggested he was at odds with President Bush 's policy toward Iran .
In a statement released by U.S. Central Command , Fallon disputed a recent Esquire magazine article that suggested differences between his views and administration policies concerning Iran .
" Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the president 's policy objectives have become a distraction at a critical time , and hamper efforts in the Centcom region , " Fallon said in a written statement released from his Tampa , Fla. , office .
" And although I do n't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command area of responsibility , the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America 's interests there , " Fallon 's statement read .
" I have , therefore , concluded that it would be best to step aside and allow the secretary and our military leaders to move beyond this distraction ... and focus on the achievement of our strategic objectives in the region .
I have submitted my request to retire to the secretary of defense . "
Magazine : Fallon Standing Between Bush and Iran
In the Esquire interview , Fallon is described as the only man standing between the Bush administration and war with Iran .
" If , in the dying light of the Bush administration , we go to war with Iran , it 'll all come down to one man .
If we do not go to war with Iran , it 'll come down to the same man .
He is that rarest of creatures in the Bush universe : the good cop on Iran , and a man of strategic brilliance .
His name is William Fallon , " reads the magazine article .
In announcing Fallon 's resignation Tuesday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said it was " a cumulative kind of thing .
It is n't the result of any one article or any one issue . "
When asked if today 's announcement might be interpreted as a move closer toward military action against Iran , Gates said , " that 's ridiculous , just ridiculous .
...
The notion that this portends anything in change of Iran policy is , to quote myself , ridiculous . "
Gates said Tuesday that Fallon had asked him for permission to retire and Gates agreed .
Gates said it was " the right thing to do . "
Administration Rhetoric ' Not Helpful '
Gates also said there was a " misperception " that Fallon disagreed with the administration 's approach to Iran .
In the article , Fallon is quoted as saying Bush administration rhetoric against Iran is " not helpful . "
The article reads : " So while Adm . Fallon 's boss , President George W. Bush , regularly trash - talks his way to World War III and his administration casually casts Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as this century 's Hitler ( a crown it has awarded once before , to deadly effect ) , it 's left to Fallon — and apparently Fallon alone — to argue that .
" As he told Al Jazeera last fall , ' This constant drumbeat of conflict … is not helpful and not useful .
I expect that there will be no war , and that is what we ought to be working for .
We ought to try to do our utmost to create different conditions , ' " said the magazine article .
The president Tuesday issued a written statement wishing Fallon and his family the best .
" During his tenure at Centcom , Fallon 's job has been to help ensure that America 's military forces are ready to meet the threats of an often troubled region of the world , and he deserves considerable credit for progress that has been made there , especially in Iraq and Afghanistan , " Bush wrote .
Fallon is in Baghdad , making the rounds to speak to all of his commanders .
ABC News ' Martha Raddatz spoke to Fallon Tuesday as he waited to go in and see Gen. David Petraeus , the U.S. commander in Iraq .
Fallon told ABC
News that he sensed the Esquire article angered members of the Bush administration .
A senior administration official met with Gates as soon as the article came out and was very worried about the reaction from the White House at that time .
Fallon told Raddatz he is grateful for the way Gates handled his resignation .
Democrats on Capitol Hill seized on the resignation as more evidence that the Bush administration " silences opposing voices . "
" Yet another example that independence and the frank , open airing of experts ' views are not welcomed in this administration , " read a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
" It is also a sign that the administration is blind to the growing costs and consequences of the Iraq War , which has so damaged America 's security interests in the Middle East and beyond , " Reid said .
Fallon , who has had a 41 - year career in the Navy , took the central command post March 16 , 2007 , succeeding Army Gen. John Abizaid , who retired .
Fallon previously served as commander of U.S. Pacific Command .
His resignation was applauded by Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
" I support Secretary Gates ' decision to accept Adm .
Fallon 's letter of resignation and request for retirement .
I also respect the reasons for which Adm .
Fallon submitted it and applaud his ability to recognize the responsibility before him , " Mullen said in a written statement .
" He had an enormous impact not only on the way we operate and fight in this new century , but also on the way in which we stay engaged globally , " Mullen 's statement read .
Gates said that until a permanent replacement is nominated and confirmed by the Senate , Fallon 's place will be taken by his top deputy , Army Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey .
ABC News ' Zach Wolf , Ann Compton , John Cochran and Jennifer Duck contributed reporting .
In war , things are rarely what they seem .
Back in 2003 , in the days leading up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq , the Pentagon adamantly insisted that the war would be a relatively cheap one .
Roughly $ 50 billion is all it would take to rid the world of Saddam Hussein , it said .
We now know this turned out to be the first of many miscalculations .
Approaching its fifth year , the war in Iraq has cost American taxpayers nearly $ 500 billion , according to the non-partisan U.S. - based research group National Priorities Project .
That number is growing every day .
But it 's still not even close to the true cost of the war .
As the invasion 's price tag balloons , economists and analysts are examining the entire financial burden of the Iraq campaign , including indirect expenses that Americans will be paying long after the troops come home .
What they 've come up with is staggering .
Calculations by Harvard 's Linda Bilmes and Nobel - prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz remain most prominent .
They determined that , once you factor in things like medical costs for injured troops , higher oil prices and replenishing the military , the war will cost America upwards of $ 2 trillion .
That does n't include any of the costs incurred by Iraq , or America 's coalition partners .
" Would the American people have had a different attitude toward going to war had they known the total cost ? "
Bilmes and Stiglitz ask in their report .
" We might have conducted the war in a manner different from the way we did . "
It 's hard to comprehend just how much money $ 2 trillion is .
Even Bill Gates , one of the richest people in the world , would marvel at this amount .
But , once you begin to look at what that money could buy , the worldwide impact of fighting this largely unpopular war becomes clear .
Consider that , according to sources like Columbia 's Jeffrey Sachs , the Worldwatch Institute , and the United Nations , with that same money the world could :
Eliminate extreme poverty around the world ( cost $ 135 billion in the first year , rising to $ 195 billion by 2015 . )
Achieve universal literacy ( cost $ 5 billion a year . )
Immunize every child in the world against deadly diseases ( cost $ 1.3 billion a year . )
Ensure developing countries have enough money to fight the AIDS epidemic ( cost $ 15 billion per year . )
In other words , for a cost of $ 156.3 billion this year alone – less than a tenth of the total Iraq war budget – we could lift entire countries out of poverty , teach every person in the world to read and write , significantly reduce child mortality , while making huge leaps in the battle against AIDS , saving millions of lives .
Then the remaining money could be put toward the $ 40 billion to $ 60 billion annually that the World Bank says is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , established by world leaders in 2000 , to tackle everything from gender inequality to environmental sustainability .
The implications of this cannot be underestimated .
It means that a better and more just world is far from within reach , if we are willing to shift our priorities .
If America and other nations were to spend as much on peace as they do on war , that would help root out the poverty , hopelessness and anti-Western sentiment that can fuel terrorism – exactly what the Iraq war was supposed to do .
So as candidates spend much of this year vying to be the next U.S. president , what better way to repair its image abroad , tarnished by years of war , than by becoming a leader in global development ?
It may be too late to turn back the clock to the past and rethink going to war , but it 's not too late for the U.S. and other developed countries to invest in the future .

Ron Paul Speaks Part 1 Ron Paul Speaks Part 2 HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BET THAT THE NEVADA STATE GOP CALL THE CONVENTION BACK TO ORDER SUNDAY MORNING ? -
Think the Ron Paul supporters will hear about it ? - I 'll bet the rules allow them to call it with as few as however many delegates they need .
So even 50 Ron Paul Supporters there might be good insurance , ... but then you 'd have to find the Denny 's they are at :)
1417 is the number of credentialed delegates that can vote and a quorum is 709 .
( Comment by : kedinger
Entered on : 2008-04-26 20:30:33
The number of seated delegates was 1347 , the larger number was the total attendees with delegates , press , and guests . )
At the beginning of the Convention the State GOP / McCain campaign tried to limit who could be considered delegates ( this is how they determined who was _not_ on that list " Nevada GOP Plays Games Ahead of State Convention by Brock Lorber " ) .
This prompted a floor fight that went on for hours .
The record crowd wondered why they were there if the people to be voted on were already predetermined .
Already the 3 congressional districts national delegates are ... ( 3 delegates for each Congressional District )
One district has awarded all 3 to Ron Paul , the second district went , One for Ron Paul , One for John McCain and One for NV .
US Senator John Ensign and the third congressional district is unknown since the convention authorities wo n't tell .
Nevada State Senator Bob Beers is also permanent chair of the convention .
He approached the podium at 6 pm banged gavel and said we lost the room , we 're in recess and have to figure out another way another time to elect the remaining 22 delegates to the national convention and left the room .... but a quorum was present and the people were not finished :)
After the hotel stated that they had no problem with another 3 hours of room use someone tried turning off the lights .
After running off as many as possible during the confusion the lights started coming back on .
Ron Paul supporters are now getting as many back as possible to get the 709 needed to continue to vote for the 22 more delegates that need to be elected .
The lights are back on and now the microphones are coming back on and the convention chair is being asked to take a qurorum count , .... Bob Beers is nowhere to be found soooo ....
Brock Lorber our on the scene correspondent ( and delegate ) will call me back with more shortly :) .
I 'll get it to you as I hear about it while I am now in Washington DC ( gott 'a love the Internet and modern communications :)
====
Brock just called and said that the convention chair refused to reappear .
A quorum call was taken and they were short of the 709 by over 100 ( I think he said 580 something ) .
Observers to the congressional delegate count told them the numbers of the delegates from the congressional delegates for the two districts that they were involved in but the third district ballots have been confiscated by the GOP and sealed and so have the other two congressional districts without an official report to the convention .
Now the remaining 500 + delegates to the convention are acting as a ' Committee of the Whole ' to verify WHAT THE HELL IS GOING TO HAPPEN .
I talked to several Ron Paul delegates at the convention that confirmed how the State GOP tried multiple methods to limit which delegates were to be selected from and when that did n't work their next tactic was to drag out the process as long as possible to claim that there was no more time and end the process .
Once this was done all of the McCain / GOP suits left .
I was also told that CSPAN began covering the Convention but soon left after it was clear that it was getting more complicated than could be rationally explained on TV .
Brock called again to say that a second call for a quorum was taken and it fell short .
When it was clear that it was over and the delegates began to leave they found over 50 people standing in another room wanting to be around in case there was a quorum met but did n't want it to happen so they hid :)
Nevada State Senator Bob Beers , convention chair , told Brian Komisky ( Ron Paul 's Southern Nevada chair ) that most likely the convention will come out of recess in Las Vegas ...
( Mitt Romney was there to support McCain so maybe he and his supporters have a plan to meet at a secure location )
========
9:30 pm update ( Nevada Time )
Confirmed by delegates who witnessed a conversation between the state party chairwoman , Sue Lowden at just before 6 pm , with counters from the counting room and McCain functionaries that of the 9 Congressional Delegates up for grabs - 7 had gone to Ron Paul .
These numbers were told to the state party chair and the McCain campaign people implored the chair to stop the State Convention .
Soon after this conversation the Convention chair , Nevada US Senator Bob Beers , put the Convention in recess and the lights were turned off .
A 5th delegate in attendance just reported to me that just before 6 pm there were several women running through the crowd looking for McCain supporters .
Declaring to be a McCain supporter she was told that they all had to get out of the convention hall immediately .
The delegate argued that a lot of party business was yet to be finished ( Platform , delegates etc. ) but was told that they would conduct business by email if they had to but that the Ron Paul people had taken over the convention and they had to get under the number needed to have a quorum .
Another delegate told me that they heard the Convention chair , Nevada State Senator Bob Beers say , " I 'll save you the trouble , I 'm making the announcement that we are out of time " .
I 'm really looking forward to the details of how a bunch of " non-existant " freedom supporters exposed the GOP for what it is .
THIS is the WIN that I have been working very hard for .
It is the " system " that is the enemy ( and the Bad Guys that always wind up in charge of it ) .
Another update : The RNC was involved :)
The Games are Afoot in Nevada " is good prep for what was behind what this guy is describing happened ) ( this article " " is good prep for what was behind what this guy is describing happened )

Many people say , despite the controversy , Christianity is a force for good in society .
It 's true that there are definitely good Christian people who do nice things .
But there is no proof that in the absence of religion , these same people are n't also capable of goodness .
More importantly , despite any good claims that can be made about Christianity , these are overshadowed with a number of problematic characteristics that might make one reconsider the value of this belief system :
1. Christianity is based on fear .
While today there are liberal clergy who preach a gospel of love , they ignore the bulk of Christian teachings , not to mention the bulk of Christian history .
Throughout almost its entire time on Earth , the motor driving Christianity has been — in addition to the fear of death — fear of the devil and fear of hell .
One can only imagine how potent these threats seemed prior to the rise of science and rational thinking , which have largely robbed these bogeys of their power to inspire terror .
But even today , the existence of the devil and hell are cardinal doctrinal tenets of almost all Christian creeds , and many fundamentalist preachers still openly resort to terrorizing their followers with lurid , sadistic portraits of the suffering of nonbelievers after death .
This is not an attempt to convince through logic and reason ; it is not an attempt to appeal to the better nature of individuals ; rather , it is an attempt to whip the flock into line through threats , through appeals to a base part of human nature — fear and cowardice .
2. Christianity preys on the innocent .
If Christian fear - mongering were directed solely at adults , it would be bad enough , but Christians routinely terrorize helpless children through grisly depictions of the endless horrors and suffering they ’ll be subjected to if they do n’t live good Christian lives .
Christianity has darkened the early years of generation after generation of children , who have lived in terror of dying while in mortal sin and going to endless torment as a result .
All of these children were trusting of adults , and they did not have the ability to analyze what they were being told ; they were simply helpless victims , who , ironically , victimized following generations in the same manner that they themselves had been victimized .
The nearly 2000 years of Christian terrorizing of children ranks as one of its greatest crimes .
And it ’s one that continues to this day .
As an example of Christianity ’s cruel brainwashing of the innocent , consider this quotation from an officially approved , 19th - century Catholic children ’s book ( Tracts for Spiritual Reading , by Rev. J. Furniss , C.S.S.R. ) :
Look into this little prison .
In the middle of it there is a boy , a young man .
He is silent ; despair is on him . . .
His eyes are burning like two burning coals .
Two long flames come out of his ears .
His breathing is difficult .
Sometimes he opens his mouth and breath of blazing fire rolls out of it .
But listen !
There is a sound just like that of a kettle boiling .
Is it really a kettle which is boiling ?
No ; then what is it ?
Hear what it is .
The blood is boiling in the scalding veins of that boy .
The brain is boiling and bubbling in his head .
The marrow is boiling in his bones .
Ask him why he is thus tormented .
His answer is that when he was alive , his blood boiled to do very wicked things .
There are many similar passages in this book .
Commenting on it , William Meagher , Vicar - General of Dublin , states in his Approbation :
" I have carefully read over this Little Volume for Children and have found nothing whatever in it contrary to the doctrines of the Holy Faith ; but on the contrary , a great deal to charm , instruct and edify the youthful classes for whose benefit it has been written . "
3. Christianity is based on dishonesty .
The Christian appeal to fear , to cowardice , is an admission that the evidence supporting Christian beliefs is far from compelling .
If the evidence were such that Christianity ’s truth was immediately apparent to anyone who considered it , Christians — including those who wrote the Gospels — would feel no need to resort to the cheap tactic of using fear - inducing threats to inspire " belief . " ( " Lip service " is a more accurate term . )
That the Christian clergy have been more than willing to accept such lip service ( plus the dollars and obedience that go with it ) in place of genuine belief , is an additional indictment of the basic dishonesty of Christianity .
How deep dishonesty runs in Christianity can be gauged by one of the most popular Christian arguments for belief in God : Pascal ’s wager .
This " wager " holds that it ’s safer to " believe " in God ( as if belief were volitional ! ) than not to believe , because God might exist , and if it does , it will save " believers " and condemn nonbelievers to hell after death .
This is an appeal to pure cowardice .
It has absolutely nothing to do with the search for truth .
Instead , it ’s an appeal to abandon honesty and intellectual integrity , and to pretend that lip service is the same thing as actual belief .
If the patriarchal God of Christianity really exists , one wonders how it would judge the cowards and hypocrites who advance and bow to this particularly craven " wager . "
4. Christianity is extremely egocentric .
The deep egocentrism of Christianity is intimately tied to its reliance on fear .
In addition to the fears of the devil and hell , Christianity plays on another of humankind ’s most basic fears : death , the dissolution of the individual ego .
Perhaps Christianity ’s strongest appeal is its promise of eternal life .
While there is absolutely no evidence to support this claim , most people are so terrified of death that they cling to this treacly promise insisting , like frightened children , that it must be true .
Nietzsche put the matter well : " salvation of the soul — in plain words , the world revolves around me . "
It ’s difficult to see anything spiritual in this desperate grasping at straws — this desperate grasping at the illusion of personal immortality .
Another manifestation of the extreme egotism of Christianity is the belief that God is intimately concerned with picayune aspects of , and directly intervenes in , the lives of individuals .
If God , the creator and controller of the universe , is vitally concerned with your sex life , you must be pretty damned important .
Many Christians take this particular form of egotism much further and actually imagine that God has a plan for them , or that God directly talks to , directs , or even does favors for them .
[ 1]
If one ignored the frequent and glaring contradictions in this supposed divine guidance , and the dead bodies sometimes left in its wake , one could almost believe that the individuals making such claims are guided by God .
But one ca n’t ignore the contradictions in and the oftentimes horrible results of following such " divine guidance . "
As " Agent Mulder " put it ( perhaps paraphrasing Thomas Szasz ) in a 1998 X - Files episode , " When you talk to God it ’s prayer , but when God talks to you it ’s schizophrenia .
. . .
God may have his reasons , but he sure seems to employ a lot of psychotics to carry out his job orders . "
In less extreme cases , the insistence that one is receiving divine guidance or special treatment from God is usually the attempt of those who feel worthless — or helpless , adrift in an uncaring universe — to feel important or cared for .
This less sinister form of egotism is commonly found in the expressions of disaster survivors that " God must have had a reason for saving me " ( in contrast to their less - worthy - of - life fellow disaster victims , whom God — who controls all things — killed ) .
Again , it ’s very difficult to see anything spiritual in such egocentricity .
5. Christianity breeds arrogance , a chosen - people mentality .
It ’s only natural that those who believe ( or play act at believing ) that they have a direct line to the Almighty would feel superior to others .
This is so obvious that it needs little elaboration .
A brief look at religious terminology confirms it .
Christians have often called themselves " God ’s people , " " the chosen people , " " the elect , " " the righteous , " etc. , while nonbelievers have been labeled " heathens , " " infidels , " and " atheistic Communists " ( as if atheism and Communism are intimately connected ) .
This sets up a two - tiered division of humanity , in which " God ’s people " feel superior to those who are not " God ’s people . "
That many competing religions with contradictory beliefs make the same claim seems not to matter at all to the members of the various sects that claim to be the only carriers of " the true faith . "
The carnage that results when two competing sects of " God ’s people " collide — as in Ireland and Palestine — would be quite amusing but for the suffering it causes .
6. Christianity breeds authoritarianism .
Given that Christians claim to have the one true faith , to have a book that is the Word of God , and ( in many cases ) to receive guidance directly from God , they feel little or no compunction about using force and coercion to enforce " God ’s Will " ( which they , of course , interpret and understand ) .
Given that they believe ( or pretend ) that they ’re receiving orders from the Almighty ( who would cast them into hell should they disobey ) , it ’s little wonder that they feel no reluctance , and in fact are eager , to intrude into the most personal aspects of the lives of nonbelievers .
This is most obvious today in the area of sex , with Christians attempting to deny women the right to abortion and to mandate near - useless abstinence - only sex " education " in the public schools .
It ’s also obvious in the area of education , with Christians attempting to force biology teachers to teach their creation myth ( but not those of Hindus , Native Americans , et al. ) in place of ( or as being equally valid as ) the very well established theory of evolution .
But the authoritarian tendencies of Christianity reach much further than this .
Up until well into the 20th century in the United States and other Christian countries ( notably Ireland ) , Christian churches pressured governments into passing laws forbidding the sale and distribution of birth control devices , and they also managed to enact laws forbidding even the description of birth control devices .
This assault on free speech was part and parcel of Christianity ’s shameful history of attempting to suppress " indecent " and " subversive " materials ( and to throw their producers in jail or burn them alive ) .
This anti-free speech stance of Christianity dates back centuries , with the cases of Galileo Galilei and Giordano Bruno ( who was burnt alive ) being good illustrations of it .
Perhaps the most colorful example of this intrusive Christian tendency toward censorship is the Catholic Church ’s Index of Prohibited Books , which dates from the 16th century and which was abandoned only in the latter part of the 20th century — not because the church recognized it as a crime against human freedom , but because it could no longer be enforced ( not that it was ever systematically enforced — that was too big a job even for the Inquisition ) .
Christian authoritarianism extends , however , far beyond attempts to suppress free speech ; it extends even to attempts to suppress freedom of belief .
In the 15th century , under Ferdinand and Isabella at about the time of Columbus ’s discovery of the New World , Spain ’s Jews were ordered either to convert to Christianity or to flee the country ; about half chose exile , while those who remained , the " Conversos , " were favorite targets of the Inquisition .
A few years later , Spain ’s Muslims were forced to make a similar choice .
This Christian hatred of freedom of belief — and of individual freedom in general — extends to this day .
Up until the late 19th century in England , atheists who had the temerity to openly advocate their beliefs were jailed .
Even today in many parts of the United States laws still exist that forbid atheists from serving on juries or from holding public office .
And it ’s no mystery what the driving force is behind laws against victimless " crimes " such as nudity , sodomy , fornication , cohabitation , and prostitution .
If your nonintrusive beliefs or actions are not in accord with Christian " morality , " you can bet that Christians will feel completely justified — not to mention righteous — in poking their noses ( often in the form of state police agencies ) into your private life .
7. Christianity is cruel .
Throughout its history , cruelty — both to self and others — has been one of the most prominent features of Christianity .
From its very start , Christianity , with its bleak view of life , its emphasis upon sexual sin , and its almost impossible - to - meet demands for sexual " purity , " encouraged guilt , penance , and self - torture .
Today , this self - torture is primarily psychological , in the form of guilt arising from following ( or denying , and thus obsessing over ) one ’s natural sexual desires .
In earlier centuries , it was often physical .
W.E.H. Lecky relates :
For about two centuries , the hideous maceration of the body was regarded as the highest proof of excellence .
. . .
The cleanliness of the body was regarded as a pollution of the soul , and the saints who were most admired had become one hideous mass of clotted filth .
. . .
But of all the evidences of the loathsome excesses to which this spirit was carried , the life of St. Simeon Stylites is probably the most remarkable .
. . .
He had bound a rope around him so that it became embedded in his flesh , which putrefied around it .
A horrible stench , intolerable to the bystanders , exhaled from his body , and worms dropped from him whenever he moved , and they filled his bed .
. . .
For a whole year , we are told , St. Simeon stood upon one leg , the other being covered with hideous ulcers , while his biographer [ St. Anthony ] was commissioned to stand by his side , to pick up the worms that fell from his body , and to replace them in the sores , the saint saying to the worms , " Eat what God has given you . "
From every quarter pilgrims of every degree thronged to do him homage .
A crowd of prelates followed him to the grave .
A brilliant star is said to have shone miraculously over his pillar ; the general voice of mankind pronounced him to be the highest model of a Christian saint ; and several other anchorites [ Christian hermits ] imitated or emulated his penances .
Given that the Bible nowhere condemns torture and sometimes prescribes shockingly cruel penalties ( such as burning alive ) , and that Christians so wholeheartedly approved of self - torture , it ’s not surprising that they thought little of inflicting appallingly cruel treatment upon others .
At the height of Christianity ’s power and influence , hundreds of thousands of " witches " were brutally tortured and burned alive under the auspices of ecclesiastical witch finders , and the Inquisition visited similarly cruel treatment upon those accused of heresy .
Henry Charles Lea records :
Two hundred wretches crowded the filthy gaol and it was requisite to forbid the rest of the Conversos [ Jews intimidated into converting to Christianity ] from leaving the city [ Jaen , Spain ] without a license .
With Diego ’s assistance [ Diego de Algeciras , a petty criminal and kept perjurer ] and the free use of torture , on both accused and witnesses , it was not difficult to obtain whatever evidence was desired .
The notary of the tribunal , Antonio de Barcena , was especially successful in this .
On one occasion , he locked a young girl of fifteen in a room , stripped her naked and scourged her until she consented to bear testimony against her mother .
A prisoner was carried in a chair to the auto da fe with his feet burnt to the bone ; he and his wife were burnt alive . . .
The cells in which the unfortunates were confined in heavy chains were narrow , dark , humid , filthy and overrun with vermin , while their sequestrated property was squandered by the officials , so that they nearly starved in prison while their helpless children starved outside .
While the torture and murder of heretics and " witches " is now largely a thing of the past , Christians can still be remarkably cruel .
One current example is provided by the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , Kansas .
Its members picket the funerals of victims of AIDS and gay bashings , brandishing signs reading , " God Hates Fags , " " AIDS Cures Fags , " and " Thank God for AIDS . "
The pastor of this church reportedly once sent a " condolence " card to the bereaved mother of an AIDS victim , reading " Another Dead Fag . " [ 2 ]
Christians are also at the forefront of those advocating vicious , life - destroying penalties for those who commit victimless " crimes , " as well as being at the forefront of those who support the death penalty and those who want to make prison conditions even more barbaric than they are now .
But this should not be surprising coming from Christians , members of a religion that teaches that eternal torture is not only justified , but that the " saved " will enjoy seeing the torture of others .
As St. Thomas Aquinas put it :
In order that the happiness of the saints may be more delightful and that they may give to God more copious thanks for it , they are permitted perfectly to behold the sufferings of the damned . . .
The saints will rejoice in the punishment of the damned .
Thus the vision of heaven of Christianity ’s greatest theologian is a vision of the sadistic enjoyment of endless torture .
8. Christianity is anti-intellectual , anti-scientific .
For over a millennium Christianity arrested the development of science and scientific thinking .
In Christendom , from the time of Augustine until the Renaissance , systematic investigation of the natural world was restricted to theological investigation — the interpretation of biblical passages , the gleaning of clues from the lives of the saints , etc. ; there was no direct observation and interpretation of natural processes , because that was considered a useless pursuit , as all knowledge resided in scripture .
The results of this are well known : scientific knowledge advanced hardly an inch in the over 1000 years from the rise of orthodox Christianity in the fourth century to the 1500s , and the populace was mired in the deepest squalor and ignorance , living in dire fear of the supernatural — believing in paranormal explanations for the most ordinary natural events .
This ignorance had tragic results : it made the populace more than ready to accept witchcraft as an explanation for everything from illness to thunderstorms , and hundreds of thousands of women paid for that ignorance with their lives .
One of the commonest charges against witches was that they had raised hailstorms or other weather disturbances to cause misfortune to their neighbors .
In an era when supernatural explanations were readily accepted , such charges held weight — and countless innocent people died horrible deaths as a result .
Another result was that the fearful populace remained very dependent upon Christianity and its clerical wise men for protection against the supernatural evils which they believed surrounded and constantly menaced them .
For men and women of the Middle Ages , the walls veritably crawled with demons and witches ; and their only protection from those evils was the church .
When scientific investigation into the natural world resumed in the Renaissance — after a 1000 - year - plus hiatus — organized Christianity did everything it could to stamp it out .
The cases of Copernicus and Galileo are particularly relevant here , because when the Catholic Church banned the Copernican theory ( that the Earth revolves around the sun ) and banned Galileo from teaching it , it did not consider the evidence for that theory : it was enough that it contradicted scripture .
Given that the Copernican theory directly contradicted the Word of God , the Catholic hierarchy reasoned that it must be false .
Protestants shared this view .
John Calvin rhetorically asked , “ Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit ? ”
More lately , the Catholic Church and the more liberal Protestant congregations have realized that fighting against science is a losing battle , and they ’ve taken to claiming that there is no contradiction between science and religion .
This is disingenuous at best .
As long as Christian sects continue to claim as fact — without offering a shred of evidence beyond the anecdotal — that physically impossible events occurred ( or are still occurring ) , the conflict between science and religion will remain .
That many churchmen and many scientists seem content to let this conflict lie does n’t mean that it does n’t exist .
Today , however , the conflict between religion and science is largely being played out in the area of public school biology education , with Christian fundamentalists demanding that their creation myth be taught in place of ( or along with ) the theory of evolution in the public schools .
Their tactics rely heavily on public misunderstanding of science .
They nitpick the fossil record for its gaps ( hardly surprising given that we inhabit a geologically and meteorologically very active planet ) , while offering absurd interpretations of their own which we ’re supposed to accept at face value — such as that dinosaur fossils were placed in the earth by Satan to confuse humankind , or that Noah took baby dinosaurs on the ark .
They also attempt to take advantage of public ignorance of the nature of scientific theories .
In popular use , “ theory ” is employed as a synonym for “ hypothesis , ” “ conjecture , ” or even “ wild guess , ” that is , it signifies an idea with no special merit or backing .
The use of the term in science is quite different .
There , “ theory ” refers to a well - developed , logically consistent explanation of a phenomenon , and an explanation that is consistent with observed facts .
This is very different than a wild guess .
But fundamentalists deliberately confuse the two uses of the term in an attempt to make their religious myth appear as valid as a well - supported scientific theory .
They also attempt to confuse the issue by claiming that those nonspecialists who accept the theory of evolution have no more reason to do so than they have in accepting their religious creation myth , or even that those who accept evolution do so on “ faith . ”
Again , this is more than a bit dishonest .
Thanks to scientific investigation , human knowledge has advanced to the point where no one can know more than a tiny fraction of the whole .
Even the most knowledgeable scientists often know little beyond their specialty areas .
But because of the structure of science , they ( and everyone else ) can feel reasonably secure in accepting the theories developed by scientists in other disciplines as the best possible current explanations of the areas of nature those disciplines cover .
They ( and we ) can feel secure doing this because of the structure of science , and more particularly , because of the scientific method .
That method basically consists of gathering as much information about a phenomenon ( both in nature and in the laboratory ) as possible , then developing explanations for it ( hypotheses ) , and then testing the hypotheses to see how well they explain the observed facts , and whether or not any of those observed facts are inconsistent with the hypotheses .
Those hypotheses that are inconsistent with observed facts are discarded or modified , while those that are consistent are retained , and those that survive repeated testing are often labeled “ theories , ” as in “ the theory of relativity ” and “ the theory of evolution . ”
This is the reason that nonspecialists are justified in accepting scientific theories outside their disciplines as the best current explanations of observed phenomena : those who developed the theories were following standard scientific practice and reasoning — and if they deviate from that , other scientists will quickly call them to task .
No matter how much fundamentalists might protest to the contrary , there is a world of difference between “ faith ” in scientific theories ( produced using the scientific method , and subject to near - continual testing and scrutiny ) and faith in the entirely unsupported myths recorded 3000 years ago by slave - holding goat herders .
Nearly 500 years ago Martin Luther , in his Table Talk , stated : “ Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has . ”
The opposite is also true .
9. Christianity has a morbid , unhealthy preoccupation with sex .
For centuries , Christianity has had an exceptionally unhealthy fixation on sex , to the exclusion of almost everything else ( except power , money , and the infliction of cruelty ) .
This stems from the numerous " thou shalt nots " relating to sex in the Bible .
That the Ten Commandments contain a commandment forbidding the coveting of one ’s neighbor ’s wife , but do not even mention slavery , torture , or cruelty — which were abundantly common in the time the Commandments were written — speaks volumes about their writer ’s preoccupation with sex ( and women as property ) .
Today , judging from the pronouncements of many Christian leaders , one would think that " morality " consists solely of what one does in one ’s bedroom .
The Catholic Church is the prime example here , with its moral pronouncements rarely going beyond the matters of birth control and abortion ( and with its moral emphasis seemingly entirely on those matters ) .
Also note that the official Catholic view of sex — that it ’s for the purpose of procreation only — reduces human sexual relations to those of brood animals .
For more than a century the Catholic Church has also been the driving force behind efforts to prohibit access to birth control devices and information — to everyone , not just Catholics .
The Catholic Church , however , is far from alone in its sick obsession with sex .
The current Christian hate campaign against homosexuals is another prominent manifestation of this perverse preoccupation .
Even at this writing , condemnation of " sodomites " from church pulpits is still very , very common — with Christian clergymen wringing their hands as they piously proclaim that their words of hate have nothing to do with gay bashings and the murder of gays .
10 . Christianity produces sexual misery .
In addition to the misery produced by authoritarian Christian intrusions into the sex lives of non-Christians , Christianity produces great misery among its own adherents through its insistence that sex ( except the very narrow variety it sanctions ) is evil , against God ’s law .
Christianity proscribes sex between unmarried people , sex outside of marriage , homosexual relations , bestiality , [ 3 ] and even “ impure ” sexual thoughts .
Indulging in such things can and will , in the conventional Christian view , lead straight to hell .
Given that human beings are by nature highly sexual beings , and that their urges very often do not fit into the only officially sanctioned Christian form of sexuality ( monogamous , heterosexual marriage ) , it ’s inevitable that those who attempt to follow Christian “ morality ” in this area are often miserable , as their strongest urges run smack dab into the wall of religious belief .
This is inevitable in Christian adolescents and unmarried young people in that the only “ pure ” way for them to behave is celibately — in the strict Christian view , even masturbation is prohibited .
Phillip Roth has well described the dilemma of the religiously / sexually repressed young in Portnoy ’s Complaint as “ being torn between desires that are repugnant to my conscience and a conscience repugnant to my desires . ”
Thus the years of adolescence and young adulthood for many Christians are poisoned by “ sinful ” urges , unfulfilled longings , and intense guilt ( after the urges become too much to bear and are acted upon ) .
Even after Christian young people receive a license from church and state to have sex , they often discover that the sexual release promised by marriage is not all that it ’s cracked up to be .
One gathers that in marriages between those who have followed Christian rules up until marriage — that is , no sex at all — sexual ineptitude and lack of fulfillment are all too common .
Even when Christian married people do have good sexual relations , the problems do not end .
Sexual attractions ebb and flow , and new attractions inevitably arise .
In conventional Christian relationships , one is not allowed to act on these new attractions .
One is often not even permitted to admit that such attractions exist .
As Sten Linnander puts it , “ with traditional [ Christian ] morality , you have to choose between being unfaithful to yourself or to another . ”
The dilemma is even worse for gay teens and young people in that Christianity never offers them release from their unrequited urges .
They are simply condemned to lifelong celibacy .
If they indulge their natural desires , they become “ sodomites ” subject not only to Earthly persecution ( due to Christian - inspired laws ) , but to being roasted alive forever in the pit .
Given the internalized homophobia Christian teachings inspire , not to mention the very real discrimination gay people face , it ’s not surprising that a great many homosexually oriented Christians choose to live a lie .
In most cases , this leads to lifelong personal torture , but it can have even more tragic results .
A prime example is Marshall Applewhite , “ John Do , ” the guru of the Heaven ’s Gate religious cult .
Applewhite grew up in the South in a repressive Christian fundamentalist family .
Horrified by his homosexual urges , he began to think of sexuality itself as evil , and eventually underwent castration to curb his sexual urges . [ 4 ]
Several of his followers took his anti-sexual teachings to heart and likewise underwent castration before , at “ Do ’s ” direction , killing themselves .
11 . Christianity has an exceedingly narrow , legalistic view of morality .
Christianity not only reduces , for all practical purposes , the question of morality to that of sexual behavior , but by listing its prohibitions , it encourages an " everything not prohibited is permitted " mentality .
So , for instance , medieval inquisitors tortured their victims , while at the same time they went to lengths to avoid spilling the blood of those they tortured — though they thought nothing of burning them alive .
Another very relevant example is that until the latter part of the 19th century Christians engaged in the slave trade , and Christian preachers defended it , citing biblical passages , from the pulpit .
Today , with the exception of a relatively few liberal churchgoers , Christians ignore the very real evils plaguing our society — poverty ; homelessness ; hunger ; militarism ; a grossly unfair distribution of wealth and income ; ecological despoliation exacerbated by corporate greed ; overpopulation ; sexism ; racism ; homophobia ; freedom - denying , invasive drug laws ; an inadequate educational system ; etc. , etc. — unless they ’re actively working to worsen those evils in the name of Christian morality or " family values . "
12 . Christianity encourages acceptance of real evils while focusing on imaginary evils .
Organized Christianity is a skillful apologist for the status quo and all the evils that go along with it .
It diverts attention from real problems by focusing attention on sexual issues , and when confronted with social evils such as poverty glibly dismisses them with platitudes such as , " The poor ye have always with you . "
When confronted with the problems of militarism and war , most Christians shrug and say , " That ’s human nature .
It ’s always been that way , and it always will . "
One suspects that 200 years ago their forebears would have said exactly the same thing about slavery .
This regressive , conservative tendency of Christianity has been present from its very start .
The Bible is quite explicit in its instructions to accept the status quo : " Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers .
For there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God ; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation . "
( Romans 13:1 –2 )
13 . Christianity depreciates the natural world .
In addition to its morbid preoccupation with sex , Christianity creates social myopia through its emphasis on the supposed afterlife — encouraging Christians not to be concerned with " the things of this world " ( except , of course , their neighbors ’ sexual practices ) .
In the conventional Christian view , life in this " vale of tears " is not important — what matters is preparing for the next life .
( Of course it follows from this that the " vale of tears " itself is quite unimportant — it ’s merely the backdrop to the testing of the faithful . )
The Christian belief in the unimportance of happiness and well - being in this world is well illustrated by a statement by St. Alphonsus :
It would be a great advantage to suffer during all our lives all the torments of the martyrs in exchange for one moment of heaven .
Sufferings in this world are a sign that God loves us and intends to save us .
This focus on the afterlife often leads to a distinct lack of concern for the natural world , and sometimes to outright anti-ecological attitudes .
Ronald Reagan ’s fundamentalist Secretary of the Interior , James Watt , went so far as to actively encourage the strip mining and clear cutting of the American West , reasoning that ecological damage did n’t matter because the " rapture " was at hand .
14 . Christianity models hierarchical , authoritarian organization .
Christianity is perhaps the ultimate top - down enterprise .
In its simplest form , it consists of God on top , its " servants , " the clergy , next down , and the great unwashed masses at the bottom , with those above issuing , in turn , thou - shalts and thou - shalt - nots backed by the threat of eternal damnation .
But a great many Christian sects go far beyond this , having several layers of management and bureaucracy .
Catholicism is perhaps the most extreme example of this with its laity , monks , nuns , priests , monsignors , bishops , archbishops , cardinals , and popes , all giving and taking orders in an almost military manner .
This type of organization cannot but accustom those in its sway — especially those who have been indoctrinated and attending its ceremonies since birth — into accepting hierarchical , authoritarian organization as the natural , if not the only , form of organization .
Those who find such organization natural will see nothing wrong with hierarchical , authoritarian organization in other forms , be they corporations , with their multiple layers of brown - nosing management , or governments , with their judges , legislators , presidents , and politburos .
The indoctrination by example that Christianity provides in the area of organization is almost surely a powerful influence against social change toward freer , more egalitarian forms of organization .
15 . Christianity sanctions slavery .
The African slave trade was almost entirely conducted by Christians .
They transported their victims to the New World in slave ships with names such as " Mercy " and " Jesus , " where they were bought by Christians , both Catholic and Protestant .
Organized Christianity was not silent on this horror : it actively encouraged it and engaged in it .
From the friars who enslaved Native Americans in the Southwest and Mexico to the Protestant preachers who defended slavery from the pulpit in Virginia , the Carolinas , and Georgia , the record of Christianity as regards slavery is quite shameful .
While many abolitionists were Christians , they were a very small group , well hated by most of their fellow Christians .
The Christians who supported and engaged in slavery were amply supported by the Bible , in which slavery is accepted as a given , as simply a part of the social landscape .
There are numerous biblical passages that implicitly or explicitly endorse slavery , such as Exodus 21:20 – 21 : " And if a man smite his servant , or his maid with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
Notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished : for he is his money . "
Other passages that support slavery include Ephesians 6:5 , Colossians 3:22 , Titus 2:9–10 , Exodus 21:2 –6 , Leviticus 25:44 –46 , 1 Peter 2:18 , and 1 Timothy 6:1 . Christian slave owners in colonial America were well acquainted with these passages .
16 . Christianity is misogynistic .
Misogyny is fundamental to the basic writings of Christianity .
In passage after passage , women are encouraged — no , commanded — to accept an inferior role , and to be ashamed of themselves for the simple fact that they are women .
Misogynistic biblical passages are so common that it ’s difficult to know which to cite .
From the New Testament we find " Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church .
. . . " ( Ephesians 5:22 –23 ) and " These [ redeemed ] are they which were not defiled with women ; . . . " ( Revelation 14:4 ) ; and from the Old Testament we find " How then can man be justified with God ?
Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ? " ( Job 25:4 ) Other relevant New Testament passages include Colossians 3:18 ; 1 Peter 3:7 ; 1 Corinthians 11:3 , 11:9 , and 14:34 ; and 1 Timothy 2:11 –12 and 5:5 –6 .
Other Old Testament passages include Numbers 5:20 – 22 and Leviticus 12:2–5 and 15:17–33 .
Later Christian writers extended the misogynistic themes in the Bible with a vengeance .
Tertullian , one of the early church fathers , wrote :
In pain shall you bring forth children , woman , and you shall turn to your husband and he shall rule over you .
And do you not know that you are Eve ?
God ’s sentence hangs still over all your sex and His punishment weighs down upon you .
You are the devil ’s gateway ; you are she who first violated the forbidden tree and broke the law of God .
It was you who coaxed your way around him whom the devil had not the force to attack .
With what ease you shattered that image of God : Man !
Because of the death you merited , even the Son of God had to die .
. . .
Woman , you are the gate to hell .
One can find similarly misogynistic — though sometimes less venomous — statements in the writings of many other church fathers and theologians , including St. Ambrose , St. Anthony , Thomas Aquinas , St. Augustine , St. John Chrysostom , St. Gregory of Nazianzum , and St. Jerome .
This misogynistic bias in Christianity ’s basic texts has long been translated into misogyny in practice .
Throughout almost the entire time that Christianity had Europe and America in its lock grip , women were treated as chattel — they had essentially no political rights , and their right to own property was severely restricted .
Perhaps the clearest illustration of the status of women in the ages when Christianity was at its most powerful is the prevalence of wife beating .
This degrading , disgusting practice was very common throughout Christendom well up into the 19th century , and under English Common Law husbands who beat their wives were specifically exempted from prosecution .
( While wife beating is still common in Christian lands , at least in some countries abusers are at least sometimes prosecuted . )
At about the same time that English Common Law ( with its wife - beating exemption ) was being formulated and codified , Christians all across Europe were engaging in a half - millennium - long orgy of torture and murder of " witches " — at the direct behest and under the direction of the highest church authorities .
The watchword of the time was Exodus 22:18 , " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live , " and at the very minimum hundreds of thousands of women were brutally murdered as a result of this divine injunction , and the papal bulls amplifying it ( e.g. , Spondit Pariter , by John XXII , and Summis Desiderantes , by Innocent VIII ) .
Andrew Dickson
White notes :
On the 7th of December , 1484 , Pope Innocent VIII sent forth the bull Summis Desiderantes .
Of all documents ever issued from Rome , imperial or papal , this has doubtless , first and last , cost the greatest shedding of innocent blood .
Yet no document was ever more clearly dictated by conscience .
Inspired by the scriptural command , " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live , " Pope Innocent exhorted the clergy of Germany to leave no means untried to detect sorcerers . . .
[ W ] itch - finding inquisitors were authorized by the Pope to scour Europe , especially Germany , and a manual was prepared for their use [ by the Dominicans Heinrich Krämer and Jacob Sprenger ] — " The Witch Hammer " , Malleus Maleficarum .
. . .
With the application of torture to thousands of women , in accordance with the precepts laid down in the Malleus , it was not difficult to extract masses of proof . . .
The poor creatures writhing on the rack , held in horror by those who had been nearest and dearest to them , anxious only for death to relieve their sufferings , confessed to anything and everything that would satisfy the inquisitors and judges .
. . .
Under the doctrine of " excepted cases , " there was no limit to torture for persons accused of heresy or witchcraft .
Given this bloody , hateful history , it ’s not surprising that women have always held very subservient positions in Christian churches .
In fact , there appear to have been no female clergy in any Christian church prior to the 20th century ( with the exception of those who posed as men , such as Pope Joan ) , and even today a great many Christian sects ( most notably the Catholic Church ) continue to resist ordaining female clergy .
While a few liberal Protestant churches have ordained women in recent years , it ’s difficult to see this as a great step forward for women ; it ’s easier to see it as analogous to the Ku Klux Klan ’s appointing a few token blacks as Klaxons .
As for the improvements in the status of women over the last two centuries , the Christian churches either did nothing to support them or actively opposed them .
This is most obvious as regards women ’s control over their own bodies .
Organized Christianity has opposed this from the start , and as late as the 1960s the Catholic Church was still putting its energies into the imposition of laws prohibiting access to contraceptives .
Having lost that battle , Christianity has more recently put its energies into attempts to outlaw the right of women to abortion .
Many of those leading the fight for women ’s rights have had no illusions about the misogynistic nature of Christianity .
These women included Mary Wollstonecraft , Victoria Woodhull , Elizabeth Cady Stanton , and Margaret Sanger ( whose slogan , “ No God .
No master , ” remains relevant to this day ) .
17 . Christianity is homophobic .
Christianity from its beginnings has been markedly homophobic .
The biblical basis for this homophobia lies in the story of Sodom in Genesis , and in Leviticus .
Leviticus 18:22 reads : " Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination , " and Leviticus 20:13 reads : " If a man lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . "
This sounds remarkably harsh , yet Leviticus proscribes a great many other things , declares many of them " abominations , " and prescribes the death penalty for several other acts , some of which are shockingly picayune .
Leviticus 17:10 –13 prohibits the eating of blood sausage ; Leviticus 11:6 –7 prohibits the eating of " unclean " hares and swine ; Leviticus 11:10 declares shellfish " abominations " ;
Leviticus 20:9 prescribes the death penalty for cursing one ’s father or mother ; Leviticus 20:10 prescribes the death penalty for adultery ; Leviticus 20:14 prescribes the penalty of being burnt alive for having a three - way with one ’s wife and mother - in - law ; and Leviticus 20:15 declares , " And if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast " ( which seems rather unfair to the poor beast ) .
( One suspects that American Christians have never attempted to pass laws enforcing Leviticus 20:15 , because if passed and enforced such laws would decimate both the rural , Bible - Belt population and the cattle industry . )
Curiously , given the multitude of prohibitions in Leviticus , the vast majority of present - day Christians have chosen to focus only upon Leviticus 20:13 , the verse calling for the death penalty for homosexual acts .
And at least some of them have n’t been averse to acting on it .
( To be fair , some Christian " reconstructionists " are currently calling for institution of the death penalty for adultery and atheism as well as for " sodomy . " )
Throughout history , homosexuality has been illegal in Christian lands , and the penalties have been severe .
In the Middle Ages , strangled gay men were sometimes placed on the wood piles at the burning of witches ( hence the term " faggot " ) .
One member of the British royalty caught having homosexual relations suffered an even more grisly fate : Edward II ’s penalty was being held down while a red hot poker was jammed through his rectum and intestines .
In more modern times , countless gay people have been jailed for years for the victimless " crime " of having consensual sex .
It was only in 2003 that the Supreme Court struck down the felony laws on the books in many American states prescribing lengthy prison terms for consensual " sodomy . "
And many Christians would love to reinstate those laws .
Thus the current wave of gay bashings and murders of gay people should come as no surprise .
Christians can find justification for such violence in the Bible and also in the hate - filled sermons issuing from all too many pulpits in this country .
If history is any indication , the homophobic messages in those sermons will continue to be issued for many years to come .
18 . The Bible is not a reliable guide to Christ ’s teachings .
Nobody really knows for sure who were the authors of the Bible .
Mark , the oldest of the Gospels , was written at least 30 years after Christ ’s death , and the newest of them might have been written more than 200 years after his death .
These texts have been amended , translated , and re-translated so often that it ’s extremely difficult to gauge the accuracy of current editions — even aside from the matter of the accuracy of texts written decades or centuries after the death of their subject .
This is such a problem that the Jesus Seminar , a colloquium of over 200 Protestant Gospel scholars mostly employed at religious colleges and seminaries , undertook in 1985 a multi- year investigation into the historicity of the statements and deeds attributed to Jesus in the New Testament .
They concluded that only 18 % of the statements and 16 % of the deeds attributed to Jesus had a high likelihood of being historically accurate .
So , in a very real sense fundamentalists — who claim to believe in the literal truth of the Bible — are not followers of Jesus Christ ; rather , they are followers of those who , decades or centuries later , put words in his mouth .
19 .
The Bible , Christianity ’s basic text , is riddled with contradictions .
There are a number of glaring contradictions in the Bible , in both the Old and New Testaments , and including some within the same books .
A few examples :
" . . .
God can not be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man . " ( James : 1:13 ) " And it came to pass after these things , that God did tempt Abraham . "
( Genesis 22:1 )
" . . . for I am merciful , saith the Lord , and I will not keep anger forever . " ( Jeremiah 3:12 ) " Ye have kindled a fire in mine anger , which shall burn forever .
Thus saith the Lord . " ( Jeremiah 17:4 )
" If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . " ( John 5:31 , J.C. speaking ) " I am one that bear witness of myself . . . " ( John 8:18 , J.C. speaking )
and last but not least :
" I have seen God face to face , and my life is preserved . " ( Genesis 32:30 ) " No man hath seen God at any time . " ( John 1:18 ) " And I [ God ] will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts . . . " ( Exodus 33:23 )
Christian apologists typically attempt to explain away such contradictions by claiming that the fault lies in the translation , and that there were no contradictions in the original text .
It ’s difficult to see how this could be so , given how direct many biblical contradictions are ; but even if these Christian apologetics held water , it would follow that every part of the Bible should be as suspect as the contradictory sections , thus reinforcing the previous point : that the Bible is not a reliable guide to Christ ’s words .
20 . Christianity borrowed its central myths and ceremonies from other ancient religions .
The ancient world was rife with tales of virgin births , miracle - working saviors , tripartite gods , gods taking human form , gods arising from the dead , heavens and hells , and days of judgment .
In addition to the myths , many of the ceremonies of ancient religions also match those of that syncretic latecomer , Christianity .
To cite but one example ( there are many others ) , consider Mithraism , a Persian religion predating Christianity by centuries .
Mithra , the savior of the Mithraic religion and a god who took human form , was born of a virgin ; he belonged to the holy trinity and was a link between heaven and Earth ; and he ascended into heaven after his death .
His followers believed in heaven and hell , looked forward to a day of judgment , and referred to Mithra as " the Light of the World . "
They also practiced baptism ( for purification purposes ) and ritual cannibalism — the eating of bread and the drinking of wine to symbolize the eating and drinking of the god ’s body and blood .
Given all this , Mithra ’s birthday should come as no surprise : December 25th ; this event was , of course , celebrated by Mithra ’s followers at midnight .
Mithraism is but the most striking example of the appearance of these myths and ceremonies prior to the advent of Christianity .
They appear — in more scattered form — in many other pre-Christian religions .
A Final Word :
These are but some of the major problems attending Christianity , and they provide overwhelming reasons for its abandon - ment .
( Even if you discount half , two - thirds , or even three - quarters of these arguments , the conclusion is still irresistible . )
For further discussion of these issues , and for consideration of many others not even mentioned here , please see the following books and pamphlets :

A friend who read the first draft of this manuscript notes : “ My moronic sister - in - law once told me that God found her parking spots near the front door at Wal - mart !
Years later , when she developed a brain tumor , I concluded that God must have gotten tired of finding parking places for her and gave her the tumor so that she could get handicapped plates . ”
As Nietzsche put it in The Anti-Christ : “ that little hypocrites and half - crazed people dare to imagine that on their account the laws of nature are constantly broken — such an enhancement of every kind of selfishness to infinity , to impudence , cannot be branded with sufficient contempt .
And yet Christianity owes its triumph to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity . ” .
The Westboro Baptist Church directly addresses the question of its hatefulness and cruelty on its web site ( www.godhatesfags.com): " Why do you preach hate ?
Because the Bible preaches hate .
For every one verse about God 's mercy , love , compassion , etc. , there are two verses about His vengeance , hatred , wrath , etc. " .
The repeated mention of this sin in medieval ecclesiastical writings leads one to wonder how widespread this practice was among the Christian faithful , including the Christian clergy .
One 8th - century penitential ( list of sins and punishments ) quoted in A.A. Hadden ’s Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents states : " If a cleric has fornicated with a quadruped let him do penance for , if he is a simple cleric , two years , if a deacon , three years , if a priest , seven years , if a bishop ten years . " .
Given his religious background , and that his cult mixed Christianity with UFO beliefs , Applewhite was quite probably aware of the divine approbation of self - castration in Matthew 19:12 : " For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother ’s womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven ’s sake .
He that is able to receive it , let him receive it . "
He said he had received a call on Saturday from Tibet .
“ ‘ Please do n’t ask us to stop , ’ ” was the caller ’s request .
The Dalai Lama promised he would not , even though he said he expected the Chinese authorities to put down the protests with force .
“ Now we really need miracle power , ” he said , and then laughed .
“ But miracle seems unrealistic . ”
As he entertained questions for over an hour here inside a temple in the lap of snow - capped Himalayas , the limits of his influence , and even his “ middle path ” message of freedom for Tibetans , rather than total independence for Tibet , came into sharp relief , as thousands of mostly young Tibetan exiles raised a chorus of stridently anti-Chinese slogans and called for secession .
“ We the young people feel independence is our birthright , ” said Dolma Choephel , 34 , a social worker active with the Tibetan Youth Congress and who gathered Sunday morning at a demonstration outside the gates of the main town temple .
“ We understand the limitations of the Dalai Lama ’s approach .
What we got after six rounds of talks  this violence ? ”
She was referring to the six negotiating sessions between the Dalai Lama and Chinese authorities since 2002 .

Just behind where Ms. Choephel stood , Buddhist monks began a hunger strike .
Protesters laid down Chinese flags on the road , inviting cars and pedestrians to trample on them .
Later , thousands streamed down the hill , to Dharamsala town , the largest Tibetan settlement in India .
Many of them had painted their faces with the colors of the Tibetan flag .
“ Long live the Dalai Lama , ” they chanted , which made it plain that despite their far more radical calls , they remained loyal to his spiritual leadership .
Late Sunday evening , candles were lit on window sills and balconies across these hills .
Tibetan - owned shops were closed in solidarity with the demonstrations across the border .
The Indian authorities , meanwhile , found themselves in an uncomfortable diplomatic spot .
The Indian police earlier last week had arrested a group of demonstrators who vowed to walk roughly 900 miles from here to Lhasa , but allowed a second group to set off Saturday morning unimpeded .

Archbishop Hashem discussed the Saudi talks whilst visiting Qatar
Archbishop Paul - Mounged el - Hachem , one of Pope Benedict XVI 's most senior Middle East representatives , said the discussions had begun a few weeks ago .
But the archbishop cautioned that the Vatican could not predict the outcome .
The discussions come in the wake of King Abdullah 's historic meeting with the Pope at the Vatican last November .
A Catholic - Muslim Forum was also set up by the Pope two weeks ago to repair relations between the two faiths after the crisis caused by a speech he gave in Germany in 2006 , in which he appeared to associate Islam with violence .
' Reciprocity '
The disclosure of talks between the Vatican and Saudi Arabia , which do not have diplomatic ties , came soon after the first Roman Catholic church in the Qatari capital , Doha , was opened in a service attended by 15,000 people .
Archbishop Hachem , the Apostolic Nuncio to Kuwait , Qatar , Yemen , Bahrain and the UAE , who attended the inauguration , said he hoped there would soon be a similar church for the many Christians in neighbouring Saudi Arabia .
If we manage to obtain authorisation for the construction of the first church , it will be an outcome of historic dimensions
Father Federico Lombardi
Spokesman for Pope Benedict
" Discussions are under way to allow the construction of churches in the kingdom , " he said .
Although he made clear the outcome was uncertain , the archbishop added that a church in Saudi Arabia would be an important sign of " reciprocity " between Muslims and Christians .
The Vatican has noted that Muslims are free to worship openly in Europe and demands religious freedom as a condition for the opening of diplomatic relations .
About a million Catholics , many of them migrant workers from the Philippines , live in Saudi Arabia .
They are allowed to worship in private , mostly in people 's homes , but worship in public places and outward signs of faith , such as crucifixes , are forbidden .
The last Christian priest was expelled from the kingdom in 1985 .
Christians complain that rules are not clear and that the Saudi religious authorities , who enforce the kingdom 's conservative brand of Islam , Wahhabism , sometimes crack down on legitimate congregations .
The authorities cite a tradition of the Prophet Muhammad that only Islam can be practised in the Arabian Peninsula .
A spokesman for Pope Benedict , Father Federico Lombardi , said : " If we manage to obtain authorisation for the construction of the first church , it will be an outcome of historic dimensions . "
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr called on Thursday for a million Iraqis to march against U.S. “ occupiers ” , threatening a massive show of strength a week after his Mehdi Army militia battled U.S. and government troops .

The government said it would not try to block the April 9 march if it was peaceful , though Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who ordered a crackdown on militia in the southern city of Basra last week , threatened more strikes against Sadr ’s strongholds .
A statement released by Sadr ’s office in the holy city of Najaf called on Iraqis of all sects to descend on the southern city , site of annual Shi’ite pilgrimages that attract hundreds of thousands of worshippers .
“ The time has come to express your rejections and raise your voices loud against the unjust occupier and enemy of nations and humanity , and against the horrible massacres committed by the occupier against our honorable people , ” it said .
The demonstration , called for the fifth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad on Wednesday , raises the prospect of unrest coinciding with a politically sensitive progress report to Congress by the top U.S. officials in Iraq .
“ If his intention is to get a whole lot of people together and go and make trouble in Najaf , I do n’t think that is going to be very popular , ” U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker told a briefing .
U.S. forces called in helicopter strikes during a clash with suspected Sadr gunmen on Thursday in the city of Hilla and bombed a house in Basra overnight , after days of relative calm that followed a truce Sadr announced on Sunday .
The truce ended six days of fighting that spread through southern Iraq and Baghdad .
Officially , the Iraqi government is sanguine about the march .
Interior Ministry spokesman Major - General Abdul - Karim Khalaf told Reuters : “ The right to hold a peaceful demonstration and express opinions is guaranteed by the constitution . ”
But Maliki has been uncompromising toward the Sadrists , fellow Shi’ites who helped install him in power in 2006 but broke with the government last year .
The prime minister told reporters the Basra crackdown could be repeated elsewhere , listing the Shula and Sadr City districts , Sadr strongholds in the capital .
“ Basra was a prisoner and now it has been freed , ” Maliki said .
“ Other cities need the same battle , and also Baghdad in areas where people are still in the hands of these gangsters . ”
A senior member of Sadr ’s bloc in parliament , Bahaa al - Araji , said the prime minister “ must stop playing with fire , or the Sadr bloc and the Mehdi Army are ready for this battle , a crucial battle ” .
In a later statement , Sadr accused elements in the security forces of continuing to arrest his followers .
“ We advise everybody to end the disturbances and to stop the shedding of blood and the arrests immediately , ” he said .
MOBILISATION
Sadr has millions of followers and was able to summon tens of thousands of people onto the streets of Baghdad for demonstrations during last week ’s fighting .

The cleric also called for a “ peaceful sit-in ” in Baghdad on Friday to protest against bombings , arrests and vehicle bans that continue to seal off parts of the capital .
Police sources in the Shi’ite city of Hilla said five people were killed in Thursday ’s predawn clash and helicopter strike , including four policemen .
U.S. forces said the fighting erupted when gunmen fired on them as they attempted an arrest .
A U.S. military spokesman said an air strike in Basra killed “ one enemy ” late on Wednesday .
Reuters television pictures showed a woman ’s body in the rubble and rescue workers searching for more dead .
Police sources said at least three people had died including a mother , father and son , and three were seriously wounded .
Last week ’s violence exposed a deep rift within Iraq ’s majority Shi’ite community and served as a reminder of the instability after months of security improvements .
Hundreds died , making March the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians since last August , according to government figures .
Crocker and General David Petraeus , the top U.S. civilian and military officials in Iraq , will report to Congress next week and are expected to recommend a pause in U.S. troop cuts after July to safeguard the past year ’s improvements .
When Hillary Clinton told the Washington Post the other day that the Florida and Michigan primary questions could well be settled by the Democratic Convention ’s credentials committee , many of us shook our heads knowingly and acted like we knew what that really meant .
Thankfully , Greg Sargent at TPM has done some actual research and produced his “ Election Central Idiot ’s Guide To The Credentials Committee . ”
His findings :
There are a total of 186 members on the credentials committee .
Twenty five of them are appointed by DNC chair Howard Dean , and the remainder are alloted by state , in numbers based on each state ’s population and Democratic performance …
In the end the breakdown on the committee will hew very closely to the overall breakdown of pledged delegates .
So presuming things continue as they have , Hillary will not have a majority , and Obama will have more members on the committee than she does .
Then what happens ?
Well , the Florida and Michigan delegations will petition to be seated .
The delegations can ask for a straight seating or they can suggest more creative solutions to the problem .
Alternatively , outside parties might suggest solutions to the committee , too .
There is no formal process by which the committee decides to vote on any particular proposal .
So , basically , after some discussion , the committee agrees to hold a vote on a particular proposal for seating the delegations in one way or another .
( Or , alternatively , the committee would consider separate solutions to each state ’s problem . )
At this point , three things can happen .
(1) If a majority of the committee supports the proposal without significant dissent , the delegations are seated according to the proposal ’s directives .
(2) If a majority of the committee supports the proposal but 20 percent or more dissent , they get to issue a minority report — and the proposal goes to the full convention for a vote .
(3) If the proposal does n’t get majority support , the delegations are n’t seated .
In number ( 2 ) there lies the capacity for a minority on the committee to create mischief .
So here ’s the takeaway : Hillary will not have a majority on the committee ; neither will Obama , though he will have more members than she does .
But Hilllary ’s supporters could conceivably force a full convention vote on whatever proposal the committee considers .
Is that likely ?
Not really .
The credentials committee is unlikely to consider a proposal that is flat - out opposed by either campaign .
And even so , Hillary supporters would be unlikely to take so drastic a step , because it probably would n’t prevent the ultimate passage of the proposal in question — and would end up getting them blamed for the mess that would inevitably ensue .
So there you have it .

The peak body representing spirit manufacturers says sales figures show the Federal Government 's tax increase on alcopops has led to more dangerous drinking behaviour .
The Distilled Spirits Industry Council says the latest figures show sales of pre-mixed alcoholic drinks have fallen by almost 40 per cent since last month 's tax increase .
But sales of bottles of pure spirits have increased by about 20 per cent .
Council spokesman Steve Riden says that means more people are mixing their drinks themselves .
" That has increased the danger because people do n't know what they 're drinking across the drinking occasion , " she said .
" People pour heavier and heavier measures and we think that a lot of people are going to be drinking more than they intended to . "
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon has rejected the claims , saying the figures show that the tax increase is achieving its aim of curbing binge drinking among young people .
" Consumption of the products that are targeted and [ are ] particularly attractive to young people [ has ] dropped dramatically , " she said .
" There has been an increase in some others , but the industry itself admits that the overall decrease is in the order of a million spirit drinks in just two weeks . "
[ digg- reddit - me ]
The 17th most popular story on reddit at the moment is this hit piece by the Judicial Watch .
The Judicial Watch , as some fact - checking reveals , is funded by rather right - wing sources :
Judicial Watch receives funding from mainly conservative sources .
In 2002 , Judicial Watch received $ 1.1 million from The Carthage Foundation and a further $ 400,000 from the Sarah Scaife Foundation .
Both foundations are Managed by Richard Mellon Scaife .
The year before the Scaife Foundation gave $ 1.35 million and Carthage $ 500,000 .
In all , between 1997 and 2002 Judicial Watch received $ 7,069,500 ( unadjusted for inflation ) in 19 grants from a handful of foundations .
The bulk of this funding came from just three foundations – the Sarah Scaife Foundation , The Carthage Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation , Inc .
The Judicial Watch was also one of the main groups pushing impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky matter , subpoening Linda Tripp , and starting over 15 lawsuits against President Clinton .
They are one arm of the Republican noise machine .
And reddit is falling for it .
The list they give of the most corrupt officials fits a bit too easily into the Republican agenda .
As Huckabee and Giuliani are the two greatest threats to the Republican coalition of evangelicals and everyone else , they are easy to include .
Larry Craig is a gay Republican – who has embarrassed Republicans enormously .
Finally , Scooter Libby who has been indicted .
It ’s an easy list .
The list of Democrats though seems to be those conservatives fear most – Hillary , Obama , Pelosi , Reid , Feinstein , etcetera .
In short , Reddit is currently promoting a right - wing hit piece created by a propaganda organization that was created to promote the Lewinsky affair .
Most important – at least some of the facts included in the piece are wrong .
Defending Obama
I am only defending Obama here , although I am sure most of the other Democrats on the list – Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , John Conyers , Dianne Feinstain , and even maybe Hillary Clinton – are being unfairly targeted , because I am already aware of the bogus - ness of the charges against Obama .
Or at least the flimsiness .
And of course – I admit – I ’m biased in favor of Obama .
It took me a long time to come to see Obama as the best candidate ; and although I am still open to another candidate , I ’ve examined each of them pretty closely , and his views and temperament seem closest to my own .
Obama has certainly faced criticism for his ties to Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko who was a big supporter of Obama ’s career from the beginning .
The senator explained the appearance of impropriety that the reddit submitter referred to thus :
“ It was simply not good enough that I paid above the appraised value for the strip of land that he sold me .
It was a mistake to have been engaged with him at all in this or any other personal business dealing that would allow him , or anyone else , to believe that he had done me a favor , ” the senator said .
To me , it seems clear that Rezko was trying to do Obama a favor – probably expecting something in return at some point ; and Obama should have realized this and rejected the offer .
But aside from this lapse in judgment , it does not demonstrate corruption .
And as the sale was a transparent process that was revealed as soon as it had occurred , it does not seem intentional on Obama ’s part .
The charge relating to the $ 5,000 worth of stock really has no depth to it .
Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign Wednesday defended two investments he made right after his election to the Senate , saying he was unaware of the stock purchases at the time and did nothing to directly aid either company in its business before the federal government …
Obama purchased $ 5,000 in shares for AVI , which was developing a drug to treat avian flu .
Two weeks after buying the stock , Obama pushed for more federal funding to fight the disease , but company officials said they never talked to Obama about his work in the area …
The reports found no evidence that any of his actions ended up benefiting either company during the roughly eight months he owned the stocks .
In other words , Obama ’s broker ( who kept Obama ’s money in a blind trust ) bought stocks which were related to some hot button issues of the day ; and as a Senator , Obama gave a speech pushing for federal funding to fight avian flu .
The amounts of money involved in both transactions are minimal .
As for the final charge : “ Obama was also nabbed conducting campaign business in his Senate office , a violation of federal law . ”
I have no idea what the Judicial Watch is talking about .
Someone please enlighten me if you do .

The good news , however , is that practice increases willpower capacity , so that in the long run , buying less now may improve our ability to achieve future goals  like losing those 10 pounds we gained when we were n’t out shopping .
The brain ’s store of willpower is depleted when people control their thoughts , feelings or impulses , or when they modify their behavior in pursuit of goals .
Psychologist Roy Baumeister and others have found that people who successfully accomplish one task requiring self - control are less persistent on a second , seemingly unrelated task .
In one pioneering study , some people were asked to eat radishes while others received freshly baked chocolate chip cookies before trying to solve an impossible puzzle .
The radish - eaters abandoned the puzzle in eight minutes on average , working less than half as long as people who got cookies or those who were excused from eating radishes .

This is the first of a two - part post .
Tomorrow , Ricki will examine how this gap is widening on genetic testing .
The disconnect between what biomedical scientists know and what health care consumers believe is growing , particularly for stem cell treatments .
The ability to send a skin cell back in developmental time to reinvent itself is a giant step forward , if expected since cell biologists started cataloging stemness genes years ago , George W. Bushs partial claim to the idea notwithstanding .
Even the glitch that some of those reprogramming genes cause cancer will vanish with refined recipes for making the coveted induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells .
Researchers have also quietly coaxed pluripotent cells from the likes of testes , teeth , fat , and bone marrow , as well as from the medical trash heap , including placenta and umbilical cord membranes and even menstrual blood .
Stem - like cells also hail from fetal cells lingering in womens bloodstreams and self - fertilized eggs .
So far the new contenders in the human embryonic stem ( hES ) cell stakes seem to be the real deal iPS cells have normal chromosomes , surfaces like those of true hES cells , and they can self - renew while also giving rise to all tissue layers of the embryo .
However , because appearances can be deceiving , the International Society for Stem Cell Research warns that a great deal of work remains before these methods can be used to generate stem cells suitable for safe and effective therapies .
In just a few months , though , iPS cells have proven themselves able to recapitulate more than a dozen diseases in vitro , providing unprecedented glimpses of the genesis of pathology .
Their potential is staggering .
Still , they are not quite ready for prime time in the clinic .
Youd never know it from the Web .
I recently lost a dear friend to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , aka Lou Gehrigs disease ) .
I googled ALS and stem cells , knowing all too well that the one approved drug only modestly extends life in a few patients .
Within seconds , the website for an Israeli company , Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics , materialized , sharing the good news that ALS patients treated with the companys NurOwnTM therapeutic cells are expected to enjoy a rapid recovery and much enhanced quality of life .
Are expected were the operative words .
In fact , the company , from which my inquisitive e-mails boomeranged , is initiating a series of efficacy and safety studies toward a cure for ALS that will place human bone marrow stem cells into the mouse model used to develop the one existing drug , and then test the rodents on a rotating rod , a standard technique .
Brainstorm would not have been much help to my friend .
More disturbing was EmCell , a Ukrainian company that claims the worlds ( sic ) largest clinical experience in embryonic stem cell transplants for various diseases and conditions .
Their 16 years of international clinical experience in transplantation of human embryonic / fetal stem cells raised the first red flag , since human ES cells debuted 10 years ago , not 16 .
The second alert was the mention of types of ES cells , a contradiction in terms .
But it was the description of their ALS therapy that revealed the mistaken identity .
The embryonic stem cells that EmCell uses to treat ALS come from cell suspensions obtained from growth zones of 4 - 8 weeks old cadaverous embryos systems and organs .
Maybe the methods were lost in translation , but a dissected full - fledged embryo does not yield hES cells .
Those cells are born in cell culture , descended from much simpler structures .
Would a desperate ALS patient who pays $ 15,000 for the treatment know that ?
EmCell is selling false hope that could taint the promise of actual hES cell therapies being developed at many companies .
The gap looms between experimental and medical science .
I do not think it is ethical to market treatments that have not undergone randomized , controlled clinical trials , replication , and validation .

In a “ major step ” toward a practical energy source for powering tomorrow ’s nanomachines , researchers in Arizona report development of a new generation of sub-microscopic nanomotors that are up to 10 times more powerful than existing motors .
Their study is scheduled for the May 27 issue of ACS Nano journal .
In the new study , Joseph Wang and colleagues point out that existing nanomotors , including so - called “ catalytic nanomotors , ” are made with gold and platinum nanowires and use hydrogen peroxide fuel for self - propulsion .
But these motors are too slow and inefficient for practical use , with top speeds of about 10 micrometers per second , the researchers say .
Wang and colleagues supercharged their nanomotors by inserting carbon nanotubes into the platinum , thus boosting average speed to 60 micrometers per second .
Spiking the hydrogen peroxide fuel with hydrazine ( a type of rocket fuel ) kicked up the speed still further , to 94 - 200 micrometers per second .
This innovation “ offers great promise for self - powered nanoscale transport and delivery systems , ” the scientists state .

After weeks of personal pondering and not a little anguish , New Mexico 's Gov. Bill Richardson ha s decided to endorse Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination .
The official endorsement will come later today in Portland , Ore. , according to the Associated Press .
Richardson , who ran against both of the surviving Democratic candidates , Illinois Sen. Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , is the nation 's only Latino governor .
He gave up his own run for the White House on Jan. 10 after never really gaining much traction -- he garnered barely 2 % of the caucus votes in Iowa -- amid suspicions he was really auditioning as a possible vice presidential nominee for the party 's eventual winner .
That suspicion might still be there .
Richardson and the less - experienced Obama could make a good fit since such a combo brings a Latino link to the nation 's fastest - growing population sector , a managerial link both as a Cabinet secretary and a state chief executive , diplomatic experience as a troubleshooter and U.N. ambassador and , especially , someone not recently connected to Washington and from the once - staunchly Republican Rocky Mountain corridor .
After a series of initial stumbles , Richardson did show some flash during a summer debate in Des Moines when he referred to both Clinton and Obama .
" You know , " he said with a smile , " I think that Sen .
Obama does represent change .
Sen. Clinton has experience .
Change and experience : With me , you get both . "
Had it come earlier , the governor 's endorsement could have helped Obama stem Clinton 's victories in Texas and California , where she showed real strength in Latino communities .
In fact , she won the Democratic primary in Richardson 's home state with a 2 - to - 1 majority among Latinos .

Porn Stats
Come to think of it , there has n't ever been a good pornography discussion on this site — and this post probably is n't it — but some of the facts laid out in American Sexuality article on the subject seem worth tucking away for future reference :
From research and the testimony of women who have been prostituted and used in pornography , we know that childhood sexual assault ( which often leads victims to see their value in the world primarily as the ability to provide sexual pleasure for men ) and economic hardship ( a lack of meaningful employment choices at a livable wage ) are key factors in many women ’s decisions to enter the sex industry .
( For a good summary of this evidence see Margaret Baldwin ’s article " Split at the Root : Prostitution and Feminist Discourses of Law Reform , " 5 Yale Journal of Law & Feminism 47 , 1992 . )
We know how women in the sex industry — not all , but many — routinely dissociate to cope with what they do .
We know that in one study of 130 street prostitutes , 68 % met the diagnostic criteria for post - traumatic stress disorder .
( For details on this , see the work of Melissa Farley , " Prostitution , Violence , and Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder . " )

Alito and Abortion
So Samuel A. Alito , Jr. will be the new Supreme Court dude .
Emphasis on " dude " .
Or emphasis on " fascist " .
Whatever .
Anyway , I 've been reading his infamous Planned Parenthood v. Casey , the one in which he upheld a spousal notification law for abortions , and it 's important to hash this out .
The conservative defense of Alito will be that it was n't his job to decide whether the law was good public policy or not , merely to decide whether it was constitutional ; and on the latter , he was upholding what he thought were the precedents on abortion at the time .
That 's not implausible ; see this passage :
Taken together , Justice O’Connor ’s [ earlier ] opinions reveal that an undue burden does not exist unless a law ( a ) prohibits abortion or gives another person the authority to veto an abortion or ( b ) has the practical effect of imposing " severe limitations , " rather than simply inhibiting abortions " to some degree ' " or inhibiting " some women . "
In Alito 's defense , it 's sometimes hard to figure out exactly what Sandra Day O'Connor intends in her opinions — often only she knows for sure — and prior to Planned Parenthood , the Supreme Court had placed restrictions on abortion that , while not " severe , " probably did prevent some women from getting abortions .
So Alito 's ruling partially stems from previous Supreme Court sloppiness , it seems .
Meanwhile , the plaintiffs who opposed the spousal notification law had not shown that the 5 percent of women who do n't notify their husbands would in fact be harmed by the new law .
( The law leaves an out for women who have " reason to believe that notification is likely to result in the infliction of bodily injury upon her . " )
On one level , then , Alito 's opinion is sort of reasonable .
But on another level , it 's not .
It 's ridiculous .
It 's dangerous .
It 's wrong .
According to Alito , because only a small number of women might face an " undue burden " in theory , but that 's not known for sure , the law is just fine and dandy ?
What kind of legal principle is that ?
The Supreme Court obviously
This all matters very , very much because in an upcoming abortion case , Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood , the Supreme Court will decide just this sort of dry procedural issue : on whether litigants need to show that an abortion restriction places an " undue burden " on women in the abstract — and is therefore unconstitutional — or must show that it places an " undue burden " in a particular case .
Alito would appear to side with the latter view , and a ruling this way would make it very hard for women to challenge abortion restrictions ( litigants would have to show that parts of the law affect them personally ) , and the net effect would be that Roe v. Wade , for all practical purposes ,
The political issue here is that over 70 percent of Americans support spousal notification laws , and if Democrats try to fight on that terrain , they could well lose .
[ EDIT : Sorry , I did n't intend this to mean that they should n't even try to convince people otherwise ; they should . ]
But there 's so much more at stake here .

And that includes women potentially affected .

Feed the Beast
" Starve the beast " — Grover Norquist 's theory that cutting taxes and running massive deficits will somehow force Congress to rein in spending — obviously looks flimsy after the high - spending Reagan and Bush years .
Even the Cato Institute
The increased fiscal gap also makes future government policy far less predictable .
Having a looming debt of that size will stir every interest group in Washington to try to influence future policy .
It wo n't be possible to take any government commitment for granted for more than a few years .
With even Social Security and Medicare likely to be on the chopping block eventually , no group or lobby will be able to rely on political inertia to protect what it now has .
That is an enviable state for members of Congress set on gaining campaign funds , but a worrisome situation for the rest of us .
Judging from the past four years , this seems anecdotally true — out - of - control deficits lead not only to more spending , but worse spending , tilted heavily towards lobbyists and other interest groups .
Alternatively , one could look at it this way : when various political interests see certain groups rewarded with tax cuts , they feel they should be rewarded too .
So the squabbling begins .
Meanwhile , so long as government spending is being paid for with borrowing and future taxes rather than present - day taxes , it 's very easy for Congress to spend more than it otherwise would .
( Which is why , of course , big - government liberals have usually opposed balanced budgets . )
Ultimately , it 's probably easiest to restrain government spending after tax increases — since that sets a general tone of fiscal austerity , and perhaps becomes easier for Congressmen to turn down spending requests .
Divided government probably helps too .
Obviously , though , from a Republican perspective , Bush - and Reagan - style tax cuts do accomplish two very important things : they redistribute wealth upwards — rather than tax the rentier class to pay for spending , the government just borrows from them instead and pays them interest for their generosity ( during the Reagan years , that interest was paid with cutting party , meanwhile , can spend more freely ) .
It 's all very clever , at least so long as deficits do n't collapse the economy and prompt a socialist takeover of government .
But that looks increasingly unlikely .

It 's all very clever , at least so long as deficits do n't collapse the economy and prompt a socialist takeover of government .

The Other Intelligence Story
Hm .
What to write about ?
Scooter Libby ?
Nah , not dull enough .
Oh , what about John Negroponte 's new that 's the dullness we need .
Important , though , especially since the new report does n't have much to say about one of , I think , the United States ' most persistent intelligence weaknesses over the past decade .
More on that in a bit .

Apart from the last , which is bizarre , this is all pretty uncontroversial and likely useful — up to a point .
The idea that we need to " improve and integrate " our intelligence is always a nice platitude , but it 's worth stepping back and asking how we got to where we are .
In this day and age , curiously , every major foreign policy move needs to be backed , it seems , by ultra - solid intelligence — as if to give the public a veneer of objectivity for what are often simply judgment calls , hunches , guesses .

The Bush administration may have been particularly flagrant about " stove - piping " CIA reports during the march to war in Iraq , true , but any policymaker who gets it in his or her head to pursue a course of action will have to do the same to some degree or other , because he or she will want backing from the intelligence agencies , and they can often provide no such thing .
Now Congress can always re-jigger the ways in which the various agencies are set up , as it recently did , and maybe that will alleviate some of the pressure from here , but the implicit " politicization " of intelligence can never go away completely .
In a better world , policymakers would just acknowledge that intelligence is highly imperfect even in the best of times , and tell voters that ultimately , their national security decisions are primarily judgment calls , rather than obvious conclusions borne of intelligence .
So many charades could be dispensed with .
( Including the idea that ordinary citizens are n't informed enough to form an opinion on foreign policy decisions — a fiction that should have been buried by the Iraq war . )
This cultural change will never happen , of course .
So the real problem is that foreign policies that put an impossibly high burden on intelligence — the Bush doctrine and preventive war come to mind — will likely fail more often than not .

Nah , not dull enough .
Oh , what about John Negroponte 's new " National Intelligence Strategy , " released last week .
Yes , the dullness we need .
Important , though , especially since the new report does n't have much to say about one of , I think , the United States ' most persistent intelligence weaknesses over the past decade .
More on that in a bit .

Holy Nanotech Batman
Check out
No , really , it 's pretty stunning to see how much research money is poured into weapons .
Over Check out the list of potential new nanobiotechnology weapons under development by the U.S. military .
Let 's see , we 've got : ultralight body armor ; " artificial muscles " built of nanomaterial ; nanotech sensors capable of detecting individual molecules ; camouflage suits that automatically heal a wounded soldier .
It 's every adolescent 's comic - book fantasy !
Now all we need to do is start a war or two to test this stuff out …
No , really , it 's pretty stunning to see how much research money is poured into weapons .
Over a third of NIAD 's basic research is now in biodefense , and that 's a growing share of a shrinking research budget .
" Biodefense " is much like missile defense , only infinitely more lunatic , and in practice ends up creating ever more deadly biological weapons — necessary to test out the defenses , see — potentially kicking off a bioweapons arms race .
Meanwhile , there 's no money left for flu vaccines , or much of anything else .
We are insane .
Human beings are insane .
But at least we 'll have cool armor .
Assume the Worst
In the New Republic today , Clay Risen has a appearing to care more about its workers :
The memo is the result of a study carried out in coordination with McKinsey , the elite consulting firm -- and it shows in its fantastic grasp of [ Wal - Mart 's ] numbers and abysmal conception of the workers who make them possible .
One proposal would replace the current 401 ( k ) program , into which the company puts a fixed percentage of the employee 's wage , with a matching program , in which the company 's contribution is equal to the employee 's ( this on top of the proposed cut in company contributions , from 4 percent to 3 percent ) .
From a cost - savings point of view , this is a brutally efficient strategy -- after all , the average Wal - Mart employee makes $ 17,500 a year .
How many are going to set aside 3 percent of that for retirement ?
What 's amazing , though , is that the memo 's author , Susan Chambers , seems to believe that employees would actually like this reduction in benefits , because , for those who can somehow afford to take full advantage , it " would help Associates better prepare for retirement . "
Then there is the proposal to shift all employees into health - savings plans , replacing traditional insurance with tax - free bank accounts in which both employees and the company set aside money ; they then use that money to pay for doctor visits , prescriptions , and so on .
Again , from a coldly rational point of view , this makes certain sense :
The more financial responsibility employees bear in their health - care costs , the less they are likely to spend .
The problem is that , again , poorly paid employees are unlikely to make the sort of contributions necessary to cover expenses .
Moreover , it 's much easier for the company to quietly adjust its own contributions to employee health downward , a fact sneakily acknowledged by the memo ( though instead of proposing a check it merely recommends more p.r. : " Wal - Mart will have to be sophisticated and forceful in communicating this change " ) .
That 's the crux of it : Wal - Mart will use some nifty gimmicks to slash its workers ' health and retirement benefits and then just pretend that this counts as an improvement .
Ultimately , of course , this wo n't work .
Wal - Mart 's critics have bullshit detectors like few other groups of people on the planet , and always , always , always assume the worst about the store .
The company will never appease its " well - funded and well - organized " attackers until it actually starts offering substantial benefits for workers .
Although , do note , Wal - Mart executives are probably paranoid that the critics want to destroy the company altogether , rather than merely improve the lives of its workers , so maybe Wal - Mart thinks that there are no steps ever worth taking — because its enemies will never be appeased .
Surely it does n't help when lunatic lefties start writing posts like " Abolish the Corporation , " either .
Alternatively , of course , Wal - Mart could solve its problems by lobbying for some sort of government - run health insurance , which would relieve the company of the burden of covering workers in the first place .
It probably will end up doing this , although it wo n't lobby for single - payer , but rather the GOP 's plans for government - financed Health Savings Accounts , high - deductible insurance , and tax credits , along with a phase - out of the employer - health tax deduction ; two steps that I think would let Wal - Mart and other big companies wash their hands of handling health insurance without having to pay taxes for some sort of single - payer system .
We 'll see .

No larger moral lurking here , but Dexter Filkins ' New York Times Magazine
The tough tactics employed by Sassaman 's battalion had their effect .
Attacks in the Sunni villages like Abu Hishma , wrapped in barbed wire , dropped sharply .
And his men succeeded in retaking Samarra .
Winning the long - term allegiance of the Iraqis in those areas was another matter , however .
If many Iraqis in the Sunni Triangle were ever open to the American project - the Shiite cities like Balad excepted - very few of them are anymore .
Majool Saadi Muhammad , 49 , a tribal leader in Abu Hishma , said that he had harbored no strong feelings about the Americans when they arrived in April 2003 and was proud to have three sons serving in the new American - backed Iraqi Army .
Then the raids began , and many of Abu Hishma 's young men were led away in hoods and cuffs .
In early 2004 , he said , Sassaman led a raid on his house , kicking in the doors and leaving the place a shambles .
" There is no explanation except to humiliate , " Muhammad told me .
" I really hate them . "
In retrospect , it is not clear what strategy , if any , would have won over Sunni towns like Samarra and Abu Hishma .
Crack down , and the Iraqis grew resentful ; ease up , and the insurgents came on strong .
As Sassaman pointed out , the Americans poured $ 7 million of reconstruction money into Samarra , and even today , the town is not completely under American control .
But there is another reason American commanders shy from using violence on civilians : the effects it has on their own men .
Pittard , the American commander in Baquba , says that he was careful not to give his men too much leeway in using nonlethal force .
It was n't just that he regarded harsh tactics as self - defeating .
He feared his men could get out of control .
" We were not into reprisals , " Pittard says .
" It 's a fine line .
If you are not careful , your discipline will break down . "
In most of the 20th century 's guerrilla wars , the armies of the countries battling the insurgents have suffered serious breakdowns in discipline .
This was true of the Americans in Vietnam , the French in Algeria and the Soviets in Afghanistan .
Martin van Creveld , a historian at Hebrew University of Jerusalem , says that soldiers in the dominant army often became demoralized by the frustrations of trying to defeat guerrillas .
Nearly every major counterinsurgency in the 20th century failed .
" The soldiers fighting the insurgents became demoralized because they were the strong fighting the weak , " van Creveld says .
" Everything they did seemed to be wrong .
If they let the weaker army kill them , they were idiots .
If they attacked the smaller army , they were seen as killers .
The effect , in nearly every case , is demoralization and breakdowns of discipline . "

Abolish the Corporation !
Er , Maybe .
Steven Greenhouse 's New York Times Time 's new
How did we get into this mess ?
I mean , the quick ' n ' dirty answer is that in the postwar era , short - sighted union leaders bargained with employers for corporate benefits rather than stumping en masse for universal health care and super - Social Security .
But why , in this day and age , are companies still forced to worry about health care and retirement funds ?
They should n't have to do it ; the system only encourages Wal - Mart - esque behavior , and makes it hard for businesses to compete globally .
Luckily , good liberals have an exit strategy : the government should handle health care and retirement , so that corporations can get back to what they do best : focusing on profit - making .
GM would no longer have to operate as a " social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself , " and the business of America could be business once again .
Only the state can free the market from these heavy chains , say liberals .
On most days , I 'd agree with this .
But is all this really the best way to go , or only yet another short - sighted solution to a longstanding problem ?
Let 's digress for a bit .
There is , of course , no such thing as a truly " free " market , only types of markets designed by the state , and it's hard to figure out what the ideal design really is .
The framers of the Constitution never predicted that the corporation as we know it would ever exist — at the time of the American Revolution , there were only franchises charted by legislatures for public purposes .
The Jacksonians , aiming to curb corruption , later revised the corporate charter and opened it up to all comers , but never intended to exempt corporations from the common law or social responsibility .
It was n't until the late 1800s that New Jersey changed all that , rewriting its charter laws to allow corporations to do whatever they damn well pleased .
Soon all the major corporations were flocking to New Jersey , and states were forced to compete with each other for lax charters ( thanks especially to several Supreme Court decisions protecting charters and declaring corporations " persons " entitled to full constitutional protection — including out - of - state recognition ) .
Toss in decades of lavish federal subsidies and voila , we 've got corporate America .
Hence the modern " free market " that conservatives have fought so hard to protect against " state intrusion . "
True legal originalists would overturn Santa Clara County vs. Southern Pacific Railroad Company — which gave corporations 14th amendment protection — as an unconscionable act of judicial activism , though do n't expect anything along these lines today ( nor , necessarily , should there be ) .
But that 's just to say that ultimately nothing stops citizens from revising corporate charter law , if needed .
Charters are n't sacred .
That leaves the question of whether to do so .
The situation we have today , in which firms like Wal - Mart and GM are obliged to cater to shareholders ( in theory at least ) , but somehow got lumped with these other profit - draining social responsibilities , like paying for prescription drugs — is untenable .
It 's no surprise , then , that , as Time details , companies are raiding and shedding their pensions and getting the government to bail them out of their obligations to retirees whenever possible .
It 's what they 're " supposed " to do .
Again , one response is to say , " Enough , enough " and just make the government assume primary responsibility for all these profit - draining obligations .
Set up basic universal healthcare and mandatory savings accounts , and let corporations offer extra benefits only insofar as they need to compete for workers .
Taxpayers will foot the rest .
That way , unions can stop haggling with employers over premiums and deductibles and focus instead on wages and workplace conditions .
It 's a far more rational and stable system than what we have now , true .
But why we think it will be any more sustainable , over the long haul , than the postwar bargain struck fifty years ago is a good question .
Is n't it likely that , even if we had a single - payer health care system and " mandatory savings accounts " , companies would still offer extra benefits to workers , only to blow the whole thing up down the road when they decide it 's no longer profitable to support increasingly long - living retirees ?
Alternatively — and you see this proposal at WTO protests or in never work in The Globalized Economy ™ ; companies could n't compete ! "
Or : " Fool !
We tried this already ; it was called ' Fascist Italy . ' "
Yeah , yeah .
Still , the idea that companies should just do their thing while government can swoop in later and pick up the mess looks less and less appealing by the day .
Steven Greenhouse 's article today on how Wal - Mart is trying to pare down its health - care costs makes for depressing reading alongside 's new cover story on those ever - shrinking corporate pension funds .
The short story : Companies do n't want to be on the hook for medical or retirement costs .
Wal - Mart 's first order of business is to keep its profits rising , which means insuring its employees as little as public opinion will allow .
( Ensuring high turnover helps . )
Meanwhile , managers across America have been raiding and overstating their company 's pension holdings , while forking over millions to takeover artists and CEOs .
Congress has let them get away with it by promising , dubiously , to take care of the retirees if things go badly .
The abstract term for this is " moral hazard " ; the more concrete term , I believe , is : " retirees recycling cans to avoid eating garbage . "
But fear not : as long as shareholders are happy , capitalism is working .
We know because they tell us so .

Alternatively — and you see this proposal at WTO protests or in Multinational Monitor from time to time — we could start rewriting corporate charters , drastically , and require companies to worry about this stuff .
Always seems iffy , but you know .
Perhaps in the end we could even hack away at a good deal of government regulation ; there 'd be no need if companies were beholden to civil authority , as was the case in the 19th century , and required to meet their social responsibilities in whatever manner they find most efficient .
What would that mean for health care ?
I do n't know .
State - run health insurance might still probably be the best way to go .
Fine .
Perhaps charter revision would prove far more useful in other areas , like in environmental conduct .
( I 'm not sold on the current " corporate responsibility " trend underway . )
But corporations were originally designed by the people and for the people ; why not have them act that way ?
" Ah , " one will say , " but that sort of thing wouldwork in The Globalized Economy ™ ; companies could n't compete ! "
Or : " Fool !

Yeah , yeah .

Against Homework
Question of the day : Is homework even necessary ?
Ayelet Waldman
I also learned from professor Cooper -- aka the homework guru -- that there is no correlation between how much homework young children do and how well they comprehend material or perform on tests .
[ n.b. , see also this study . ]
Why ? …
Because their attention spans are just too short -- they can't tune out external stimuli to focus on material .
Second , younger children cannot tell the difference between the hard stuff and the easy stuff .
They 'll spend 15 minutes beating their heads against a difficult problem , and leave themselves no time to copy their spelling words .
Finally , young children do not know how to self - test .
They have n't the faintest idea when they 're making mistakes , so in the end they do n't actually learn the correct answers .
It is n't until middle school and high school that the relationship between homework and school achievement becomes apparent .
So why the hell do Zeke and I have to spend every afternoon gnashing our teeth …
The reasons , Cooper says , extend beyond Zeke 's achievement in this particular grade .
Apparently , by slaving over homework with my son , I am expressing to him how important school is . …
When younger kids are given homework , Cooper says , it can also help them understand that all environments are learning ones , not just the classroom .
For example , by helping calculate the cost of items on a trip to the grocery store , they can learn about math .
The problem is , none of my children 's assignments have this real - world , enjoyable feel to them .
My children have never been assigned Cooper 's favorite reading task -- the back of the Rice Krispies box .
The final , and perhaps most important , reason to assign homework to young children , says Cooper , is to help them develop study habits and time management skills that they 'll need to succeed later on in their academic careers .
If you wait until middle school to teach them these skills , they 'll be behind .
I suppose this makes sense .
Spending their afternoons slaving over trigonometry and physics will come as no surprise to my kids .
By the time they 're in seventh grade they wo n't even remember what it 's like to spend an idle afternoon .
I guess that settles that : Everyone go out and play .
Seriously .
Also , let me call bullshit on Dr. Cooper and doubt very much that homework " help [s children ] develop study habits and time management skills . "
Generalizing from a single experience here , when I was in elementary school , I remember very distinctly cutting corners on virtually all of my homework .
Math problems would get scribbled frantically in pencil on paper during homeroom .
( In fact , what little creativity I have owes entirely to those ingenious , sweaty - fingered minutes spent trying to make it appear as if I had thought very hard about , say , problem # 23 ( a ) but just could n't get the answer . )
The spelling workbook , I quickly discovered , did n't need to be filled out at all — if you worried about grades you could always recoup your losses by getting the " bonus " spelling words on quizzes right .
" Homework " always denoted something to do as little of as physically possible .
Ever since , I 've always had terrible study skills , and while I blame my own laziness , all that useless homework gets part of the blame .
But let 's do Waldman one better and say it flat out : homework is most likely evil .
Yes , evil .
Any educational system that relies on parents at home to help with the " learning process " will only end up perpetuating inequality , as long as some parents can help their kids and some cannot ; as long as some parents can speak English and some cannot .
And homework , for all its uselessness , is far more likely to put undue stress on family life than anything else .
Of course , let 's also be honest , the whole point of public school is n't to turn students into well - educated citizens but rather to produce good consumers and dutiful worker bees — people with short attention spans who follow authority , care deeply about status , and will attend with all due diligence to humiliatingly pointless tasks .
Get used to working overtime , kid , you 'll need it .
In that regard , homework is indispensible .

In that regard , homework is indispensible .

More Brains , Igor
The New York Times has a very good
Most experts agree that the exodus of skilled workers from poor countries is a symptom of deep economic , social and political problems in their homelands and can prove particularly crippling in much needed professions in health care and education .
Jagdish Bhagwati , an economist at Columbia University who migrated from India in the late 1960's , said immigrants were often voting with their feet when they departed from countries that were badly run and economically dysfunctional .
They get their government 's attention by the act of leaving ….
But some scholars are asking whether the brain drain may also fuel a vicious downward cycle of underdevelopment - and cost poor countries the feisty people with the spark and the ability to resist corruption and incompetent governance .
Remittances back home from expatriate workers make up some of the difference — and these payments are usually spent
Some suggest that OECD countries should restrict skilled immigration .
One response would be that in some sense we already do ; strict licensing requirements here in the United States already put up staggeringly high informal tariffs on the importation of doctors , lawyers , economists , and other professionals .
Quick example : Several years ago the federal government paid New York hospitals
So what to do ?
Only a handful of countries have been successful in luring their emigrés back home .
Bhagwati has suggested that developing countries should tax their expatriates .
Creating networks among entrepreneurs might offer one solution — I know of at least one example in Latin America where the government sets up links between researchers abroad and workers at home to share knowledge .
Set up something like Craigslist for really smart expatriates .
Ultimately , the best thing to do would be to figure out how to get the poorest countries in the world to start growing — just as China , India , Indonesia , and Brazil have done — but the first person who figures out a fail - proof way to do that will get a very nice prize indeed .
Thehas a very good piece today on the " brain drain " phenomenon among developing countries ; wherein the most talented and educated workers in the Third World emigrate to the United States or Europe or other wealthy countries , thus leaving their home countries with very little in the way of human capital , and no way to exit the vicious cycle that caused people to leave in the first place : Remittances back home from expatriate workers make up some of the difference — and these payments are usually spent more effectively than foreign aid — but not enough .
Interestingly , the " powerhouses " of the developing world — China , India , Indonesia , Brazil — do n't suffer from brain drain , with less than 5 percent of their skilled citizens living in OECD countries .
Some suggest that OECD countries should restrict skilled immigration .
One response would be that in some sense we already do ; strict licensing requirements here in the United States already put up staggeringly high informal tariffs on the importation of doctors , lawyers , economists , and other professionals .
Quick example : Several years ago the federal government paid New York hospitals $ 400 million to train fewer doctors out of concern for " oversupply " ; blue - collar protectionists never had it so good .
These barriers , by the way , dwarf our rather small tariffs on goods that " free traders " tend to worry so much about .
But that 's only part of it .
On the other hand , the United States , Britain , Canada , and Australia really do actively seek out many other sorts of skilled workers from abroad , especially in more technical fields , and this seems to hurts developing countries the most .

" It was just a day like any other day "
From the New York Times '
Over the years myth tended to obscure the truth about Mrs. Parks .
One legend had it that she was a cleaning woman with bad feet who was too tired to drag herself to the rear of the bus .
Another had it that she was a " plant " by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
The truth , as she later explained , was that she was tired of being humiliated , of having to adapt to the byzantine rules , some codified as law and others passed on as tradition , that reinforced the position of blacks as something less than full human beings .
" She was fed up , " said Elaine Steele , a longtime friend and executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development .
" She was in her 40's .
She was not a child .
There comes a point where you say , ' No , I 'm a full citizen , too .
This is not the way I should be treated . ' " Right .
Similar " caveats " ( Parks was a NAACP plant ! ) seem to be agreed to be handpicked — by civil rights leaders to become the poster child for the Montgomery bus boycotts .
So what ?
That 's always made her even more of a hero , I think ; to have agreed to set her life aside and stand at the forefront of a movement .
From the obit : " Her act of civil disobedience , what seems a simple gesture of defiance so many years later , was in fact a dangerous , even reckless move in 1950 's Alabama .
In refusing to move , she risked legal sanction , even harm . "
To put it lightly .
No amount of mythmaking can denigrate that .
As many people know , fifteen ! — named Claudette Colvin did much the same thing on a Montgomery bus ; the case she ended up filing in court along with three other women , Browder v. Gayle , eventually became the one in which the Supreme Court 's struck down bus segregation .
Initially , the NAACP wanted to organize a boycott around Colvin 's case , but backed off because they did n't think she made for a suitable enough poster - child — Colvin was allegedly several months pregnant , and " prone to outbursts . "
Or perhaps the timing just was n't right — mass movements are always sensitive to timing .
( Baton Rouge had staged the first bus boycotts two years earlier , but that had been forgotten . )
Parks , as a member of the NAACP , was Colvin 's mentor , and sat in on the decision to boycott or not after the younger girl was arrested , and was eventually inspired by her example to do the same nine months later .
That this was how a movement sprouted — with two women inspired by each other — is no less sweeping a story than the traditional tale of one brave person sparking a wildfire .
Presumably those civil rights leaders were right that the nation needed to see Rosa Parks — " one of the finest citizens of Montgomery " — at the head of the boycotts rather than Colvin , who might have been more easily be slimed by reactionaries who think a movement can be discredited by attacking the private lives of the people who lead it .
Not much has changed in the last fifty years , in that regard .
At any rate , none of this can minimize what Parks did ; that would n't be possible .
From the obituary of Rosa Parks : Right .
Similar " caveats " ( Parks was a NAACP plant ! ) seem to be wending their way through the internet , and I 'm still not sure what the " point " of these myths is ; in truth , they do n't matter very much .
Yes , Parks was handpicked — to be handpicked — by civil rights leaders to become the poster child for the Montgomery bus boycotts .

Electing to Fight
John M. Owen IV has a Foreign Affairs Electing to Fight : Why Emerging Democracies Go to War , which argues exactly what the title suggests :
According to Mansfield and Snyder , in countries that have recently started to hold free elections but that lack the proper mechanisms for accountability ( institutions such as an independent judiciary , civilian control of the military , and protections for opposition parties and the press ) , politicians have incentives to pursue policies that make it more likely that their countries will start wars .
In such places , politicians know they can mobilize support by demanding territory or other spoils from foreign countries and by nurturing grievances against outsiders .
As a result , they push for extraordinarily belligerent policies .
Even states that develop democratic institutions in the right order -- adopting the rule of law before holding elections -- are very aggressive in the early years of their transitions , although they are less so than the first group and more likely to eventually turn into full democracies .
The historical record bears this out , it seems .
Owen wonders if , on this theory , " a democratic Iraq [ will be ] no less bellicose " than Saddam Hussein 's regime , as various factions in the near future " compete for popularity by stirring up nationalism against one or more of Iraq 's neighbors . "
This does n't seem so implausible — I could see an Iraqi government with a large Sadrist presence getting all up in some neighbor 's face ; John M. Owen IV has a review of , which argues exactly what the title suggests :

This does n't seem so implausible — I could see an Iraqi government with a large Sadrist presence getting all up in some neighbor 's face ; Jordan , perhaps — but it does sort of seem like the least of Iraq 's concerns right now .
On the other hand , a rapid push for democratization in the Middle East — if and when it ever comes — would make this sort of chaotic outcome all the more likely .
But as Josh Marshall once suggested , perhaps this was the plan all along .
All Hail Our New Chairman ?
This is n't really the place to come for Federal Reserve commentary , but maybe I can provide a few knee - jerk lefty complaints about the new Fed chief , Ben Bernanke .
He 's undoubtedly a smart guy , and all the center - left blogs
Moreover , Epstein argues , moderate rates of inflation , up to about 20 percent , " have no predictable negative consequences on the real economy , " so perhaps the Fed obsession is misguided after all .
As far as I can tell , no one seems to know for sure whether or not inflation would hurt the poor , but that 's probably not to question to ask , instead let 's debate : what sort of monetary policy would be better for the least well - off , and the rest of us ?
Or rather :
Why not have the Fed stop fretting about inflation — within limits — and instead focus on promoting full employment , investment , and GDP growth ?
Good question .
The answer is to follow the money :
One likely explanation is that a focus on fighting inflation and keeping it low and stable is in the interest of the rentier groups in these counties .
Epstein and Power ( 2003 ) present new calculations of rentier incomes in the OECD countries supporting the view that in many countries , higher real interest rates and lower inflation increase the rentier shares of income .
Ah , rentiers .
The argument against Epstein , I take it , is that can't use inflation to boost employment because people are n't dumb , they 'll soon catch on to what the bank 's doing and plan accordingly , nothing will change when inflation strikes , and soon we 're on the path towards stagflation .
Hence the virtues of a hawk like Greenspan — or Bernanke .
In reply , the dying herd of old Keynesians might say eh , this is n't really a concern , since the real inflationary dangers come not from full employment , which is usually a good thing , but from stagnant growth , since during a slowdown monopolistic enterprises will start raising prices to recoup their fixed costs .
Certainly
I 'm not even fractionally smart enough to know who 's right in all of this , so I 'll just leave it at that and admit that my bias is towards Epstein .
His suggestion for " real targeting " makes sense on the surface , although for the Fed to be truly democratic , the whole institution itself will probably have to be rejiggered so that ordinary citizens get actual input into central bank decision - making .
That obviously wo n't happen in my lifetime , but surely the least we can do is be bitter about it , no ?
This is n't really the place to come for Federal Reserve commentary , but maybe Iprovide a few knee - jerk lefty complaints about the new Fed chief , Ben Bernanke .
He 's undoubtedly a smart guy , and all the center - left blogs like him , but this just looks like more of the same .
He 's a fan of " formal inflation targeting , " eh ?
As best I can tell from his 1999 spat with James K. Galbraith , Bernanke does n't take this to mean that the Fed should sacrifice everything else under the sun— including employment growth — at the altar of Always Low Prices , but Gerald Epstein argues here that that 's what inflation targeting tends to mean in practice .
That inflation - obsessed monetary theorists in the U.S. wrongly insisted that the rate of unemployment could never go below 6.5 percent during the 1980s , letting wages stagnate and poverty rise , makes Scooter Libby 's high crimes and misdemeanors look rather flimsy in comparison .
Moreover , Epstein argues , moderate rates of inflation , up to about 20 percent , " have no predictable negative consequences on the real economy , " so perhaps the Fed obsession is misguided after all .
As far as I can tell , no one seems to know for sure whether or not inflation would hurt the poor , but that 's probably not to question to ask , instead let 's debate : what sort of monetary policy would be better for the least well - off , and the rest of us ?
Or rather :
Why not have the Fed stop fretting about inflation — within limits — and instead focus on promoting full employment , investment , and GDP growth ?
Good question .
The answer is to follow the money : Ah , rentiers .
The argumentEpstein , I take it , is that theoretically a central banker justuse inflation to boost employment because people are n't dumb , they 'll soon catch on to what the bank 's doing and plan accordingly , nothing will change when inflation strikes , and soon we 're on the path towards stagflation .
Hence the virtues of a hawk like Greenspan — or Bernanke .
In reply , the dying herd of old Keynesians might say eh , this is n't really a concern , since the real inflationary dangers come not from full employment , which is usually a good thing , but from stagnant growth , since during a slowdown monopolistic enterprises will start raising prices to recoup their fixed costs .
Certainly Big Pharma and Big Insurance have been doing just that recently , so score one for the dying herd .
I'm not even fractionally smart enough to know who 's right in all of this , so I 'll just leave it at that and admit that my bias is towards Epstein .
His suggestion for " real targeting " makes sense on the surface , although for the Fed to be truly democratic , the whole institution itself will probably have to be rejiggered so that ordinary citizens get actual input into central bank decision - making .

Adventure !
I was flipping through a copy of National Geographic Adventure yesterday , and figured , hey , some of this stuff is worth linking to on the ol ' blog .
The zud , that would wipe out all their livestock .
You'd be ornery too .
The I was flipping through a copy ofyesterday , and figured , hey , some of this stuff is worth linking to on the ol ' blog .
The cover feature 's about a guy who backpacked along some or all ( I forget ) of the Great Wall of China .
Some good factoids in there :
The GWoC took 1800 years to build , you can't actually see it from space , and the reason that the Mongols of old would get so ornery and conquer stuff every now and again was because Mongolia is prey to the occasional freak super - blizzard , called a , that would wipe out all their livestock .
You'd be ornery too .
The other good story was about how climate change has made it difficult for grizzly bears in ANWR to find food these days , so now they 're out for blood ... human blood !
No , really , they never used to attack people , but now they do .
Best part comes at the end when , shortly after being chased by a bear , a once - fuzzy - wuzzy environmentalist vows to go on a shooting spree the next time he sees one .
Cool pictures , too .
Who 's Doing the Damage ?
Oh hilarious .
Here 's the real problem with legalizing gay marriage :
If the principle behind SSM is institutionalized in law … then people like me who think marriage is the union of husband and wife importantly related to the idea that children need moms and dads will be treated in society and at law like bigots .
Awww … poor thing .
Sign gay marriage into law and suddenly people might not be allowed to gay - bash on the radio anymore , for fear of sounding like bigots and having their broadcast licenses revoked ( I really do n't think she needs to worry here ) ; and future schoolteachers will brainwash their students into thinking that the gay rights debates of yore pitted a few noble crusaders for equality against a wall of old - fashioned and mostly stodgy bigots .
Liberal elites can be so cruel !
Really , though , I wanted to comment on this , somewhat less - goofy , paragraph :
The most important fault line in the marriage debate is between a ) people who think SSM will help a small number of gay couples and not affect anyone else and b ) people like me who think this is going to change fundamentally the nature of marriage .
Is that really the fault line ?
Neither of these propositions is testable unless we just go for it and legalize gay marriage — or , alternatively , we could just look at Europe 's experience and note that Option A not being married , it could easily strengthen the institution , which , I take it , is Andrew Sullivan 's argument .
That 's why you have more than a few feminists on the left opposed to the whole idea , seeing as how it would bolster what they see as a patriarchal and mostly oppressive institution .
And they 're probably right .
But let 's also take Gallagher 's fears seriously for a second .
My guess is that keeping gay marriage illegal will do far more to erode marriage than anything else in the near future .
Corporations and states , after all , are increasingly creating partner benefits for gay couples — it 's hard to stop the states from doing this , and even harder to stop companies from doing it .
( I guess you could try to pass an amendment , but that seems difficult . )
And once there are benefit systems in place for gay couples , straight couples may as well sign on too , forgoing marriage .
If companies increasingly extend healthcare and retirement benefits to " domestic partners , " well , that 's one less incentive for everyone else to get married , is n't it ?
I think Jonathan Rauch once warned that without gay marriage , " every unmarried gay couple " — especially those with kids — " will become a walking billboard for the joys of co-habitation . "
Not good for Gallagher .
This seems like the greater " threat " to marriage , and unless we plan on banning all gay people everywhere from even looking at each other — and even in America this seems like a daunting task — allowing gay marriage is probably the best way to avert the inevitable " erosion " at work here .
We can add another loop too .
Just as Gallagher seems to fear , young people increasingly do seem to see the backlash against gay rights as a form of bigotry .
How much respect will those kids have for an institution they see as discriminatory ?
Not much , one would think .
This should really be what gets Gallagher nervous .
Granted , it 's near - impossible to test any of these arguments — I guess we can see what happens in Massachusetts and , inevitably , California in the coming years — though my gut feeling is that it would be impossible for gay couples to screw up marriage any more than straight couples have already done .
( Granted , in real life I think it 's right to allow gay marriage even if it does somehow affect straight couples — just like it was right to end racial discrimination among employers even if the net effect is to pull down white wages — but this seems to be one of those cases where doing what 's right and doing what 's beneficial for the majority are actually aligned . )
Oh hilarious .
Here 's the much mocked Maggie Gallagher 's take on theproblem with legalizing gay marriage : Awww … poor thing .
Sign gay marriage into law and suddenly people might not be allowed to gay - bash on the radio anymore , for fear of sounding like bigots and having their broadcast licenses revoked ( I really do n't think she needs to worry here ) ; and future schoolteachers will brainwash their students into thinking that the gay rights debates of yore pitted a few noble crusaders for equality against a wall of old - fashioned and mostly stodgy bigots .

Neither of these propositions is testable unless we just go for it and legalize gay marriage — or , alternatively , we could just look at Europe 's experience and note that Option A looks like the likely result .
Alternatively , though , one could throw in a third option — that gay marriage will change marriage , yes , but for the better .
I do n't see why this argument 's any less implausible than the other two .
Insofar as legalizing gay marriage can send out a signal that being married is preferable tobeing married , it could easily strengthen the institution , which , I take it , is Andrew Sullivan 's argument .
That 's why you have more than a few feminists on the left opposed to the whole idea , seeing as how it would bolster what they see as a patriarchal and mostly oppressive institution .

Balancing Act
This is over a year old , but Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth of Dartmouth have written a very interesting ( draft )
So is this true ?
Brooks and Wohlforth say probably not .
It 's hard to distinguish , granted , between explicit " balancing " and normal moves made by other countries , for reasons of their own , that just so happen to inconvenience or hurt the United States .
But real " balancing " would mean that Europe and Russia and China were taking moves that are only coming about because the United States is the pre-eminent power in the world , and they fear that ; moves they would n't pursue otherwise .
This probably is n't the case .
Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder opposed the Iraq war partly because they genuinely thought it was a bad idea , quite rightly , and partly because opposition was popular domestically .
Likewise , Russia 's recent " strategic partnerships " with India and China may look menacing , but they are n't really intended to counter U.S. power in any meaningful way .
( All three countries are pursuing economic modernization , and since that entails working with U.S. - controlled financial institutions , they still need to cozy up to the hegemon . )
Meanwhile , Russia 's recent arms sales to India and China , along with its support for Iran 's nuclear program , mostly stem from its desperate need to slow the rapid decline of its defense sector , which is in a bad way .
That 's why Vladimir Putin can call nuclear proliferation the " main threat of the 21st century " and still fund the Bushehr reactor in Iran .
He 's sincere about the former , no doubt , but that reactor contract means 20,000 jobs at home .
The EU 's proposal for defense cooperation , meanwhile , is meant to complement , not counter , American military power .
Again , people like Chirac may say otherwise for public consumption at home , but in reality , the EU is actually weakening its ability to balance against the United States — by foregoing investment in advanced defense technology — in order to create a rapid reaction force that can help the U.S. by dealing with Balkans - style problems .
Given that the U.S. and the EU are currently working together on Iran , it 's obvious that their interests are mostly aligned .
In short , people like O'Reilly are wrong .
No one 's balancing against the U.S. ; not yet .
Though it still seems that the U.S. should avoid unilateralism when possible , because ill will makes cooperation on other issues difficult .
Also , notice that France and Germany have a serious dilemma here .
The more that they use the language of balancing — the more that they talk about " checking American power , " even when they obviously intend to do no such thing — then the more the U.S. will discount their specific objections to policies .
Chirac and Schroeder may have had good reason to believe that Iraq was a flawed idea , but U.S. policymakers were inclined to dismiss their objections as knee - jerk anti-Americanism .
That 's bad .
Likewise , if U.S. leaders believe that , say , France and Germany want to work through international institutions only in order to check American power , then the U.S. will be less likely to pursue multilateralism .
This is over a year old , but Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth of Dartmouth have written a very interesting ( draft ) paper asking whether other countries are engaging in " soft balancing " against the United States .
Prior to the Iraq war , many liberal analysts worried that too much unilateralism from America would provoke other nations — especially Europe , China , and Russia — to start banding together and counterbalancing that loud , honking hegemon across the Atlantic .
U.S. conservatives , meanwhile , viewed France and Germany 's opposition to the war as stemming from a desire to constrain American power .
On this view , what started as " soft " balancing — a bit of stubbornness at the Security Council — would soon lead to hard opposition .
As Bill O'Reilly said on the Daily Show just a few nights ago , " France is the enemy !
" So is this true ?
Brooks and Wohlforth say probably not .
It 's hard to distinguish , granted , between explicit " balancing " and normal moves made by other countries , for reasons of their own , that just soto inconvenience or hurt the United States .

Preposterous Universe
One of these days , I 'll actually be able to wrap my head around those extra dimensions in space that string theorists always talk about .
One of these days .
The simplest way to hide extra dimensions from view is to imagine that they are " compactified " — curled up into a tiny ball ( or other geometrical configuration ) with an extent much smaller than what can be probed by current experimental apparatus .
In the 1990s , however , a new possibility arose , as scientists came to appreciate the role of " branes " in higher - dimensional physics .
A brane , generalizing the concept of a membrane , is simply an extended object : A string is a one - dimensional brane , a membrane is a two - dimensional brane , and so on , up to however many dimensions may exist .
A remarkable feature of such objects is that particles may be confined to them , unable to escape into the surrounding space .
We can therefore imagine that our visible world is a three - dimensional brane , embedded in a larger universe into which we simply can't reach .
Gravity , as the curvature of spacetime itself , is the one force that is hard to confine to a brane ; the extra dimensions must therefore have some feature that prevents gravity from appearing higher - dimensional .
( For example , in four spatial dimensions , the gravitational force would fall off as the distance cubed , rather than the distance squared . )
One possibility , proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed , Savas Dimopoulos and Georgi ( " Gia " ) Dvali , is that the extra dimensions curl up into a ball that is small without being too small — perhaps as large as a millimeter across in each direction .
Randall , in collaboration with Raman Sundrum , showed that an extra dimension could be infinitely big , if the higher - dimensional space was appropriately " warped " ( hence the title of her book ) .
That 's from a Warped Passages .
One of these days , I 'll actually be able to wrap my head around those extra dimensions in space that string theorists always talk about .
One of these days .
That 's from a review of Lisa Randall 's new book ,

To recap : The Bayh - Dole Act , in essence , transferred the patents for all pharmaceutical inventions made with the help of federal research grants to the universities and small businesses where they were made .
No longer would taxpayers own the research that the government had paid for ; it would be in private hands from now on .
Many people credit this act with spawning the multi-billion dollar biotech industry , since in 1979 , only much more unwilling to share their research with other scientists , instead spending their time seeking out licenses with private business in order to earn millions .
Out with the altar of Hermes , in with Mammon .
Whether or not Bayh - Dole was warranted at the time — if nothing else , it helped many research universities reap windfalls — it 's certainly not having a positive effect on drug innovation today .
Between 2000 and 2003 , the average number of " new molecular entities , " or genuinely new drugs ( as opposed to " me-too " drugs ) dropped to eight a year , and
The thing is , as Clifton Leaf pointed out in a recent Forbes without anything like Bayh - Dole : the computer industry .
The IT industry still has patents , of course , but companies and research institutions are much more generous in licensing their technology , and inter-company sharing is much more widespread .
In part because of all this sharing , computer prices keep going down ,
Now here 's the kicker : technically the Bayh - Dole Act empowers federal agencies to ensure that new technologies — gene analysis , cell lines , research techniques — are being shared as widely as possible .
But the NIH has never once used this power .
As well , Bayh - Dole technically allows the government power to use its taxpayer - funded research royalty - free , but it 's never done that .
One wonders :
What the hell ?
Government reticence on both these measures essentially acts as a taxpayer subsidy to Pfizer and Bayer , and hinders innovation .
I guess that 's the point , but it sucks .
I honestly do n't know whether it 's time to repeal Bayh - Dole altogether .
As a " compromise " an amendment could be passed , though , that forces the government to do the above two things — and require scientists to license their patents as widely as possible — at minimum .
The other day , I wrote that it might be time to socialize drug research , or at least take a kangaroo hop in that direction .
( Granted , the Pharma lobby would never let this happen , but let 's keep things unrealistic for now . )
In comments , serial catowner pointed out that the drug industry is n't in any way innovative these days , which I definitely agree with , and JimPortlandOR pointed to the Bayh - Dole Act of 1980 as a culprit mucking things up .
Good point .
So here 's a suggestion .
To recap : The Bayh - Dole Act , in essence , transferred the patents for all pharmaceutical inventions made with the help of federal research grants to the universities and small businesses where they were made .
No longer would taxpayers own the research that the government had paid for ; it would be in private hands from now on .
Many people credit this act with spawning the multi-billion dollar biotech industry , since in 1979 , only 5 percent of government - held patents had ever been developed — because companies did n't want to risk commercializing them if they did n't own the patents .
Bayh - Dole fixed that , in theory .
But it also made academic institutionsmore unwilling to share their research with other scientists , instead spending their time seeking out licenses with private business in order to earn millions .
Out with the altar of Hermes , in with Mammon .
Whether or not Bayh - Dole was warranted at the time — if nothing else , it helped many research universities reap windfalls — it 's certainly not having a positive effect on drug innovation today .
Between 2000 and 2003 , the average number of " new molecular entities , " or genuinely new drugs ( as opposed to " me-too " drugs ) dropped to eight a year , and few of them were by the major corporations .
More tellingly , drug companies have made often made relatively little progress on any number of important diseases in the past few decades .
There 's virtually nothing out there to treat MS , or Parkinson's , or Alzheimer's .
Diabetes treatments have stalled .
Cancer medications are n't really going anywhere .
Perhaps that 's just because these things are intrinsically difficult .
But one theory is that , because government - funded research institutions now worry more about cashing in on their inventions , they spend more time hoarding their research , groveling for contracts , and litigating over patents than they do collaborating fruitfully with other scientists .
Plus , Bayh - Dole inflates the price of drugs — drugs researched with taxpayer money .
The thing is , as Clifton Leaf pointed out in a recent article , there 's another " high - technology , university - incubated industry " that 's doing perfectly fineanything like Bayh - Dole : the computer industry .
The IT industry still has patents , of course , but companies and research institutions are much more generous in licensing their technology , and inter-company sharing is much more widespread .
In part because of all this sharing , computer prices keep going down , Moore 's law is awesome , and innovation after innovation keeps cropping up .
Meanwhile , entrepreneurs and researchers at universities do n't need restrictive patent rules as incentive to innovate : Leaf points out that the " $ 50 K Competition " at MIT , which offers a mere $ 50,000 in seed money for innovative business plans , " has showcased some notable winners — and losers " over the years , including Ask Jeeves and Akamai .
Smart people will always find ways to bring good ideas to the market , and , the more widely ideas are shared , the more stuff they 'll probably invent .
No reason the pharmaceutical industry should be any different .
Now here 's the kicker : technically the Bayh - Dole Act empowers federal agencies to ensure that new technologies — gene analysis , cell lines , research techniques — being shared as widely as possible .
But the NIH has never once used this power .
As well , Bayh - Dole technically allows the government power to use its taxpayer - funded research royalty - free , but it 's never done that .
One wonders :
What the hell ?

Simplify , Simplify
The go anywhere , and they 're mostly just ideas for " discussion " rather than things the Bush administration will actually end up backing .
( With sinking poll numbers and Karl Rove potentially out of commission , it 's hard to see the president finding the gumption to cap the mortgage - interest deduction , ya know ? )
So let 's " discuss . "
I realize no one on the House Ways & Means Committee plans on asking me , but here 's one way to take a more progressive stab at tax simplification :
Find some way to slowly phase out the mortgage - interest deduction .
Robert Shapiro has argued that it does n't actually benefit home - buyers , since sellers just bid up the price of houses until they exactly offset the cost of the deduction , so in essence , it just acts as a taxpayer subsidy to the construction and real estate industries .
Is that really worth it ?
Any phase - out would lower home values , though , so this step makes for thorny politics , but that 's why you …
Simplify and expand the family tax credit .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel has proposed a simplified , refundable tax credit available to all working taxpayers with children that would replace the EITC , Child Credit , Additional Child Credit , and Child and Dependent Care Credit — cutting away about 200 pages of the tax code .
This would cost an extra $ 200 billion over ten years , which is a lot , but doable once we get to …
Earlier this year , David Cay Johnston reported on a paper by two tax experts noting that a number of investors overstate the price of stocks , businesses , and real estate , because they 're allowed to report their capital gains and losses on the honor system , unlike wage - earners .
Actual verification and enforcement of these reports could recoup at least $ 250 billion over the next decade .
It also seems like a good idea to consolidate , simplify , and expand , as Paul Weinstein , Jr. , has suggested , both the various college subsidies into one single College Tax Credit , and the various tax savings vehicles — IRAs or 401 ( k ) s — into a single and transferable universal pension account .
Simplifies a lot , and good for all involved .
I realize people like Paul Krugman have argued that college is n't for everyone , but might as well try to raise the numbers .
Weinstein lists a bunch of corporate loopholes and tax deductions we could close to pay for these parts .
Works for me .
That 's not so hard .
Those are n't earth - shaking steps , but they 're all good , liberal things to do , and they do simplify the tax code quite a bit , especially for working families .
I do n't really see the point in repealing the alternative - minimum tax ( AMT ) , which is there to ensure that the very wealthy wo n't exploit loopholes and dodge taxesl ; if the AMT is falling on too many middle - class families then just raise the threshold and reform , rather than eliminate , it .
I also do n't really know how one would simplify capital gains taxation , which is obviously at the heart of any reform , but I 'm sure there are decent ways to go about it .
Oh yeah , and most of the Bush tax cuts are going to have to be repealed ( for a start ) to avoid fiscal disaster in the long run , but that 's another story ...

The consensus seems to be that the Tax Reform Commission 's proposals for , uh , tax reform wo n't actuallyanywhere , and they 're mostly just ideas for " discussion " rather than things the Bush administration will actually end up backing .

So let 's " discuss . "
I realize no one on the House Ways & Means Committee plans on asking me , but here 's one way to take a more progressive stab at tax simplification :
Is Liberal Interventionism Dead ?
Sam Rosenfeld and Matt Yglesias have a new TAP even if the war had been sold and fought exactly as the liberal hawks wanted — as a way to turn Iraq into a liberal democracy — with a different , more competent administration , it still would have failed .
Well , agreed .
The United States has never shown much interest in democracy - building , it 's never been very good at it , and as I TAP piece sells the idea of liberal interventionism somewhat short :
Intervening requires us to take sides and to live with the empowerment of the side we took .
Tensions between Kosovar and Serb , Muslim and Croat , Sunni and Shiite are not immutable hatreds , and it ’s hardly the case that such conflicts can never be resolved .
But they can not be resolved by us .
Outside parties can succeed in smoothing the path for agreement , halting an ongoing genocide , or preventing an imminent one by securing autonomy for a given area .
But only the actual parties to a conflict can bring it to an end .
No simple application of more outside force can make conflicting parties agree in any meaningful way or conjure up social forces of liberalism , compromise , and tolerance where they do n’t exist or are too weak to prevail .
That 's obviously true of the United States ' military , which has classically been good primarily at smashing things , although our twenty - year - old soldiers have adapted to " mission creep " unbelievably well in Iraq .
But Donald Rumsfeld wants to make the military even more focused on smashing things — as opposed to people like Thomas Barnett , who wants to see a more fully developed " SysAdmin " side — and regardless of what you want to call it , the
But the United Nations complicates the tale somewhat , since their peacekeeping forces actually have succeeded in reconciling a large number of post - conflict nations .
Post - WWII UN operations in Congo , and post - Cold War peacekeeping forces in Namibia , El Salvador , Mozambique , Eastern Slavonia , Sierra Leone , and East Timor should all count as successes — the UN disarmed the parties , demobilized militias , held relatively free and fair elections , and put the countries on a path towards sustained civil peace .
So in one sense , outside forces can " make conflicting parties agree in [ a ] meaningful way , " and if those UN missions did n't conjure up , as TAP puts it , " social forces of liberalism , compromise , and tolerance , " they at least pointed the way down that path .
Those countries , save for the Congo , are all peaceful democracies today .
We know it can work because it 's been done .
On the other hand , even the UN can't seem to stop a country on the brink of disintegration from doing so , but it's hard to tell how much of that failure has come from the sheer difficulty of the task and how much from poor implementation .
The original UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia obviously flopped , but it was also severely undermanned .
Same with the initial UN force in Bosnia .
( Could a more robust operation — say , 20,000 more troops and American commanders — have averted many of the Balkan crises later in the 1990s ?
Who knows ? )
The UN actually enforced ( rather than just " kept " ) the peace in Eastern Slavonia and East Timor , both successfully , when it had enough troops .
So I do n't think I 'm quite as ready to say " it 's impossible " , although a good deal of modesty and skepticism is absolutely crucial here .
I think the United States is inherently awful at nation - building right now , yes .
But that says as much about the United States and its military as it does about the inherent impossibility in peacekeeping and nation - building , and it 's worth , I think , trying to disentangle the two .
Sam Rosenfeld and Matt Yglesias have a new article arguing that the war in Iraq — or at least the " liberal hawk " idea that Iraq could be made into a democracy at the barrel of a gun — was always doomed to fail , and it was n't just because Bush utterly botched it .
They say thatthe war had been sold and fought exactly as the liberal hawks wanted — as a way to turn Iraq into a liberal democracy — with a different , more competent administration , it still would have failed .
Well , agreed .
The United States has never shown much interest in democracy - building , it 's never been very good at it , and as I noted earlier in the week , the success of our nation - building adventures abroad have usually depended on internal factors in the occupied country , rather than the competence of our plans .
That was as true of the American South in 1865 as it was of Kosovo in 1999 .
And sad to say , but the mere existence of a profit - seeking military - industrial complex made problems like the looting of the Iraqi treasury pretty much inevitable .
There 's no reason to think an invasion run by George Packer or Peter Beinart c

We as a nation are watching the country of Pakistan , a primary ally of the United States , in a state of emergency and now under martial law .
This , in my opinion , is a condition that the United States , through thoughtful deployment of our armed forces could have helped to avoid - yet when we had the chance to completely decimate the Taliban and Al Qaeda , your Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , answering to you and Vice - President Dick Cheney - allowed both of the above terrorist entities to escape from Tora Bora by allowing the Afghanistan Military , as ill - trained as they were , to conduct the final mop-up of the remaining insurgents in Afghanistan and the Central Commands refusal to commit the necessary troops to finalize the destruction of Taliban and Al Qaeda elements , which allowed many of them to escape into the northern tribal areas of Pakistan and again become a threat to US interests , Pakistan itself , and now the fight in Afghanistan is almost as fierce as it was when we first began .
It is common knowledge that Pakistan has a substantial nuclear arsenal , and by and through the incompetence of the White House and the Department of Defense , then headed by Donald Rumsfeld - we allowed this to happen and instead turned our military might on Iraq , who had no weapons of mass destruction and had absolutely nothing to do with the events that transpired on 9 - 11 .
Present Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney - you have both failed this nation miserably , and as a private citizen that predicted this development in Pakistan , I personally condemn both of you for failing our nation in a time of war .
No one yet knows how Pakistan will weather this crisis , but I wholeheartedly support the people of Pakistan that are attempting to stave - off radical Islam , and we as a nation are aware that it was your decisions that allowed this unprecedented spiral of Pakistan into anarchy - and whatever the consequences may be , you both stand responsible for Pakistan ’s fate .
Through experience we have learned that radical Islam spreads like a cancer , and through your own words we know this , as well as our continued monitoring of this situation in Pakistan and other nations who are fighting radical Islam .
You both state that you support our troops and are attempting to make America safer ; by your very actions , which reek of utter incompetence and greed , you have failed the people of the United States , the world , and especially those who trusted your judgment .
These events in Pakistan could easily destabilize the Middle - East even more than your actions have already done - and the people of the United States should rise - up in unison and condemn your actions and incompetence .
Please Mr. Bush and Cheney - your time to lead this nation has come and gone ; you have demonstrated that you have no respect for our own Constitution , our Bill of Rights , and the Rule of Law .
Not only have you violated our own laws and the trust of a nation , in addition to the many international laws and treaties you ’ve violated your decisions have negatively impacted several nations throughout the world - and over a million Iraqis and thousands of our own troops now lie dead because of your miscalculations , incompetence , and violation of International Law .
If you care for this great nation as you state you do - it ’s time for both of you to resign so that we can begin to rebuild this shattered nation , and at the same time , mitigate the damage your administration has caused throughout the world !
America as a nation should rise - up and demand your resignation , and those of us that do not are contributing to the downfall of the country our forefathers fought and died for - something that you refused to do during the Vietnam War , staying comfortably in the US while more then 58,000 of America ’s best lost their lives in the Vietnam War .
We need a President with the will to guide this nation by and through the tenants as set forth in our constitution - not as they are interpreted by a tyrant and Dictator .
I call upon our Congress and the American people to demand your resignations - and if that does not happen forthwith , then it is now the time to begin impeachment proceedings .
This nation , nor the world , can stand much more of your incompetence and violation of our sacred laws and spirit of freedom and liberty - and I respectfully call for both of your resignations as a free person and citizen of the United States of America !

With gas prices rising to record highs , individuals are looking for ways to cut that cost and one company are ready to give it to them .
A California based company , E - fuel Corporation has just announced their newest product , a do - it - yourself home ethanol refinery .
The Efuel100 home ethanol system is about the size of a refrigerator and can produce about 35 gallons of pure ethanol in just under seven days .
While the company boast about how simple , cheap and effective the small refinery is , the simple facts just do n’t seem to be adding up .
The process requires massive amounts of sugar , water and about $ 1 worth of a proprietary yeast developed by the company .
Approximately 350 to 490 pounds of raw sugar and about 140 gallons of water are needed to make one 35 gallon batch of ethanol .
If you factor in the cost of the $ 10,000 refinery , the travel cost to pickup 400 pounds of sugar every week and water and electricity , I have a strong feeling that $ 1 per gallon is a pipe dream .
As we have stated many times before , food based ethanol is a bad idea , even on a small scale like this .
Chances are , this type of small scale ethanol production will only drive up the cost of raw sugar making the mini refinery less economical and disrupting food prices world wide .

End of Nepalese monarchy sets stage for new period of political instability
By K. Ratnayake
30 May 2008
The decision on Wednesday to abolish the Nepalese monarchy has been greeted with a great deal of fanfare , both in Nepal and internationally .
Among ordinary Nepalese , there are many hopes that the establishment of a republic will usher in peace and prosperity .
In reality , it is a desperate attempt by sections of the Nepalese ruling elite to salvage the discredited state apparatus in preparation for pro-market reforms and a fresh onslaught on the living standards and rights of workers and the urban and rural poor .
The resolution for a “ federal democratic republic ” was the first action of the newly established Constitutional Assembly and was carried overwhelmingly — 560 to just 4 .
King Gyanendra and his family have been given 15 days to vacate the Narayanhity Palace in Kathmandu and will be reduced to the status of ordinary citizens .
A president will be chosen and installed as head of state at the next meeting of the assembly , which has two years to draft a new constitution .
All the major political parties — the Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist ( CPN -M ) , Nepali Congress ( NC ) and Nepal Communist Party - Unified Marxist Leninist ( NCP - UML ) — hailed the decision as a great step forward .
Prime Minister and NC leader G.P. Koirala declared that “ the dream of the Nepali people has come true , ” even though his party had until recently been pushing for a constitutional monarchy and the retention of the king as ceremonial head of state .
Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told the media : “ The Nepalese people have been freed from centuries of feudal tradition and the doors have now opened for a radical social and economic transformation . ”
The Maoists won the largest bloc of seats — 220 — in assembly elections in April and have been asked to form the interim government that will govern for the next two years .
The two largest establishment parties — Nepali Congress and the NCP - UML — won 110 and 103 seats respectively .
Tens of thousands of people thronged into the capital Kathmandu to celebrate the declaration of the republic .
Hundreds of protestors demanding that King Gyanendra leave the palace immediately clashed with police yesterday .
The Nepali press joined in the general euphoria with headlines in the Kathmandu Post of “ Vive la Republique ” and in the Himalayan Times of “ A hope is born ” .
The expectations and hopes of masses of ordinary people will rapidly come into conflict with the program of a new Maoist - led government .
The Maoists , who ended their protracted guerrilla struggle in 2006 , have been busy pledging to business leaders that they will defend private property and encourage foreign investment .
The CPN - M’s program is based on the reactionary two - stage theory of Stalinism , which in the name of clearing away feudal remnants defends capitalism and relegates socialism to the indefinite future .
In an interview with IBN / CNN , CPN -M chairman Prachanda declared : “ Our fight is against feudalism , not against capitalism ...
Between the feudal stage and socialist stage there will be a capitalist stage . ”
He went on to clarify what that meant in practice , promising his party would “ try to create favourable environment for them [ foreign investors ] to invest here ” .
The CPN - M leader explained that a government led by his party would study the Indian and Chinese models of Special Economic Zones to learn how investors should be helped .
In order to protect investors , Prachanda has promised to set up an “ industrial security force ” that would include former Maoist guerillas in order to protect private industrial enterprises .
In fact , in the name of “ ending feudalism , ” the CPN - M is coming to the rescue of Nepali capitalism , which traditionally relied on the monarchy and the army to suppress discontent and opposition generated by the country ’s appalling levels of poverty and unemployment .
In April 2006 , tens of thousands of protesters defied security forces for days to demand that the king step down and that basic democratic rights be implemented .
It was in the aftermath of these demonstrations that the Maoists reached a deal with a seven - party alliance headed by Nepali Congress and the NCP - UML to enter the interim government in preparation for the election of a constituent assembly .
Media coverage of the end of the Nepali monarchy has focussed almost exclusively on widespread popular hostility to King Gyanendra who was enthroned in 2001 after a bizarre and still unexplained massacre of much of the royal family , including former King Birendra .
Crown Prince Dipendra , reportedly enraged by his parents ’ refusal to allow him to marry , opened fire at a family gathering with automatic weapons , before shooting himself .
From the start , King Gyanendra and his son Paras were under a pall of public suspicion for engineering the incident .
He quickly tore up his promises to end the war with the Maoists and modernise the country .
In 2003 October , Gyanendra dissolved the parliament , appointed a figurehead prime minister and stepped up the war to crush the Maoist guerrillas .
In 2005 , he dismissed the prime minister and assumed full executive powers , declaring an emergency and granting sweeping powers to the military .
Leading opposition politicians were rounded up , heavy media censorship imposed and protests ruthlessly crushed .
However , as the 2001 bloodbath revealed , the whole institution of the monarchy was in crisis .
The shut - in world of the royal family was completely divorced from the reality of the vast majority of the population .
Yet the same international media that today heralds the end of the monarchy routinely used phrases such as “ beloved monarch widely revered as an incarnation of a Hindu god Vishnu ” to describe Birendra in particular .
In reality , the history of the Nepali monarchy is comparatively brief — some 240 years .
Its origins go back to the eighteenth century , when the Shah clan was driven out of India and retreated to the mountainous areas of Nepal .
With the assistance of the British East India Company , the Shah ruler consolidated its rule over the bulk of present - day Nepal .
In 1857 , the Nepali regime provided badly needed soldiers to assist the British to suppress the widespread mutiny of Indian soldiers .
The whole record is sordid .
In 1846 , protracted and bitter factional infighting culminated in a bloody brawl one night that resulted in the death of dozens of Nepali aristocrats .
The chief beneficiary of what became known as the Kot massacre was prime minister Jang Bahadur who drove his rivals into exile , and established what amounted to a hereditary prime ministership , with the monarchy under virtual house arrest .
The rule of the Ranas only ended in 1951 , when with the assistance of Nepali Congress and Indian government , King Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah was installed on the revived throne .
For more than half a century , King Tribhuvan , followed by his son Mahendra in 1955 and his grandson Bihendra in 1972 , presided over one of the world ’s last remaining absolute monarchies .
Despite the illusions fostered by Nepali Congress , King Mahendra repeatedly stalled on the granting of a constitution .
When it was finally proclaimed in 1959 , the constitution was a farce .
The king retained sweeping powers , including the right to impose a state of emergency , which he did without warning in 1960 and ordered the arrest of political leaders .
His son Bihendra only granted a limited “ democratic ” constitution in 1990 after mass protests in 1989 threatened to spiral out of control despite a ruthless crackdown that resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people .
Increasingly the Nepali monarchy was an anachronism that frustrated efforts by sections of the business elite to integrate the economically backward country into globalised processes of production .
Efforts by the traditional parties — Nepali Congress and its various Stalinist allies — invariably floundered on the vested interests of the royalist cliques and the army hierarchy .
With their promises to “ fight feudalism ” and enact “ a radical social and economic transformation ” to create a favourable environment for foreign investors , the Maoists are offering a way out of the impasse for the local capitalist class .
The imposition of far - reaching market reforms will provoke political opposition as social conditions for the majority deteriorate even further .
Nepal is one of the world ’s poorest countries with an average per capita income of just $ US280 a year .
Over 30 percent of the population of nearly 30 million lives below the official poverty line and in rural areas in particular basic services such as clean water , sanitation , schools and medical services are very limited or non-existent .
For all the talk about democracy , the next government will inevitably require anti-democratic methods to impose its policies .
The political situation is highly unstable .
The CPN - M has been called on to form the next government but requires the support of other parties to establish a majority in the assembly .
A coalition is yet to be formed and the leading ministerial posts are undecided .
At the same time , while King Gyanendra has indicated that he will leave the palace , the royalists and the army top brass undoubtedly harbour ambitions to make a comeback .
The army has refused demands by the CPN -M to integrate its fighters .
Several small bombs that exploded in Kathmandu on Tuesday and Wednesday were widely believed to be the work of royalist groups .
The instability is further compounded by the intrigues of Nepal ’s neighbours and the major powers , all of which are scrambling for influence in Kathmandu .
India has traditionally regarded Nepal as part of its sphere of influence and is concerned about a possible growth in Chinese influence .
Both countries have welcomed the declaration of a republic .
India is sending a delegation to Kathmandu next month to discuss a “ comprehensive economic partnership . ”
China has offered to develop a railway link with Nepal .
The US may well play the most destabilising role .
The Bush administration backed the monarchy during the April 2006 protests until the last minute and opposed the integration of the Maoists into the interim government .
Washington has refused to take the CPN - M off its list of terrorist organisations despite efforts by the Maoist leaders to reassure the US that its interests will be protected .
Last week , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Evan Feigenbaum visited Kathmandu to assess the situation and held talks with Prime Minister Koirala as well as Maoist leader Prachanda .
Feigenbaum warned in Washington yesterday that the degree to which the US would work with the Maoists depended on how well they stayed away from violence .
The real threat of provocation and violence , however , comes from the former monarchy , the army and royalist supporters .
Washington is quite capable of encouraging such activities if it finds that its rivals — notably Russia and China — are gaining the upper hand in Kathmandu .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush said Friday that " it 's clear our economy has slowed , " hours after a government report showed a decline in payrolls for the second straight month .
But he said the long - term outlook is good , with a stimulus package enacted last month by Congress providing support for the economy .
" I know this is a difficult time for our economy , " the president said .
" But we recognized the problem early and we provided the economy with a booster shot . "
Bush said the effects of the stimulus package are " just starting to kick in " and that the plan will " put money into the hands of American workers and businesses . "
Earlier in the day , Bush 's chief economic adviser Edward Lazear said that the nation 's economy could contract in the current quarter .
But he added that , " we expect that the economy will get stronger , primarily in the third quarter . "
The statements come after the Labor Department said employers made their deepest cut in staffing in almost five years during February , highlighting concerns that a recession is imminent .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , said in remarks made on the Senate floor that Americans are " burdened by an economy that is spiraling downward every day . "
Reid noted that Bush does not think the economy is headed for a recession , but argues that the facts prove otherwise .
" This morning , all signs point in that direction , " Reid said .
" But regardless of what label we use , there is no doubt whatsoever that the American people are suffering . "
Meanwhile , oil prices spiked to a record high above $ 106 a barrel Friday , raising concerns that higher gas prices will hurt consumers and increase inflation .
On Wall Street , stocks fell to their lowest level in nearly 18 months as recession fears continued to spook investors .
This infrastructure is considered to be beta .
Everything should be usable , to a certain degree .

Individuals who engage in costly punishment do not benefit from their behavior , according to a new study published in the journal Nature by researchers at Harvard University and the Stockholm School of Economics .
The group , led by Martin A. Nowak of Harvard 's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics , Department of Mathematics , and Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology , examined cooperation among subjects playing a modified version of the Prisoner 's Dilemma .
This game captures the fundamental tension between the interests of the individual and the group , and is the classic paradigm for cooperation .
The study found that the use of punitive behavior correlates strongly with reduced individual payoff , and bestows no benefit on the group as a whole .
" Put simply , winners do n't punish , " says co-author David G. Rand of Harvard 's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Department of Systems Biology .
" Punishment can lead to a downward spiral of retaliation , with destructive outcomes for everybody involved .
The people with the highest total payoffs do not use costly punishment . "
" Costly punishment , " the type of punitive behavior studied by Nowak and his colleagues , refers to situations where a punisher is willing to incur a cost in order to penalize someone else .
Other researchers have suggested that costly punishment can compel cooperation in one - time interactions where individuals need not worry about reputation or retaliation -- a scenario Nowak and his colleagues found unrealistic , since , as they write , " most of our interactions are repeated and reputation is always at stake . "
" There 's been a lot of previous work on the use of punishment in cooperation games , but the focus has not been on situations where individuals use punishment in the context of ongoing interactions , " says co-author Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics and the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard .
" We make the setting more realistic by having subjects play repeated games and introducing costly punishment as one of several options . "
Dreber , Rand , Nowak , and Drew Fudenberg of Harvard 's Department of Economics recruited 104 Boston - area college students to participate in a computer - based Prisoner 's Dilemma game that was extended to include costly punishment alongside the usual options of cooperation and defection .
Pairs of students played the game repeatedly so the interaction between costly punishment and reciprocity could be assessed .
The result :
There is a strong negative correlation between individual payoff and the use of costly punishment .
The five top - ranked players never used costly punishment , while players who earned the lowest payoffs tended to punish most often .
Winners used a tit - for - tat like strategy while losers used costly punishment .
Furthermore , costly punishment did not increase the average payoff of the group .
The study shows that punishment is not an effective force for promoting cooperation .
The unfortunate tendency of humans to engage in acts of costly punishment must have evolved for other reasons such as establishing dominance hierarchy and defending ownership , but not to promote cooperation .
In cooperation games , costly punishment is a detrimental and self - destructive behavior .
" Punishment may be a tool for forcing another person to do what you want , " Dreber says .
" It might have been for those kinds of dominance situations that the use of punishment has evolved . "
" Our finding has a very positive message :
In an extremely competitive setting , the winners are those who resist the temptation to escalate conflicts , while the losers punish and perish , " concludes Nowak .
This study was supported by the John Templeton Foundation , the National Science Foundation , the National Institutes of Health , the Jan Wallander Foundation , and J. Epstein .
Family 's Struggle : All Six Kids Are Autistic Each of the Kirtons ' children has a different type of autism .
Feb. 5 , 2008  --
Autism is a difficult diagnosis for any parent .
For Robin and John Kirton , it 's difficulty times six .
Each of their six children suffers from a different form of the disorder , which affects an estimated one in 150 American children .
It 's an incredibly rare occurrence that , experts say , points to something in the genes .
Studies have shown that if one child has autism , the chance of the next sibling having it is only about 15 percent .
" They 've rolled the dice six times and have a child each time with autism .
That 's really uncommon , " explains Dr. Gary Goldstein of the Kennedy Krieger Institute for pediatric research and treatment .
After reading about the Kirton 's inspiring story in People magazine , " Good Morning America " decided to visit the Utah family to find out just how they cope .
" We worry about them , where they 're going to be 10 , 20 years in the future , " says John .
Together , he and Robin navigate the diverse world of autism , and deal with each child 's individual condition .
Shy and Awkward
Bobby , the oldest at 14 , has Aspergers , a high functioning form of autism that his teachers started noticing in the 5th grade .
" He just would not speak up .
If he was n't sure about something , he just would n't ask .
He was like a fly on the wall , and would just sit back and not do things ... we did n't know any better , we just thought he was quiet , " explains John .
With the help of his school , Bobby has been able to thrive , academically , but is often lost when it comes to social and behavioral skills , shying away from other kids on the playground , unsure of how to make friends .
" He does n't engage in back and forth conversations with people .
It 's mainly one - sided on his side , whatever interests him mainly , " says John .
Anxiety , Tantrums , Meltdowns
The next oldest children , 9 - year - old Emma and 8 - year - old Nephi , have more severe Aspergers .
Unlike their older brother , they are prone to anxiety , temper tantrums and extreme fixations with a specific object .
The Kirton family has started a Web site , for parents of autistic children .
Learn more about the family at AutismBites.com .
When " GMA " arrived , they were both so obsessed , Emma with her artwork and Nephi with his Legos , they did n't want to talk or do anything else .
Nephi is " somewhat like Emma , where he has the meltdowns at school , as well , " according to John .
" He has hit [ others ] before , also , so he and Emma are very similar in that respect .
Varying levels , different things upset him , though he 's not as anxious as Emma .
Nephi does n't quite worry as much as she does . "
" Just the little things will set her off , and we never know what things will set her off , and when , " Robin explains .
" In school , she 'll get upset about the most trivial thing that would n't bother a kid half her age , and she 'll just start crying , burst out in tears , sometimes she 'll cry out loud , wail .
Sometimes she will strike other children , she 'll hit , " says Robin .
" She has a very difficult time transitioning from one activity to the next , and will sometimes have fits , bouts of aggression over it , because it upsets her so much to not be able to finish . "
Non-Verbal , Classic Autism
At the other end of the spectrum are 6 - year - old Sarah and 4 - year - old Ammon .
With a diagnosis of classic autism , both are completely non-verbal , and have wreaked havoc on the Kirtons ' home .
Both have to be diapered with extra tape , and their clothes put on backwards to prevent them from putting their hands inside their dirty diapers .
" She 's not potty trained , she 's 6 years old , and she 's not potty trained , " says John .
" She does a lot of screaming , that 's how she communicates . "
" We have to strap Sarah in when she eats , because otherwise , she 'll just bounce around , so , in order to get her to sit there and finish a meal , I have to strap her in , " explains Robin .
Ammon used to rock in a recliner so violently that he once flipped himself over , and would spend hours and hours shredding paper .
" He sways his head and bobs , and when he's in the bathtub , he likes to pour water continuously over his head and watch the water fall .
He flaps his hands , and he moves his head , " says John .
PDD -NOS
With the least severe form of autism , called PDD - NOS , 3 - year - old Mary is the youngest of the brood .
" She 's about a year delayed with her language .
She 's also emotionally behind , as well .
She gets upset and has these little meltdowns , as well .
She does a little bit of hand flapping , " says Robin .
How could this happen to all six ?
" The current feeling is , it 's a combination of genetic risk and some environmental risk that either determines what kind of autism the child has , or how severe the autism is , " explains Goldstein .
No matter how severe the autism , this disorder can be financially crippling for families .
The average cost of caring for just one autistic child is $ 500 a month .
" The biggest factor that is holding us back , and a lot of autistic parents , is being able to afford to try different things , because there are some methods out there that cost a tremendous amount of money , " explains John .
Feeling Incredibly Blessed
Despite the challenges that daily life with six autistic children can bring , John and Robin say they feel incredibly blessed to have them .
" They 're just so wonderful in their own unique ways , and we accept them and love them for who they are , and they just bring so much joy into our lives , and we just love being their parents , " says Robin .
" We do love them , and want to take care of them , and just hope for a better day to make their lives easier , " says John .
Blogging For Support
The Kirton family has also started a Web site , a sort of cyber support group for parents of autistic children .

Something that happened to the last 3 Republican presidents , and to Obama in their first reelection debates .
Did not happen to Trump .
Both Bushes , Obama and even the great Ronald Reagan were dead on their feet and had truly horrible first debates .
That 's what caused the " Reagan is too old " talk , that he had to salvage with his classic joke about Mondale 's youth and inexperience , in a later debate .
Most presidents get so used to being catered to in office , they just are n't ready for their first debate .
It 's been glaring in every other case in recent history .
Obama looked like ...
1941 : German engineer Konrad Zuse unveils the Z3 , now generally recognized as the first fully functional , programmable computer .
Because Zuse designed and built his computer inside Nazi Germany , which was already at war , his achievement went unnoticed outside Germany until after the Third Reich 's collapse .
In the meantime , the Harvard Mark 1 , a computer produced by an American team , appeared in 1944 and is still occasionally cited as the first of its kind .
Complicating Zuse 's claim of priority , an air raid destroyed his computer , as well as all accompanying photographs and documentation .
Zuse rebuilt the Z3 15 years after the war ended , to demonstrate its capabilities and to establish his claim to the patents associated with the machine .
The Z3 , Zuse 's third computer in a series of four , used the simple binary system for performing complicated mathematical computations – its outstanding feature .
Zuse is also remembered for devising Plankalkül ( calculation plan ) , an early programming language designed , although never implemented , for engineering purposes .
Additionally , he 's credited with founding the world 's first computer startup company , Zuse - Ingenieurbüro Hopferau , or Zuse Engineering Office of Hopferau ( Bavaria ) , in 1946 .
Zuse 's achievement , according to his son , was even more remarkable considering he worked independently , even in isolation , and remained unaware of contemporary developments in computer science .
And unlike computer pioneers in the Allied countries , Zuse received precious little support from his government .
The Nazis saw little military value in his computers and provided only very minimal funding .
Years later , Zuse was generously funded by Siemens and some other German companies when he rebuilt his Z1 computer as part of a retro computing project .
A replica of the Z3 ( and the Z4 ) is on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised Egyptian efforts to bring calm to the Middle East when asked on Thursday about talks between Cairo and Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad .
Rice told a Brussels news conference she could not comment on specific meetings but said : “ I talked with the Egyptians and we fully expect the Egyptians to carry out the efforts that they said they would carry out to try to bring about calm in the region , to try to improve the situation in Gaza . ”
Asked whether talking to Hamas , branded a terrorist group by the United States , Israel and Europe , did not undermine peace efforts , she said : “ As you know , Egypt is a good ally in this effort to help the Annapolis ( Israeli - Palestinian peace ) solution come into being , and I trust that what the Egyptians are doing is exactly in that course . ”
GLOBAL ELITE GATHER IN D.C. Trilateral Commission members want suffering U.S. taxpayers to shell out even more money The Trilateral Commission — one of the three most powerful globalist groups in the world — held closed - door meetings right here in Washington , D.C. from April 25 to 28 .
True to form , those members of the media who knew about the meeting — or were themselves participants in the proceedings — refused to discuss what went on inside or report on the attendees .
Luckily , AFP ’s own editor , Jim Tucker , was on the scene to bust this clandestine confabulation wide open .
By James P. Tucker Jr. Luminaries at the Trilateral Commission meeting in Washington expressed confidence that they own all three major presidential candidates , who , despite political posturing , will support sovereignty - surrendering measures such as NAFTA and the “ North American Union . ”
“ John has always supported free trade , even while campaigning before union leaders , ” said one .
“ Hil and Barack are pretending to be unhappy about some things , but that ’s merely political posturing .
They ’re solidly in support . ”
He was referring to Sens. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) and Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) .
Mrs. Clinton , they noted , held strategy sessions as first lady on how to get Congress to approve NAFTA “ without changes . ”
As president , they agreed , she would do no more than “ dot an i or cross a t . ”
Candidate Obama has not denied news reports in Canada that his top economic adviser , Austan Goolsbee , assured Canadian diplomats that the senator would keep NAFTA intact and his anti-trade talk is just “ campaign rhetoric . ”
PETRIFIED ABOUT PAUL
While they are confident they can deal with any “ potential president , ” the Trilateralists paid huge tribute to Ron Paul in an equally large twist of irony , by expressing alarm that he is causing “ significant future damage . ”
They expressed concern that Paul ’s rallies have attracted multitudes of young people who are getting “ their political education . ”
They want Republicans to pressure Paul to drop out now and stop his education rallies .
This assignment was given to Thomas Foley , former U.S. House speaker .
The reasons Paul ’s “ education campaign ” strikes fear into Trilateral hearts are obvious .
Paul would refuse to surrender an ounce of U.S. sovereignty to an international organization and TC wants world government .
Paul would immediately bring U.S. troops home from Iraq , Afghanistan and from 130 UN “ peacekeeping ” missions around the globe .
TC wants to enjoy war profiteering and global power .
Paul would abolish the federal income tax while the TC wants to pile on a global tax payable to the UN .
The formal agenda was loaded with everything Paul and American patriots detest : higher taxes , more foreign giveaways , more immigration , both legal and illegal , into the United States and “ engaging Iran , ” among others .
AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY HER FAIR SHARE ?
The Trilaterals got down to real work on Saturday , April 26 , with a high - powered panel called “ U.S. Foreign and Domestic Policy : Broad Outlines for a New Administration . ”
It was presided over by journalistic pimp David Gergen , who will write nothing about TC in his magazine , U.S News and World Report .
Also participating were Kenneth Duberstein , former White House chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan ; Strobe Talbot , president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state ; and Joseph Nye , former assistant secretary of defense .
Henry Kissinger , former secretary of state and long - time Bilderberg leader , was present and listed as a participant .
But a TC staff member crossed his name out .
Some speculated he had throat problems .
This panel had these orders for the next president : increase foreign aid across the board because “ America does not pay its fair share , ” pay up the arrears in UN dues , allow as many immigrants into the United States as want to come and provide “ amnesty ” for illegal aliens already here .
Little , if anything , was said about the fact that American taxpayers pay one - fourth of the UN ’s operating costs and one - third of the cost of 130 “ peacekeeping missions ” or the fact that immigrants from South America depress wages here and the average immigrant family costs the government thousands of dollars a year in welfare , health and other “ benefits . ”
Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank and another long - time Bilderberg boy , largely echoed these views in a sweetheart “ interview ” by another journalistic strumpet , Lionel Barber , editor of The Financial Times , who will obediently report nothing .
FIGHT WARMING ; ALLOW IMMIGRANTS
There were “ subgroup ” meetings on “ climate change , ” “ water and sanitation ” and “ migration and development . ”
Every nation , especially the U.S. , should spend big bucks to fight “ global warming , ” they agreed .
The United States should spend more “ because Americans cause the most pollution , ” one argued .
Americans should send more money to Africa so natives can drink clean water and scrub themselves , they said .
Antonio Garrigues Walker , chairman of Garrigues Abogadas y Asesores Tributarios , joined Peter Sutherland , the UN secretary - general ’s “ special representative on migration and development , ” to call on the United States to not only allow unlimited immigration , but to throw more money at Mexico and other impoverished Latin countries .
It was , somehow , their “ right ” to have more U.S. dollars .
Sutherland is chairman of British Petroleum and Goldman Sachs International .
He is also a long - time Bilderberg leader .
MEDIA BLACKOUT
Bill Emmott , another kept journalist , spoke on “ the rise of Asia ” at a reception - dinner held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum .
Emmott , former editor of The Economist , will report nothing .
Sunday morning , Robert Blackwill , former U.S. deputy national security adviser for Iraq , led a panel discussion on “ engaging Iran and building peace in the Persian Gulf Region . ”
For the first time , there was dissent .
Blackwill tried to rationalize the invasion of Iraq .
Others doubted that Saddam Hussein was connected to the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks or was a nuclear threat .
Blackwill said the military option remains but he hopes diplomatic efforts succeed .
Other participants were Ray Takeyh of the Council on Foreign Relations , which functions as the propaganda ministry for TC and Bilderberg ; Volker Perthes , head of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and Hitoshi Tanaka , former Japanese deputy minister of Foreign Affairs .
MORE , MORE , MORE MONEY
More foreigners demanded more U.S. money at a lunch panel called “ European and Asian views on U.S. Foreign and Security Policy . ”
Participants were Elisabeth Guigou , a member of the French National Assembly and former minister for European affairs and Han Sung - joo , former minister of foreign affairs for South Korea .
An afternoon session addressed “ global health ” with more calls for American tax dollars .
A major voice in this cause came from Sylvia Mathews Burwell , president of Global Development Programs , Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Bill Gates has attended at least one Bilderberg meeting .
EXCUSES FOR IRAQ ; PLANS FOR IRAN
John Negroponte , U.S. deputy secretary of state , addressed the evening dinner on “ U.S. foreign policy perspectives . ”
Again , the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were rationalized and an invasion of Iran held out as a possibility .
The Monday morning finale addressed the Global Financial Crisis involving these luminaries : Robert Kimmitt , U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury ; Martin Feldstein , former chairman of the President ’s Council of Economic Advisers ; David Rubenstein , managing director of The Carlyle Group ; Naoki Tanaka , president of the Center for International Public Policy Studies and Sir Andrew Crockett , president of JP Morgan Chase International .
Among them , there was much talk of the U.S. government ’s “ duty ” to “ intervene ” on behalf of “ financial institutions under stress . ”
Little or nothing was said of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are losing their homes because financial institutions lured them into buying houses they could not afford .
Throughout the weekend , no American voices were heard objecting to the demands on their country .
Instead , there were smiles , nods and applause .
AFP editor James P. Tucker Jr. is a veteran journalist who spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .
Since 1975 he has won widespread recognition , here and abroad , for his pursuit of on - the - scene stories reporting the intrigues of global power blocs such as the Bilderberg Group .
Tucker is the author of Jim Tucker ’s Bilderberg Diary .
Loaded with photos — many never published before — the book recounts Tucker ’s experiences over the last quarter century at Bilderberg meetings .

No charge for S&H in U.S. ( Issue # 19 , May 12 , 2008 )
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- China banking and securities regulators signed an agreement with their U.S. counterparts Monday that will help to lay the groundwork to enable Chinese investors to buy and sell U.S. stocks and mutual funds .
The agreement signed between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the China Banking Regulatory Commission marks a further expansion of QDII -- the qualified domestic institutional investor program -- and brings the U.S. in line with similar agreements signed between Beijing and regulators in Singapore , Hong Kong , Japan and the U.K .
According to data from the U.S. Treasury Department from last June , China held $ 922 billion in U.S. securities -- but only $ 29 billion of that in U.S. stocks .
Most of the rest is held in U.S. government bonds .
" What we 've seen over the last six to 12 months , China has a lot of capital and is looking for ways to make that capital work harder and more efficiently , " said Charlie Awdry , a fund manager for Gartmore 's China Opportunities Fund .
" This is illustrative of the broader engagement between China and the rest of the world . "
Analysts said Chinese banks may not be in much of a rush to invest in the U.S. , however .
" It 's significant in the sense that , in the long run , Chinese money will invest in the U.S. , but this is just part of the ongoing process , " said Lan Xue , Citigroup 's head of China research in Hong Kong .
" The actual implementation will be long and slow , " said Gartmore 's Awdry .
Glenn Maguire , head of Asian economic research for Societe Generale in Hong Kong , pointed out that investors bid up Hong Kong - listed stocks on a similar announcement , but the money from the mainland largely did n't materialize .
" Any type of change to capital outflows is evolutionary rather than revolutionary , " he said .
Because of the appreciation in the yuan , stress in the U.S. financial sector and the upcoming U.S. presidential election , Chinese banks might not exhibit such a great appetite for U.S. equities , he said .
So far , China 's institutions and sovereign wealth funds have suffered from investing in financial - services stocks like Blackstone Group BX , +0.09 % , Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % and the U.K.'s Barclays BCS , - 0.60 % .
Still , Shanghai - listed stocks have done ever worse than their U.S. counterparts this year .
The Shanghai Composite is down over 30 % , compared to the 6.7 % fall for the S&P 500 .

Exemptions exist for antique sword collectors Legislation against selling , making , hiring or importing samurai swords in England and Wales has come into force .
Those breaking the law face six months in jail and a £ 5,000 fine .
Carrying a sword in public is already illegal .
Exemptions will cover swords which are used for re-enactments or antique weapons kept on display by collectors .
Eight years ago a councillor was killed by a man wielding a samurai sword in the office of Cheltenham Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones .
Anyone found guilty of importing samurai swords will face up to seven years in prison and an unlimited fine .
' Cheap reproductions ' Samurai swords are part of Japanese history and genuine artefacts can change hands for large sums of money .
But in recent years there has been a trade in reproductions which can be bought over the internet for as little as £ 35 and they have been used in several attacks .
This ban is part of our wider strategy to tackle serious violent crime
Vernon Coaker
Last month a gang of youths , one armed with a samurai sword , attacked a 15 - year - old boy in Newry , County Down .
On another occasion , a youth was seen brandishing a sword in Newcastle .
Chris James , who deals in antique military items , including Japanese swords , told the BBC he welcomed the legislation .
He said : " I do n't have a problem with it if it stops youths getting hold of cheap reproductions . "
Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker said : " The government takes violent crime very seriously and we are determined to do all we can to protect individuals and communities .
Consultation " Having undertaken a wide consultation we recognise that it is the cheap and easily available samurai swords that have been used in crime .
That is why we have made sensible exemptions for genuine enthusiasts .
" This ban is part of our wider strategy to tackle serious violent crime .
Later this year we will launch a new advertising campaign aimed at preventing young people carrying knives . "
In 2000 MP Nigel Jones survived a samurai sword attack A Home Office spokeswoman said the government had consulted collectors and martial arts groups as well as laws enforcement agencies .
Swords aged over 100 years will be exempt from the law , and defences will be in place for crown functions , museums and drama productions .
Alf Hitchcock , of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) , said : " Throughout the consultation process the Association of Chief Police Officers has supported the government 's position on the banning of samurai swords .
The introduction of a ban is much needed .
Alf Hitchcock , Acpo " As I have said on previous occasions , these are not the most common weapons for people to carry and use in violent crimes but nationally there have been some significant incidents , serious assaults and murders using a samurai sword .
" So we feel the introduction of a ban is much needed . "
Currently 17 weapons , including knuckle dusters and batons are on the Offensive Weapons Order , which was created by the Criminal Justice Act 1988 .

2. First , get drunk and watch some episodes of that old beloved failed TV series .
Become nostalgic , call up one of the lead actors you havenât seen in a while , and offer him the lead role in your new movie .
This has several benefits : youâve already got their phone number right on you , the shooting process is that much more like your old Frat days , and you know theyâll be grateful for the part .
Sometimes theyâll even write the script for you , in which case you can just give them the cocktail napkin and let them go nuts .
But try not to give the same actor the lead role in more than one movie ; they tend to get uppity .
Remember , youâre the star here ; theyâre just the medium for your genius .
If all of your friends are busy , give Steve Carrel a shot .
Heâs a decent guy , and Rudd vouches for him .
Now populate the rest of the film with as many male bit players from your previous films as possible .
A good method is to put the names of all the people you regularly go drinking with on a wheel , then spin it and match them to characters .
And donât worry , you donât need to generate character traits for all these people ; they can still play themselves , just in new costumes and with new jobs .
Pepper in the occasional popular TV comedian , and your male cast is complete .
As for the female cast , DO NOT use the wheel method .
If you can help it , you should never reuse an actress ; people want new eye candy , and all actresses are equally funny ( which is to say , as funny as the guy they are in a scene with ) .
Since the protagonist is based on you and will want to sleep with these women , try and cast women youâd want to sleep with .
This has the added benefit that sometimes you get to sleep with them .
3 . The key here is quantity .
You havenât written any funny lines yet , but if you get enough footage of the actors saying things , chances are some of the things they say will be funny .
Youâve got your premise ( you with a minor flaw would like to sleep with a pretty lady ) , and thatâs enough to start .
Let the actors work ; all you need to do is roll camera and change angle occasionally so you can edit it all together later .
And donât worry about continuity errors or making motivated cinematography choices ; remember , this is a comedy , and most of the audience will be high .
Youâre not Joel Coen , for Godâs sake .

一見すると、そのグラフは 、Yawsに対する信じられないくらい大きなスケーラビリティの優位性があるように見えます。Apacheが4000のパラレル接続でダウンしたのに対し、Yawsは80,000を超えるスケール能力を持っています。このグラフに対する反応は大きく二極化する傾向にあります。「これらのグラフは正確な方法で行われたものではなかった」あるいは「 Apacheの設定ミスに違いない」というものと、それとは反対に「ワオ！Yawsを利用する価値がある」というものです。
Yawsの比較グラフを信じるかどうかに関係なく、Yaws(サイト・英語)は動的コンテンツを提供するための確かなWebサーバーです。Claes Wikstrom氏は 、Yaws を「 もう一つ のWebサーバー」として 、Erlang ( サイト・英語 ) で実装しました。それは、長時間稼動、並列性、高信頼性分散システムのサポートに特化して作られたプログラミング言語です。( Erlangについてもっと勉強したければ、言語作成者であるJoe Armstrong氏によって書かれたすばらしい書籍Programming Erlangbook ( source ) を参照してください )
Erlangのいくつかの独自機能と相まったYawsの柔軟性は、RESTful
Webサービスプラットフォームとして説得力のある組み合わせとなります。もし静的なページを提供したいのであれば、代わりにlighttpd(サイト・英語)やnginx(サイト・英語)を入手してください。しかし、動的なRESTful
Webサービスを書いているのであれば、Yawsは間違いなく調査する価値があります。本稿では、Webサービス開発にYawsとErlangを使用した私の経験のいくつかを説明します。
Yaws基礎
Yawsは、動的 なWebコンテンツの提供やRESTful
Webサービスのサポートに関していくつかの方法を提供します。:
関連スポンサーコンテンツ 静的ページ内へ のErlangコードの埋め込み。このアプローチでは、静的コンテンツの中に直接erlタグを書き、その中に書く out/1 という関数にErlangのコードを埋め込みます。ファイルは、 .yaws という拡張子を持ち、そのファイルはYawsによって処理され、その中に含まれるであろう out/1 関数の実行結果と共にerlタグが置き換えられます。Erlangの表記では、 out /1 はarityが1の関数ということです。即ち、関数が1つの引数をとることを意味します。その引数は、Yawsの arg レコードとして期待され、コードでそれらをハンドリングすることを目的に、受け取った入力リクエストに対する詳細を伝えるためにYawsが利用するデータ構造です。例えば、arg レコードは、リクエストURI、ヘッダー、
POST データなどといった情報を提供します。
アプリケーションモジュール（appmods）。Yawsのappmod機能は、アプリケーションコードがURIをコントロールするためのものです。前述したアプローチでは、Erlangのコードは、静的ファイル内に組み込まれ、そのURIはWebサーバーのドキュメントルートの相対パスによって決定されます。しかし、appmodと共にアプリケーションがURIの意味をコントロールします。そして、そのURIは通常、どのファイルシステムにあるものとも一致しません。基本的に、Appmodsは out/1 関数を利用したErlangのモジュールです。そういったモジュールは、URIパス要素に対応づけるためのYawsの設定ファイル内に書かれています。リクエストが登録されたappmodと関連づけられたパス要素を含んでいる場合、Yawsはそのモジュールの out/1 関数を呼び出し、それをarg レコードに渡します。appmodの out/1 関数は、的確なリソースを確定するために残りのURIを検査することができます。そのリソースは、受け取ったリクエストのターゲットであり、それ相応に反応します。
Yawsアプリケーション( yapps ) 。通常、単一のErlangモジュールであるappmodsとは異なり、Yawsのyapps
は成熟したアプリケーションです。それぞれのyapp
には自身のドキュメントルートを持ち、それぞれが専用のappmodのセットを持つことができます。特に、yappsはErlang/OTPのアプリケーションです。OTPとは、「 Open Telecom Platform」のことで、強力な機能を持つErlangアプリケーションを提供するための、十分に実績のあるライブラリとフレームワークのセットです。OTPは、分散、イベントハンドリング、高信頼性といった多くのことをおこなうためのイディオムやアプローチを隠蔽します。Erlang/OTPは、いろいろなテレコムシステムの中で、実世界の現場での利用実績があります。例えば、1年を通じてたった数ミリ秒のダウンタイムをマークしています。
これら3つのアプローチ全てが、Yaws のWebサイト( サイト・英語 )
で詳しく述べられており、RESTful Webサービスに役立つように応用させることも可能で、サービスそれ自身の特異性に依存しています。しかしながら、私の経験では、Webアプリケーションに対する最高の制御を提供するので、yappsとappmodsはベストに機能します。
RESTfulな設計
私たちはRESTful Webサービスを開発したいので、「 Representational State Transfer ( 表現の状態遷移 ) 」として表されるRESTに関して、いくつか細かい部分を見ることにしましょう。Webのような大規模な分散システムに適したアーキテクチャスタイルを表現するために、Roy T. Fielding は、自身の論文の中 で「 REST 」という言葉を使いました( source )。本質的には、HTTPはRESTの実装です。「
Representational State Transfer」という言葉は、リクエストとレスポンスの中で、リソース状態の表現のやりとりを通してRESTfulシステムが動作するという事実を表しています。例えば、HTTPのGETで得られた典型的なWebページは、GETを対象としたURIによって指定されるWebリソースのHTML表現です。
RESTful なWebサービスを開発するとき、以下の事項は注意すべき重要事項です。
リソースとリソース識別子
それぞれのリソースに対応したメソッド
クライアントとサーバー間のデータ交換フォーマット
ステータスコー ド
リクエストとレスポンスそれぞれに対する適切なHTTPヘッダ
Yaws とErlangを背景として、これらの分野をそれぞれ検討しましょう。
リソース識別子
RESTful な Webサービスを設計するときには、サービスが何のリソースで構成されているのか、それらを特定する一番の方法は何か、お互いがどのように関連しているのかといったことについて考える必要があります。RESTfulなリソースはURIによって識別されます。通常、関連するリソースにはURIがあり、それ自身が関連していて、共通のパス要素を共有しています。例えば、Webベースのバグトラッキングシステムでは、架空のプロジェクト「フェニックス」に対する全てのバグが、URI
http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/
によって見ることができます。それに対して、特定のバグ番号12345は、
http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/12345/
によって見ることができます。RESTfulなリソースは、自身の状態表現の中で他のリソースに対するURIを提供する傾向もあります。それにより、Web アプリケーション全体の一部をナビゲートするための状態表現の中に返されたURIを使用するために、クライアントが特定のリソースの状態を取得することができます。
Yawsでは、 arg レコードがリクエス トURI を示します。そして、 yaws_api モジュールがそれを簡単に取得するための request_url 関数を提供します 。
out ( Arg ) ->
Uri = yaws_api:request_url ( Arg ) ,
Path = string : tokens ( Uri#url.path , " / " ) ,
一度、リクエス トURI を持てば、上記に示すように、/(スラッシュ)で区切ることでリクエストパスを分割することが便利であると分かります。その結果は、appmodと関連のあるURIポイントで始まるパス要素のリストとなります。例えば、URI
http://www.example.com/projects/ の「 projects」パス要素上にappmodを関連づけたとします。あるリクエストが、プレフィックスとしてそのURIを含む全てのURIで構成されているのならば、appmodのout/1 関数は、リクエストのターゲットリソースを表している分割されたパス要素のリストとなります。例えば、URI
http://www.example.com/projects/Phoenix/bugs/
のリクエストは、上記で示したコードを実行した後で、Pathの値の中にあるErlangのパス要素のリストになります。:
[ " projects " , " Phoenix " , " bugs " ]
URI を分割することの効用として 、Erlangのパターンマッチにより、ディスパッチがとても簡単になります。例えば、このような関数の先頭を定義することにより、特定のURIを扱うための分割した関数を書くことができます。それをout/2と呼ぶことにしましょう。:
out ( Arg , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) ->
% code to handle this URI goes here .
この out / 2 f関数は、値 Project , によって、私たちが知っている全てのプロジェクトのバグリストに対する全てのリクエストを操作することができます。そして、それは関数本体を利用することができ、リクエストされている特定のプロジェクト名にセットされます。サポートしている追加のURIは単純です。それは、 out / 2 関数の値を追加するだけです。それらはYawsのフレームワークから直接呼ばれてないので、もし望むのであれば、これらの関数に対して out 以外の名前を自由に使用することもできます。
留意すべき点は、リソースURIを適切に定義することで、大きなメリットを生み出すということです。appmodsやyappsによって、リッチなURIの部分をもつことが非常に簡単です。何故なら異なるパス要素上の異なるappmodsの紐づきの単純化と、ディスパッチの容易さがあるからです。
Erlangのパターンマッチングは、異なるURIに対するリクエストハンドリングを容易にします。これを、全てのサービスが同じURIで与えらていて、
RESTfulでないサービス定義を伝統的に利用しているプアなものと比較してください。通常、このURIはスクリプトを示しています。リクエスト本体の中、あるいは、実際にリクエストをディスパッチするための場所を特定するURIのクエリー文字を通して提供された情報を使用するためのスクリプトを示しています。上で示すようなErlang/Yawsのディスパッチ技術によるURIは、伝統的なアプローチによる終わりがないかのようなパラメーターリストによる過剰なURIよりもはるかにすっきりとしています。
リソースメソッ ド
Webクライアント がWebリソース上で呼び出すことができる方法は、HTTPの動詞となるGET、PUT、POST、DELETEによって定義されます。しかし、個々のリソースはこれらの操作のサブセットのみをサポートする傾向にあります。あなたがWebサービスを設計するとき、それぞれのリソースがどの方法をサポートするのかを決め、RFC
2616( source )で定義されているそれぞれのHTTPの操作に期待されている動作に注意する必要があります。
Yawsでは、リクエストの方法は http_request レコードにあり、argレコードを通してアクセス可能です。
Method = ( Arg#arg.req ) #http_request.method
これは 、Erlangのatomを表現しているリクエストメソッドを返し、パターンマッチングのディスパッチアプローチに加えることができます。リクエストメソッドを含めるために、 out 関数に新しいパラメータを加え、 out / 3 に変えることができます。
out ( Arg , ' GET ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) ->
% code to handle GET for this URI goes here .
この関数は、プロジェクトごとのバグリストに対する
GET リクエストだけを扱います。おそらく、リストに新しいバグを追加するために、別の変数として
POST を扱うかもしれません。 GET や POST だけでなく、他の全ての操作を扱わないようにするには、同じURIに対して全てを補足する関数を記述するだけです。
out ( Arg , ' GET ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) ->
% code to handle GET for this URI goes here ;
out ( Arg , ' POST ' , [ " projects " , Project , " bugs " ] ) ->
% code to handle POST for this URI goes here ;
out ( Arg , _ Method , [ " projects " , _Project , " bugs " ] ) ->
[ {status , 405} ] .
ここで、 GET と POST 以外の方法 は、3つめにあたります。それは、HTTPステータス405を返し、「メソッドが許可されていない」ことを意味します。MethodとProjectの先頭にあるアンダースコアは、それらを使用しないことに対して、コンパイラの警告を出力しないようにするものです。
ちょうどURIのディスパッチのように、Erlangのパターンマッチングは、別々のHTTP操作を取り扱うために別々の関数にディスパッチすることを容易にします。
表現形式
RESTful なWebサービスを設計するとき、それぞれのリソースがどんな表現(群)をサポートするのかを考える必要があります。例えば、Webサービスのリソースは、通常XMLやJSON表現をサポートします。Erlangでは、XMLの読み込みと生成のためにxmerlライブラリ(source)を提供しており、YawsはわかりやすいJSONモジュールを提供しています。共に、とてもよく機能します。
クライアントがどんな表現(群) を選ぶのかを決めるために、送られてきたリクエストの
Accept header ヘッダーにアクセスすることができます。このヘッダーは、 headers レコードの中で利用することができ、 arg レコードを通して利用することもできます 。
Accept_hdr = ( Arg#arg.headers ) #headers.accept
あなたのリソースが複数の表現をサポートする場合、どちらの表現が好ましいかをクライアントが示したかどうかを見るために、このヘッダをチェックすることができます。クライアントが
Accept ヘッダーを送信していないならば、上で示した
Accept_hdr 変数は、atomの undefined がセットされるでしょう。そして、あなたのリソースはそれがベストであると考える表現であればなんでも提供することができます。さもなければ、あなたのサービスは、どの表現が送信されたのかを判断するために、
Accept_hdr の値をパースすることができます。クライアントが、リソースが実行できないようなリクエスト表現を要求するなら、何のフォーマットが受け入れ可能かを示しているボディ部と共に、「受け入れられない」を意味するHTTPステータス406を返します。
case Accept_hdr of
undefined ->
% return default representation ;
" application /xml " ->
% return XML representation ;
" application / json " ->
% return JSON representation ; ?
_ Other ->
Msg = " Accept : application / xml , application / json " ,
Error = " Error 406 " ,
[ {status , 406} ,
{header , {content_type , " text / html " }} ,
{ehtml ,
[ {head , [ ] , [ {title , [ ] , Error} ]} ,
{body , [ ] ,
[ {h1 , [ ] , Error} ,
{p , [ ] , Msg} ] } ] } ]
end .
上 のErlangのコードは、 application / xml か application / json のどちらであるかを見るために Accept_hdr の値をチェックしています。いずれかであれば、そのリソースは適切な表現を返しますが、そうでなければ、上記コードはリソースが提供しようとしている表現を示しているHTMLドキュメントに加えて、HTTPステータス406を返します。
求める表現を取り扱うもう一つの方法は、あなたが想像するように、もう一つのパラメータとしてout
ハンドラ関数にそれを加えることです。この方法では、Erlangのパターンマッチによって、リクエストがリクエストURI/メソッド/表現の組み合わせに対して適切なハンドラにディスパッチされることを保証します。これは、上記のようにケース文でハンドラが分散することを防ぎます。
ところで、この例で はYaws の ehtml タイプも示しています。それはHTMLを一連 の Erlangの言葉として表現する方法です。私は、 ehtml が書くのに非常に直感的であると思います。何故なら、それが直接HTMLの構造に従いながら、とてもコンパクトで、文字通りのHTMLを書くときに直面するタグの記述ミスや記述の面倒さを取り除いているからです。
ステータスコー ド
RFC 2616によって示されるように、RESTfulなWebサービスは適切なHTTPのステータスコードを返さなければなりません。適切なステータスを返すことは、Yawsにとって簡単なことです。単に、 out/1 関数の結果に、statusのタプルを含めます。適切なステータスコードを返す例として、上記のケース文を参照してください。もし、コードが明確にステータスをセットしていない場合は、Yawsは、成功を表すステータス200をセットします。
HTTPヘッダー
Yawsでのリクエストヘッダーの取得とリプライヘッダーの設定も簡単です。既に、ヘッダーレコードからAcceptヘッダーを取得する例を見てきました。他のリクエストヘッダーは、同様の方法で取得することができます。以下のように、リプライヘッダーをセットするには、単に返すリプライの header タプルをセットする必要があります 。
{header , {content_type , " text / html"}}
この例では、 Content - type ヘッダーに 「 text/html」をセットしています。同様にして、「メソッドが許可されていない」エラーを表すステータス405を返している先の例では、以下のヘッダーも含める必要があります。
{header , { " Allow " , " GET , POST" }}
Appmodsあるい はYapps ?
ここまで 、Yaws とErlangが、RESTfulなWebサービスに対して、最も重要な関心事の多くを扱うことをとても簡単にするための方法を見てきました。一つ残る疑問は、appmods対yappsの選択についてです。そして、その答えはあなたのサービスが何をするかに依存します。あなたが実装しているWebサービスが、他のバックエンドサービスと相互作用する必要があるならば、おそらくyappsがベストな選択でしょう。それらが本格的な
Erlang/ OTPアプリケーションならば、それらは一般的に初期化と終了の関数があり、バックエンドへのコネクションの生成と切断がおこなわれるでしょう。もし、あなたのyappがErlang/OTPの
gen_server ならば、例えば、 init / 1 関数は、 gen_server フレームワークが提供する状態を確立し、変更することが可能で、サーバーに入ってくる呼び出しによって、いつでもコールバックします。加えて、yappsを使用することは、同じようにappmodsを使用することができることを意味するので、別のものを選択するという問題ではありません。最後に、yapps
は、Erlang/OTPの管理ツリーに加わることが可能です。そこで、スーパーバイザープロセスがyappsを監視し、それらが機能しなくなれば再起動することができます。スーパーバイザーツリーは、Erlangシステムの長期稼動において重要な役割を果たしています。
本稿は、リレーショナルデータベース以外のバックエンドをベースとしたRESTfulなWebサービスについて適合させました。データーベースと従来のWebサーバーで実装しているならば、Erlyweb(サイト・英語)を調べる必要があります。それは、そのようなWebサービスのためのフレームワークであり、それもまたYawsとErlangをベースにしています。
結論
RESTful な Webサービスを実装することの重要な側面は、適切なプログラミング言語を選ぶことです。私たちは、様々なプログラミング言語の中にある多くのサービスフレームワークが、長年にわたって行ったり来たりするのを見てきました。そして、そのほとんどが、問題に適していなかったというだけの理由で失敗でした。
Yaws とErlangは、特別なRESTful
Webサービスフレームワークを提供しませんが、それでも、それらが提供するものは、RESTful開発を目的として特別に作られたその他多くの言語フレームワークよりも、RESTful開発により適しています。
この種の記事は、必ずし もYaws 、Erlang、RESTful
Webサービスの詳細に深く踏み込んでいるわけではありません。願わくは、簡単なコードの例を通して主要なトピックに触れ、それらを扱うための考え方を蓄えてくれることを望みます。私の経験では、YawsとErlangでRESTfulなWebアプリケーションを構築することは、とても簡単で、結果のコードは読むのが容易で、保守が容易で、拡張が容易です。

In the heart of California 's iconic Orange County — home to Disneyland and the bourgeois teens of MTV's Laguna Beach — is troubled Santa Ana .
The county seat of 353,000 , where nearly 6 out of every 10 adults over age 25 lack a high school diploma , suffers from crippling poverty and an explosion in crime .
In 2004 , the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government placed Santa Ana at the very top of its Urban Hardship Index — officially dubbing it worse off than Miami , Detroit , Cleveland , and Newark , N.J. With 76 percent of its population Hispanic , mostly Mexican immigrants , Santa Ana is the poster child for the troubles of the country 's immigration policies and of Mexican immigrants in particular .
Now , a new study lays bare what sociologists and others have long argued : Mexican immigrants are assimilating to life in the United States less successfully than other immigrants .
Sponsored by the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank , " Measuring Immigrant Assimilation in the United States " by Jacob Vigdor , a professor of public policy studies and economics at Duke University , introduces a novel assimilation index that uses census and other survey data to measure how similar select immigrant groups are to native - born Americans .
Using such factors as intermarriage , English ability , military service , homeownership , citizenship , and earnings , Vigdor assembled a 100 - point assimilation index .
The closer to 100 , the more assimilated an immigrant group .
Overall , the report shows immigrants are weaving into the American fabric at a remarkable clip , despite arriving poorer and knowing less English than immigrants of a century ago .
And they are gaining speed , with new arrivals assimilating faster than those who came more than 20 years ago .
With a score of 53 , Canadians are the most assimilated , followed closely by Filipinos , Cubans , and Vietnamese .
The main outlier : Mexicans , with a score of 13 — followed by Salvadorans .
Why Mexicans are faring so poorly in the United States is complicated , experts say .
But the root of the problem is no surprise : Many Mexicans are here illegally , depriving them of rungs on the economic ladder and the opportunity to gain citizenship .
" There are certain jobs or certain services you just can't get [ as an illegal immigrant ] , " Vigdor says .
" There are plenty of indications here that for those Mexican immigrants who are interested in making a more permanent attachment to the United States , their legal status puts very severe barriers in that path . "
Since the 1990s , Mexicans ' immigrant story has differed from that of their peers .
When comparing Mexicans and Asians , " Asians show up with a lot more money , oftentimes , " notes Dowell Myers , a demographer at the University of Southern California .
" They have a higher education to begin with , and many of them are entrepreneurs . "
Past decades saw influxes of refugees from countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines .
Today 's Asian immigrants are some of the best and brightest , which puts them on a faster track to assimilation via economic success .
The Asian experience recalls a general rule of today 's immigrants .
The farther you have to migrate , the wealthier you probably were in your country of origin .
" Poor people can't afford a plane trip across the ocean , but poor people can walk across the border , " Myers says .
" Poor Africans and poor Chinese can't do it . "
Because of their proximity to the United States , poor Mexicans can make the trip .
Indeed , their poverty impels them to risk the border crossing .
But when they arrive , they arrive significantly disadvantaged , and they often qualify for jobs that offer little opportunity for social advancement .
Other factors may also contribute but are more difficult to quantify :
The leading contender is that the sheer number of Latinos in the United States has created a subculture that slows assimilation .
Indeed , in a unique multigenerational study spanning four decades , Generations of Exclusion , sociologists Edward Telles and Vilma Ortiz found that many immigrants and their children had made slow progress assimilating for cultural and economic reasons .
A large community means a large dating pool : Only 17 percent of third - generation Mexicans studied had married non-Hispanics .
The authors found adult Mexican - Americans in the third and fourth generations lived in more segregated neighborhoods than they did as youths , largely because of the many new immigrant arrivals .
Educational levels , meanwhile , lagged behind the national average .
However , English ability was nearly universal , even among first - generation immigrants , which should ease the concerns of some lawmakers who want to make English the natural language .
Significantly , though , 36 percent of fourth - generation Mexican - Americans studied could still speak Spanish .
Perhaps most telling :
Of the approximately 1,500 surveyed in two distinct immigrant communities — Los Angeles and San Antonio — most identified as " Mexican " or " Mexican - American " even into the fourth generation .
It 's that kind of cultural signifier that has so many white Americans concerned that this is a group not interested in becoming American .
Ortiz says her interviews demonstrated that that was not the case .
She argues that the above factors , especially segregated neighborhoods , " all probably lead to a stronger sense of identification of being Mexican or Mexican - American , " she says .
" The fact that they are maintaining a sense of Mexicanness is to some extent a reaction to how American society does n't fully accept Mexican - origin folks . "
The continued ethnic identification is similar to that of other groups that have felt oppression from the majority , African - Americans and American Indians among them .
Rubén Rumbaut , a professor of sociology at the University of California - Irvine , notes that " the people who have been most ostracized , stigmatized , and racialized ... assert that now with pride , and they dig in their heels , and they become that which they had been labeled pejoratively . "
Rumbaut , a leading researcher in immigrant studies , argues that assimilation is like a tango .
Each party has to avoid stepping on the other 's toes .
" Assimilation , unlike acculturation ... includes how they are welcomed or not by native groups , " he says .
In one study that included members of 77 nationalities , Rumbaut asked participants if they agreed that the United States was the best country in the world .
Those most likely to agree were Vietnamese and Cubans or those who had benefited from refugee assistance .
The least likely were Haitians , Jamaicans , and others with black skin " who bore the brunt of racial discrimination in their adoptive society , " Rumbaut says .
" The moral of the story is you reap what you sow .
I see assimilation as a relationship and not some robotlike process of adaptation to a new environment that takes place only on the part of the assimilated . "
The fact is that despite all this , Mexican immigrants and their children are advancing .
That 's because just about every immigrant , no matter what the country of origin , is here to work .
" Couch potatoes do n't emigrate , " Rumbaut says .
Indeed , Mexican immigrants start with nearly nothing " but actually climb more than Asians do , " Myers points out .
" The Mexican immigrants are the poorest of immigrants , by and large , but the majority become homeowners in the United States . "
That includes the folks here illegally .
Myers calls that a far better measure of assimilation than self - identifiers such as " Mexican " or Mexican - American . "
He likens that to New Yorkers in Los Angeles rooting for the Yankees .
" They wave the Mexican flags ... but these are the same people who will enlist in the U.S. Army and be proud about it .
Their identity is a composite of their heritage and current loyalty . "

The BBC has secured the television rights to show Formula One in the UK from the 2009 season .
The five - year deal for an undisclosed fee marks F1's return to BBC screens 12 years after it switched to ITV .
The contract covers all platforms and will see F1 broadcast on the BBC Sport website , as well as on TV and radio .
F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone said he was " delighted " , adding : " The BBC has some innovative ideas to consolidate and expand our UK fan base . "
Interview : Former F1 driver Damon Hill
The classic BBC Grand Prix theme tune Among the new developments will be live video coverage of F1 on the BBC Sport website .
Asked why he had decided to split with ITV , Ecclestone told BBC Radio 5 Live : " It 's not that we are unhappy with ITV but I think maybe they will have their hands full with other things and maybe the BBC can service us a bit better .
I 'm absolutely flabbergasted - I almost fell out of bed when I heard it
Murray Walker
Former F1 commentator " I think it will be good , a fresh face .
I 'm not complaining about ITV , I 'm not saying they did a bad job or anything like that .
" But with all the other things they are loaded up with - and who knows they will get some more stuff - maybe it will be a bit more difficult to spend as much time on us .
" I think the BBC will do that . "
Dominic Coles , BBC
Sport director of sport rights , said : " The biggest motorsporting event in the world is returning home after 12 years .
" We were delighted when Bernie Ecclestone approached us about the return of F1 to the BBC .
Damon
Hill was the last man to win the title when the BBC had F1 " F1 is a crown jewel of sports broadcasting , so to bring the rights back to their traditional home from 2009 is tremendously exciting .
" Fans will be able to enjoy uninterrupted , state of the art and innovative coverage from BBC Sport , across all of our TV , radio and new media platforms , for the first time since 1996 . "
ITV , which was in the third year of a five - year deal , released a statement saying it had " decided to exit F1 at the end of this season " .
It added that it was a " straightforward commercial decision " .
BBC director of sport Roger Mosey said : " Our understanding is that F1 did have a termination right at the end of the 2008 season , and that appears to be what has happened , and we 're absolutely delighted F1 will be back on the BBC this time next year . "
606 : DEBATE
I hope the BBC go back to providing the excellent F1 coverage we used to have
WW Murray Walker , former F1 commentator for both the BBC and ITV , said : " I 'm absolutely flabbergasted - I was lying in bed listening to the news this morning and I almost fell out of bed when I heard it .
" It 's an amazing development because I think ITV did and do a superb job , and I think there is more to this than meets the eye . "
BBC sports news correspondent Adam Parsons said : " ITV are saying it was a straightforward commercial decision .
A lot of people I have spoken to have queried that .
" Within ITV , what they are saying is that even though Lewis Hamilton is great , even though the Brazilian Grand Prix [ at the end of last year ] got huge viewing figures , that actually over the course of a year viewing figures are not that impressive , they 're not that great .
" A lot of races are happening at night , they 're not happening at peak time .
That it is not particularly good value for money .
" The other side of that is the BBC is saying , Lewis Hamilton and the ripple effect of that is wonderful , millions of people tune in and the Brazilian GP was the most - watched sports event of last year .
" You might say ITV would rather bad - mouth it because they 've just lost the rights but on the one hand they 're saying it 's a straightforward commercial decision .
" But on the other plenty of people are saying that having spent a decade broadcasting when a German , a Finn and a Spaniard were winning world titles , it seems a bit curious [ for ITV ] to pull out when a Brit is on the verge of winning it . "

By all rights , “ Let Me Stand Alone ” should not be an easy book to read .
Doom hangs over this collection of the journal writings of Rachel Corrie , who was a 23 - year - old American peace activist when she was crushed to death by an Israel Defense Forces bulldozer in Gaza five years ago .
And yet most of this book whizzes by in a series of delights : in descriptions of autumn football games in Washington state , and ice in the winter mornings , of war seen on television , of the wind , of Corrie ’s grandparents ’ house in Des Moines , the used - book store in Aitkin , Minn. , her mother tending to her dying grandmother , her own face .
And this is all before the age of 14 .
When she was 2 years old , she looked at Capitol Lake in Olympia , Wash . , her hometown , and said ( famously , in her family ) : “ This is the wide world , and I ’m coming to it . ”

It turns out that Rachel Corrie was first of all a miraculous child ; then , an amazing changeling of a girl ; later , a difficult , challenging , brilliant teenager , and finally a demanding , charismatic young adult .
Most important , she was a very able writer from a remarkably early age — about 10 years old , or 11 — an immediate , sensory observer , a good thinker , a rebel eventually .
Above all , she was always human , never caustic ( though she could be casually cruel to her parents , like all adolescents ) , and almost painfully alive to the give and take within families , among friends , between lovers , between siblings .
She would go on to carry this feeling of connectedness to its logical extreme , because among the many things she was , Rachel Corrie was above all a natural extremist .
She felt other people ’s pain really and truly .
As a grown - up , she feels connected not only to her parents , her sister , her unpredictable boyfriend and to others around her , but also to the mentally ill people with whom she worked in Olympia ( “ Do n’t we all hear voices ? ” she asks her journal ) , and to the world .
She also felt responsible for mankind ’s lapses in humanity .
That natural extremism and dedication to goodness took her into activism , and that ’s how she ended up in Gaza — her shoulder blades , face , six ribs and spinal cord broken under the blade of that bulldozer .
But this book is not all about Rachel Corrie ’s progression toward this terrible fate .
It ’s really three books in one .
It ’s a coming - of - age book about a certain kind of American girl , an upstanding , stalwart child of the Pacific Northwest , who loves freedom the way a pioneer child would , as part of the normal course of things .
As a child , Corrie is like a Mark Twain character :
You would not be surprised to see her in a thin dimity dress or in smocked gingham , with her blond hair in a braid , playing barefoot in the reeds near Huck ’s river .
As she gets older , she flirts with all the syndromes American girls now flirt with : drinking , smoking , anorexia .
“ Then she cursed herself for spending so much time thinking about herself , ” she writes .
But she survives ; she ’s an American survivor — and if you did n’t know beforehand the wrenching end of her story you would assume she could survive anything .
The first half of the book reads like a best - selling Oprah - endorsed literary tell - all memoir ( or anyway , almost all … there is an editorial hand involved in culling the journals , and that hand belongs to the Corrie family ) , written by an exceptionally creative and gifted girl .
“ Let Me Stand Alone ” is also a writer ’s notebook .
One can easily imagine it being read in a workshop .
It includes poetry , and a long ( some might say too long ) half - fiction , half - confessional love story ; rapturous descriptions of nature , and loving details about Olympia ( having read “ Let Me Stand Alone , ” I now vote Olympia , Wash . , the No. 1 city to visit in the United States , although I have n’t been there ) .
A love poem about driving on the highway with her mother and seeing a flock of herons is particularly accomplished ; here ’s a bit of it :
anonymous gray herons
their forms slip into your dream vocabulary
your eyes save them deep in linty pockets and amber jars
but their beaks are needles and they do n’t notice you pass
eyes with no pupils in constant dialogue , heron with itself
they send messages with their outlines
they glide into the horizon while you ’re forming your reply
Here ’s another section , from the middle of the book , where Corrie imagines the salmon of Olympia : “ There have been so many times over the last several years when I ’ve wanted to be anywhere except Olympia .
I think I ’ll be gone within the next year .
It ’s hard to explain it . …
The salmon talked me into a lifestyle change .
The salmon beneath downtown Olympia are church .
Years ago a group of us doing salmon restoration work rode a bus down to the East Bay Marina and observed the hole in the bulkhead .
Salmon swim into that hole .
Salmon have to make it all the way up Plum Street in that hole . ….
Once you know there are salmon down there it ’s hard to forget .
You imagine their moony eyes while you walk home from the bar in your slutty boots .
You ’re aware of them down there when you ride around in somebody ’s car — fanning their gills .
It ’s hard to be extraordinarily vacuous when you always have the salmon in the back of your mind : in that pipe down there . … ”
In this case , it ’s only the pitiable situation of fish that provokes Rachel Corrie ’s empathy and political action .
For “ Let Me Stand Alone ” is , as well as a coming - of - age book and a writer ’s notebook , also the autobiography of an activist .
We watch as Rachel emerges from her lovely , hypersensitive , receptive and involved girlhood , and we ’re cheering her : because she is really so good , so kind , so open and sensitive to suffering and injustice — like an old - fashioned saint , a Great Person in the making .
I could n’t help thinking of Joan of Arc as I read along ( partly , no doubt , because of the seeming physical resemblance to La Pucelle , a light - haired wisp of furious girlhood ) .
Belief , Christian virtues of selflessness and self - denial , charisma , fervor , a thirst for a cause — Rachel Corrie always had the makings of a martyr .
When she gets to Gaza — a section that represents about a fifth of the book , and , of course , its finale — Corrie ’s writing changes radically , with all that the word implies .
At first , the change is subtle .
Everything is reduced .
Her range of emotion contracts , and instead of pure love , angry love , needy love and furious love , Rachel , in the face of the plight of the Gazans , feels only angry love .
Instead of frustration with herself , her parents , Olympia , the Bush administration , school , siblings , friends , boyfriend , she feels frustration only at the Israeli government ( a nice , broad target for this and other negative emotions , when you ’re living in Gaza ) .
She sinks into the reduced and shrunken emotional , intellectual and even physical space of the refugee ; Corrie becomes a Gazan .
In this sad final section , there were bits I had to skip , because the writing becomes so rote , so predictable , so propagandistic , so meaningless — and it was hard to see such a brave talent , such a wonderful person , become so flat and dull , so prescriptive and hortatory .
And yet I recognize Rachel Corrie in this section .
I was young , too , when I had my first tête - à - tête with evil — for me , it was Haiti under Jean - Claude Duvalier and the various generals and civilian juntas that followed .
Like me , Corrie was privileged , liberal , educated , literate , American : Naturally the hunger , deprivation and imprisonment of the Gazans among whom she decided to live is — and should be — too dreadful a thing for her to witness without responding in anger toward their oppressors , as the plight of the Haitian people was and remains for me .
Rachel was even younger than I was at the moment of her first encounter , however , and she was a member of an organization in Gaza , the International Solidarity Movement .
The ISM ’s goal was — in part — to stop Israeli bulldozing of Gazan houses by presenting its people as human shields , facing down the scoops of the dozers .
In Haiti , I was not part of any missionary group , and had the luxury of forming my own opinions in solitude .
I was n’t organizing a movement , as Corrie was .
I did not want my entire social group back in the United States to come to Haiti to help me stop the mechanisms of oppression there , the way Rachel does in Rafah .
Rachel took the humanitarian ’s way , the activist ’s way , the militant ’s way .
She begins doing press for the ISM , and her journal - writing and e-mail composition evaporate into a kind of boosterish stew of stereotypical ( though not untrue ) observations about Palestinian suffering and Israeli oppression .
“ Time to go , ” she writes in an e-mail .
“ Meeting with the Youth Parliament . ”
It ’s like watching a lesson taught by George Orwell , with Corrie as the example .
There in the border town of Rafah , facing the Israeli army , a gifted writer — still able to witness honestly and well , as we see in small glimpses — begins to remove from her work much of what is human , closely observed , specific and concrete , and substitute instead propaganda clichés that , even when true , feel meaningless and shopworn , and finally , tragically empty , especially in light of Rachel Corrie ’s fate .
Still , I ca n’t help admiring her committed work and her youthful engagement ; the world might just possibly be a better place if more of us believed in humanity ’s essential goodness , as Corrie did , and if more of us were willing to leave our gardens , BlackBerrys , malls and coffee shops behind and work for peace and justice .
Her innocence is disarming : “ The surreal thing , ” she writes , a month and a half before her death , “ is that we are safe .
White - skinned people stand up in front of the tanks and they open their weird tank lids and wave at us . ”
There is a sense of Auden ’s “ while someone else is eating , ” in these final pages , of the evils that go on while we continue on with our doggy lives .
“ I have been in Palestine for two weeks and one hour now , ” Corrie writes in an e-mail just a month before she was killed , “ and I still have very few words to describe what I see .
It is most difficult for me to think about what ’s going on here when I sit down to write back to the United States .
Something about the virtual portal into luxury . … ”
Her talk of “ internationals ” and “ sister communities ” may put you off , but the fact of her sympathy and dedication is inspiring .
And , as Graham Greene wrote in “ The Comedians , ” his novel about Haiti under Duvalier , “ Death is a proof of sincerity . ”
Because the saddest thing of all about the decline in Rachel Corrie ’s eloquence and description , and the simultaneous growth in her activism , is how very short the period of her involvement was .
And how much truth , honor and respect was — deservingly — heaped upon her every political pronouncement by the brutality and vicious stupidity of her murderer ’s crushing rubber tracks and slicing steel .
When it mattered , no one lifted a lid and waved .
“ My back is broken , my back is broken ” — those were Rachel Corrie ’s last words .
That ’s concrete and specific enough .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc on Monday defended a policy of retaining data on Web users for up to 18 months as necessary to improve search results , responding to an EU report that saw no need for search services to keep personal data beyond six months .

A group of data protection commissioners from across the European Union found that computer Web addresses and cookie monitoring are personal information that search services should do more to protect .
The long - anticipated set of recommendations for how European data protection laws should be applied to Web search services was published on Friday and can be found at tinyurl.com / 5yukzm .
The report by the so - called Article 29 Working Party calls for increased user notification and warns Web search services that fail to do so may be unlawful .
Cookies are small bits of text that mark the comings and goings of computer users to Web sites .
They are widely used by commercial sites to make Web surfing more convenient and by advertisers to measure audiences .
But they also raise privacy concerns due to their potential to track user behavior .
“ It is the opinion of the Working Party that search engines in their role as collectors of user data have so far insufficiently explained the nature and purpose of their operations to the users of their services , ” the report states .
“ The Working Party does not see a basis for a retention period beyond 6 months , ” the study concludes .
In a statement issued on Monday , Peter Fleischer , Google ’s global privacy counsel , said his company disagreed with key findings in the report and argued that privacy policies must be balanced against efforts to make Web services easier to use .
“ We believe that data retention requirements have to take into account the need to provide quality products and services for users , like accurate search results , as well as system security and integrity concerns , ” Fleischer wrote .
IMPROVING SERVICES ?
The EU report specifically challenges the defense by saying arguments about improving services may conceal other uses that go beyond the original reasons the data was collected .
The Google official also took issue with the Article 29 Working Party ’s finding that Internet Protocol addresses -- the unique addressees that identify a specific computer or device connected to the Internet -- should be treated as personal information , with the full weight of data protection laws .
His blog post can be read at tinyurl.com /3jkdy8 /.
“ Based on our own analysis , we believe that whether or not an IP address is personal data depends on how the data is being used , ” Fleischer said .
Google has previously argued the issue is not black and white , in part because Internet Service Providers often allot the same IP address to many users .
Google Web services generate mountains of more or less anonymous user data that it stores securely in massive computer data centers it operates .
The company ’s engineers regularly study this data to figure out how to improve its services .
While traditionally Internet companies have stored data on Web surfers for years , Google took the initiative a year ago to limit how long it stored such data to 18 months .
Rival search services followed suit to set their own limits , with Ask.com going a step further by offering a set of tools for users to scrub their data stored from Ask computers .
Dr. Rothschild backed up his point by telling us the story of the discovery of the Bacillus subtilis , a bacterial microorganism that is commonly found in the environment rather than in humans , yet is well known by modern science to be very friendly to the human system .
It can promote dramatic healing benefits in humans , even though it is n't one of the native microbes that normally inhabit the human body .
According to Dr. Rothschild , the story of Bacillus subtilis goes like this :
The bacillus subtilis was discovered by the Nazi German medical corps in 1941 , toward the end of their African campaign .
At the time , the German military victory was at its height .
But the German high command became genuinely alarmed when hundreds upon hundreds of soldiers in North Africa suddenly began dying every week .
Oddly , the Nazi soldiers were n't dying because of British General Montgomery 's retaliatory bombs and shrapnel , but instead , they were dying of uncontrollable dysentery .
Of course , the Germans were aware that dysentery was caused by pathogenic ( i.e. disease - causing ) bacteria from local food and water sources .
But in those days , there were no antibiotics .
Sulfur was already on the market , but only in a topical non-ingestible form .
So with no medication available with which to stop the plague of dysentery , the Nazis quickly began looking for other means to help their dying soldiers .
The German high command immediately sent out a contingent of scientists , physicians , chemists , biochemists , bacteriologists and other experts to help solve the problem .
With typical German circumspection , these top experts reasoned that there must be a natural way to counteract the deadly bacteria causing the dysentery because , if there was n't , the millions of Arabs living in the region would have been dead long ago .
Therefore , the Germans ' first step was to closely scrutinize the native Arabs , and see whether or not they were affected by dysentery .
What they discovered was that the Arabs also caught dysentery , but at the first sign of diarrhea [ the # 1 symptom of dysentery --- Ed. ] the Arabs would do something quite incredible :
They would immediately begin following around a horse or camel until it would drop its dung .
Then , the affected Arab would pick up the warm dung droppings , and quickly gulp them down !
This strange procedure effectively eliminated the dysentery almost overnight .
Once the good hygienic Germans finally recovered from the shock of seeing the Arab natives gulping down warm camel dung , they quickly realized that there must be something in the dung that somehow counteracted the harmful bacteria that caused the dysentery .
They questioned the Arabs , who told them that they had no idea why it worked , but that their fathers had always done so , as had their forefathers , and it had always worked .
The only caveat was that the camel or horse dung had to be ingested while still warm and fresh , because it had no effect on the dysentery if ingested cold .
So the Nazis began carefully examining fresh camel and horse dung .
What they discovered was that it was teeming with a powerful bacterial microorganism which later came to be called Bacillus subtilis .
This bacteria , it turned out , is so strong that it practically cannibalizes all harmful microorganisms in the human body --- particularly pathogenic bacteria like the virulent strain which was causing dysentery in the German troops .
Within a very short time , the Nazis began producing hundreds and thousands of gallons of active Bacillus subtilis cultures for their troops to ingest .
And bingo , no more dysentery !
Soon afterwards , the Germans even discovered the process by which the Bacillus subtilis cultures could be dried and placed into easily ingestible capsules .
From that time forward , the resourceful Germans had no more problems with losing troops from dysentery .
Still Benefiting Health - Savvy Individuals
For many years afterwards , cultures of Bacillus subtilis were sold worldwide as a medicinal product ( sold in the U.S. and Mexico , for example , under the brand name Bacti- Subtil ) rapidly becoming the world 's leading treatment for dysentery and other intestinal problems .
Unfortunately for Americans , this popular bacterial supplement that cures intestinal infections began losing favor in the late 1950's and 1960's , upon the advent of synthetic antibiotics which were heavily touted by the giant pharmaceutical companies as " wonder drugs , " even though they cost five times as much as Bacti-Subtil , and took three times longer to accomplish the same results .
Nonetheless , Bacillus subtilis remains one of the most potent and beneficial of all health - promoting and immune - stimulating bacteria .
According to clinical studies documented in the medical research report , IMMUNOSTIMULATION BY BACILLUS SUBTILIS PREPARATIONS , by micro-biologist J. Harmann , the cell wall components of ingested Bacillus Subtilis are able to activate nearly all systems of the human immune defense ,

Monopolies came to the United States with the colonial administration .
The large - scale public works needed to make the New World hospitable to Old World immigrants required large companies to carry them out .
These companies were granted exclusive contracts for these works by the colonial administrators .
Even after the American Revolution , many of these colonial holdovers still functioned due to the contracts and land they held .
Key Takeaways
The last great American monopolies were created a century apart , and one lasted over a century .
Globalization and the maturity of the world economy have prompted calls for the retirement of antitrust laws .
The Sherman Antitrust Act banned trusts and monopolistic combinations that lessened or otherwise hampered interstate and international trade .
A monopoly is characterized by a lack of competition , which can mean higher prices and inferior products .
However , the great economic power that monopolies hold has also had positive consequences for the U.S. Read on to take a look at some of the most notorious monopolies , their effects on the economy , and the government 's response to their rise to power .
1:55 A History Of U.S. Monopolies
Sherman's Hammer
In response to a large public outcry to check the price - fixing abuses of these monopolies , the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 .
This act banned trusts and monopolistic combinations that lessened or otherwise hampered interstate and international trade .﻿﻿
The act acted like a hammer for the government , giving it the power to shatter big companies into smaller pieces to suit their own needs .
Despite this act's passage in 1890 , the next 50 years saw the formation of many domestic monopolies .
However , during this same period , the antitrust legislation was used to attack several monopolies with varying levels of success .
The general trend with the use of the act seemed to have been to make a distinction between good monopolies and bad monopolies , as seen by the government .
One example is International Harvester , which produced cheap agricultural equipment for a largely agrarian nation and was thus considered untouchable , lest the voters ' rebel .
American Tobacco , on the other hand , was suspected of charging more than a fair price for cigarettes — then touted as the cure for everything from asthma to menstrual cramps — and consequently became a victim of the legislator 's wrath in 1907 and was broken up in 1911 .﻿﻿
The Benefits of a Monopoly
The oil industry was prone to what is called a natural monopoly because of the rarity of the products it produced .
John D. Rockefeller , the founder and chairman of Standard Oil , and his partners took advantage of both the rarity of oil and the revenue produced from it to set up a monopoly without the help of the banks .
The business practices and questionable tactics that Rockefeller used to create Standard Oil would make the Enron crowd blush , but the finished product was not near as damaging to the economy or the environment as the industry was before Rockefeller monopolized it .
Back when there were a lot of oil companies competing to make the most of their find , companies would often pump waste products into rivers or straight out on the ground rather than going to the cost of researching proper disposal .
They also cut costs by using shoddy pipelines that were prone to leakage .
By the time Standard Oil had cornered 90 % of oil production and distribution in the United States , it had learned how to make money off of even its industrial waste — Vaseline being but one of the new products it launched .﻿﻿
The benefits of having a monopoly - like Standard Oil in the country was only realized after it had built a nationwide infrastructure that no longer depended on trains and their notoriously fluctuating costs , a leap that would help reduce costs and the overall price of petroleum products after the company was dismantled .
The size of Standard Oil allowed it to undertake projects that disparate companies could never agree on and , in that sense , it was as beneficial as state - regulated utilities for developing the U.S. into an industrial nation .
Despite the eventual break up of Standard Oil in 1911 , the government realized that a monopoly could build up a reliable infrastructure and deliver low - cost service to a broader base of consumers than competing firms , a lesson that influenced its decision to allow the AT&T monopoly to continue until 1982 .
The profits of Standard Oil and the generous dividends also encouraged investors , and thereby the market , to invest in monopolistic firms , providing them with the funds to grow larger .
The Limitations of a Monopoly
Andrew Carnegie went a long way in creating a monopoly in the steel industry when J.P. Morgan bought his steel company and melded it into U.S. Steel .
A monstrous corporation approaching the size of Standard Oil , U.S. Steel actually did very little with the resources in its grasp , which can point to the limitations of having only one owner with a single vision .
The corporation survived its court battle with the Sherman Act and went on to lobby the government for protective tariffs to help it compete internationally , but it grew very little .
U.S. Steel controlled about 60 % of steel production at the time , but competing firms were hungrier , more innovative , and more efficient with their 40 % of the market .﻿﻿
Eventually , U.S. Steel stagnated in innovation as smaller companies ate more and more of its market share .
Clayton Improves Sherman's Aim
Following the break up of sugar , tobacco , oil , and meat - packing monopolies , big business did n't know where to turn because there were no clear guidelines about what constituted monopolistic business practices .
The founders and management of so - called " bad monopolies " were also enraged by the hands - off approach taken with International Harvester .
They justly argued that the Sherman
Act did n't make any allowance for a specific business or product and that its execution should be universal rather than operate like a lightning bolt attacking select businesses at the government 's behest .
In response , the Clayton Act was introduced in 1914 .
It set some specific examples of practices that would attract Sherman 's hammer .
Among these were interlocking directorships , tie - in sales , and certain mergers and acquisitions if they substantially lessened the competition in a market .﻿﻿
This was followed by a succession of other acts demanding that businesses consult the government before any large mergers or acquisitions took place .
Although these innovations did give the business a slightly clearer picture of what not to do , it did little to curb the randomness of antitrust action .
Major League Baseball even found itself under investigation in the 1920s but escaped by claiming to be a sport rather than a business and thus not classified as interstate commerce .
Over the years , the Sherman Antitrust Act has been used to break up large companies .
End of a Monopoly Era ?
The last great American monopolies were created a century apart , and one lasted over a century .
Others were very short - lived or still continue operating today .
AT&T Inc. ( T ) , a government - supported monopoly was a public utility — that would have to be considered a coercive monopoly .
Like Standard
Oil , the AT&T monopoly made the industry more efficient and was n't guilty of fixing prices , but rather the potential to fix prices .﻿﻿
The break up of AT&T by President Reagan in the 1980s gave birth to the " baby bells . "
Since that time , many of the baby bells have begun to merge and increase in size to provide better service to a wider area .
Very likely , the break up of AT&T caused a sharp reduction in service quality for many customers and , in some cases , higher prices , but the settling period has elapsed , and the baby bells are growing to find a natural balance in the market without calling down Sherman 's hammer again .
Microsoft , Corp. ( MSFT ) , on the other hand , was never actually broken up even though it lost its case .
The case against it was centered on whether Microsoft was abusing its position as essentially a non-coercive monopoly .
Microsoft has been challenged by many companies over time , including by Google , over its operating systems ' continuing hostility to competitors ' software .
Just as U.S. Steel could n't dominate the market indefinitely because of innovative domestic and international competition , the same is true for Microsoft .
A non-coercive monopoly only exists as long as brand loyalty and consumer apathy keep people from searching for a better alternative .
Even now , the Microsoft monopoly is looking chipped at the edges as rival operating systems are gaining ground and rival software , particularly open - source software , is threatening the bundle business model upon which Microsoft was built .
Because of this , the antitrust case seems premature and / or redundant .
The Bottom Line
Globalization and the maturity of the world economy have prompted calls for the retirement of antitrust laws .
In the early 1900s , anyone suggesting that the government did n't need to have a hammer to smash big business would 've been eyed suspiciously , like a member of a lunatic fringe or one of Wall Street 's big money cartel members .
Over the years , these calls have been coming from people like economist Milton Friedman , former Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan , and everyday consumers .
If the history of government and business is any indication , the government is more likely to increase the range and power of antitrust laws rather than relinquish such a useful weapon .

Police digging up the " Colditz " care home discovered more bones yesterday as the inquiry into sickening child abuse allegations escalated .
The remains were found close to where forensic officers found a skull beneath several inches of concrete on the ground floor of Haut de la Garenne in Jersey .
A sniffer dog went " berserk " when he was led close to the bones , sparking police fears that they could be the remains of another body .

The discovery came after the first picture of a " punishment room " at the home was released , revealing a haunting message written on the wall .
A giant stone bath tub stood in the centre of the room and up to 25 children at a time would be forced to sit in freezing water as the abusers watched .
On a nearby wooden post is the message scrawled by an inmate : " Iv been bad 4 years & years . "

Deputy chief officer Lenny Harper replies to questions today at the Jersey children 's home
The bones have been sent to a laboratory to ascertain if they are human and if they date back to the period when the abuse took place at the children 's home in St Martin , Jersey .
In a day of dramatic developments , police revealed they have been overwhelmed by hundreds of phone calls from victims and witnesses reporting allegations of abuse over the last few days .
They may have to set up a dedicated call centre to deal with the volume of calls more effectively .
The number of full - time officers investigating the child abuse case has almost doubled in this week as officers continue to work long hours in the hope of achieving a significant breakthrough .
Deputy police chief Lenny Harper revealed that the number of suspects had risen to 40 , which includes many now living on the British mainland .
It was reported today that one suspect is Wilfred Krichekfski , a leading member of Jersey 's political establishment , who died in 1974 .
Former senator
Mr Krichekfski allegedly visited the home regularly to abuse boys up to his death , the Times claimed .
A former resident says he was raped in the early Sixties by the senator after being woken up by a care worker with the words : " There is someone here to see you . "
The only person he told about the abuse was a psychiatrist who reportedly told him he would be placed in a mental hospital if he repeated the allegations .
A police spokesman said today : " We do have a list of suspects but we will not reveal any of the names on that list . "
Asked if the team was any closer to making an arrest , Mr Harper said : " Suspects are one thing , we need evidence to convict people .
If we get any evidence that they are trying to leave the island we have got a team at the ports and we will take the necessary action . "
Detectives have questioned victims and witnesses in Australia , Thailand , the UK and several countries within Europe , including Germany .
Mr Harper , who is leading the inquiry , said there was a " culture " of abuse at the home during certain periods .
" I think we are looking at a culture of abuse rather than a paedophile ring , " he said .
" There is an excavation of a second site within the house .
" Archaeologists have taken out a few items .
But it is too early to say whether they are significant .
They 're possibly pieces of bone . "
Police are also trying to establish how many children killed themselves at the home .
This line of inquiry emerged after relatives of a child who committed suicide contacted police to ask for an investigation into the death .
Mr Harper said he felt there were issues surrounding the suicide claims which need " to be looked at " but he dismissed the suggestion that the victim was murdered .
The number of alleged victims who suffered physical or sexual abuse at Haut de la Garenne is now more than 160 .
Many claim they were repeatedly raped , tortured and beaten in tiny , airless " punishment cells " below the ground floor by staff and visitors at the home from the early Fifties to 1986 , the year it closed .
The horror unfolding at Haut de la Garenne - known locally as Colditz - threatens to become the worst childcare scandal on British soil .
Police are currently examining seven separate " hot - spots " inside and outside the building where the bodies of boys and girls could be buried .
In other developments , police are attempting to compile a list of those who went missing from the home .
But detectives are being hampered because the evidence they have is anecdotal and often only includes a child 's first name or nickname .

Patricia Thornton : ' It 's awful if it 's true but I saw no evidence of it when I was there '
Police also revealed that former children 's television host Jimmy Saville had visited the home on several occasions during the Seventies but is not part of their inquiry .
A former volunteer , Christine Bowker , also revealed today that she had she encountered children " frozen with fear " while working at the home in the early Seventies .
She claimed that she was met with a " wall of silence " when she tried to raise concerns and eventually left because she was worried about the conduct of some staff .
Ms Bowker said : " [ The staff ] watched me very carefully with the children and if the children relaxed at all or responded to my affection , they glared at the children then the children just went back into their shells .
" When I left ... and I left in distress and abuse I received from some of the staff ...
I could n't get anybody to listen to the problem , " she said .
However , Patricia Thornton , who was responsible for the wellbeing of youngsters in the home from the early Fifties to 1973 , insists she took no part in any abuse or cover-up .
The 85 - year - old , who lives in the village of Cheriton , Hampshire , said : " It 's awful if it 's true but I saw no evidence of it when I was there .
" I just find it difficult to believe that all these horrible things were going on and I knew nothing about it . "
Miss Thornton , who received an MBE in 1996 for her services to the community , said she was proud of her work at the home .
She added : " When I first arrived in Jersey , there was a home for boys at Haut de la Garenne and a separate home for girls which was not being run very well .
" I was very concerned about the welfare of the girls so I closed it down , pensioned off the lady who had been running it and moved the girls into the boys ' home .
I was very surprised when I read about the scandal .
I feel quite shattered . "
But police are continuing to treat Morag Jordan , a former matron at the home , as a suspect .
Angus Council in Scotland confirmed on Monday that Mrs Jordan had been suspended from her post delivering meals on wheels to the elderly .
A spokesman said : " Given the attention currently focused on Mrs Jordan , she has been reassigned to other duties . "
Mrs Jordan , who lives in Kirriemuir with her husband Tony , claims she had no involvement with the abuse of children at the home .
And in a clear sign that politicians in Whitehall are taking the scandal seriously , senior justice officials from Jersey States have held talks in London with officials at the Ministry of Justice .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : " Clearly , Jersey officials , who requested the meeting , will update their ministry of justice counterparts on the continuing police investigations which are clearly potentially very serious .
" It would not be appropriate to speculate about the outcome of those investigations . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. regulatory probe into potential oil - market trading abuses is focusing on possible short - term manipulation of benchmark crude prices and the use of information related to important oil storage tanks to influence prices , the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday .

The newspaper , citing people familiar with enforcement priorities of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , said the CFTC is pursuing several oil investigations , and that many of them relate to one another .
On Thursday the U.S. futures market regulator had said it would step up surveillance of energy trading by tracking index funds , and had reached an agreement with the U.K. ’s Financial Services Authority and ICE Futures Europe to share information on energy contracts .
The CFTC has been under pressure from U.S. lawmakers to crack down on speculators they blame for pushing energy prices to record levels .
U.S. crude oil CLc1 hit a record high of $ 135.09 a barrel last week , and is up by more than 40 percent this year .
The Journal quoted CFTC enforcement chief Gregory Mocek as saying the agency has about 60 manipulation investigations open in various commodity markets .
The CFTC has expanded an investigation , disclosed previously by the newspaper , into alleged short - term manipulation of crude - oil prices via a widely used price - reporting system run by Platts , a unit of McGraw - Hill Cos MHP.N .
One suspicion , the newspaper said , is that energy companies and traders have at times issued a flood of orders during a time window used by Platts to determine its reported prices for physical oil transactions , then used the potentially distorted prices to make profits in other markets .
According to the Journal , Platts has said its system has safeguards to protect against manipulation .
Subpoenas on the matter have gone out in several stages , the report cited people familiar with the cases as saying .
The Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying the agency has also been questioning traders about similar activity in the jet - fuel market .
Another area of concern for CFTC regulators is whether the owners of crude - oil storage tanks use their knowledge to make bets on oil - futures markets .
In theory , the owner of a tank could issue misleading information about the tanks being full or empty , leaving the wrong impression about whether oil is in plentiful supply .
Then they could make trades to profit on the misunderstanding .
If you build websites , you have no doubt heard about Ruby on Rails ( RoR ) .
But if you ’re a designer or front - end developer or you ’re using PHP without any application framework , it may seem like a big leap to adopt the Ruby on Rails approach .
In this article , I hope to demystify Ruby on Rails and convince you that you can make the leap — and that it is a leap worth making if your needs fit within the Ruby on Rails “ sweet spot ” detailed below .
Article Continues Below
It does take time to learn new ways to do all the things you already know how to do , and to learn some new concepts and techniques at the same time .
In the short term , switching technologies , even to Ruby on Rails , will destroy your productivity .
Nevertheless , I ’m convinced that many web developers would be more productive , produce better sites , and even have more fun if they took the leap and began using Ruby on Rails .
Fun for the whole family # section2
Ruby on Rails ( Rails for short ) is a “ full - stack ” framework , which means that it covers both front - end and back - end design .
This makes it an exceptionally potent tool in the hands of a “ jack - of - all - trades ” developer .
Even if you ’re primarily a front - end or a back - end developer , though , you can still use Ruby on Rails effectively .
The interfaces between the front end ( the browser ’s HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ) and the back end ( Ruby , and the Rails framework ) are well defined , so you do n’t need to understand both sides if you want to focus on one or the other .
If you ’re a web designer or front - end developer , you can learn how to use the Ruby on Rails template system , and how to write little bits of embedded Ruby code in your view files .
This will make you a much better partner for a back - end developer , since you can work directly on the Rails application files instead of delivering HTML and CSS that someone else has to integrate .
So whether you ’re approaching Ruby on Rails as a front - end or back - end developer , on which projects should you consider using it ?
Ruby on Rails is at the heart of diverse web applications and sites such as Basecamp , Blinksale , 43 Things , Odeo , Revolution Health , Twitter , YellowPages.com , and A List Apart .
The enthusiasm for Rails extends to many of the largest web companies .
Yahoo , eBay , Amazon , and AOL all have Ruby on Rails projects , and ThoughtWorks is creating enterprise applications in Rails .
But for all the diversity of Ruby on Rails applications , the ones that are best - suited to the framework have a few key things in common .
A website or web service is most appropriately implemented with Ruby on Rails when it has the following three characteristics :
It is a database - backed website or web service large enough to justify the overhead of a powerful framework .
It has unique needs that are n’t well met by a typical CMS .
( If Joomla or Drupal does everything you need , such systems may be a better choice . )
It is a new application , allowing developers to start fresh with the database and software architecture .
This is the “ sweet spot ” for Ruby on Rails applications .
Applications that share these characteristics can probably be built much more quickly with RoR than with PHP , .NET , or Java , once the investment required to learn Rails has been made .
Productivity boosts #section4
One of the main reasons Ruby on Rails increases productivity is that it makes building new applications , adding features , and making tweaks much easier .
The combination of the language ( Ruby ) and the framework ( Rails ) means you can do more with less code .
Less code — and better - structured code — means changes are relatively painless , so you can iterate and experiment more readily .
This leads to better sites , and , hopefully , more fun building them .
Of course , adopting a major new tool requires an investment of time that ca n’t be taken lightly .
If you ’re focused on a single project , it often is n’t justifiable .
But if you expect to keep building websites for some time , and you ’re building sites of significant complexity , a short - term investment in learning Ruby on Rails will pay off in the long term .
To understand why I believe you can do more with less effort using Ruby on Rails , let ’s start with a quick look at Ruby .
Meet Ruby#section5
Ruby is a modern , object - oriented language .
In any Ruby program , everything is an object .
Ruby is also a dynamic language , which means a variety of things :
Ruby is interpreted dynamically ( like PHP ) , so there is no compilation ( as there is with C or Java . )
This speeds up iterative development .
In Ruby , variables are dynamically assigned a type when they are used , eliminating all the code you must write in most other languages to define and set up variables .
A Ruby program can generate code dynamically , modifying itself as it executes .
Rails uses this capability internally to deliver its “ magic , ” which you can simply enjoy .
( You do n’t need to understand how these techniques work . )
Ruby is a wonderfully clean language to read and write , but its benefits go beyond that .
Because Ruby can be powerfully extended , the Rails framework is able to turn it into a sort of special - purpose language for building web applications .
While Ruby ( a language ) and Rails ( a framework ) are separate things , they complement and depend on each other in many ways .
All Ruby on Rails applications are written in Ruby , and the character of Ruby has a big influence on Ruby on Rails applications .
There are frameworks , such as CakePHP , that bring many of Rails ’ ideas to other languages .
But the power and flexibility of Ruby makes Rails cleaner and more flexible than many other frameworks .
If you ’re going to make the investment in learning a framework , learning Ruby while you ’re at it is n’t that big a hurdle , and the payoff is considerable .
The Rails approach #section6
Many websites are built without any application framework at all : you just write the code you need and borrow bits from various places when you can .
That ’s fine for small sites , but it can quickly get out of control , resulting in reams of messy code that is hard to understand and to maintain .
With a framework such as Ruby on Rails , a lot of decisions about how to structure your code are already made for you and you also have a powerful set of libraries at your disposal .
Another important characteristic of Rails is that it organizes each application around a model - view - controller ( MVC ) structure .
MVC , a well - established pattern for organizing software projects , gives all your code a consistent structure , which helps a lot when you ’re working on multiple sites , or bringing in someone new to work on a site .
It also provides separate files , with clean interfaces , that can be split between front - end and back - end developers .
Databases and objects #section7
Ruby on Rails is designed to be used to build database - backed applications , and many of its core components focus on interacting with databases .
The heart of Rails is a library called Active Record , which implements something called object - relational mapping ( ORM ) .
With ORM , you can work with software objects that represent your data and let the Active Record library take care of communicating with the database .
This may sound mysterious in the abstract , so let ’s make it concrete .
Even without knowing any Ruby — or anything about object - oriented programming — I bet you can make sense out of the following code examples , which are pieces of actual Ruby on Rails code .
Suppose you have a bookstore site and you want to add a new book .
You could write :
newbook = Book.new
You ’re telling the “ Book ” class that you want an empty book object , named “ newbook . ”
You can set the title , or any of its other attributes , in an intuitive way :
newbook .
title = “ Angle of Repose ”
newbook.author = “ Wallace Stegner ”
At this point , you have an object in memory .
All it takes is :
newbook.save
… and your new book has been written to the database .
Active Record generates the SQL to tell the database to insert the record .
You can add validations on all the fields and generate descriptive error messages with just a few more lines of code .
Now you want to find that book out of the millions in your database .
Just write :
angle_of_repose = Book.find_by_title “ Angle of Repose ”
… and you have an object , which you ’ve named “ angle_of_repose , ” that has all the information from the appropriate database record .
There ’s a little more to it , but not that much ; working with software objects that reflect the information your site deals with is a natural and powerful approach .
In RoR , you have a rich set of software objects that correspond to your database tables , and these objects make up the “ model ” layer of the model - view - controller system .
Your code interacts with the model objects , and Active Record creates the SQL to make the database do what you want .
You do n’t have to write any SQL to work with the database .
And since none of your code communicates directly with the database , you can switch from one database engine to another by simply changing a configuration setting .
Views and controllers #section8
To create web pages , Rails provides a template system that makes it easy to use consistent page structures , to insert common components without repeating their code , to render information that comes from the database , and to display and process forms .
These templates constitute the “ view ” ?
layer of the model - view - controller system .
If you ’re a front - end developer , this is the part of Rails you should focus on .
You can simply assume that your “ view file ” will be handed variables that contain whatever information you need to display .
Just as PHP files are a mix of PHP code and HTML , a typical Rails view is a mix of Ruby and HTML .
Continuing with our bookstore example , here ’s a snippet of view code that displays the title and author of a book :
< h1 ><%= book .
title %></h1 >
< p ><%= book.author %></p>
The Ruby code is marked by <%= and %> ; the rest is HTML .
The HTML and the output of the Ruby code are combined to create the web page .
Rails has integrated support for the Prototype and Scriptaculous JavaScript libraries , plus a great facility called Ruby JavaScript ( RJS ) , for building Ajax interfaces .
You can write almost everything in Ruby , including code that is eventually executed by the browser as JavaScript ( the Rails framework handles the translation . )
A “ controller ” is a piece of Ruby code whose primary job is to communicate with the model to prepare the data needed by the view .
Any information that the view needs is assembled by the controller in a set of variables before invoking the view .
The controller also responds to Ajax requests after the page has loaded .
Controllers provide a variety of other functions as well , from user authentication to error handling .
Rails tries hard to provide reasonable defaults for almost everything .
Following a philosophy called Convention over Configuration , Rails almost entirely eliminates configuration files .
If you follow the Rails conventions , an amazing amount of stuff , from routing requests to the correct controller and view , to validating form data and displaying error messages , just works .
Compared with most other languages and frameworks , it takes less code to accomplish most common tasks .
The Convention over Configuration approach is sometimes frustrating for newcomers , especially if they try to learn from an existing application , because there are hidden assumptions behind much of the code .
The assumptions are what make the code simpler , but they can be confusing when you do n’t know them .
After you learn the Rails conventions , though , everything in Rails makes more sense .
And when you ’re building a new site , you have the wind at your back , because so much is already defined for you .
It ’s not perfect # section10
Rails does have its drawbacks .
These weak points are minimized for applications that fall within the Rails sweet spot I described earlier , but they can be big issues at the fringes .
Ruby is slower than most other languages .
This is likely to change this year , but for now , it is a disadvantage — for those few applications in which processing time is actually an issue .
In reality , this is a non-issue for the vast majority of websites .
The overhead of the MVC framework can also slow things down .
With a little attention , though , most Rails applications can be made to perform very well .
Model requests often need tuning to reduce the number of database accesses required .
You can often eliminate database requests entirely : Rails includes a powerful caching system , so pages can frequently be created once and delivered many times .
Rails applications are also more trouble to host than PHP applications .
Because of the size of the Rails framework code , it has to be kept in memory all the time , not loaded in response to a request .
You need 100 – 200 MB of dedicated RAM to host even a low - traffic Rails application .
With PHP applications , in contrast , you can host hundreds of applications on a single server , because they do n’t occupy any memory when they are n’t being accessed .
Because of these server requirements , shared hosting of Rails applications is generally problematic .
A VPS ( virtual private server ) is usually the best choice .
Setting up a Rails server can be more complex than for PHP .
This was an issue a year or two ago , but now there are many Rails - oriented hosting companies that provide turnkey solutions .
Another result of these server requirements is that Ruby on Rails hosting tends to be more expensive than for other platforms and languages .
If you ’re in the Rails sweet spot , your application is significant enough that the incremental hosting cost is insignificant compared to the value you get from using Rails .
The learning curve #section11
The complexity of Rails can make it hard for a beginner to get started : it takes months to become familiar with all of Rails .
But you can get started by first learning just enough to build a basic Rails site .
As you begin working with it , you ’ll pick up new skills and knowledge as you need it .
People come to building websites in various ways and from different backgrounds , but most of them fall into one of two categories :
People who have an idea for a site they want to build and learn just enough technology to build it .
Programmers who see websites as just another kind of program .
Ruby on Rails was built by programmers , for programmers .
So if you come to it from a professional software development background , it will feel a lot more familiar than if you come from web design .
If you ’re not a software developer , there ’s more to learn , but it ’s not beyond your reach .
Learning the parts of Ruby , and some bits of object - oriented programming , that you need to know to use Rails is not difficult .
To start building applications using the Rails framework you only need to know how to use a limited subset of Ruby ’s capabilities .
You can leave the advanced Ruby coding to those who work on the framework itself .
You do n’t need to understand much about how the internals of Rails works , or the techniques ( such as metaprogramming ) that it uses internally .
The Rails ecosystem includes many practices that come from the software development world , including use of source - code control systems , an automated testing framework , documentation tools , and deployment scripts .
If you ’ve been doing ad - hoc web development , these may be foreign concepts , but they can bring a lot of sanity into your work life once you become comfortable with them .
What to learn when #section12
The art of learning Rails is figuring out just what you can ignore at which stage of your education so you can grapple with a few things at a time , instead of with all the diverse technologies that make up a Rails application .
( One easy way to get started learning Ruby on Rails is with the “ free online course ” : http://www.BuildingWebApps.com/learning_rails produced by the author of this article . )
Start by learning the basics of Ruby .
You do n’t need to go too deep , but you need to know the basics before you can effectively develop with Rails .
Rails code looks almost like markup , and it is tempting to think of it as such , but you need to make the shift to thinking of your site as a program that emits web pages , rather than as a set of files that are web pages .
If you ’re focused on the front end , learn how layouts , view templates , and partials work .
If you ’re working with a back - end developer , they ’ll take care of the model and controller layers and provide your views with variables packed with just the data you need .
At first , you can ignore Ajax ; it ’s a largely separate layer that can make a big improvement in the user experience , but it really is optional .
So you can put RJS , Prototype , and Scriptaculous aside when you ’re learning Rails .
Add on a layer of Ajax sophistication once you ’re comfortable with the basics .
If you ’re a back - end developer , concentrate on learning how to model your application domain as a set of resources , create your database tables , and use the resulting objects .
The Rails framework is wide and deep , so it takes time to learn thoroughly , but you do n’t need to use very much of it to get started .
While you ’re learning Rails , you can ignore testing and all its associated complexities , even though it gets a lot of attention in discussions of Rails .
When you ’re further along , come back to it — but do n’t let it slow down your initial learning or add to your cognitive load .
Once you ’re up to speed , Ruby on Rails will become an old friend .
With this powerful set of tools at your fingertips , you ’ll be more productive than ever .
By being able to do more with less code , you ’ll build better sites and have more fun doing it .
There ’s no looking back .
Because it ’s what all the cool kids do , this is a post in literate Haskell .

How do you shuffle a pack of cards ?
Easy .
Throw it up in the air and then pick them up again .
Done .
Ok , you do n’t do that in practice , because it makes a mess .
But in principle it would give you a fair shuffling of the cards .
Conceptually it ’s equivalent to doing “ pick a card , any card ” until you run out of cards , and using the resulting order you picked them in .
But while tidy , that ’s far too boring .
Nevertheless , it ’s a pretty good way of shuffling .
It ’s more or less equivalent to one of the standard ways of shuffling a list / array / favourite sequential data structure , the Fisher - Yates shuffle .
This has a very easy to follow imperative implementation , but the purely functional ones … not so much .
Oleg has an implementation , although he does n’t call it by this name .
However , I found this implementation a little scary and ( more importantly ) not that easy to use .
Here ’s one which is structured according to a custom monad ( sorry ) which emulates the “ pick a card , any card ” structure of shuffling the list .
It seems likely that the monad has other uses , but I ca n’t think of any at the moment .
Mostly I ’m just posting this as a cute way to solve the problem .
> {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving#-}
We ’ll need this to derive the monad instance for our sample .
> module Sample ( > Sample ,
We ’ll define a type Sample a b .
This should be interpreted as an action which can add items to and random draw items from a bag of elements of type a and results in a b .
> takeSample ,
Given a Sample we run it by providing it with a source of randomness .
We define a sample with the following primitives :
> draw ,
We can draw an item from it at random .
This returns Nothing if the bag is empty , else Just someItem
> place ,
We can put an item into the bag .
> placeAll , > drawAll ,
And we provide some useful functions for bulk add and remove .
placeAll puts a list of items into the bag .
drawAll draws all the remaining items from the bag in a random order .
> shuffle
And using the combination of placeAll and drawAll we ’ll define a shuffle function .
> ) where > > import Control .
Monad .
State > import System .
Random > import qualified Data .
Sequence as Seq > import Data .
Sequence ( Seq , ( <| ) , ( |> ) , ( >< ) ) > newtype Sample a b = Sample ( State ( StdGen , Seq a ) b ) deriving Monad
A Sample consists of two things .
A random generator with which to make choices and a collection of elements ( we assume it ’s a StdGen rather than an arbitrary generator , mainly because I ’m being lazy ) and a bag of elements to draw from .
We allow repetitions , and in order to allow us to draw from any point we model it as a Data .
Sequence rather than a list ( which has O ( log ( k ) ) indexing ) .
We want to chain actions with respect to this sampling together , so we model it as a state monad .
> takeSample :: StdGen ->
Sample a b -> b > takeSample g ( Sample st ) = evalState st ( g , Seq . empty )
Given a Sample , we set it running with a source of randomness and an empty bag .
> draw :: Sample a ( Maybe a ) > draw =
Sample $ do ( gen , sample ) <- get > if ( Seq .
null sample ) > then return Nothing > else do let ( i , gen ' ) = randomR ( 0 , Seq .
length sample - 1 ) gen > let ( x , sample ' ) = remove i sample > put ( gen ' , sample ' ) > return $ Just x
Draw takes an element from the sequence , returns the result of that and chains through the new generator and the remaining elements .
> where > remove :: Int -> Seq a -> ( a , Seq a ) > remove 0 xs = ( x , u ) where ( x Seq .:< u ) =
Seq .
viewl xs > remove i xs | i == Seq .
length xs = ( x , u ) where ( u Seq .:> x ) = Seq .
viewr xs > remove i xs = ( x , u >< v ) > where ( u ' , v ) = Seq .
splitAt i xs > ( u Seq .:> x ) = Seq . viewr u'
This is just a helpful method for removing an element from inside a sequence .
> place :: a -> Sample a ( ) > place x = Sample $ do ( gen , sample ) <- get > put ( gen , x <| sample )
To place an element we just append it to the beginning of the sequence .
> placeAll :: [ a ] ->
Sample a ( ) > placeAll xs = Sample $ do ( gen , sample ) <- get > put ( gen , Seq .
fromList xs >< sample )
Similarly for placing multiple elements , although we use sequence concatenation rather than appending them one by one .
> drawAll :: Sample a [ a ] > drawAll = do el <- draw > case el of >
Nothing -> return [ ] >
Just ( x ) -> do xs <- drawAll > return $ x : xs
drawAll simply draws from the bag until it finds nothing left .
Pretty self explanatory .
> shuffle :: StdGen -> [ a ] -> [ a ] > shuffle gen xs = takeSample gen $ place
All xs >> drawAll
And finally , we can implement shuffle .
And it ’s a one liner .
In order to shuffle a bunch of elements we simply put them all in the bag , then take them all out again in a random order .
Ta da !
This was n’t really very hard to do directly , but I found that creating the right abstraction to build it out of helped clarify the logic a lot .
The Sega Neptune was basically a two - in - one game system ( Genesis / 32X ) , planned for release in 1995 .
Unfortunately , by the time a working prototype was ready , the Sega Saturn took the spotlight .
On the bright side , this engineer has taken matters into his own hands and produced a working console .

( Thanks , Jake )
Overview
According to reader Jake , the project started with circuit boards from both systems being ripped out and then custom fitted into the Genesis console .
Next , the Genesis ’s cart slot contacts were soldered onto the 32X’s .
The two boards were connected via 24AWG wire , which also took care of the video cable connection .
Finally , an Xacto knife was used to modify the cartridge slot for the larger - sized 32X cartridges .

NBC Universal Chief Digital Officer George Kliavkoff : " We 'd love to be on iTunes .
It has a great customer experience .
We 'd love to figure out a way to distribute our content on iTunes . "
Obviously NBC did , until they walked out .
In order for them to come back , they want more money per show ( still ) to " reflect the full value of the product . "
And for iTunes to block you from loading pirated content onto your iPod .
Sounds insane right ?

" If you look at studies about MP3 players , especially leading MP3 players and what portion of that content is pirated , and think about how that content gets onto that device , it has to go through a gatekeeping piece of software , which would be a convenient place to put some antipiracy measures .
We are financially harmed every day by piracy .
It results in us not being able to invest as much money in the next generation of film and TV products . "

What does that have to do with NBC selling shows through iTunes that would be appropriately locked down with DRM — thereby making money on those next - gen products ?
Ummm ... we 're not sure .

Laura Bush , docile doormat / Behold , the ideal Republican wife : Prim , sexless , nearly useless , lets the men do the real thinkin' .
Hot !
I fondly recall , just before the tragic Bush / Kerry presidential election , an impassioned discussion I had with a family friend , a conservative Catholic mother of four and grandmother of six , headstrong , outspoken , hilarious , a real no - BS matriarch of her big crazy messy family and clearly the wearer of the pants in her marriage and a woman whom I always liked for her wit and her outsized personality , despite her unfortunate choice of religious and political affiliation , a woman who , it turned out in our discussion , absolutely hated — hated — John Kerry 's wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry .
Remember her ?
Controversial .
Fiery .
A little weird , prickly , unpredictable .
Also : headstrong and outspoken and did n't take any crap from any men , no matter how powerful .
Heinz is also rather amazing , in terms of sheer accomplishment and self - made acumen : world traveled , highly educated , spoke multiple languages ( she was an interpreter for the United Nations , early on ) , took over the philanthropic arm of the Heinz empire when her husband died unexpectedly , almost ran for senate , raised her enormously accomplished , well - adjusted sons to adulthood by herself , and so on .
I thought she was great .
And my friend hated her .
And why ?
Well , ironically enough , for most of the reasons I list above .
Apparently , Heinz had too much personality .
She was too strong , too in your face , too fearless and outspoken , something was " just not right about that woman . "
All this , of course , made Heinz into " a total bitch . "
( And yes , this completely echoes the right 's hatred of Hillary Clinton during the Bill Clinton years and up through today , because she dared to be the opposite of meek and quiet , dared to try and actually do something progressive and radical as first lady .
Yes , she botched it badly , overshot her abilities and overestimated her powers to revolutionize health care .
But the real problem was how badly she underestimated the violent , inbred misogyny and anti-feminism of the old - boys network in Washington ) .
I was equal parts appalled and amused .
And not only because my brash , blunt friend and Heinz obviously had far more in common , personality - and attitude - wise , than she cared to acknowledge .
No , I was stunned because my friend far preferred , as the perfect counter to Heinz , as a role model and a woman and the ideal presidential wife , one tepid , timid , thoroughly useless Laura Bush .
Wait , what ?
You mean docile , prudish , former librarian Laura Bush , she of the nonexistent inspiration and dull - as - dishwater personality ?
Yes indeed , that Laura Bush .
Here was my friend , brash and funny and who spoke her mind without the slightest reservation , and who could drink and think and opine with the strongest of men , and yet she admired this ... limp wallflower ?
I did n't get it .
I still do n't completely get it , to this very day .
All of this comes to mind as I see , skirting across the newswires , a handful of generic photos and sidebar stories of Laura Bush out on tour recently with her twin Styrofoam peanut daughters , Jenna and Barbara , promoting a new children 's book they all apparently , and yeah right , wrote together and is n't that sweet .
There is Laura , looking exactly as she has looked for the past eight insufferable years .
Prim , a bit glassy , reserved , her hair some sort of ironclad helmet of awkward architecture , the very epitome of nice , meek , domestic Republican female , not making the slightest wave and hoping no one really notices because , well , she 's just a woman .
In fact , I challenge anyone reading this column right now to name one thing this woman has said or done in the past seven - plus years that shows her using her position as first lady to make any real difference .
A single issue .
A single notable appearance .
A single daring , interesting , engaging ... anything .
Did you say , somewhat meekly , " children 's literacy ? "
Ah , yes .
Right you are , Laura has indeed taken on that wild ' n ' wooly issue , fought valiantly to ensure lots of white children have enough access to " James and the Giant Peach . "
It 's a hugely divisive , hot - button topic that 's tearing the nation apart and really needs someone of her position and influence to step in and ...
Oh , never mind .
Children 's literacy .
Yes .
I believe that ranks No. 291 on the list of the Top 300 controversial issues facing the nation today , right behind overpriced lip balm but just ahead of the demise of " Cathy " cartoons in major American newspapers .
Good choice .
I know .
It 's not exactly against the law to be docile and quiet .
It 's not exactly a crime to simply want to be a good mother and housewife ( noble and under - respected callings , both ) , to not seek the spotlight and not hunger for power and influence .
And besides , meek , shy girls who want nothing more than to marry the male equivalent of a tub of spackling paste at age 22 and never think for themselves and never inspire anyone to do anything need role models , too .
Right ?
Sure , eight years in one of the most high - profile positions in the world , a simply staggering opportunity to make use of that power and that " office " to take on at least one serious , needful issue ( or 10 ) , and you do not a single thing of interest or inspiration with it ?
You essentially get handed the keys to the kingdom and all you want to do is knit a nice key cozy for them ?
Fine .
But then again , no .
For in choosing to be and do almost nothing at all for all these years , Laura has also come to epitomize the compliant , unobtrusive woman , the worst kind of example for modern young women today .
This is , of course , why conservative Republicans and fundie Christians love her .
They call her " classy . "
What they mean is :
She knows her place , keeps her mouth shut , possesses exactly zero sexuality , speaks only when spoken to , lets the men do the " real " work , stays so far off in the background she might as well be wallpaper .
Here 's the bottom line : I think Laura Bush has been bad for America .
Not nearly as toxic as her husband , but bad enough .
Indeed , Teresa Heinz Kerry may 've been weird and worldly , Hillary might be polarizing and opinionated and overly masculine , Barack Obama 's wife , Michelle , appears to be outspoken and sarcastic and smart as hell .
But oh my God , give me one of them any day over the docile doormat first lady .
Has n't the expiration date for that dangerous feminine cliche long since passed ?

The number of roadblocks in the West Bank has increased by 41 since September despite Israeli pledges to reduce them , the United Nations reported on Friday .
The total number of roadblocks in the Palestinian territory rose from 566 on September 4 to 607 by April 29 , the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said .
Easing Restrictions IDF lifts siege imposed on Nablus Hanan Greenberg ( Video ) After more than a year , roadblock near Asira a - Shamaliya opens ; move expected to ease passage of Palestinians .
IDF fears rise in activity in most terror - oriented city in West Bank IDF lifts siege imposed on Nablus
A total of 144 new closures were erected while 103 were removed , an OCHA report said .
The closures severely restrict the mobility of people and goods within the West Bank , and also affect access of UN staff crossing from the West Bank to Jerusalem , the agency added .
The international community has urged Israel to ease restrictions on movement in the West Bank as part of peace efforts with the Palestinians .
During a visit by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in March , Israel pledged to remove 50 West Bank roadblocks .
Israeli authorities later claimed they did away with 61 roadblocks , but OCHA said only 44 had actually been removed and that most of those were of little or no significance .
Israel started installing the roadblocks , some staffed by soldiers and others unmanned , during the first Palestinian uprising in the late 1980s in order to curb militant attacks on targets in Israel .
The number of barriers increased during the second uprising which began in 2000 .
' Israel doing its utmost '
The report came out shortly after visiting French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner criticized Israel 's network of roadblocks and checkpoints , which are seen as a key impediment to the recovery of the Palestinian economy .
" The restrictions on access and mobility are still significant , " Kouchner said at a Palestinian investment conference in Bethlehem .
" They have not yet been alleviated as they should have .
Israel should and Israel can exert more efforts in this regard without endangering its security . "
Israel says it cannot move faster in easing restrictions because Palestinian militants still pose a threat .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev , speaking before the OCHA report was published , said Israel is doing its utmost to improve freedom of movement in the West Bank .
" That 's our challenge to take down roadblocks , to try to create greater movement and access for Palestinians while maintaining security .
That 's what we 're trying to do , " He said .

David Bonior , who was a former high ranking Congressman , and most recently served as the campaign manager for John Edwards announced this morning that he is supporting Barack Obama .
“ I see one candidate who has proven he can bring the kind of change to Washington that will mean more jobs , better pay for American workers , and health care for every single American .
That candidate is Barack Obama , ” Bonior said .
His reason for supporting Obama now was the results of Tuesday ’s primaries , “ Tuesday was a critical moment in this race , because Barack Obama continues to run a positive campaign that focuses on the issues that matter to ordinary Americans , he has won a commanding lead in this race , and I believe he can and will defeat John McCain in November . ”

Bonior ’s endorsement is huge because he and John
Edwards are still very popular with organized labor .
So far many of the unions who endorsed Edwards , have waiting to see who the Democratic nominee will be before they shift their support .
Bonior ’s endorsement alone wo n’t shift labor , but it sends the most powerful signal yet that the party is unifying around Obama , and that it might be time for labor to get on board .

Mr. Whitman is Ford Foundation Professor at Yale Law School , where he teaches criminal law and legal history .
He holds both a law degree and a doctorate in history .
As everybody knows , no person in the United States of America can be convicted of a crime unless that person ’s guilt is proven “ beyond a reasonable doubt . ”
It would be hard to name a legal doctrine more familiar to the general public .
For that matter , it would be hard to name a legal doctrine more basic to the American sense of justice .
American criminal law would be unimaginable without the reasonable doubt standard .
Indeed , the requirement of proof “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” is so fundamental that the Supreme Court has read it into our constitutional law , even though the phrase “ reasonable doubt ” appears nowhere in the Constitution .
But what exactly is proof “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” ?
Anyone who has served as a criminal juror knows that the rule is not easy to understand .
There is always some possible uncertainty about any case .
Exactly what kind of uncertainty counts as a legal “ doubt ” ?
Exactly when are legal “ doubts ” about the guilt of the accused “ reasonable ” ?
Jurors are sometimes understandably baffled .
Even the some of the most sophisticated members of the legal profession find the question too difficult to answer .
The result is a troubling situation indeed .
Once a jury has determined a person to be guilty “ beyond a reasonable doubt , ” that person ’s fate is almost always sealed .
Even the emergence of new evidence , like the evidence of DNA testing , may not be enough to reopen a criminal case .
Yet judges and legal scholars have come to the conclusion that the phrase “ reasonable doubt ” can be assigned no definitive meaning .
A moral philosopher might raise disturbing questions indeed about this state of affairs .
How you can send somebody to prison , or even to death , on the strength of a rule that nobody understands ?
My new book , The Origins of Reasonable Doubt : Theological Roots of the Criminal Trial , uses history to account for this troubling state of affairs .
In order to make sense of our law , we have to dig deep into its past .
The reasonable doubt formula seems mystifying today because we have lost sight of its original purpose .
At its origins the rule was not intended to perform the function we ask it to perform today :
It was not primarily intended to protect the accused .
Instead , strange as it may sound , the reasonable doubt formula was originally concerned with protecting the souls of the jurors against damnation .
In the criminal trial of past centuries , there was more at stake than the fate of the accused .
The fate of those who sat in judgment was at stake at well .
In part this was because jurors had to fear vengeance on the part of the relatives of the convicted man .
But it was also for religious reasons .
Convicting an innocent defendant was regarded , in the older Christian tradition , as a potential mortal sin .
The reasonable doubt rule developed in response to this disquieting possibility .
It was originally a theological doctrine , intended to reassure jurors that they could convict the defendant without risking their own salvation .
According to medieval doctrine , judging was a spiritually dangerous business .
Any sinful misstep committed by a judge in the course of judging “ built him a mansion in Hell . ”
This was especially true any time a judge imposed “ blood punishments ” — that is , execution and mutilation , the standard criminal punishments of pre-nineteenth - century law .
To be a judge in a capital case was to participate in a killing , and that meant judging was full of spiritual peril .
And when it came to that sort of spiritual peril , premodern Christian theology turned in particular on the problem of “ doubt . ”
Doubt was the voice of an uncertain conscience , and it had to be obeyed .
“ In cases of doubt , ” as the standard theological formula ran , “ the safer way is not to act at all . ”
This applied to judging just as it did to all other acts involving the individual conscience .
As the standard Christian law explained , “ In every case of doubt , where one ’s salvation is in peril , one must always take the safer way .
. . .
A judge who is in doubt must refuse to judge . ”
A judge who sentenced an accused person to a blood punishment while experiencing “ doubt ” about guilt committed a mortal sin , and thus put his own salvation at grave risk .
The story of the “ reasonable doubt ” rule , which now seems so mysterious to us , is simply an English chapter in this long religious history .
Common law jurors were Christians , and they were Christians who engaged in acts of judgment .
This meant that to be a juror was potentially to “ to pawn [ your ]
Soul , ” as the most famous pamphlet of the revolutionary era declared .
Or as another pamphlet put it , “ the Juryman who finds any other person guilty , is liable to the Vengeance of God upon his Family and Trade , Body and Soul , in this world and that to come . ”
There is plenty of evidence that English jurors took these ominous threats quite seriously , especially at the end of the eighteenth century .
Jurors experienced “ a general dread lest the charge of innocent blood should lie at their doors . ”
It was in response to such juror “ dread ” that the reasonable doubt standard introduced itself into the common law , especially during the 1780s .
The reasonable doubt rule arose in the face of religious fears .
It is still with us today , a living fossil from an older moral world .
Such is the story my book tells .
As it suggests , the “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” standard was not originally designed to make it more difficult for jurors to convict .
It was originally designed to make conviction easier , by assuring jurors that their souls were safe if they voted to condemn the accused .
In its original form , it had nothing to do with maintaining the rule of law in the sense that we use the phrase , and nothing like the relationship to the values of liberty we ascribe to it today .
It was the product of a world troubled by moral anxieties that no longer trouble us much at all .
All this means that it is no surprise that our law finds itself in a state of confusion today .
We are asking the reasonable doubt standard to serve a function that it was not originally designed to serve , and it does its work predictably badly .
Most of all , it is no surprise if American jurors find themselves confused and troubled when they face the difficult task of judging the accused persons before them .
The law cannot give any convincing answer to the question , what is the meaning of “ beyond a reasonable doubt ? ”
That is a question only history can answer .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign acknowledged this morning that even if all delegates from Michigan and Florida were seated at the Democratic convention , she would not have enough delegates to claim the presidential nomination .
This suggests that the campaign has determined that one of the major avenues to the nomination is almost certainly closed off and that if Mrs.
Clinton intends to pursue it , she will have to look elsewhere — most likely to an appeal to the superdelegates to give the nomination to Mrs. Clinton .
Still , asked on a conference call with reporters to clarify whether they had concluded that the Florida and Michigan delegations were irrelevant at this point , campaign officials stopped short of agreeing .
“ That ’s why we have a process , to find out , ” said Geoff Garin , the campaign ’s top strategist .
“ All we ’re saying is , we ought to let the process play through .
We think that it continues to be constructive for the Democratic Party to do that , as we go into these next set of states . ”
Phil Singer , a spokesman for the campaign , added that if it were clear that seating the delegations in full would not threaten Senator Barack Obama ’s path to the nomination , the Obama campaign would be enthusiastically supporting their seating .
The rules committee plans to meet May 31 to resolve the issues with Michigan and Florida , both of which violated D.N.C. rules in holding their primaries earlier than the party allowed .
The Clinton campaign has argued for months that not seating delegates from those states would disenfranchise voters in those states and put the party at risk for losing them in the fall .
Earlier in the call , Clinton officials were asked to lay out the math by which seating the delegates from Michigan and Florida would get Mrs. Clinton significantly closer to the nomination .
The reporter asking the question , from the Detroit News , said that it appeared , based on estimates of pledged delegates , that even if those delegations were fully counted , “ it ’s likely you ’ll come up behind . ”
Mr. Singer said that even if the delegates were counted , the campaign would still be about 100 delegates shy of the number needed .
The implication was that the gap could not be made up , even if she wins more delegates in the remaining contests , as she is expected to do .
He also said he expected the Democratic National Committee ’s rules and bylaws committee to seat the delegates from Michigan and Florida to ensure that all voters are represented .
Asked again if it was correct that the Clinton campaign would still not reach the full number of delegates , Mr. Singer said , “ That is correct . ”
The Clinton camp has also been arguing that the full number of delegates needed to claim the nomination is 2,209 , which includes Florida and Michigan , as opposed to 2,025 .
Howard Wolfson , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , said that the 2,025 was “ not the operative number . ”

Les hausses répétées du prix du pétrole commencent à avoir un impact sérieux dans certains secteurs de l'économie et les protestations se multiplient , particulièrement en Europe .
Les augmentations à répétition du prix du baril de pétrole touchent de plus en plus la qualité de vie de la population .
De 20 $ US qu'il était à New York , début 2002 , il a atteint 135 $ US jeudi dernier , une inflation que de moins en moins de gens sont capables d'absorber .
La flambée des cours du pétrole provoque donc de plus en plus de mécontentement et les mouvements de protestations commencent à se multiplier à travers le monde .
Le monde réagit
Dans l'archipel indonésien , par exemple , les manifestations prennent de l'ampleur depuis que le gouvernement a annoncé une importante réduction des subventions de l'essence .
L'impact sur le prix à la pompe a provoqué des hausses de près de 30 % .
À l'Université de Makassar , au moins deux manifestants ont été arrêtés mardi , tandis qu'une trentaine d'entre eux lançaient des pierres sur la police , lors d'une manifestation .
À Londres , des centaines de routiers menacent de bloquer Londres en guise de protestation contre la hausse des prix du carburant .
Quelque 300 véhicules se sont immobilisés en pleine heure de pointe sur une autoroute menant à Londres .
Ils sont en colère et demandent au gouvernement de Gordon Brown de baisser la taxe sur les carburants pour les entreprises de transport routier .
En Espagne aussi les routiers tentent de faire valoir leur point de vue auprès du gouvernement .
Une organisation menace de lancer un appel à la grève le 8 juin , si ses revendications ne sont pas satisfaites .
La principale association représentant environ 60 % du secteur du transport routier ne s'est toutefois pas jointe à l'appel pour le moment afin de ne pas compromettre les négociations avec le gouvernement .
Par contre , un mouvement de grève a aussi été lancé lundi dans trois ports catalans .
Ce mouvement commence à se répandre à d'autres régions .
Une confédération patronale nationale regroupant 1400 entreprises de pêches représentant 20 000 marins lance un appel à la grève illimitée à compter de vendredi .
De son côté , l'organisation Medisamak , qui rassemble des associations de pêcheurs méditerranéens , prépare une action de protestation à la Commission européenne .
Cette dernière d'ailleurs a vivement critiqué l'idée du président français Nicolas Sarkozy de plafonner la taxe à la valeur ajoutée sur le prix du pétrole afin de limiter les effets de la flambée du brut .
On croit que cela enverrait un mauvais signal aux pays producteurs de pétrole .
Les ambulanciers et les pêcheurs français n'auront pas attendu M. Sarkozy pour signifier leur mécontentement .
En Normandie , les ambulanciers ont lancé une opération de ralentissement du trafic automobile sur le périphérique .
« En 10 ans , nos tarifs ont augmenté de 6 % alors que le carburant a augmenté de 40 % en trois ans » , a déclaré Hervé Lacroix , ambulancier à Cherbourg , à la tête de la manifestation , et cité par l'AFP .
Le mouvement de grève des pêcheurs , entamé il y a deux semaines en France , se poursuit toujours et s'est répandu en Espagne .
D'autres sources d'énergie ?
Comme il fallait s'y attendre , on commence à penser à des sources alternatives d'énergie .
Le premier ministre français , François Fillon , propose le développement du programme nucléaire français .
«
Il faut continuer à développer le programme nucléaire français , parce que cette réponse était en 1970 une bonne réponse , et elle est toujours aujourd ' hui une bonne réponse » , a -t - il déclaré à l'Assemblée nationale .
M. Fillon propose aussi d'augmenter les investissements dans les énergies renouvelables .
À la Bourse de New York , les investisseurs aussi sont inquiets .
Ils craignent que les consommateurs réduisent leurs achats de biens qui ne sont pas de première nécessité .
Le Venezuela , une exception
La crise n'affecte pas tous les pays de la même façon .
Au Venezuela , par exemple , le plus grand producteur latino - américain de brut , c'est surtout les prix du lait et de la farine qui inquiètent .
L'essence est quasiment gratuite dans ce pays .
Depuis son arrivée au pouvoir , il y a plus de neuf ans , le président socialiste Hugo Chavez n'a pas osé augmenter l'essence , moins chère qu'en Arabie saoudite , le premier producteur mondial .

The next time you 're feeling all smug and twenty - first century commuting into the office while using your laptop to catch up on emails or prep for a presentation , consider the following .
Back in 1893 , a publication called The Manufacturer and Builder hyped a new portable typewriter that could " readily be used on the lap , on the desk , on the train — in short , anywhere " — and showed a forward - thinking commuter doing just that .
Click through for a closer look at the world 's first laptop .

Measuring 12 inches long by 6 - 1/ 2 inches wide by 2 inches deep , and weighing a mere 3 pounds , the World typewriter was roughly the same size as many of today 's laptop computers .
Instead of a keyboard , however , the World used a dial ; users chose a character with the right hand , then used the left to operate a lever that pressed it into the paper .
Yet another lever was used to make spaces between words .
Even so , the World typewriter was said to be
. . . readily mastered , so that after a month or two of practice any one of ordinary intelligence , by application , can acquire a speed of forty words per minute , or about twice the number that a rapid penman will write with the pen .

Of course , a fast typist on a QWERTY keyboard could reach speeds of 100 words per minute or more — a fact that may have helped contribute to the World typewriter 's fade into oblivion .
As oil and in turn gas , prices continue to increase and no action or plans in sight that suggest any near term reduction , I ’m seeing articles and comments along the lines of , “ It ’s not uncommon in Europe to pay $ 7 for a gallon of gas .
If they can stomach it , so can we . ”
An example of this logic is in this opinion piece by Paul Krugman .
Krugman takes what is otherwise a thoughtful argument i.e. all the talk about speculation driving an “ oil bubble ” may not be based on well reasoned economics but rather on wishful thinking , and destroyed his credibility with :
The consequences of that ( oil ) scarcity probably wo n’t be apocalyptic :
France consumes only half as much oil per capita as America , yet the last time I looked , Paris was n’t a howling wasteland .
But the odds are that we ’re looking at a future in which energy conservation becomes increasingly important , in which many people may even " ” gasp " ” take public transit to work .
Why is this kind of logic silly ?
How about a quick geography lesson .
France has an area of approximately 250,000 square miles , about the size of Texas which is approximately 269,000 square miles .
France has a population of 64 M people which means they have a density of approximately 256 people / Sq. Mi. Texas has a population of 24 M people which means they have a density of approximately 164 people / Sq. Mi. Beginning to see an issue ?
Let ’s extrapolate that to the entire United States .
To be generous , I ’ll exclude Alaska and Hawaii .
The continental US has an area of 3.2 Million Sq. Mi .
The continental US population is approximately 302 million people .
That translates to a density of only 94 people / sq. mi .
I wo n’t even drag you through the densities that exist west of the Mississippi and east of the Pacific coastal states .
To suggest that a European country that is a fraction of the size of the US with a population density nearly 3X the US is comparable in energy use is naive at best and dishonest at worst .
OK , let ’s try a different tact .
Let ’s assume we could get rid of all those nasty , hydrocarbon burning , carbon dioxide spewing personal vehicles .
If tomorrow we banned the use of all personal vehicles we would at most , reduce our oil per capita consumption by 40 % ( it would be less than 40 % because of course , we ’d have to provide transit solutions for those people and many of those solutions involve petroleum as the fuel ) .
Even with a 40 % reduction , we ’d still be using 10 % more per capita than France .
My point in all of this is that trying to compare the US to a European country , especially one that is a fraction of the size of the US with a population density nearly 3X the US , as comparable in energy use is naive at best and dishonest at worst .
The only way that we are close to being comparable to Europe is in the taxes and other costs waiting to be imposed to “ solve ” our energy “ problem ” by forcibly removing our need for oil .
Oh , and another way that we ’ll be like Europe , we ’ll be heading for our own “ Dark Ages . ”
A study that followed the lives of young males for 20 years has found that cognitive ability predicted whether the person was likely to engage in violence or theft if they had a tendency for antisocial behaviour .
Way back in ’ 79 , the researchers recruited 698 males from 12 to 18 years of age from a random telephone survey in New Jersey .
They kept in contact with them until the year 2000 .
The researchers interviewed the participants and asked about any antisocial behaviour or offences .
They also tested the participants using neuropsychological tests of verbal IQ and executive function – the ability to co-ordinate mental resources that is closely linked to the frontal lobes .
In the males who did end up engaging in antisocial behaviour , the ones with cognitive difficulties tended to be violent , while the ones who were cognitively more able tended to steal .
In other words , low mental ability was associated with violence while the brighter individuals tended to engage in theft .
This could be because successful theft could require more thought , from planning a robbery to tricking another individual , whereas successful violence just requires a target .
One of the difficulties in interpreting these sorts of studies , is that they rely on participants admitting their own offences , so maybe more intelligent people are likely to describe their crimes differently .
However , it certainly was n’t the case that more able people simply kept quiet about antisocial behaviour , as both reported wrongdoings , but of a different type .
UPDATE : Romeo Vitelli makes an interesting point in the comments :
All things being equal , theft is regarded as being less serious than violence is .
Given that this study depends on self - report , are the ones who commit violence less likely to admit to committing violent crimes than the ones who commit theft ?

The former security director of the One Laptop Per Child non-profit has blasted the project for losing sight of its goals , accusing chairman Nicholas Negroponte of deceiving the public .
It 's all about shipping kit , says Ivan Krstić in an incendiary essay .
" I quit when Nicholas told me — and not just me — that learning was never part of the mission .
The mission was , in his mind , always getting as many laptops as possible out there ; to say anything about learning would be presumptuous , and so he does n't want OLPC to have a software team , a hardware team , or a deployment team going forward , " writes Krstić .
" Nicholas ' new OLPC is dropping those pesky education goals from the mission and turning itself into a 50 - person nonprofit laptop manufacturer , competing with Lenovo , Dell , Apple , Asus , HP and Intel on their home turf , and by using the one strategy we know does n't work . "
Ouch .
Negroponte 's decision to embrace Windows has seen top - level resignations from the OLPC project .
CTO Mary Lou Jepsen left in January , and former software chief and president Walter Bender departed in April .
Krstić resigned in March .
OLPC is a poster child for free software innovation , with critics acknowledging value in its advances in mesh networking and the radical task - based UI Sugar .
But the F / OSS ideals are now being jetissoned , writes Krstić , along with the crown jewels :
" In reality , Nicholas wants to ship plain XP desktops .
He 's told me so .
That he might possibly fund a Sugar effort to the side and pay lip service to the notion of its ' availability ' as an option to purchasing countries is at best a tepid effort to avert a PR disaster . "
Not everyone thinks Sugar is a successful UI - judge for yourself in our extensive hands - on .

Four nuclear sites in west Cumbria are being decommissioned
The cost of cleaning up the UK's ageing nuclear facilities , including some described as " dangerous " , looks set to rise above £ 73bn , the BBC has learned .
A senior official at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority said the bill would rise by billions of pounds .
Nineteen sites across the country , some dating from the 1950s , are due to be dismantled in the coming decades .
A spokesman for the Department for Business said it was ready for an adjustment in the clean - up costs .
In January , the National Audit Office said that the cost of decommissioning ageing power sites had risen from £ 12bn to £ 73 bn .
Radioactive decay
At the largest site , Sellafield , on the Cumbrian coast , I saw for myself one of the " ponds " in which an unknown mass of radioactive material was dumped in the 1950s .
Beneath the unruffled surface of the water lies an unrecorded collection of rusting metal containers holding radioactive waste , including spent fuel rods .
Beside it , workers are constructing a vast new building to handle the material when a retrieval operation eventually gets under way .
DECOMMISSIONING SITES Anglesey Wylfa Ayrshire Hunterston A Caithness Dounreay Cheshire Capenhurst ( fuel facility ) Cumbria Calder Hall , Sellafield , Windscale , LLW Repository Dorset Winfrith Dumfries Chapelcross Essex Bradwell Gloucestershire Berkeley , Oldbury Gwynedd Trawsfynydd Kent Dungeness A Lancs Springfields Oxon Harwell , Culham JET Somerset Hinkley Point A Suffolk Sizewell A Speaking to the BBC , Jim Morse , a senior director at the authority , said of the projected cost : " I think it 's a high probability that in the short term it will undoubtedly go up .
" We 've still a lot to discover , we have n't started waste retrieval in those parts of the estate where the degradation and radioactive decay has been at its greatest . "
When asked if the cost increases could run into billions of pounds , Mr Morse said : " I 'm sure it 'll be some billions , I really do n't know .
" No - one 's done this before .
It 's very difficult to find another measure .
There 's nothing in engineering terms that allows you to extrapolate from what you have today . "
A pilot project to investigate the task of dismantling has been under way for years at one of the most distinctive landmarks at Sellafield - the giant sphere of the 1950s - era Windscale Advanced Gas- cooled Reactor .

Down below us , behind heavy shielding , robotic tools have been used to break up the most contaminated elements which are then extracted and sealed inside giant concrete blocks .
For the moment the blocks - along with all nuclear waste - are stored in temporary facilities while the government decides where and when to build a long - term underground dump .
A spokesman for the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform suggested the government was ready for the clean - up 's costs to rise .
" As the NDA continues its work to establish - for the first time - the scale of the challenge , the assessment of the costs involved will naturally need adjusting , " he said .
The spokesman also added that the next generation of nuclear power stations would produce less waste than the older ones , and that the power generators would be obliged to pay for the costs .

What are these ?
I ’ve programmed in many languages before , indeed I ’ve spent at least a year working in Basic , C , C++ , C# , java , assembler , modula - 2 , powerhouse and prolog .
One thing I ’ve never done before is Matlab , well except a few basic exercises for some course I did way back .
A couple of years ago I started using python and more recently I ’ve started to use the scipy libraries which essentially provide something similar to Matlab .
The experience has been unlike anything I ’ve coded in before .
The development cycle has gone like this :
1 ) Write the code in python like I would write it in , say , java .
I have data stored in some places , then I have algorithms that iterate over these data structures computing stuff , calling methods , changing values and doing various complex things in order to implement the desired algorithm .
10 pages of code , somewhat general .
2 ) Then I realise that in a few places I do n’t need to iterate over something , I can just use some vectors and work with those directly .
7 pages of code , a little more general .
3 ) Then I realise that part of my code is really just running an optimisation algorithm , so I can replace it with a call to an optimiser in one of the scipy libraries .
5 pages of code , and a bit faster now .
4 ) Then I try to further generalise my system and in the process I realise that really what I ’m doing is taking a Cartesian space , building a multi- dimensional matrix and then applying some kind of optimiser to the space .
3 pages of code , very general .
5 ) Finally I ’m like , hey , how far can I push this ?
With some more thought and spending a few days trying to get my head around all the powerful scipy libraries , I finally figure out that the core of my entire algorithm can be implemented in an extremely general and yet fast way in just a few lines .
It ’s really just a matrix with some flexible number of dimensions to which I am applying some kind of n-dimensional filter , followed by an n-dimensional non-linear optimiser on top of an n-dimensional interpolation and finally coordinate mapping back out of the space to produce the end results .
2 pages of code , of which half is comments , over a quarter is trivial supporting stuff like creating the necessary matrices , and just a few lines make the necessary calls to implement the algorithm .
And it ’s all super general .
Now this is great in a sense .
You end up throwing away most of your code now that all the real computation work is being done by sophisticated mathematical functions which are using optimised matrix computation libraries .
The bottleneck in writing code is n’t in the writing of the code , it ’s in understanding and conceptualising what needs to be done .
Once you ’ve done that , i.e. come up with mathematical objects and equations that describe your algorithm , you simply express these in a few lines of scipy and hit go .
It ’s not just with my financial software either .
I recently implemented a certain kind of neural network using nothing but scipy and found that the core of the algorithm was just one line of code — a few matrix transformations and calls to scipy functions .
I hear that one of the IDSIA guys working on playing
Go recently collapsed the code he ’s been working on for six months down to two pages .
The downside to all this is that you spend months developing your complex algorithms and when you ’re done you show somebody the result of all your efforts — a page or two of code .
It looks like something that somebody could have written in an afternoon .
Even worse , you start to suspect that if you had really known scipy and spent a few days carefully thinking about the problem to start with , then you probably could have coded it in an afternoon .
It ’s a little embarrassing .
We 're gonna go ahead and report this story , even though we run the risk of the GOP suing us for " taking McCain 's quotes out of context . "
</ snark >
At a town hall meeting today , Senator McCain made a stunning admission when he announced that his energy policy would aim to reduce our dependence on Middle East oil , which would in turn ensure that we never have to fight another war there again .
Download Download
" My friends , I will have an energy policy which will eliminate our dependence on oil from Middle East that will then prevent us from having ever to send our young men and women into conflict again in the Middle East . "
Think about how amazing this is .
McCain is essentially saying that our quest to " spread democracy " throughout the Middle East is a sham .
It has nothing to do with freeing oppressed people , or protecting Israel , or defending ourselves against future attacks .
It 's about gaining control of foreign oil .
Stunning .
Will this get any significant media play ?
Digg It !
Tweety gets this exactly right :
The following video illustrates the fact that uninformed liberals know nothing of which they speak .
They take to the streets , attend Cindy Sheehan rallies and protest for the sake of protesting .
They bitch and complain about the war in Iraq , call Bush a terrorist and call for the destruction of Israel , yet have no freakin idea of the atrocities that Saddam committed when he was in power , or how many millions of men , women and children were murdered at his hands .
At one point in the video , a dumb liberal was asked if she know who the Kurds were and she said no , obviously .
She did n’t know that Saddam also fired Scud missiles into Israel targeting civilians during the first Gulf War .
It ’s a shame that these people are so uninformed , and at the same time , it is a blessing to live in a country where you can assemble for any reason , no matter how insane it may be .

The 700 Mhz spectrum auction results were revealed today .
The big winner ?
Verizon Wireless , which took the largest chunk of the sought - after C - block according to The Wall Street Journal .
But was Verizon the real winner in this situation ?
Or was it actually Google ?
Google , after all , is the company that pushed for the FCC to adopt certain “ open ” requirements for the winner of the spectrum auction .
These included opening the network and any devices used on the network to third parties .
When Verizon heard that the FCC would implement a rule requiring the winner of the auction to use it within open network guidelines , Verizon sued the FCC to attempt to stop the auction from going forward .
“ Imposing any such requirements in the competitive wireless market would reduce the revenue the government will receive from the spectrum auction and limit the introduction of new and innovative wireless service , ” is what Verizon had to say at the time .
That , of course , turned out to be a preposterous statement as the spectrum auction went forward and garnered nearly double the amount of cash the government had hoped for from the bidding ( our coverage ) — most of that , coming from none other than Verizon .
( AT&T and Echostar won some smaller parts of the spectrum as well . )
Once Verizon knew the auction was going forward it clearly did not want to lose .
This made for an interesting situation given the talk that Google might have been placing a bid simply to make sure the minimum was reached for opening the C - block .
It appears , that may have been precisely what took place .
Google ended up with no licenses for any of the spectrum , but did get what it wanted :
An open spectrum .
Meanwhile , Verizon has control of the spectrum , but must do with it what it initially sued to stop , keep it open .
Of course , Verizon has changed its tune since that lawsuit and now seemingly favors open networks .
However , questions remain if this “ open ” talk is simply spin or a legitimate effort to help developers and consumers ( our coverage ) .
What Verizon ultimately does with the 700 Mhz spectrum should speak to its intentions .
Looking back on these events , history may judge it as ( if I can reconstitute a quote from Charles Baudelaire famously used in The Usual Suspects ) :
The greatest trick Google ever pulled , was convincing the world it was bidding to win the spectrum auction .
update : Google put up a short post on its Public Policy Blog weighing in on the matter ( they ca n’t say much due to the FCC ’s anti-collusion rules ) .
Basically , it reads as : Thanks everyone for playing !

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - A U.S. soldier who fought in Iraq before deserting and coming to Canada now faces deportation next month , but says he should n’t be returned to the United States to face “ unjust punishment ” .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Corey Glass , 25 , learned on Wednesday that his application to remain in Canada has been rejected and he now must willingly return to the United States by June 12 or be deported .
“ I do n’t think it is fair that I should be returned to the United States to face unjust punishment for doing what I felt morally obligated to do , ” Glass told reporters on Wednesday .
If he is returned to the United States , Glass , of Fairmount , Indiana , could face jail time .
He joined the National Guard in 2002 .
“ When I joined the National Guard , they told me the only way I would be in combat is if there were troops occupying the United States , ” he said .
But in 2005 , he was deployed to a U.S. base in Iraq , where he worked in military intelligence .
“ Through this job I had access to lots of information about what was happening on the ground in Iraq , ” he said .
“ Through what I saw , I realized innocent people were being killed unjustly . ”
He said he tried to quit the military , but his commander told him he was simply suffering from stress and needed downtime , he said .
He went home on leave and said he was not coming back .
“ I was told desertion is punishable by death , ” he said .
After searching the Internet , he found out about U.S. deserters in Canada .
He came to Toronto in 2006 and has lived in the city since .
His case is also important to the estimated several hundred other Iraq war deserters currently living in Canada , said Lee Zaslofsky , co-ordinator of the War Resisters Support Campaign .
“ I ’m disappointed in the government of Canada , which seems to be doing the dirty work of the American government in rounding up people that do n’t want to fight in George Bush ’s Iraq war , ” said Zaslofsky , who is himself a Vietnam War resister .
He called on Canadians to contact Prime Minister Stephen Harper , as well as Liberal opposition leader Stephane Dion and speak in support of Glass and others like him .
A spokeswoman for Citizenship and Immigration Canada said she cannot discuss individual cases because of privacy rules .
Nearly 16 years ago in these very pages , I wrote that " ' one - size - fits all ' rules for business ignore the reality of the market place . "
Today I 'm watching some broad rules evolve on individual decisions that are even worse .
Under the guise of protecting us from ourselves , the right and the left are becoming ever more aggressive in regulating behavior .
Much paternalist scrutiny has recently centered on personal economics , including calls to regulate subprime mortgages .

Zoo officials say the animal was easily sedated and captured A 29 - year - old male orangutan named Bruno escaped from his enclosure at Los Angeles Zoo on Saturday evening after making a hole in the wire fencing .
About 3,000 visitors were shepherded towards the front exits while Bruno roamed free for about 20 minutes .
Zoo staff said Bruno never managed to enter the public areas and was quickly sedated by his keepers .
" He was calm and responded well to the staff , " promotions co-ordinator Gina Dart said .
" He was never aggressive . "
Once out of his enclosure , instead of trying to flee , Bruno hid in an area behind his pen , where one of his keepers spotted him , the Los Angeles Times reported .
ABC
News quoted zoo director John Lewis as saying that Bruno was easily sedated because , like the other five orangutans at the facility , had been trained to allow his keepers to administer medicine : " Fortunately all of our great apes , the staff trained them to allow medical procedures , so the keeper actually put him through his behaviours , and he allowed her to hand inject him with anaesthetic and went right to sleep , " Mr Lewis quoted as saying .
" They carried him to his bedroom , and it was all over in about 20 minutes , " he added .
In December last year one man was killed and two were injured when a tiger escaped from its pen in San Francisco Zoo , an incident blamed on incorrect enclosure design .

What are these ?
May 2 , 2008  -- A Memphis high school principal , fed up with public displays of affection in the hallways , allegedly displayed a list of couples — including some who are gay — in the school , publicly outing the boys and violating their privacy , according to one of the students involved .
" I really feel that my personal privacy was invaded , " Nicholas , one of the young men who claims his sexuality was exposed without his approval by his principal , told ABC News ' Memphis affiliate Eyewitness News Everywhere .
" I mean , Principal Beasley called my mother and outted me to my mother ! "
" It was actually frightening , " Nicholas said of the incident , which occurred in Fall 2007 , " to see a list with my name on it where not just other teachers could see but students as well . "
Nicholas , an 11th grader at Hollis F. Price Middle College High School in Memphis , was allegedly named , along with his suspected boyfriend , 10th grader Andrew , on a list of couples posted by their principal , Daphne Beasley .
Beasley did not return calls made by ABCNEWS.com but according to a statement from the Memphis school district , while the principal was tired of the hallway hanky - panky , she did nothing wrong in alerting parents to the activity .
" The principal did not list any information other than students ' names on her personal call list , and she certainly did not specify the sexual orientation of any student , " said Van D. Turner , Jr. , associate general counsel of the Memphis City Schools Board of Education , in a statement provided to ABCNEWS.com .
" Additionally , the list was never posted publicly anywhere at the school . "
According to the statement , this " call list " was used by Beasley to " notify the parents of those children she knew to be involved romantically " after the school received " numerous complaints " of " explicit sexual behavior in public view . "
ACLU Threatens Legal Action
The case has been taken up by the leading civil liberties group in the United States .
" I really could n't believe that a principal would have done something like this , " said Christine Sun , the American Civil Liberties Union attorney handling the case after it was brought to her attention by Nicholas ' mother .
" The Constitution provides all of us with the right to privacy and the right to associate whomever we want to associate with , " said Sun .
" And by creating this list and intruding upon these students ' privacy without any reason to , she violated their constitutional rights . "
The ACLU claims in a letter to the Memphis City Schools dated April 29 that the principal requested over the school intercom system that all the teachers and staff provide her with the names of students who were a couple , " hetero or homo . "
What 's more , according to the ACLU , the list was not as confidential as the school district claims , but rather posted in full view of those who entered the principal 's office — including gossipy high school students .
" The list was in plain site of anyone who walked into the principal 's office , " said Sun , who said there were approximately 15 other couples on the list , including several more who were also gay .
" It 's our understanding that [ Nicholas and Andrew 's ] names , and the fact that they were a couple , quickly spread at the school . "
Sun , who told ABCNEWS.com that she believes the Memphis school district to be " homophobic , " said that Nicholas ' mother — who was " shocked " to hear that her son is gay — reported that Beasley said she " had a problem with homosexuality " and that " homosexuality will not be tolerated . "
ABC News does n't have the last names of the students , and the ACLU said both the boys and their parents declined to be interviewed for this story .
" It 's raised our concerns about how gay students are treated , " added Sun , who said that the ACLU will take legal action if they do not receive a response from the Memphis School District before May 9 .
The school board , meanwhile , is sticking to its stance .
" It is the position of the Memphis City Schools that he principal did act in an appropriate manner in order to correct a serious issue [ of public display of affection ] at the school and that Memphis City Schools has not subjected either of these students to discriminatory treatment , " said the school board 's Turner in the statement .
A formal response will be drafted before the ACLU 's deadline , Turner told ABCNEWS.com .
Seven years ago today LtU was born .
I find it incredible that we have been doing this for so long , that some of the earliest members are still here , and that some of the same topics are still going strong !
While the range of topics and general style of LtU remained fairly constant over the years , each year brought with it its own flavour .
The main reason for this was that LtU was always open to new members , and each contributing editor influenced the discussion according to his interests .
So how can one summarize year seven ?
I think that for Anton and me year seven will be remembered as the year of spam .
We have been fighting spam daily , and I fear that we will have to put in place more draconian measures on new users shortly .
Some of you probably saw a couple of spam messages that managed to get past us .
But let me assure you : this is a tiny fraction .
There are hundreds of new users that signed up only to post spam , with at least two or three new spammers signing up daily .
Since we try to accommodate new members , I am not deleting users that fail to comply with our request for real names or identifying personal information - and so detecting potential spammers before they begin posting spam is difficult and time consuming .
One reason why I posted fewer programming language related posts was that I was simply too busy fighting spam ...
This is a good opportunity to thank Anton again for all he does to keep LtU up and running ( his insightful and amusing posts I take for granted , you see ) .
Without his help in putting in place the technical infrastructure required for all the spam monitoring and control we would have drowned in spam long ago .
This is one reason ( aside from the fact that I was very busy with other things ) that year seven is ( still ) not the Year of the Wiki .
We put up a wiki , but decided that the integration of the wiki into LtU would require too much time , time both us could n't spend this year .
Spam came to LtU for the simple reason that LtU became too well known a site ...
In fact the second thing that happened to LtU this year is that the number of active members grew considerably .
This is , of course , very gratifying .
I still remember the early days , when LtU had three members , and we did n't know if between the three of us we can keep finding enough interesting material to keep the site alive .
As one might expect this meant that some topics that were discussed here many times came up for discussion again .
It is good to revisit these issues from time to time , but I fear that the rising volume of messages , and the number of new users , some of whom with less decorum than others , kept many old timers from engaging in these discussions , leading to some long threads that were not up to the usual quality of LtU discussions .
Since no one was there to object , some may have gotten the impression that these threads ( replete with ad hominem attacks , insults and language advocacy ) are acceptable on LtU .
I am partly to blame for not stepping in , but I just did n't have the time to follow all these discussions .
So let me take this opportunity to remind everyone that discussions of this type are not welcome by the LtU community , and suggest more recent members consult the LtU policy as well as the LtU spirit pages .
We discussed various forms of moderation and control in the past , and I still think the conclusion we reached - that is that the community should " police " itself - is the right one .
If you find the content or style objectionable , post about it ( in a separate thread , if needed ) .
I noticed that several of the LtU contributing editors began to post less and less .
While I think the items on the home page are
interesting and exciting , there are fewer new home page items each week than I 'd like .
One reason for this is that many prefer to post things on their own blogs , and a fair amount of LtU candidate material gets posted to places like programming.reddit.com .
While there are LtU members who prefer to keep the site restricted as much as possible to the discussion of published academic papers , my opinion is that if a regular member considers some project , site or presentation to be of interest to the LtU community , he should post about it here .
This is even truer when it comes to contributing editors , of course .
Contributing editors - do n't hesitate , contribute !
I remind everyone that we have some departments that are begging for stories , top among them the new departments devoted to Scala and Ruby .
It seems to me that LtU is in a state of transition .
We can fight to remain the LtU we all know and love - but this requires effort .
Or we can hope for the best , and see LtU turn into comp.lang.misc .
To make sure we do n't jump the shark , the community has to step up .
Both in terms of steering the conversation , and keeping threads from getting long and disorganized , and by posting new and interesting stuff !
This is a good opportunity to ask long time members to mentor new members , not just direct them to the getting started page :-) .
I implore old timers that are sitting back to engage in the conversation , and let us know what they are up to .
We miss you guys !
And most of all , I pray for spammers to just crawl back to where they came from .
The last wish , I know , is unlikely to happen .
The others I think are within our reach !
Happy birthday everyone !

I wrote before about the BBC and the Human Rights Watch reports on abuse by UN peace keepers in Congo , smuggling gold and drugs out of the country in exchange for weapons they gave to the rebels .
The UN decided that " in the absence of corroborative evidence " its investigators " could not substantiate the allegation " that Pakistani peacekeepers supplied weapons or ammunition to the militia .
The New York Times just published an article by Matthias Basanisi , the UN 's deputy chief investigator in Congo at that time .
He reveals nothing short but an orchestrated cover -up of the scandal :
I was the investigator in charge of the United Nations team that in 2006 looked into allegations of abuses by Pakistani peacekeepers in Congo and found them credible .
But the investigation was taken away from my team after we resisted what we saw as attempts to influence the outcome .
My fellow team members and I were appalled to see that the oversight office ’s final report was little short of a whitewash .
The reports we submitted to the office ’s senior management in 2006 included credible information from witnesses confirming illegal deals between Pakistani peacekeepers and warlords from the Front for National Integration , an ethnic militia group notorious for its cruelty even in such a brutal war .
We found corroborative information that senior officers of the Pakistani contingent secretly returned seized weapons to two warlords in exchange for gold , and that the Pakistani peacekeepers tipped off two warlords about plans by the United Nations peacekeeping force and the Congolese Army to arrest them .
And yet , much of the evidence we uncovered was excluded from the final report released last summer , including corroboration from the warlords themselves .

I wonder what is worse now : Trading weapons with warring fractions you are supposed to protect the people from , in exchange for gold and drugs you smuggle out of the country .
Or covering up the inspection report revealing this abuse ?
The Dixie Chicks backlash hits us almost as soon as we touch down on American soil .
Standing in line at Cincinnati airport , an immigration officer asks the purpose of our visit .
When we tell him we 're here to interview the Texan trio , he refrains from spitting on federal property .
But you can hear the sound of phlegm gathering in the back of his throat .
" They should string those girls up , " he snarls .
Before we know it , we 've been hauled off to have our bags searched and we miss our connecting flight to Memphis , where the Chicks are playing the following night .
Welcome to America .
When we belatedly arrive in Tennessee , several hours later , our taxi driver is similarly unimpressed with the 25 m - selling one - time saviours of American country music .
" Those girls need to learn to keep their mouths shut , " he says .
Ever since Natalie Maines , the Dixie Chicks ' lead singer , told a London audience they were " ashamed that the president of the United States of America is from Texas " , the group has found itself in the eye of a storm that has threatened to destroy their careers .
The comment , made last March during a concert at the Shepherd 's Bush Empire , three days before America and Britain went to war in Iraq , was applauded by the audience .
The American ambassador to Britain did n't appear overly offended and , after the show , asked to have his photograph taken with the trio .
But when a review of the concert in the Guardian , the only newspaper whose critic reported the comment , was picked up by a country - music website in Nashville , all hell broke lose .
Before you could say shock and awe , Clear Channel , which owns 1,200 radio stations in America and helped to fund Bush 's election campaign , had banned Dixie Chicks records from the airwaves " out of respect for our troops and our listeners " .
Cumulus Media , the second largest radio conglomerate , with 270 stations , also banned them , while right - wing press commentators had a field day denouncing them as traitors and dubbing the group " the Dixie Sluts " and " Saddam 's Angels " .
Six weeks earlier they had sung the national anthem at the Superbowl .
Now , public CD - burning parties were being held all over the south and mid-west in scenes unprecedented since the Beatles ' records suffered the same fate almost 40 years earlier , after John Lennon had suggested the group was bigger than Jesus .
In one town in Louisiana , a steamroller crushed piles of offending Dixie Chicks records .
Sales of their current album , Home , plummeted from 124,000 in the week the story broke to 33,000 , an inevitable result of their banishment from the airwaves .
Their number one country single , Travellin ' Soldier , also went into freefall down the charts .
And there were more sinister aspects to the backlash .
Death threats against Maines led to the need for 24 - hour armed protection .
Martie Maguire and Emily Robison , her fellow Chicks , stood by her in admirable solidarity and said that any one of them could easily have made the comment .
So Robison 's Texas ranch was trashed .
The obnoxiously gung - ho country singer Toby Keith ( who , in the wake of 9/11 , scored a country number one with an offensive record called Courtesy of the Red , White and Blue ( The Angry American ) , which threatened " we 'll put a boot in your ass , it 's the American way " , launched his own anti-Chicks crusade .
His shows now feature a backdrop depicting Maines and Saddam Hussein as lovers .
Another image has her face superimposed on the body of a toad .
In conservative country - music circles , Keith 's crude attacks have gone uncriticised .
But Maines faced a fresh backlash when she responded by turning up to a country music awards ceremony wearing a T - shirt bearing the slogan : " f.u.t.k . "
Less than two weeks before Maines fateful comment , tickets went on sale for the Dixie Chicks ' summer American tour .
A staggering $ 49 m was taken on day one , beating the previous record held by the Rolling Stones .
Like every date on the tour , when we caught consecutive shows in Memphis and Atlanta , they were sold out , despite some fans having returned their tickets in protest .
At several venues , demonstrations have been staged .
In Little Rock , Arkansas , a few days earlier , a local radio station handed out anti-Chicks T - shirts .
More ludicrously , the American Red Cross turned down the group 's offer of a $ 1 m donation from the tour proceeds because Bush is one of its patrons .
In Memphis , the audience is divided .
The merchandising counter is selling Free Natalie T - shirts and doing a brisk trade .
The road crew also sport them , after the phrase was coined by a DJ in Austin , Texas ( where they live ) , who had bravely come out in support .
But some fans are highly critical .
" Natalie made those statements later on after we bought the tickets , otherwise we would n't be here , " complained Rod Good , 44 , from Alexandria , Ohio .
Connie and Steve Vaughan , both 53 , from Atoka , Tennessee , turned up in matching American flag shirts .
" We want her to know we support the troops , " they said .
Yet the show - which is prefaced by Elvis Costello 's version of ( What 's So Funny ' Bout ) Peace , Love and Understanding - is well received , even when a song called Truth No 2 is accompanied by a video featuring Martin Luther King , Gandhi and Malcolm X and footage of civil - rights protests .
The film also shows archive footage of Nazi book burning before it ends with shots of the destruction of Dixie Chicks records and the on - screen messages : " SEEK THE TRUTH " and " TOLERANCE " .
Throughout the show , Maines sports a " Dare To Be Free " T - shirt , and it is lost on no one that we 're in the city where King was assassinated .
The following night we see the show again in Atlanta , Georgia , where neither of the city 's two country radio stations has played a Dixie Chicks song since March .
But when there are a handful of cat - calls from the audience , Maines responds feistily .
" If you 're booing that 's OK , because we love freedom of expression , " she tells them .
" But just remember .
We 've got your 65 dollars . "
Backstage before the show , the Chicks had been in similarly defiant mood .
In their initial shock at the backlash , Maines issued a qualified apology to Bush in which she said that whoever holds the office of president " should be treated with respect " .
Since then , her resolve has hardened .
As Trotsky once observed , the proletariat is radicalised by experience of the struggle .
And while many have abused and reviled the Chicks , to others they have become a cause célèbre .
Bruce Spingsteen was one of the first to post a message of support on his website .
Dolly Parton has also told her fans they should carry on buying Dixie Chicks records .
More significantly , political support has grown since early July , when the group 's English - born manager , Simon Renshaw , testified before a congressional committee looking into the future of the radio industry .
He revealed that his office had received death threats , and offered evidence that right - wing organisations had orchestrated the campaign .
He complained that the group 's rights under the first amendment had been abused , and that " artistic freedom , cultural enlightenment and political discourse " had been undermined .
Many agreed .
One committee member , Barbara Boxer , a Democratic senator from California , likened the corporate radio ban to Nazi Germany and the McCarthyite witch - hunts of the 1950s and called it " a chilling message to people that they ought to shut up " .
Reclined over a chair in a room marked " CHICKS LIVING ROOM " and with armed security posted outside the door , Maines is astonishingly upbeat about her ordeal .
" There was a point where I felt sick , " she admits .
" But now I feel proud and empowered .
I 'm glad it happened . "
Two days after the row erupted , Maines asked her fellow group members if they were mad at her .
" I said ' No , it really could have been any of us ' , " Maguire says .
" We were about to go to war , and before we went on that night we talked about how silly we felt having to go out and entertain when our hearts were so heavy with what was about to happen . "
Maines concedes that they are entertainers , not politicians .
" But that night it felt just too strange not to say anything .
It would have been trite not to acknowledge it .
To say something that was true and real but in a jokey manner was my way of dealing with it .
And I 'd rather it was a political reason that brought us down off the top of the charts than a musical one . "
" It 's changed us all for the better , " Robison adds .
Their solidarity is self - evidently genuine .
They are so in tune on the issue that they frequently finish each other 's sentences , and they screech " Oh my God ! " in unison when told of our experience in the immigration line .
" You 're just lucky you were n't French , " says Maines .
Their anger at Bush is now expressed in far stronger and more coherent terms than the original off - the - cuff comment .
" We were told the official White House quote on our ordeal , " Maines recalls .
" I thought it was going to be something empowering about the first amendment and our rights as American citizens .
I do n't know why I thought such an educated thing could have come out of there .
Instead it was , ' Their fans have spoken . ' "
" Which makes your mind go back to the death threats and the trashing of Emily 's ranch and the corporate banning , " says Maguire .
" So is the President condoning those things ? " Robison demands .
" He was asked about the end of the war in Iraq , and he said , ' Freedom is a beautiful thing and these people now have a right to speak and we 've given them that ' , " recalls Maines .
" It was everything he should have said when he was asked about us . "
One of the group 's first public responses to the radio ban was to pose nude on the cover of Entertainment Weekly with slogans such as " TRAITORS " and " SADDAM'S ANGELS " superimposed on their bodies .
" It deserved a strong response from us and we felt it had to be in your face , " Maguire says .
" The magazine wanted us standing in front of the American flag in our jeans and smiling for the cover .
And we thought no .
We had to hit them over the head with it and expose the absurdity of the things we were being called .
It 's made me realise our country has not progressed as far as I thought we had .
If this can happen to three white girls playing country music ... "
Robison picks up the thread : " They 've set this tone that they 're not to be questioned and if you do then you are unpatriotic .
That 's somehow gotten into the American psyche and that 's scary .
If you can't question your government then you are just mindless followers . "

The attack took place in the South Waziristan region , where tribal militants are based , Reuters news agency reported residents as saying .
The Pakistani state TV report said several missiles destroyed the house of a suspected militant leader .
Reuters reported the military saying seven militants were among the dead .
" Initial reports suggest militants were hiding there and seven of them were killed and several wounded , " an unnamed military official told the news agency .
A local tribesman said foreign militants were believed to be staying at the compound , in a village near Wana in South Waziristan .
" Militants have cordoned the blast site and are taking out bodies from the rubble , " the tribesman told AFP news agency .
" The missile has left only part of a boundary wall intact and turned the compound into a pile of debris , " he said .
War on militants
It was not clear who launched the strike .
A local tribesman , Rahim Khan , told the Associated Press that the missiles were fired from an unmanned drone aircraft .
US forces , operating in neighbouring Afghanistan , are believed to have been behind previous strikes in Pakistan 's border region .
In February , at least 12 people - including suspected militants - were killed in a missile attack on a house near the Afghan border .
A month earlier , a senior al - Qaeda leader , Abu Laith al - Libi , was killed in a strike in North Waziristan .
The US considers strikes in the tribal border region - the heartland of al - Qaeda and the Taleban - to be vital in its war against Islamist militancy .
However , the Pentagon seldom confirms them , since Pakistan publicly opposes any US strike on its territory .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden threatened the European Union with grave punishment on Wednesday over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad .

In an audio recording posted on the Internet , Bin Laden said the cartoons were part of a “ crusade ” in which he said the Catholic Pope Benedict was involved .
The message was released on the fifth anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
The cartoons were first published by the Danish daily Jyllands - Posten in September 2005 but a furor erupted only after other papers reprinted them in 2006 .
At least 50 people were killed in the protests against the publication of the cartoons , which Muslims say are an affront to Islam .
Newspapers which have reprinted the cartoons argue they are defending the right to media freedom .
Bin Laden ’s message was entitled “ The Response Will Be What You See , Not What You Hear ” , according to the password - protected Ekhlaas Web , which carries messages and statements from al Qaeda - affiliated groups around the world .
The banner message appeared in bright red , labeled “ urgent ” with plain Arabic text .
It carried no picture of the Saudi - born militant leader nor the insignia of al Qaeda ’s media arm As - Sahab , which usually releases his videos and audio tapes .
The message apparently is the first by bin Laden since November 29 when he urged European countries to end military participation with U.S. forces in the Afghan conflict .
The al Qaeda leader , blamed for the September 11 attacks on U.S. cities , issued a number of messages late last year after a hiatus of well over a year raised speculation that he might be dead or incapacitated .
Bin Laden , who is believed to be hiding in remote areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan , has tended to release messages to mark significant dates or events .
On September 7 , 2007 , bin Laden appeared in a videotape marking the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and said the United States remained vulnerable despite its economic and military power .
He then eulogized a September 11 hijacker in an al Qaeda tape that appeared on the anniversary date itself .
Later the same month bin Laden vowed to retaliate against Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf for the killing of a rebel cleric and a raid on his mosque .
Bin Laden is blamed for masterminding a series of attacks on U.S. targets in Africa and the Middle East in the early 1990s .
His wealthy family has disowned him and he has been stripped of his Saudi citizenship .
EAGLEVILLE , Pa. 
A local planning board has approved a proposal to build a $ 250 million visitor center and conference facilities on privately owned land in Valley Forge National Historical Park .
Opponents say the decision increases the risk of commercial development in other scenic and historic national parks .
The Planning Commission of Lower Providence Township , about 15 miles northwest of Philadelphia , voted unanimously late Wednesday in favor of the project , the American Revolution Center .
The center , on 78 acres inside the park , will include a 142,000 - square - foot museum commemorating the American War of Independence , a 145,000 - square - foot conference complex with as many as 99 rooms for overnight guests , and parking for 600 cars .
The center was conceived by the Valley Forge Historical Society to be the first national museum dedicated to the process of independence from Great Britain .
It would be close to where Gen. George Washington ’s troops camped during the winter of 1777 - 78 , the period commemorated by the park .
This was originally a pamphlet created and distributed by a Texas fundamentalist parents ' group , for the purposes of fighting " humanism " , which they see as a grave threat , claiming it removes values , preventing people from having a sense of right and wrong .
It can be found on the internet at
Personally , I would find it downright hilarous if it was n't for the fact that it is meant seriously .
It looks more like a paranoid rant to me , reminiscent of Scientology 's " everyone is out to get us " view .
Notice the careful mention later on of how humanism is " anti-American " .
Disguising Right - Wing Paranoia as Religion , anyone ?
WHAT IS HUMANISM ?
Below are some basic beliefs of Humanism :
HUMANISM :
(1) Humanist Manifesto s I and II , Prometheus Books , Buffalo , NY .
The Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies , Freeman Digest , Provo , Utah .
Humanism Is Referred to By Humanists
As A " Faith " And A " Religion " :
It was declared by the U. S. Supreme Court to be a religion .
Does this religion have effective Sunday Schools ?
Not exactly .
It has effective Monday through Friday schools .
That 's right !
Our public schools .
Does n't the Constitution require separation of church and state ?
Yes , indeed !
However , schools are rapidly changing from their traditional education to " change agents " for Humanism .
Who pays for it ?
You do !
HOW IS IT INDOCTRINATED ?
How could such complex issues of Humanism possibly be indoctrinated into vour child in elementary or high school ?
NOT BY ACCIDENT .
Under Lenin and Stalin , Pavlov developed the technique of conditioning dogs to bring about the desired results ; and from this beginning , Humanist psychologists and behavioural scientists successfully developed techniques which can GRADUALLY CHANGE YOUR CHILD'S CONSCIENCE , PERSONALITY , VALUES , AND BEHAVIOR .
An extensively used technique is Values Clarification which can be used to convince the child that he has the right to develop HIS OWN personal values , free from parental influence and authority , free from religious influences .
It can further convince the child that there are NO ABSOLUTES , NO RIGHT , NO WRONG .
The child is told that whatever value he chooses is right for him , as long as he uses their seven - step method .
To arrive at this values he is to :
Choose the value freely .
( Free from parental guidance and religious morals of right and wrong . )
Choose from alternatives .
( Choose from alternatives , including those DIFFERENT from parental values , such as to have premarital sex or not to have premarital sex . )
Choose after considering the consequence .
( What child can see far enough ahead to fully realize the adverse consequences of such a blind course of action ? )
Prize and cherish the value .
( Cherish the value because his OWN personal feelings have guided him to choose what is most importallt to him . )
Publicly confess or affirm the value .
( Be courageous enough to bravely take a stand and to influence peers . )
Act on the value .
( If he chooses premarital sex as his values he is to take action and carry it out . )
Act upon the value regularly .
( Live by the value consistently to establish it as his chosen behavior .
He does his own thing . )
Other Humanistic strategies for behavioral change are role playing , whereby the child acts out emotional situations such as conflicts with parents , also magic circles diaries , journals , public interviews , etc. Survival games and openended situations of " What would you do if ? " develop situation ethics , to say the least .
Whatever the strategy , the objective is basicallv the same -- to get your child to reveal his very heart , soul , mind , and even his subconscious thoughts before his peers and teacher .
In turn the peer group openly discusses his personal feelings and values and challenges him to defend his values and how he arrived at parental and religious influence .
A child 's only defense for some values may be that the parents that he loves hold the same values .
Thus , both the childs ' and parents ' values are subjected to open criticism from peers if his values differ from theirs .
Skilled " change agents " ( teachers ) can manipulate discussions to create peer pressure for conformity to non-Christian standards .
They have been known to intimidate slow conformers .
Values education frequently incorporates the above techniques and strategies with these issues :
Are these issues on which you want your child to choose his values , free from your influence , and free from any standard of RIGHT AND WRONG ?
Is n't it time to demand that Humanism be removed from our schools ?
Is n't it time for parents to demand that schools educate our children in academic skills instead of Humanistic values ?
HOW IS IT DISGUISED ?
Determining the extent of Humanism in the school requires some detective work .
Terms of designation are constantly changing .
It may be called values education , valuing skills , values clarification , self - awareness , decision making , self - acceptance , interpersonal relation skills , etc . Films , textbooks , and library books frequently contain Humanism and provide excellent opportunities for open " hollest " discussion which includes teacher pressure and peer pressure .
Curriculums often contain courses on Human ( Humanistic ? ) sexuality and family living , or sex education may be sandwiched in with reading , history , health , biology , etc .
Note that textbooks and teacher 's manuals are not essential for implementing Humanism .
More and more teachers are being trained with our tax dollars to be effective " change agents " and to sneak Humanism into the classroom .
They are encouraged to be " models " for desired behaviour changes .
Fortunately , some schools and teachers are resisting the thrust of Humanism .
However , some are rushing forward to create a new social order .
HOW CAN IT AFFECT YOUR CHILD ?
His conscience can be slowly remolded until ultimately he recognizes no need for God and parental values .
Parents are portrayed as unloving , uncaring , and inadequate .
Slowly , he is conditioned to view his parents with distrust and disrespect .
Alienation often results .
Serious emotional problems , serious moral problems , and serious spiritual problems often occur .
HOW CAN YOU HELP YOUR CHILD ?
Examine vour child 's library and textbooks for immoral , antifamily , and anti-American context .
Arrange to view films shown in classrooms .
Objectional material should be taken to the principal .
If he is unresponsive , go to the superintendent , and then to the school board members , one at a time .
If necessary , get the support of other parents to go to the entire school board .
Voice your views to the state school board , state legislators , governor , and U.S. congressmen .
Teach vour child to recognize Humanism and its techniques and strategies .
Humanism in the school is unconstitutional ; and your child , as well as the teacher , should be aware of his constitutional rights of separation of church and state .
President Carter signed into law the Hatch Amendment to the ESEA Acts .
This Amendment gives you and your child protection from invasion of privacy .
You may instruct your child to refuse to discuss orally or in writing , his personal feelings about his private life , social issues , or controversial issues .
Discussing personal feelings of a third person , such as Jane or John , is another deceptive invasion of privacy
You may assure your child that refusal to discuss his personal feelings is not a symptom of mental illness .
Role playing was developed for mental patients and criminals .
Your child should be aware that role playing , games involving ' What would you do if ...? " and games involvillg suicide and mercy killings can cause emotional trauma .
They should inform you when exposed to any Humanistic techniques or strategy .
Americans wondering why the government spent only $ 600,000 investigating the collapse of three WTC buildings on 9/11 ( compared to $ 6 million investigating President Clinton 's high jinks ) got their answer today .
The science of 9/11 was just not that complicated .
It was " liquids and gels " all the way down .
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) in cooperation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) announced the winners of the National Ground Zero Pancake Blowout Competition yesterday .
The Blowout contest proved the science behind the 9/11 Commission 's Report about why the buildings collapsed into their own footprints at free - fall speed .
And it did n't cost the government a red penny to conduct the necessary tests .
The answers came straight from two teams of high school science guys and gals - one from Iowa and the other from Oklahoma .
The contest rules were explained by the Grand Marshall , Professor Thomas Eager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , an engineer who originated the Pancake Theory .
According to Dr. Eagar in his testimony to the 9/11 Commission and repeated verbatim in the contest rules , the contestants were tasked to model the tragic collapse of the World Trade Center buildings , in which " upper floors pancaked down onto lower floors , causing a domino effect that left each building in ruins within ten seconds . "
Both winning teams produced neat piles of exploded and completely powdered pancake debris , drawing high praise from Dr. Eagar , and from science teachers all over the U.S.
One observer hailed the event as a turning point for American science education .
The experiments proved that science can indeed be used to explain past events , establishing causes and effects ; science is clearly not limited merely to studying how to avoid , or prepare for , future disasters .
This is a ground - breaking concept , according to Dr. Eagar - one he admitted had never occurred to him , personally , which explains why the concept is totally absent both from his own testimony and from the final Report of the 9/11 Commission .
All competing teams tried to model the collapse of WTC 1 , 2 and 7 using pancakes to represent the steel - and - cement floors .
To represent the steel infrastructure around the outside " wall " of each great pancake stack , the contestants placed long , thin bamboo sticks ; and the inner core was modeled using 47 bamboo sticks leading from the " sub - basement " to the roof .
The sticks , of course , served as pancake - separators , precisely modeling the functional office spaces between the floors in the three WTC buildings .
After carefully constructing their " tall stacks " according to specifications , contestants attempted to bring them down by igniting selected pancake " floors " with exploding jet fuel ( kerosene ) fires representing the points of contact where the hijacked airplanes entered the buildings at 500 miles per hour .
The 47 - storey WTC Building 7 posed a special problem because it was never hit by an airplane on 9/11 , yet it collapsed into its own footprint , too , and at free - fall speed ; moreover , it collapsed from the " bottom up " unlike WTC 1 & 2 , which collapsed from the " top down " .
As Dr. Eagar had explained patiently to the 9/11 Commission : WTC 7 is especially important .
Not only did WTC 7 inspire the Pancake Theory in the first place , it demonstrated convincingly that any alternative theories must be rejected as mere " speculation " .
Accordingly , contestants were instructed to ignore the obviously different circumstances surrounding the collapse of WTC 7 , and to bring down all three buildings in the exact same manner .
Two teams out of almost 300 contestants nationwide successfully demonstrated that a " tall stack " consisting of between 47 and 110 pancakes will always collapse on itself in a heap of dust when subjected to heat from kerosene fires positioned roughly 3 / 4 of the way up the stack .
What surprised most observers , the winning explosive mix of ingredients included whole wheat flour , buttermilk , soda ( for leavening ) , and two " special ingredients " in place of cooking oil - to be discussed below .
By contrast , pancakes made from fresh milk or sour milk cannot in principle blow something to smithereens ; and buckwheat or rye flour flapjacks blow apart nicely but never collapse at free - fall speed into their own footprints .
The day 's biggest duds , however , were ' cakes leavened with baking powder , which packs less than half the explosive power of bicarbonate of soda .
The two special ingredients used in place of cooking oil were " liquids and gels " collected from an interesting source - airports , complements of the war against the terrorists .
Under careful supervision by HAZMAT and TSA agents , the students mixed some confiscated " liquids and gels " together with the appropriate amounts of buttermilk , whole wheat flour , and bicarb soda .
KA - BLAM !
The day 's fiery climax was declared to be " a catastrophic success " by Dr. Christopher Musso , engineering marketing specialist and co-author , with Dr. Eagar , of the Pancake Theory .
It was Musso who originally suggested the contest as a means of providing a government - friendly , low - cost , yet valid and reliable test of the hard science that informs the 9/11 Commission Report .
Dem Tussle is Right Up GOP's Alley
" When you set out to take Vienna , " Napoleon famously advised , " take Vienna . "
That might be updated to : " If you 're going to bowl , bowl better than a 37 . "
That 's what Barack Obama scored when he set out to demonstrate he was just one of the guys at a Pennsylvania bowling alley recently .
He started with a gutter ball .
Hillary Clinton responded with an April Fools '
Day gag about deciding the nomination with a bowl - off .
" A bowling night .
Right here in Pennsylvania , " Clinton proposed .
" The winner take all .
I 'll even spot him two frames . "
" It is time for his campaign to get out of the gutter and allow all the pins to be counted .
I 'm prepared to play this game all the way to the 10th frame .
When this game is over , the American people will know that when that phone rings at 3 a.m. , they 'll have a president ready to bowl on Day One . "
The saddest part is that this was , without a doubt , the absolute funniest thing Hillary Clinton has ever said ( after , of course , " I believe you , Bill " ) .
Unfortunately , Obama missed an opportunity to explain that he was bowling so badly because he was under sniper fire .
Obama 's weaknesses do n't end with bowling , which may be why the Democratic Party - and many in the media - are obsessed with putting the Democratic contest to bed .
The press went into a tizzy over the fact that many Obama supporters now say they 'd vote for John McCain over Clinton should their candidate lose the nomination .
Likewise , a significant number of Clinton voters say it 's their gal or nothing .
My hunch is that this is , for the most part , nonsense .
Clinton and Obama supporters wo n't be voting Republican in a fit of spite come fall .
And while black voters might hold a serious grudge against Clinton if she were perceived to have " stolen " the nomination from Obama , it 's doubtful the rest of Obama 's base - basically the Howard Dean vote - would abandon their eight years of biblical fury toward the GOP and the war just so they could vote for a guy who is to Bush 's right on foreign policy at the expense of the first female president of the United States .
No , the real reason top Democrats are desperate to put an end to this thing might be because Clinton is validating all sorts of things Republicans will say about Obama if he 's the nominee .
For example , she said Obama 's not ready to be president " on Day One " or receive emergency 3 a.m. phone calls on Night One .
And when the Jeremiah Wright controversy was winding down , Clinton tried to reignite the firestorm by saying that Obama 's choice of ministers is fair game .
This is a wonderful boon to Republicans .
Clinton 's criticisms of Obama 's foreign - policy inexperience and his association with Wright are both perfectly legitimate .
But if she were n't making them , Democrats ( and much of the press ) would denounce Republicans for saying the same things .
If Obama had secured the nomination by now , the Democrats would surely be labeling any criticism over Jeremiah Wright as unfair , racist " swift - boating . "
That 's hard to do when Bill and Hillary Clinton are making this criticism bipartisan .
As The New York Times ' David Brooks has argued , the Clinton - Obama smackdown is destined to churn up a lot of identity - politics bile and reduce this contest to a race between the Very Liberal Woman and the Even More Liberal Black Guy .
And the more Obama is seen as the lefty black candidate rather than the Pepsi candidate - i.e. a politician for a New Generation - the easier it will be for McCain to run as a truly bipartisan figure .
The old adage that if you 're going to try to kill the king , you 'd better succeed in killing him , applies to queens too .
Obama failed to slay her Royal Highness Hillary , and now she 's gunning for him .
The problem is that she can't kill Obama either .
And while one still has to bet on the Republicans losing in ' 08 , the possibility that the Democratic nominee will be fatally wounded is improving with each passing day .

courtesty of Iov de Beholther FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 27 , 2008
San Francisco , CA The Billboard Liberation Front today announced a major new advertising improvement campaign executed on behalf of clients AT&T and the National Security Agency .
Focusing on billboards in the San Francisco area , this improvement action is designed to promote and celebrate the innovative collaboration of these two global communications giants .
“ This campaign is an extraordinary rendition of a public - private partnership , ” observed BLF spokesperson Blank DeCoverly .
“ These two titans of telecom have a long and intimate relationship , dating back to the age of the telegraph .
In these dark days of Terrorism , that should be a comfort to every law - abiding citizen with nothing to hide . ”
AT&T initially downplayed its heroic efforts in the War on Terror , preferring to serve in silence behind the scenes .
“ But then we realized we had a PR win on our hands , ” noted AT&T V.P. of Homeland Security James Croppy .
“ Not only were we helping NSA cut through the cumbersome red tape of the FISA system , we were also helping our customers by handing over their e-mails and phone records to the government .
Modern life is so hectic – who has time to cc the feds on every message ?
It ’s a great example of how we anticipate our customers ’ needs and act on them .
And , it should be pointed out , we offered this service free of charge . ”
Commenting on the action , and responding to questions about pending privacy litigation and the stalled Congressional effort to shield the telecoms from these lawsuits , NSA spokesperson [ REDACTED ] remarked : “ [ REDACTED ] we [ REDACTED ] condone [ REDACTED ] warrantless [ REDACTED ] , [ REDACTED ] SIGINT intercepts , [ REDACTED ] torture [ REDACTED ] information retrieval by [ REDACTED ] means necessary . ”
“ It ’s a win - win - win situation , ” noted the BLF ’s DeCoverly .
“ NSA gets the data it needs to keep America safe , telecom customers get free services , and AT&T makes a fortune .
That kind of cooperation between the public and private sectors should serve as a model to all of us , and a harbinger of things to come . ”
Come see the improvement at 14th St. and Valencia St. in San Francisco The BLF ( www.billboardliberation.com) has been improving outdoor advertising since 1977 .
Prior campaigns have included work for Exxon , R.J. Reynolds , and Apple Computers .
AT&T ( www.att.com) is America ’s favorite telecommunications trust .
Based in San Antonio , Texas , it has over 300,000 employees and annual revenues of $ 117 Billion .
NSA ( www.nsa.gov) is the largest intelligence organization in the world .
Headquartered at Fort Meade , Maryland , its budget , personnel , products , and services are all classified .

At the passing of the 25th anniversary of the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut , Lebanon  the first large suicide bombing to target Americans  the time is right to ask the perennial question : has the Bush administration ’s “ war on terror ” since 9/11 made Americans safer ?
Although the Bush administration regularly boasts that its war on terror has been effective because no large terrorists attacks on U.S. soil have occurred since 9/11 , such terrorism in North America has historically been a rare event .
It ’s like bragging that efforts to prevent lightning strikes have succeeded because a dwelling has not been struck or burned .
In fact , 9/11 was shocking to Americans not only because of the magnitude of the casualties , but because North America had seen very little terrorism coming from abroad .
The last major international terrorist attack on U.S. soil was eight years before , in 1993 ( also on the World Trade Center ) .
Predictions of terrorist attacks are hard to make , but the dramatic surge in suicide bombings overseas since the Bush administration ’s war on terror began should increase our worries that another major attack could occur in the American homeland .
According to data from U.S. government terrorism experts , which were reported in the Washington Post , in 2000 , the year before the war on terror began , 37 suicide attacks occurred worldwide .
Since 9/11 , the total climbed steadily to several hundred attacks in each of 2005 and 2006 and then exploded to a whopping 658 attacks in 2007 .
What ’s more , the attacks have occurred in dozens of countries on five continents .
Yet according to U.S. intelligence officials , two - thirds of all suicide attacks since 1983 have targeted U.S. policy goals .
In other words , the war has been disastrously counterproductive .
Although the American homeland has been fairly safe since 9/11 , suicide attacks against U.S. facilities overseas , such as embassies and military assets , and allies have skyrocketed .
So the Bush administration ’s bragging that its war on terror has made Americans safer is ludicrous .
In fact , the administration ’s war on terror has played right into Osama bin Laden ’s hands .
A common strategy of terrorists is to strike the stronger aggressor , hope for an overreaction , and thus gain zealous recruits and funding for the terrorists ’ cause .
Instead of using intelligence , law enforcement , and limited military and covert action in the shadows to capture or kill terrorists in a low - key way after 9/11 , the administration ’s highly publicized cowboy invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq were overreactions that must have put a smile on bin Laden ’s face .
With a tin ear for why bin Laden was attacking the United States in the first place  the superpower ’s military presence and policy of political meddling in Muslim lands  the Bush administration has further inflamed Islamist radicals worldwide with more of the same .
That two - thirds of suicide attacks since 1983 have targeted U.S. policy goals is a euphemistic way of saying that the U.S. government is largely responsible for the problem of anti-U.S. terrorism .
The Bush administration has vehemently and publicly denied what the empirical data point to by blaming anti-U.S. terrorist attacks on hatred of American freedoms .
Polls taken in Islamic countries counter this viewpoint .
The American people , as if supporting their local sports team against a rival , would prefer to buy into this administration ’s Tarzan - like foreign policy ( “ America good ; others bad ” ) .
Instead , we should be engaging in the more difficult , soul - searching task of discovering the root causes of anti-U.S. terrorism .
Americans could continue to give the benefit of the doubt to their government ’s aggressive foreign policies in the Middle East , during both Democratic and Republican administrations , but that would be a delusional and dangerous choice .
Titanic search was Cold War cover story for secret mission to find nuclear subs
A mission to find the lost wreck of the Titanic was actually a cover story for inspecting the wrecks of two nuclear submarines , the man who discovered the famous liner has revealed .
Dr Bob Ballard led a team in 1985 that pinpointed the wreckage of the enormous ship 73 years after it sank in the Atlantic .
But he almost did n't succeed after his top secret mission to find two Cold War subs left him with just 12 days to find the Titanic .
The United States Navy lost two submarines during the 1960s - the USS Thresher and USS Scorpion - which had more than 200 men on board .
The Titanic leaves Southampton on its maiden voyage in 1912 .
Dr Ballard found the wreck in 1985
Officials feared at least one of them had been sunk by the USSR .
When Dr Ballard approached the Navy for funding to find the Titanic using his robotic submarine craft , they asked him to discover the submarines first .
" I could n't tell anybody , " the oceanographer said .
" There was a lot of pressure on me .
It was a secret mission .
I felt it was a fair exchange for getting a chance to look for the Titanic . "
He added : " We handed the data to the experts .
They never told us what they concluded – our job was to collect the data .
I can only talk about it now because it has been declassified . "
The USS Scorpion was lost in 1968
The USS Thresher ( SSN - 593 ) was the lead ship of her class of nuclear - powered attack submarines .
She was lost during deep - sea diving tests in 1963 after a high - pressure pipe blew causing the vessel to lose power and implode as it sank .
However , the USS Scorpion disappeared in 1968 amid speculation that it was sunk by Soviet forces .
Dr Ballard mapped both submarine wrecks using his newly developed underwater robot craft .
He concluded that the most likely cause of the Scorpion 's destruction was being hit by a rogue torpedo it had fired itself .
Investigating the wrecks gave Dr Ballard the idea of finding a trail of debris that would lead him to the Titanic .
Both the Thresher and Scorpion had both broken into thousands of pieces .
He criss - crossed the North Atlantic seabed and eventually found a debris trail that led him to the luxury liner 's final resting - place .
He found the Titanic split in two but had little time to explore further .
It was not until he returned to the site in 1986 that he was able to make a detailed study .
Oops !
According to a law professor at George Washington University , all patent judges appointed after the year 2000 have been done so unconstitutionally , making thousands of patent rulings made by said judges null and void .
This will have ramifications on patents worth billions and billions of dollars , and it's not clear exactly what 's going to happen .
But the Justice Department has already all but conceded that Professor Duffy is right .
Given the opportunity to dispute him in a December appeals court filing , government lawyers said only that they were at work on a legislative solution .
They did warn that the impact of Professor Duffy 's discovery could be cataclysmic for the patent world , casting " a cloud over many thousands of board decisions " and " unsettling the expectations of patent holders and licensees across the nation . "
But they did not say Professor Duffy was wrong .
If it was a legislative mistake , it may turn out to be a big one .
The patent court hears appeals from people and companies whose patent applications were turned down by patent examiners , and it decides disputes over who invented something first .
There is often a lot of money involved .
The problem Professor Duffy identified at least arguably invalidates every decision of the patent court decided by a three - judge panel that included at least one judge appointed after March 2000 .
Blitzer on defense : CNN had ' pretty strong ' anti-war coverage David Edwards and Muriel Kane

From the point of view of a network anchor like CNN's Wolf Blitzer , " one of the most provocative allegations " in former White House press secretary Scott McClellan 's new book is his assertion that " those of us in the news media who cover the president " were " too deferential to the White House " during the run-up to the Iraq war .
Blitzer strongly defended CNN 's pre-war reporting , pointing out that he had frequently interviewed people like Scott Ritter , who made the case that there was no evidence for Iraqi possession of WMD's .
" I think we were pretty strong , " Blitzer stated , " but certainly with hindsight , we could have done an even better job .
There were a lot of things missing in our coverage .
... I think we asked the tough questions , but we could have done better . "
Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post pointed out to Blitzer that " anti-war voiced had limited access , it seemed , to the airwaves , while administration officials were on every day . "
" We had a reporter whose sole job ... was to cover the anti-war activists ... almost on a daily basis , " Blitzer insisted in response .
It appears that CNN's Maria Hinajosa did provide extensive coverage of the anti-war protests in February and March of 2003 , along with brief soundbites featuring mostly unidentified demonstrators .
However , there were relatively few studio interviews with anti-war figures , and even those did not necessary explore their arguments against the war .
Blitzer also played a clip from The Early Show in which two out of three network anchors who were asked about McClellan 's criticisms were quick to disagree .
" I think that the media did a pretty good job , " insisted ABC 's Charles Gibson .
" I think it 's convenient now to blame the media . "
NBC 's Brian Williams claimed that the media were merely reflecting a national desire for war , saying , " People have to remember the post - 9/11 era , and how that felt and what the president felt he was empowered to do . "
Only CBS 's Katie Couric was prepared to call it " one of the most embarrassing chapters in American journalism . "
She added , " I think there was a sense of pressure from corporations who own where we work , and from the government itself , to really squash any kind of dissent . "
CNN correspondent Jessica Yellin expressed much the same sentiments as Couric on Wednesday evening , when she stated on Anderson Cooper 360 , " I think the press corps dropped the ball at the beginning .
When the lead - up to the war began , the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives , frankly , to make sure that this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president 's high approval ratings . "
Blogger Glenn Greenwald remarked tartly of the Early Show exchange , " Perish the thought that journalists should be adversarial to our political officials , challenge what they say or point out when they 're lying .
Instead , their job is merely to pose polite questions , let political officials say what they want in response , and then go home -- just as Charlie Gibson said . "
Greenwald also noted that these questions about pre-war news coverage come the wake of the recent revelation that retired officers who provided military analysis for the networks were part of an illegal Pentagon propaganda campaign , a story that the networks themselves have barely acknowledged .

A man walked into a bank in New York City one day and asked for the loan officer .
He told the loan officer that he was going to Philippines on business for two weeks and needed to borrow $ 5,000 .
The bank officer told him that the bank would need some form of security for the loan .
Then the man handed over the keys to a new Ferrari parked on the street in front of the bank .
He produced the title and everything checked out The loan officer agreed to accept the car as collateral for the loan .
The bank ’s president and its officers all enjoyed a good laugh at the guy for using a $ 250,000 Ferrari as collateral against a $ 5,000 loan .
An employee of the bank then drove the Ferrari into the bank ’s underground garage and parked it there .
Two weeks later , the guy returned , repaid the $ 5,000 and the interest , which came to $ 15.41 .
The loan officer said , “ Sir , we are very happy to have had and this transaction has worked out very nicely , but we are a little puzzled .
While you were away , we checked you out and found that you are a multi millionaire .
What puzzles us is , why would you bother to borrow “ $ 5,000 ” .
The millionaire replied : “ Where else in New York City can I park my car for $ 15.41 and expect it to be there when I return ”
Well thats how the rich stay rich , they know a lot more about Money Management .
All the millionaires I have met in my life were penny wise .
Look after your cents and the Dollars will look after themselves .

' You Get Careless ' : Obama Blames Clinton RFK Quip on Stress of Long Campaign Obama says he accepts Clinton explanation of controversial comment .
May 24 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama gives Hillary Clinton the benefit of the doubt that she had no hidden meaning when she invoked the assassination of Bobby Kennedy as an explanation for remaining in the Democratic presidential race .
" I have learned that when you are campaigning for as many months as Sen. Clinton and I have been campaigning , " he told the Puerto Rico radio station Isla , " sometimes you get careless in terms of the statements that you make .
And I think that is what happened here .
" Sen . Clinton says that she did not intend any offense by it , " he added , " and I would take her at her word on that . "
Clinton 's remarks to the editorial board at the Argus Leader in South Dakota Friday struck some nerves partly because it came in the wake of Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy 's health problems and because of longstanding concerns about Obama 's security .
" People have been trying to push me out of this ever since Iowa , " Clinton said Friday .
" I find it curious because it is unprecedented in history .
I do n't understand it .
" You know , my husband did n't wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary sometime in the middle of June .
Right ? " she added later in the conversation .
" We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California .
You know , I just -- I do n't understand it . "
The remarks initially prompted a less - gracious response from the Obama campaign Friday .
Campaign spokesman Bill Burton said the remarks were " unfortunate . "
Clinton soon apologized , saying she meant no offense .
She was backed up by a supporter , Robert Kennedy , Jr. who said in a statement : " It is clear from the context that Hillary was invoking a familiar political circumstance in order to support her decision to stay in the race through June . "
Today , the Rev. Al Sharpton talked to Clinton about her remarks and gave her the benefit of the doubt .
" I do n't believe that anyone is dumb enough to suggest that something happen to Sen. Obama , " Sharpton said .
But ABC
News political analyst Matthew Dowd , former chief strategist for George Bush 's 2004 campaign , told ABC News Radio that Clinton 's remark was a huge political misstep .
" This , to me , is one of the worst gaffes in the course of this campaign , " he said .
" It 's going to hurt her , and I think it 's gonna really hurt her with a lot of her supporters that are gonna basically say , ' Come on , enough 's enough ; it 's time to go in this race . '
" If there were any conversations [ about Clinton as an Obama running mate ] , or if there were any plans for conversations , " Dowd added , " my guess is that 's gonna be put way on hold .
If I were the Obama folks , I 'd be seriously concerned about having her on a ticket with just the kind of things she says . "
Today , as Clinton campaigned in Puerto Rico , she moved on to other subjects .
Obama also spent his day campaigning in Puerto Rico , where he held a rally at La Plaza del Quinto Centenario in advance of next Sunday 's primary .
" If we do well in Puerto Rico , " he told the cheering crowd , " there 's no reason I wo n't be announcing I 'm the Democratic nominee for president . "
Obama added that he thought his campaign was " on the brink of winning the Democratic nomination . "

Today the RSA security conference sent out an announcement detailing the rules of engagement for press covering the event ( which begins April 7 in San Francisco ) .
At the bottom of the e-mail is a message noting that in accordance with an agreement the conference made with former Vice President Al Gore , press will not be allowed to attend his keynote presentation at the conference .
Video recordings , broadcasts and photography are also prohibited .
Press protestations are becoming a habit of Gore's .
When he gave his now - famous global warming slide presentation at the TED conference in 2006 ( Technology , Entertainment and Design ) I tried to approach him after the presentation to ask a question and was thwarted by his aggressive spokesman who planted himself between me and the former v.p. and griped that I 'd been allowed to attend the presentation .
He said the talk was supposed to have been off - limits to press ( although the conference organizers never mentioned this to me , and no one tried to prevent me from entering the auditorium , although my badge clearly indicated I was press ) .
Gore 's spokesman took down my name and affiliation and warned that I was n't to write anything about the event .
Gore , whose speaker fee is reportedly $ 100,000 , spoke again at TED this year , which I wrote about for Wired 's Epicenter blog .
There were no restrictions on press covering that talk other than regarding photos .
The conference wanted press to use only official photos provided by TED .
Last year the Smoking Gun published a copy of Gore 's speaker 's contract , which stipulates that all press are to be barred from his appearances and that the conditions of the contract cannot be disclosed to anyone .
The contract refers to Gore throughout as Vice President Gore , rather than former vice president .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. airlines have raised fares , added new fees and surcharges , cut jobs and reduced services -- and still find themselves running out of options to counter record fuel prices threatening their survival .

Even mergers , long considered an integral component to the airlines ’ long - term survival , seem less likely now than they did a few months ago .
While Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N has agreed to acquire Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N , merging may not be an option for other carriers as cash becomes king in a battle for survival .
“ Even at current oil levels of $ 130 a barrel , the airlines are involved in a massive survival game , ” said Julius Maldutis , president of consulting firm Aviation Dynamics .
Seven small airlines have filed for bankruptcy or stopped operating in the past five months and , if oil prices do not ease by the end of the summer , Maldutis said several network carriers could file for bankruptcy protection by the autumn .
“ You are not going to file for bankruptcy when you are down to a couple of hundred million ( dollars ) in cash -- you are going to file for bankruptcy when you have still got a billion and a half or so if you are going to hopefully survive operationally , ” Maldutis said .
Major U.S. airlines have raised round - trip fares by up to $ 60 over the past few days as they struggle with oil prices that on Tuesday continued to trade around $ 129 a barrel , roughly double where they were a year ago .
Analysts expect the legacy carriers to get through the summer season -- bookings remain reasonably strong -- but if oil prices do not fall by early autumn , some network airlines could face major decisions involving capacity cuts or bankruptcy protection .
“ I think bankruptcy protection is a very high probability at these oil price levels for a few carriers within the domestic arena , ” said Brian Nelson , equity analyst at Morningstar .
“ Ideally , this industry needs a liquidation .
It needs consolidation . ”
Even James
May , chief executive of top U.S. airline lobbying group , the Air Transport Association , has forecast more airline bankruptcies if oil prices do not retreat .
“ No one is exempt from the threat , ” May said in an interview with Reuters last week , adding that capacity cuts could reach 20 percent and affect dozens of cities , possibly triggering more calls in Congress to re-regulate the airline industry .
GOD - GIVEN RIGHT
The latest air fare increase is the 13th successful rise in 17 attempts by the major airlines since December 20 , according to Tom Parsons , chief executive of Bestfares.com , an Internet travel Web site .
“ A lot of people have a feeling that one of their God - given rights in the United States is to have cheap air fares -- that ’s certainly going to have to change , ” said Rick Seaney , CEO of airline ticket research site FareCompare.com .
“ People that were used to flying coast to coast for $ 250 round trip probably are looking at $ 500 round trip for leisure travel and a business person is probably looking at $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 -- that ’s where we are heading . ”
Network carriers have announced other measures to counter high fuel prices and a weak U.S. economy in recent months .
American Airlines , owned by AMR Corp AMR.N , said last week it will cut thousands of jobs and reduce capacity .
American , the world ’s largest airline by traffic , also said it plans to charge $ 15 for many passengers ’ first checked bag , an unprecedented move by a major U.S. airline .
AMR Corp CEO Gerard Arpey said the airline industry as it is constituted today was simply not built to withstand oil prices at $ 125 a barrel .
Goldman Sachs said earlier this month it expects U.S. crude to average $ 141 a barrel in the second half of 2008 and said oil could even shoot up to $ 200 within the next two years as part of a “ super spike . ”
Delta unveiled plans in March to cut 2,000 jobs and scale back flights and UAL Corp UAUA.O , parent of United Airlines , has said it will shrink its fleet up to 4 percent this year .
Some analysts say the major airlines have just about run out of options , but Steve Lott , a Washington - based spokesman for the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , a trade group for international airlines , said airlines will continue to find ways to become more efficient .
“ The low - hanging fruit has already been picked , so airlines are forced to look deeper into their operations and further up the tree to see what else they can cut , ” said Lott .
“ However , we ca n’t give up ... because there is the possibility that airlines will see deep financial problems so we need to keep looking for further efficiencies and turn over every rock . ”
Seaney of FareCompare.com .
believes that , if oil prices do not come down , the U.S. government may have to help the major airlines , just as it did following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
“ The government is going to end up having to do something , ” said Seaney .
“ The airlines are at the end of their rope . ”
The twentieth century is hardly behind us but already its quarrels and its achievements , its ideals and its fears are slipping into the obscurity of mis-memory .
In the West we have made haste to dispense whenever possible with the economic , intellectual , and institutional baggage of the twentieth century and encouraged others to do likewise .
In the wake of 1989 , with boundless confidence and insufficient reflection , we put the twentieth century behind us and strode boldly into its successor swaddled in self - serving half - truths : the triumph of the West , the end of History , the unipolar American moment , the ineluctable march of globalization and the free market .
The belief that that was then and this is now embraced much more than just the defunct dogmas andinstitutions of cold war–era communism .
During the Nineties , and again in the wake of September 11 , 2001 , I was struck more than once by a perverse contemporary insistence on not understanding the context of our present dilemmas , at home and abroad ; on not listening with greater care to some of the wiser heads of earlier decades ; on seeking actively to forget rather than remember , to deny continuity and proclaim novelty on every possible occasion .
We have become stridently insistent that the past has little of interest to teach us .
Ours , we assert , is a new world ; its risks and opportunities are without precedent .
Perhaps this is not surprising .
The recent past is the hardest to know and understand .
Moreover , the world really has undergone a remarkable transformation since 1989 and such transformations are always unsettling for those who remember how things were before .
In the decades following the French Revolution , the douceur de vivre of the vanished ancien régime was much regretted by older commentators .
A century later , evocations and memoirs of pre–Word War I Europe typically depicted ( and still depict ) a lost civilization , a world whose illusions had quite literally been blown apart : “ Never such innocence again . ”
1
But there is a difference .
Contemporaries might have regretted the world before the French Revolution .
But they had not forgotten it .
For much of the nineteenth century Europeans remained obsessed with the causes and meaning of the upheavals that began in 1789 .
The political and philosophical debates of the Enlightenment had not been consumed in the fires of revolution .
On the contrary , the Revolution and its consequences were widely attributed to that same Enlightenment which thus emerged — for friend and foe alike — as the acknowledged source of the political dogmas and social programs of the century that followed .
In a similar vein , while everyone after 1918 agreed that things would never be the same again , the particular shape that a postwar world should take was everywhere conceived and contested in the long shadow of nineteenth - century experience and thought .
Neoclassical economics , liberalism , Marxism ( and its Communist stepchild ) , “ revolution , ” the bourgeoisie and the proletariat , imperialism , and “ industrialism ” — the building blocks of the twentieth - century political world — were all nineteenth - century artifacts .
Even those who , along with Virginia Woolf , believed that “ on or about December 1910 , human character …
The hill that Hillary Rodham Clinton must climb to beat Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination will grow a little steeper on Monday , as it has most days lately .
Margarett Campbell , a Montana state legislator , plans to declare her support for Senator Obama , of Illinois .
She becomes the 69th superdelegate he has picked up since the Feb. 5 coast - to - coast string of primary elections and caucus votes .
( Note : After this column was published , Ms. Campbell said she would be remaining neutral , citing state party rules that prevent its members from endorsing a candidate during a contested primary . )
In the same period , Senator Clinton , of New York , has seen a net loss of two superdelegates , according to figures from the Obama campaign that Clinton aides do not dispute .
That erosion may dim Mrs. Clinton ’s remaining hopes even more than internal campaign turmoil , which led to the ouster on Sunday of the campaign ’s chief strategist , Mark Penn .
Trailing by more than 160 pledged delegates  those chosen in state primaries or caucuses  Mrs. Clinton has counted on superdelegates to help her overtake Mr. Obama with a late surge before the party ’s convention in August .
The party ’s rules for proportional allocation make it highly difficult for her to erase Mr. Obama ’s pledged delegate lead , even if she sweeps the final 10 contests .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) -
Thou shall not pollute the Earth .
Thou shall beware genetic manipulation .
Modern times bring with them modern sins .
So the Vatican has told the faithful that they should be aware of “ new ” sins such as causing environmental blight .

The guidance came at the weekend when Archbishop Gianfranco Girotti , the Vatican ’s number two man in the sometimes murky area of sins and penance , spoke of modern evils .
Asked what he believed were today ’s “ new sins , ” he told the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the greatest danger zone for the modern soul was the largely uncharted world of bioethics .
“ ( Within bioethics ) there are areas where we absolutely must denounce some violations of the fundamental rights of human nature through experiments and genetic manipulation whose outcome is difficult to predict and control , ” he said .
The Vatican opposes stem cell research that involves destruction of embryos and has warned against the prospect of human cloning .
Girotti , in an interview headlined “ New Forms of Social Sin , ” also listed “ ecological ” offences as modern evils .
In recent months , Pope Benedict has made several strong appeals for the protection of the environment , saying issues such as climate change had become gravely important for the entire human race .
Under Benedict and his predecessor John Paul , the Vatican has become progressively “ green ” .
It has installed photovoltaic cells on buildings to produce electricity and hosted a scientific conference to discuss the ramifications of global warming and climate change , widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels .
Girotti , who is number two in the Vatican “ Apostolic Penitentiary , ” which deals with matter of conscience , also listed drug trafficking and social and economic injustices as modern sins .
But Girotti also bemoaned that fewer and fewer Catholics go to confession at all .
He pointed to a study by Milan ’s Catholic University that showed that up to 60 percent of Catholic faithful in Italy stopped going to confession .
In the sacrament of Penance , Catholics confess their sins to a priest who absolves them in God ’s name .
But the same study by the Catholic University showed that 30 percent of Italian Catholics believed that there was no need for a priest to be God ’s intermediary and 20 percent felt uncomfortable talking about their sins to another person .
THE classified ad caught Ilse Ackerman ’s eye : “ Lincoln Heights Fixer - Upper . Artist Vision Required .
On cul - de- sac . ”
No address was listed .
Intrigued -- and determined -- she and husband Meeno Peluce drove to every cul - de-sac in the area in search of “ For Sale by Owner ” signs .
When the couple finally saw the 1926 house -- atop a steep , winding dirt road on the outskirts of downtown Los Angeles -- they found a condemned structure .
The backyard featured a discarded black Naugahyde couch and some yucca plants .
Everything else was dead .
Ackerman and Peluce , however , were not deterred .
“ We did n’t see it as a wreck , ” Ackerman remembers .
“ It always looked like it does in our minds . ”
In their minds , they saw a magical outdoor space for their growing family .
After six years of the couple ’s planting , transplanting , building and tending , visitors can see it too : a wild jungle of blooming Pride of Madeira , cascading white roses , flowering bougainvillea reaching toward the sky .
Thriving vegetable gardens are filled with chard , squash , tomatoes , basil and sunflowers , some bursting from simple bales of hay and compost with eye - popping color .
Then there are the animals of Skyfarm , as the couple has dubbed their home .
Two dogs , three cats , one tortoise .
A couple of cockatiels in an aviary , six chickens in a coop , a pet squirrel with the Spanish name Quince -- “ because he is the 15th animal , ” Peluce says .
And that ’s not counting the 60,000 to 90,000 bees in three hives kept by Ackerman , a sculptor and former art teacher turned amateur beekeeper .
For her , Skyfarm is where her creative energy takes flight .
For Peluce , a professional photographer , it is his “ decompression chamber ” -- a country escape in the heart of urban L.A .
At the time Ackerman saw the classified ad , the couple was living in a loft at the Brewery industrial arts complex near downtown and were looking for an affordable house with more room .
Ackerman , a New England native , pined for a garden .
They hired an inspector to look at the Lincoln Heights house , and his assessment was grim .
“ He assumed it was a tear - down , ” Peluce says .
“ He also told me the house was ‘ a marriage breaker . ’
But for us , it was just another adventure . ”
They purchased the property , their first home , in October , and moved in by December .
The house was barely inhabitable , with holes in the wall , buckled floors and no hot water .
Enough debris had been dumped on the property to fill the equivalent of eight railroad cars .
Undaunted , the couple cooked meals on a camp stove , prompting them to call this period their “ homesteading ” phase .
Friends and family thought they were nuts .
“ I was terrified , ” says Sondra Peluce , Meeno ’s mother , remembering her first impression of the house .
“ I thought they had taken leave of their senses .
I actually think I went and threw up .
It was like an out - of - control fun house that was not fun . ”
Her dismay turned to pride , however , as she watched the home ’s transformation over the succeeding months .
“ When I saw my son hoisting railroad ties on his shoulder , I thought to myself , ‘ He is building an inner strength that will carry his family forever , ’ ” she says .
By his own admission , Peluce was not a handy guy .
A former actor and now a photographer who has shot album covers for the likes of pop R&B singers Rihanna and Mary J. Blige , Peluce had no background in home and garden renovation .
Indeed , he and his wife now laugh at his Sharper Image “ upscale gentleman ’s tool kit , ” which now hangs in their pantry as decoration .
But that did n’t keep him from working alongside the builder he hired .
As they began excavating , remnants of the home ’s colorful past and its original owner emerged .
“ You could see there was a pond and workings of different fountains , ” Ackerman says .
“ It was like a neglected plantation . ”
As the couple added plants and animals , the ambience became decidedly more rural .
“ We live in the country in the city ” is how Peluce describes life at the end of a dirt road .
Like most things on Skyfarm , the eclectic mix of plants includes the salvaged and repurposed .
( “ I ’m addicted to thrift , ” Ackerman admits . )
When they read in the Recycler that an old grove of bamboo was to be torn down in Bell Gardens , they rented a flatbed truck , dug up the trees and replanted them here .
The New England farmhouse they envisioned allows daughters India , 7 , and Mette , 3 , to move freely between the colorful , art - filled interiors of their home -- a style their parents have dubbed “ Cowboy Craftsman ” -- to the oasis outside .
Fanciful , hand - laid footpaths lead to an outdoor dining area , a barbecue , a hot tub they found in the Recycler for $ 100 and the animal pens .
Asked what prompted her interest in beekeeping , Ackerman could not recall .
She does , however , remember buying a copy of “ Beekeeping for Dummies , ” recommended by an East L.A. supplier of beekeeping equipment .
But she is among the growing number of people concerned about Colony Collapse Disorder , a mysterious affliction that has killed billions of bees worldwide .
“ She is the daughter of a teacher and a philosophy professor , ” says Peluce , who met Ackerman when they were both teachers at Hollywood High .
“ She is someone who was always taught to look things up , ” he adds .
The backyard collection of animals provides the children with daily lessons , a direct connection with the food cycle -- which is not always easy in an metropolitan environment .
With city lights in the not - so - far - away horizon , they have established an equilibrium of urban and country , old and new .
“ Climbing into ramshackle , beautiful , old falling - down places has been a big part of all our adventures leading up to this house , ” Peluce says .
“ So when we climbed into the beat - up hulk of the old grand dame that is our home , we felt very much at home with the spirit of its decrepitude . ”
Adds Ackerman : “ All of our adventures make us closer .
There is no way we will ever leave this house . ”

Former congresswoman and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro asserted that if Barack “ Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman of any color , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is .
And the country is caught up in this concept . ”

This assessment strikes many people as being wrong headed at a gut level , but empirically it can be proven wrong simply by looking at John Edwards ’ political career .
Edwards is Caucasian and an attorney .
He is young for politics and has 6 years of experience in elected office .
His one term in the United States Senate buttressed his campaign for the presidency in 2004 .
Edwards finished a respectable second to John Kerry in the 2004 delegate count and served as the Vice Presidential nominee for the Democratic Party .
A well - spoken lawyer ran for president and had a very good showing despite only having won a single statewide election ?
By Ferraro ’s own standards this could not have happened because Edwards ’ is white and as she said a white male would not be in the position Obama currently occupies .
Some may argue Edwards served 4 years of his term in the U.S. Senate prior to running for President and this differentiates him from Obama who was shown into the Senate in 2005 and began running in 2007 .
The thing is Obama spent 7 years in the Illinois state senate so his political experience is at least equal to Edwards ’ in 2004 .
Others might object that Edwards did not win the nomination or ever lead in the delegate count in 2004 .
This is true , but by the time the nominating process was over many Democrats preferred Edwards to John Kerry .
It is highly likely to my mind that had Edwards won Iowa in 2004 he would have gotten the “ anybody but Dean ” support that pushed Kerry to the 2004 nomination .
Edwards lost Iowa by a mere 2 points to John Kerry .
Therefore , Edwards with a similar resume , gender and communication skill set was in nearly the same position in 2004 that Obama is in now .
Some still may argue that Edwards had a better private sector career as an attorney and that made a difference in his 2004 presidential credentials .
The fact is Edwards was a great trial lawyer .
Barack Obama was head of the Harvard Law Review and taught constitutional law courses at the University of Chicago .
Constitutional Law and Trial Law are different fields to be sure * , but Harvard and the University of Chicago do not just hand out those honors to anyone .
Once again Obama ’s resume seems to be at least equal to that of John Edwards in 2004 .
If this is still not enough to prove Ferraro ’s claims to be absurd , consider that Al Gore had John Edwards on his short list of potential running mates in 2000 when Edwards had been in the U.S. Senate less than 2 years .
In 2000 , Edwards had still only won 1 election , had served in the Senate fewer than 18 months and was seriously considered to be a Vice Presidential nominee despite having to bear the burden of being a white male .
How could Edwards have been in that position if Ferraro was right about Obama ?
Sorry , but a look at the previous two election cycles prove that Ferraro ’s claims do not pass the smell test .
* This is one key difference between Obama and Edwards ’ disposition when it comes to politics : Obama is more theoretical and offers a grand vision so constitutional law suits him .
Edwards is more of a populist fighting for the little guy and sticking it to the fat cats so he is more suited to trial law .
Still , both men ’s political talents and resumes are not that different despite one being white and the other being an African American .

A study by researchers at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine shows there is increasing evidence that high rates of illness in Persian Gulf War Veterans can be explained , in part , by exposure to certain chemicals , including pesticides and nerve agents .
Veterans from the 1990 - 91 conflict have a higher rate of chronic , multi-symptom health problems than either non-deployed personnel or those deployed elsewhere .
Symptoms routinely reported by these veterans include fatigue , muscle or joint pain , memory problems , trouble sleeping , rash and breathing problems .
" This evidence suggests that exposure to this certain class of chemical may be linked to elevated risk of health problems , " said Beatrice Golomb , M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine , whose study will be published in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) the week of March 10 .
" Health issues among Gulf War veterans have been a concern for nearly two decades .
Now , enough studies have been conducted , and results shared , to be able to say with considerable confidence that there is a link between chemical exposure and chronic , multi-symptom health problems , " said Golomb .
" Furthermore , the same chemicals affecting Gulf War veterans may be involved in similar cases of unexplained , multi-symptom health problems in the general population . "
The study synthesized evidence regarding a class of chemicals known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEis ) and organophosphates ( OP ) , which includes nerve gas chemicals .
Some military personnel were exposed to nerve gas ( sarin ) when demolishing Iraqi munitions .
Also , the pesticides used aggressively in Gulf regions to control sand flies and other insects fall in the same category of chemicals .
This includes the carbamate pyridostigmine bromide ( PB ) pills originally given to service members to protect against potential nerve - agent exposure .
( Note : As a result of an earlier RAND corporation report by Golomb outlining the risks of using such pills , military policy has been changed . )
The study linked exposure to each of these chemicals with the chronic , multi-symptom health problems in 25 to 33 percent of returning Gulf War veterans .
" There is evidence that genetics have something to do with how a body handles exposure to these chemicals , " said Golomb .
" Some people are genetically less able to withstand these toxins and evidence shows that these individuals have higher chance of suffering the effects of exposure . "
Specifically , illness is linked to lower activity of enzymes that detoxify AChEis , due to genetic variants
The enzymes known to be involved are paraoxonase ( PON ) for OPs , including sarin , and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) for PB .
Among those service members given PB pills as a preventive measure , those with the mutations that reduced their ability to detoxify the pills were at significantly higher risk of illness , according to Golomb .
Previous studies have shown genetic variants of these enzymes are also associated with increased rates of some neurological diseases , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) or Lou Gehrig 's disease .
Golomb says this may explain the elevated levels of ALS seen in Gulf War veterans .
Some of the chemicals linked to these multi-symptom illnesses continue to be used in agriculture , and at homes and offices for pest control in the United States and around the globe .
Studies not related to the Gulf War showed that agricultural workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides had 10 times the number of health symptoms as those not exposed .
" Again , genetic variants that hamper defense against these chemicals were linked to higher risk of health problems .
These findings carry important implications for current members of the armed forces as well as the general public , suggesting that exposure to these pesticides in any setting may increase risk for impaired neuropsychological function and poor health " said Golomb .

Computer users should be careful while using Wi-Fi hotspots at airports and other public places , to prevent hackers lurking around from having access to sensitive information , US Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned .
As a matter routine , the FBI says people “ kill ” time at airports connecting to airport ’s Wi-Fi to check their office e-mail , do personal banking or shop for a gift .
But they should first consider the odds , for there could be a hacker nearby , with his own laptop , attempting to “ eavesdrop ” on their computer to obtain personal data .
In the United States , there are 68,000 Wi -Fi “ hot spots ” at airports , coffee shops , hotels , bookstores , schools and other locations .
While many of these hot spots have secure networks , some do not , according to Supervisory Special Agent Donna Peterson of FBI ’s Cyber Division .
And connecting to an insecure network can leave one vulnerable to attacks from hackers .
Agent Peterson said one of the most common types of attack is this : a bogus but legitimate - looking Wi -Fi network with a strong signal is strategically set up in a known hot spot …and the hacker waits for nearby laptops to connect to it .
At that point , your computer and all your sensitive information , including user ID , passwords , credit card numbers , basically belongs to the hacker , Peterson said .
The intruder can mine your computer for valuable data , direct you to phony webpages that look like ones you frequent , and record your every keystroke .

Soon , you wo n't have to leave your house to buy more Wii games .
Nintendo launched WiiWare , its games - on - demand service for Wii , Tuesday in Japan .
With a few clicks , owners of the console can log in to the Wii Shopping Channel and download new games that range in price from $ 5 to $ 15 .
Titles include new entries in the popular Dr. Mario and Final Fantasy series .
Nintendo says it sees this type of digital delivery as a way to let new game ideas blossom without the financial risks of producing retail inventory .
The low - risk environment gives developers a chance to flex their creative muscles .
" A big idea can succeed without a big budget , " says Tom Prata , director of project development at Nintendo .
WiiWare is Nintendo's answer to rival gamemakers Sony and Microsoft , who offer similar services for their PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles .
Nintendo has offered downloadable retro games , like the classic Super Mario Bros. , since Wii 's launch , but this is its first step into original digitally delivered software .
Nintendo will launch WiiWare in the United States on May 12 .
While the company has not announced which WiiWare games will launch in the U.S. version of the service , here 's a roundup of some of the higher - profile games that debuted Tuesday on Japanese Wiis :
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King ( $ 15 )
Based on the popular role - playing game series , this Sims - like title challenges you , as the child - king of a small town , to build your town up from scratch and make it livable for its inhabitants .
( Read our full impressions of My Life as a King . )
Lonpos ( $ 10 )
Remember those fit - the - plastic - pieces - into - a- rectangle puzzles ?
Here 's the digital version .
The puzzles start off easy , but get challenging quickly .
By paying more money , you can download more plastic aggravations .
( Read our full impressions of Lonpos . )
Dr. Mario and Virus Extermination ( $ 10 )
The well - known puzzle game returns on WiiWare .
Match the falling pills to the colored viruses to kill them .
The Virus Extermination mode is a remixed version that lets you move the pills by clicking on them with the Wiimote 's pointer .
( Read our full impressions of Dr. Mario and Virus Extermination . )
Star Soldier R ( $8 )
The successor to the outer - space shooting games that once clogged arcades , Star Soldier R has a unique twist .
You can only play it for two or five minutes at a time , and you 've got to rack up as big a score as possible in that brief period .
You can then upload your scores to the worldwide leader boards and see how you shape up .
( Read our full impressions of Star Soldier R. )
Angel 's Solitaire ( $5 )
Every downloadable games service needs a Solitaire game , right ?
But because this is Japan , it is dressed up with adorable , underage anime girls who flit about on screen as you move piles of cards .
Do n't expect to see this one in the States .
( Read our full impressions of Angel 's Solitaire . )
Saku Saku Animal Panic ( $ 10 )

Is this suburban house the real home of the OpenMac ?
Psystar , makers of the OpenMac ( now hastily renamed " Open Computer " ) , plans to fight Apple for the right to preinstall OS X Leopard on its 3rd party hackintosh .
Apple 's End User License Agreement expressly forbids installing the operating system on anything other than Apple hardware .
A spokesman for Psystar , named Robert ( no surname given ) , told Information Week that his company believes Apple is committing some imagined anti-trust offense and violating US monopoly laws .
Lets take a look at the arguments .
What if Honda said that , after you buy their car , you could only drive it on the roads they said you could ?
Then do n't buy it .
This is a straw man argument .
Apple 's EULA might forbid the use of its OS on third party hardware , but would never chase individuals who do this .
The clause is aimed at corporations loading OS X onto machines and selling them , a practice which would cut into Apple 's hardware revenue .
So Robert might better ask : " What if Honda said that it wo n't allow other car makers to put its proprietary self - parking software in their cars ? "
In this case , Honda surely would n't care if a lone hacker ported the system to an old Chevy Nova , but if Ford ripped it off wholesale , Honda would sue .
Robert also asks " What if Microsoft said you could only install Windows on Dell computers ? " .
There would be an outcry , of course , as this would be a clear case of collusion between two companies – which sell different but compatible products – to attempt to tie up the market and exclude competition .
Apple , on the other hand , owns the whole kit and caboodle .
It makes the software and the box it runs on , and can do what the hell it likes .
Apple might not let anyone else make and sell Macs , but , to return to the previous argument , Honda does n't let anyone else make and sell Hondas .
The Mac is a combination of hardware and software : one product , not two .
You might be able to buy a Leopard DVD in a store , but it is sold as an upgrade , not a standalone product .
It 's also a little odd that " Robert " refuses to give a last name .
Anyone inside the company would surely know who he is ( it 's a small outfit , as we 'll see in a moment ) , so the only reason to speak without a surname ( or perhaps a pseudonym ) is to protect himself from Apple , which seems to keeping very quiet on this issue , almost as if it did n't care .
The Guardian 's Charles Arthur did a little digging into the company and found out that it did n't exist until last week .
No website , no presence at the Miami Chamber of Commerces ( Psystar is based in Miami ) and nobody answering the phones .
Arthur managed to get ahold of an anonymous man on the support line number , but he was evasive : Remember that Arthur called the support line :
I 'm not support .
I 'm just answering the phones .
The company seems to have mysteriously moved , too .
The address changed from a small suburban house to an office in an industrial district .
Is " Robert " the sole employee of Psystar ?
A quick look at the other products on the Psystar site shows a curiously eclectic selection , all of which have noncommittal , waffling descriptions .
Communications Systems , Network Management Devices , Employee Management Systems , Surveillance Systems and Integrated Multimedia Systems .
Does n't it seem odd that the same company will install high end A/V equipment in your home and also manage your employee payroll data ?
I 'm not saying that this is a scam setup , but there 's definitely something strange here .
If the OpenMac exists , then the only worry is getting your order filled by this apparently sketchy outfit .
If it does n't exist , what on Earth is going on ?
UPDATE : Gadget Lab reader Richard sent this screen grab , which shows that the Psystar store is currently unable to process credit cards .
As Alice said when she was tumbling down the rabbit hole , curiouser and curiouser .

So exactly who or what is Psystar ?

Mac Clone Maker Psystar Vows To Challenge Apple EULA [ Information Week ]
Ethanol Plan a Failure Germany Backs Away from Biofuels
Berlin has abandoned plans to increase the percentage of ethanol in gasoline sold at the country 's pumps .
New projections estimate that up to 3 million cars would have been unable to run on the higher mixture .
Scientists at the University of York have characterised an important new step in the mechanism used by bacteria to evade our immune system .
It is an ‘ invisibility cloak ’ which means that bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae , a common cause of ear infections in children , can move about the body without the risk of being attacked by the immune system .
A multidisciplinary research team from the Departments of Biology and Chemistry at York have been studying how bacteria capture the molecule used to make the ‘ cloak ’ , called sialic acid .
The researchers have now discovered an enzymatic activity that helps in the more efficient capture of sialic acids released from our cell surfaces .
As well as using the sialic acid to make the ‘ invisibility cloak ’ other bacteria use similar methods to capture sialic acid as a simple food source , so are literally eating us from the inside !
Dr Gavin Thomas , of the Department of Biology , who led the research said : " This novel enzyme , as well as other steps required for the formation of the ' invisibility cloak ' that we have discovered in York , now offers the chance to develop novel antimicrobials against these bacteria . "
The work , which was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) , was undertaken by Dr. Emmanuele Severi ( Biology - Thomas lab ) in collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Potts ( Biology and Chemistry ) , Dr. Andrew Leech ( Biology ) and Professor Keith Wilson and Dr. Axel Müller ( Chemistry and York Structural Biology Laboratory ) .
The team used the Centre for Magnetic Resonance based in the Department of Chemistry , and the Technology Facility in the Department of Biology .
The paper Sialic Acid Mutarotation
Is Catalyzed by the Escherichia coli ß- Propeller Protein YjhT was recently published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .

OK , this is beyond the pale , but just the beginning of the smears that will befall Sen. Obama as the campaign continues .
Sullivan stated the caller " was n't calling Barack Obama Hitler .
He was just talking about how Hitler got the crowd all excited , and Barack Obama got the crowd all excited . "
Sullivan then stated that he would do a " side - by - side comparison " of a Hitler speech and an Obama speech .
Sullivan then introduced the " comparison " by stating : " So , ladies and gentlemen , from the past , a little archive , a little walk down Der Fuehrer 's memory lane .
Here he is , the one , the only , Adolf Hitler ! "
Are you creeped out yet ?
The idiot known as Sullivan tries to justify this walk on the dark side and compares Obama to Hitler because one of his caller 's brought it up and Hitler got people fired up too .
OK , sure .
Good for the caller ( who identifies as a Republican ) who is n't standing for this garbage .
And to think Hugh Hewitt believes right wing talk radio is sensible .
" All right , we wo n't play Hitler any more , then . "
But Sullivan then pleaded : " One time -- oh , come on , one more time ?

Just one more time ?
Then I wo n't do it again . "
He then added : " Until the next time . "

Updated 7/19/07 : FBI nabs bomb threat suspect with spyware
Updated 7/19/07 : Policeware : the spyware used by law enforcement
A recent case that was heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals involved law enforcement use of a key logger on a suspect ’s computer .
The case involved a suspected illicit drug maker that was under investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) .
The DEA obtained permission from a judge to install key logging software on the suspect ’s computer in order to harvest passwords for PGP and Hushmail encryption .
This case highlights a question that I ’ve been thinking about for years : would my anti-virus program alert me to the presence of key logger software , even if it was installed by law enforcement ?
C|Net News interviewed representatives from several anti-virus / malware companies and got answers to that question .
Would the following vendors ’ programs detect key loggers even if installed by law enforcement ?
▪ Grisoft / AVG : Yes
▪ Checkpoint : Yes
▪ Computer Associates : Yes
▪ eEye : Yes
▪ IBM : Yes
▪ Kaspersky : Yes
▪ McAfee : Yes
▪ Microsoft : Yes
▪ Sana : Yes
▪ Sophos : Yes
▪ Symantec : Yes
▪ Trend Micro : Yes
▪ Websense : Yes
C|Net News also asked these vendors if they had ever received requests from law enforcement ( including subpoenas ) that their products not inform a specific user of the presence of a law enforcement installed key logger .
Some of the companies have a policy to not discuss specific dealings with law enforcement – and the rest said they had received no such request .
I am wondering just now – what would McAfee , Trend , Symantec , or any of the others do if law enforcement DID request / require that their products not report the presence of a key logger .
How would they accomplish that feat ?
I can imagine a number of scenarios on how that would be accomplished :
The specific anti-virus vendor would design in a mechanism that would silence the software ’s alert of a key logger if it received a specific signal from the vendor ’s update service .
To accomplish this , the vendor would have to know precisely which PC should be silenced , and be able to do so silently .
Other , less serious , alternatives come to mind :
Law enforcement could sneak into the suspect ’s computer and run a program that would disable anti-virus programs ’ ability to detect or report the presence of the key logger .
I can easily imagine malware that would perform the same disabling feature in order to hide its own key logger .
Some malware already has the ability to completely shut down anti-virus programs , firewalls , and so on , so this capability is not that far - fetched .
Law enforcement could send an e-mail to the suspect , where the e-mail either contained an executable , or a URL to a law enforcement website .
“ Please run this program or visit this web site so that we can install a key logger for you . ”
Uh huh .
Remember : anything that law enforcement can do , hackers can do .
In fact , hackers are often one step ahead of law enforcement , experienced with the illicit installation of key loggers .
Anyway , I can imagine a future where law enforcement may have the ability to get key loggers onto computers , and at the same time get anti-malware programs to look the other way .
But I expect that there will be capabilities of detecting and disabling such key loggers : hackers are notoriously anti-law enforcement and they would quickly fill the need to detect and block law enforcement key loggers .
In the meantime I can think of a few countermeasures :
Regularly scan your computer with one of several available online malware scanners ( see this tip for more information ) .
Run one or more anti-rootkit programs to scan for rootkits ( I feel that key loggers and / or the means for blocking anti-malware ’s alerting it may be done by rootkits ) .
Switch your OS : use MacOS or Linux instead of Windows .
I have a feeling that the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU will be watching these developments .

Jeffrey R. Immelt , chairman and chief executive of General Electric leads a discussion in Los Angeles , California May 24 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shares of General Electric GE.N fell sharply before the opening bell on Friday , extending earlier declines , after the industrial conglomerate reported an unexpected decline in quarterly earnings and lowered its profit outlook .
Shares of GE dropped 10.2 percent to $ 33 in pre-market trading .
Mmmm … One Star-rific !
For your fun and edification , I now present selected snippets of one - star reviews of my work on Amazon .
Why ?
Oh , just because .
Old Man ’s War :
Opening the book , I met a central character whose lame attempts at humor are acclaimed as hilarious .
Gradually we find our man is gifted at everything but amazingly modest .
This endears him to his fictional friends who are numerous and described in tedious detail …
A physicist character in inserted to relieve the author from any explanation by insisting that our math is inadequate .
Aliens are thrown at us in pathetic haste , as mere cartoon monsters .
I wonder this book can be classed as SF .
a trite , weakly written novel that barely qualifies as science fiction …
The science ( I ’m a hard core devote ) is absent or implausible , and the action is a series of cliches .
Ultimately , it reads like John Wayne of the future with the main character saving the day in multiple , and very tired ways .
All of the “ surprises ” were predictable and uninspiring and the hints of self - doubt are pushed aside like so many alien carcasses .
I highly recommend avoiding this book .
I could not finish reading this book because it bored me to tears .
There are dialogs after dialogs , but no action .
If this is a movie , there will be only one scene in the whole movie , of people talking to each others .
‘ infantile ’ is the best description , not even rising to ‘ adolescent ’ .
save your money on this wretched crap .
The Android ’s Dream
Very slow , very boring , really not very interesting .
The Sagan Diary
There is just nothing here .
No insights , no plot , no real imagination .
Just fluff and dreck .
The book is emotional tripe without clear context .
You need a better memory than mine to match the emotional ramblings to the events in the Old Man ’s War series .
My real problem is that these thoughts and feelings portray a sensitive , delicate young thing rather than the heavy duty Special Forces soldier who even in civilian life engendered some degree of fear even in the people who knew her best .
It ’s like hearing Mike Hammer cry about his boutonniere not matching his tux for the prom – Oh please !
How do I feel about these one star reviews ?
I feel fine about them .
I am not under the impression that , alone among all writers who have ever existed , I will be the one whose work is universally acclaimed ; nor am I under the impression that when readers who feel burned by work are offered an avenue to express their displeasure , that they will rather prefer to stew privately .
Nor do I think an appropriate response to negative reviews is to flamebroil the reviewer and send my minions to harass them , thus revealing myself to be something of an insecure psychotic .
Someone does n’t like my work and wants to tell people so ?
Okay by me .
I ’ll live .
As will any other author who has the sense not to get in a lather over the idea that somewhere someone might not like their work .
And if you do n’t have that sense , well .
Just put on your big author panties and deal with it .
A challenge to other authors with blogs , LiveJournals and etc :
Post your one - star ( or otherwise negative ) Amazon reviews , if you have them , and you probably do .
Oh , go on .
Own your one - star reviews , man .
And then , you know .
Get past them .
If you ’re lucky , some of them might actually be fun to read .

Court Move Puts All Eyes On SCOTUS In Trump Bid To Hijack Census To Boost White Voters
There 's been no shortage of articles trying to explain the ongoing housing and mortgage crisis .
But none does a more clear and entertaining job than this recent episode of This American Life , " The Giant Pool of Money " ( iTunes - Feed - MP3 ) .
Step by step , the show traces how we got into this mess .
Along the way , you 'll discover how 70 trillion dollars of global money needed to get parked somewhere , and it found the US housing market .
As the money poured in , the American investment community cranked out as many mortgages as it could .
And when there were no more qualified home buyers left , the banks started lowering lending standards until there were none left .
In the end , even dead people were getting mortgages ( sadly , a true story ) .
Give the podcast a listen .
The whole debacle gets pieced together in a way that you 've probably never heard before .

When I was in high school , most of my budget went to two items , gas and beer .
At that time , the price of gas was 25 cents a gallon , and beer was $ 1.25 a six - pack if I remember correctly ( and I may not ) .
So the relative price was 5 to 1 , i.e. to get five gallons of gas , you had to give up a six pack of beer .
Today , the tradeoff is a bit different .
A gallon of gas is around $ 4.00 and beer is over $ 5.00 a six - pack .
I 'm not sure on the price today , but say let 's say it 's $ 5.50 .
So now , roughly , the relative price is 5.5 to 4 , or 5 to 3.63 rather than 5 to 1 as before .
Gas costs a lot more beer these days , to get five gallons today you have to give up 3.63 six packs , where before it was only one .
If someone had an allowance of $ 5 per week back then and purchased two six - packs and 10 gallons of gas , then they would need $ 51 to purchase the same basket of goods ( or bads ) today .
Since this was 36 years ago , that works out to inflation of 6.7 % per year .
Not quite as bad as I imagined , but still pretty high , certainly higher than the increases in the minimum wage over that time period .
Kids who did n't drink at all , say they put all of their allowance into gas , would need $ 80 today to buy the 20 gallons of gas they could get for $ 5 at a quarter per gallon .
That 's an inflation rate of 8.0 % .
But an all beer kid , one who spent all $ 5 on beer and did n't drive at all , would only need $ 22 today to get the same amount of beer .
That 's an inflation rate of 4.1 % .
Given the shift in relative prices , kids today should be tempted to drink more , and drive less .

Even high - end rentals are going fast .
In just the three weeks since it arrived on the market , a four - bedroom apartment at 15 Central Park West , advertised for $ 55,000 a month , has gone to contract .
The broker , Roberta Golubock with Sotheby ’s International Realty , said she showed the apartment to eight financially qualified prospects .
Some New Yorkers defend their spending as investments or gifts to themselves .
In August , Karen Borkowsky and Robert Kennedy , a partner in a law firm , were married at the Rainbow Room .
The reception , which the event planner , Shawn Rabideau , lavished with glass and calla lilies , cost $ 150,000 to $ 200,000 .
But when Ms. Kennedy considered that she had survived breast cancer and , at age 41 , married a guy she had dated in high school , the wedding ’s cost seemed less exorbitant .
Then , shortly after returning from their honeymoon , the couple started a $ 400,000 project to combine and restore two apartments into a three - bedroom , three - bath co-op on the Upper West Side .
“ We are investing in the longevity of the apartment , ” she said .
There are also some people who say they have not been hurt because they have poured so much money into opportunities not available to the Main Street investor .
Paul Parmar , a 37 - year - old investor in companies specializing in health care , defense , media , luxury items and private aviation , says he is living just as large as ever .
In recent months , Mr. Parmar , who lives in Colts Neck , N.J. , said he bought 140 acres in Mineola , Tex. , and is spending $ 20 million to begin building a refuge there for abused tigers .
Since January , he said he added to his car collection with a $ 110,000 BMW 750 Li ( for his girlfriend ) and a Bentley Arnage for himself , for about $ 300,000 .
He is leasing a Maybach through Luxautica , an “ ultimate car club ” that has annual fees of about $ 125,000 .
“ On a spending level , ” Mr. Parmar said , speaking about a possible recession , “ it does n’t affect me at all . ”
That said , providers of luxury goods reported anecdotal evidence of a widening gap between the merely rich and the ultrarich .
Clifford Greenhouse , who owns a household - staff employment company , said he suspects that the merely rich might be starting to lag behind their far richer counterparts , and are trimming their budgets .
He cited reduced demand for chauffeurs  a relatively small - ticket service  yet ever - strong demand for private chefs , butlers and “ household managers . ”
Darren Sukenik , a real estate broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman , said that while business may be slower for clients with a mere million to spend on apartments , none of his clients with budgets of more than $ 2.5 million have stopped shopping .
Seth Semilof , the publisher of Haute Living , a luxury magazine , said that luxury car dealerships that advertise with him are pushing Bentleys and Rolls - Royces at the expense of less - extravagant cars like the BMW 5 Series .
“ If you look at the $ 20 million - plus market , it ’s still strong as ever , ” Mr. Semilof said .
Some of the ultrarich are still willing to pay above sticker price for things they want badly enough .
Mr. Semilof helped three buyers in the past two months acquire Rolls - Royce Phantom convertibles for as much as $ 200,000 above the asking price of $ 465,000 .
Independent tests conducted by engineers at the U.S. Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) Argonne National Laboratory on a BMW Hydrogen 7 Mono - Fuel demonstration vehicle have found that the car 's hydrogen - powered engine surpasses the super - ultra low - emission vehicle ( SULEV ) level , the most stringent emissions performance standard to date .
" The BMW Hydrogen 7 's emissions were only a fraction of SULEV level , making it one of the lowest emitting combustion engine vehicles that have been manufactured , " said Thomas Wallner , a mechanical engineer who leads Argonne 's hydrogen vehicle testing activities .
" Moreover , the car 's engine actively cleans the air .
Argonne 's testing shows that the Hydrogen 7's 12 - cylinder engine actually shows emissions levels that , for certain components , are cleaner than the ambient air that comes into the car 's engine . "
The current Hydrogen 7 is represented by the H2 - PFI column .

It was not an easy task to measure the Hydrogen 7's emissions .
" A gross polluter is easy to measure , but the cleaner the car the harder it is to test , " said Don Hillebrand , director of Argonne 's Center for Transportation Research .
" Most labs test at the SULEV level .
Argonne 's vehicle testing facilities are unique in that they are able to detect even trace levels of emissions .
In this case , it was near - zero emissions . "
After an extensive evaluation by BMW , " Argonne ’s Advanced Powertrain Research Facility was found to be the only public test facility in North America capable of testing hydrogen vehicles at these low emissions levels , " said BMW 's Wolfgang
Thiel , manager , operating support emissions analysis .
" Zero is a very small precise number – we are pushing the boundaries of emissions testing . "
Technical and program information about the Hydrogen 7 tests will be presented by Wallner and BMW North America 's Jason P. Perron Wednesday , April 2 during the National Hydrogen Association Annual Hydrogen Conference , March 30 - April 3 , in Sacramento , Calif .
Argonne will join BMW 's Christoph Huss , senior vice president , science , traffic and vehicles regulations , in a press conference to present the test results during the Society of Automotive Engineers 2008 World Congress , April 14 - 17 , in Detroit .
BMW has put the hydrogen model into limited series production .
Although the vehicle is not yet available for sale to the general public , it is being made available to " influential public figures , " whose use demonstrate a new era in clean energy , BMW has said .
In the meantime , the greatest challenge to widespread use of hydrogen cars is the limited number of hydrogen refueling stations .
Argonne has conducted cutting - edge transportation research for more than 30 years and employs a multidisciplinary staff of engineers and scientists involved in engine , battery , fuel cell , vehicle systems and applied materials research .
Argonne 's transportation research program and facilities are primarily funded by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , which supports the development of vehicle technologies and alternative fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil , and enables the U.S. transportation industry to sustain a strong , competitive position in domestic and world markets .

Today a new law gets the final go - ahead which will make it illegal to own violent porn .
From next January extreme videos , photos and online material will be banned .
That includes any image where it looks like someone 's life could be in danger or where parts of their body could be seriously hurt .
The governments making it a crime to own this stuff because it thinks looking at these images could encourage violent behaviour .
But critics say its going to make criminals out of people who look at violent porn with no intention of harming anyone .
Here are two very different views on the changes .
Lucy  Against the ban
Lucy thinks the ban will " create millions of harmless criminals "
Lucys just put her three - year old son to bed - shes spent the day with him , hanging out in the park and going to playgroup .
Shes a normal mum who does normal stuff but some of the things she gets up to behind closed doors wouldnt quite be seen that way .
 With my girlfriend in the privacy of my own home we engage in dominance and submission .
It s all consensual .
To us its a way we express our love for each other . 
Shes one of millions of people who enjoy bondage , domination and sado - masochism ( BDSM ) .
Lucy says shell only do this kind of stuff with people who agree to it and shed never want to cause actual harm to anyone .
Any photos , online images or videos she watches all feature actors .
 Ive been looking on my computer - one particular image that I m going to have to get rid of is this one .
Two women , one holding a knife to the other ones throat .
 When I look at this picture I do not feel compelled to go out and hurt anybody .
I dont know anybody else who would look at that picture and feel compelled to go out and hurt people .
" Although I do know quite a few people who would go ' mmm that s quite a sexy image ' . 
When the new law comes in to force in January this picture could be illegal .
It s a crime to own any pornographic image that shows someone in a potentially life - threatening situation .
 The wording in it is so incredibly vague , " says Lucy .
" We want a piece of legislation that is going to catch people who are dangerous but under this you are going to create millions of harmless criminals overnight . 
Liz Longhurst 
For the ban
Liz 's daughter Jane was killed by a man addicted to violent porn
Lizs daughter Jane was killed in 2003 .
She was strangled to death by Graham Coutts , a man who was addicted to violent porn websites .
Hed downloaded hundreds of images of women being raped and strangled as well as pictures claiming to show people having sex with corpses .
Liz thinks if these hadnt been available for him to look at , her daughter would still be alive .
 It made it seem alright .
I think he knew from quite a young age that it wasnt really alright .
" But I think he thought , well , there are all these sites , Im not the only one and it must be alright really and so he just went with the flow . 
Innocent intentions
Since Janes death
Liz has been campaigning for this new law .
She understands that many people who look at extreme images have no intention of hurting people .
" Sometimes the freedoms of like - minded , decent people have to be curtailed because of a few others .
" I know some would argue women choose to do this .
But I believe a lot of women who have been trafficked are forced to be on these sites . 
With the growth of the internet , extreme pornographic images have become a lot more readily available now .
This new law means looking at one on your PC could result in a jail sentence .
Liz says :  What its allowing is for the police to walk in to anybodys home , pick up anybodys computer and check out whats on it .
 It wont be accepted by the majority of people until somebody else has been murdered like Jane . 

Serial President - 140 + death row Texecutions " Executing juveniles , the mentally disabled , the innocent , violating international law by denying foreign citizens the right to contact their government before they 're sentenced to death , even accusations of genocide " " Please , " Bush whimpers , his lips pursed in mock desperation , " do n't kill me . "
A Roster of the Dead This is a list of bodies , a roster of the dead , who might have been called Witnesses had they not met their untimely ends .
Some of the names on this list will give you pause .
Some are rumor .
Some you may find incredible , and some frightening .
Do your own research .
You will draw your own conclusions .
The above paragraph began the last edition of the Bush Body Count .
In previous editions , there were no special criteria for adding bodies - only that they could be related to the Bush family in some way , and be dead .
In fact , the original Bush Body Count started as a parody of the so - called Clinton Death List .
Times have changed .
The Bush Body Count is no longer a parody , and many of the names have been removed .
This edition examines the scandals and misdeeds of the Bush family generations , and lists the corpses they leave in their wake .
Bush Went Awol - Bodies Sid Adger Mr. Adger , a Houston oil supply company executive and Bush family friend , died in 1996 of unknown causes .
Adger was the mysterious businessman who approached General James Rose and asked him to help George W. Bush avoid Vietnam by recommending him for a pilot position with the National Guard .
General James Rose General Rose recommended George W. Bush for a pilot position with the Texas National Guard .
He died of unknown causes in 1993 .
He was immediately buried and no autopsy was performed .
Lt. Colonel William Harris , Jr. Lt. Col. William Harris was one of two commanding officers who could not perform George W. Bush 's annual evaluation covering the year from May 1 , 1972 to April 30 , 1973 .
They stated in their filing that " Lt . Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of this report . "
Fortunately for George W. Bush , Lt. Col .
Harris is not here to verify his 1973 statement .
He 's dead .
Lt. Colonel Jerry B. Killian Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian was another of George W. Bush 's commanding officers .
He cannot testify in a court of law as to George W. Bush 's dereliction of his sworn duty .
Lt. Col. Killian is dead .
James Downing Aalund Mr. Aalund 's name is the first on a long list of young Texans who died in Vietnam .
These young men did not have influential fathers to pull the strings necessary to get them into the Texas Air National Guard .
If they had been so lucky , they would surely have fulfilled their responsibilities to the ANG , if only out of gratitude that they did not have to die , thousands of miles away in a strange land .
They surely would not have disappeared from duty for over a year , as did our fearless leader George W. Bush .
Enron - Bodies J. Clifford Baxter
Found dead in his car , shot in the head .
Mr. Baxter was vice chairman of Enron Corp. when he resigned in May 2001 .
Enron has been hot copy lately with the revelation that they were the largest campaign contributors for George W. Bush .
Was J. Clifford Baxter a potential witness to Bush foreknowledge of their wrongdoings ?
His death was ruled a suicide .
Charles Dana Rice
He was the senior vice president and treasurer of El Paso Corp. , an energy corporation swept up in the recent energy scandal .
Two months after the " suicide " of Enron executive Clifford Baxter , in the midst of questions about the accounting practices of El Paso Corp. , Charles Rice was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head .
His death was ruled a suicide .
James Daniel Watkins
His body was found on December 1 , 2001 in the Pike National Forest in Colorado , a gunshot wound to the head .
Mr. Watkins was a consultant for Arthur Andersen , the accounting firm for Enron .
He disappeared on November 13 after he left work .
He was described as a devoted family man who always called home if he were going to be late .
Officials initially said that the death was suspicious , but have changed their tune and have ruled his death a suicide .
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown
He died in a plane crash on April 3 , 1996 .
Was Ron Brown the first Enron body ?
In 1995 Enron officials accompanied Brown on a trade mission to India , and to Russia in 1994 .
Speculation among right - wing whackos suggests that our last duly - elected President , Bill Clinton , was somehow responsible for his death , but we wonder : was Secretary Brown privy to information that would conclusively link George W. Bush to Enron greed and corruption ?
Charles Meissner , Assistant Commerce Secretary , also died in this crash .
Jake Horton
He was the senior vice - president of Gulf Power , a subsidiary of Southern Company , a cohort of Enron in the energy industry , and a major contributer to the Bush agenda .
According to reporter < http://www.guardian.co.uk/enron/story/0,11337,643422,00.html>Gregory
Palast , Horton knew of the company 's appalling accounting practices , and " ... had no doubt about its illegal campaign contributions to Florida politicans - he'd made the payments himself .
In April of 1989 Horton decided to come clean with state officials , and reserved the company jet to go confront company officials .
Ten minutes after takeoff the jet exploded .
Kennedy Assassination - Bodies John Fitzgerald Kennedy
An internal FBI memo reported that on November 22 a reputed businessman named George H. W. Bush reported hearsay that a certain Young Republican had been talking of killing the President when he came to Houston .
The Young Republican was nowhere near Dallas on that date .
According to a 1988 story in The Nation , J. Edgar Hoover said in a memo that Mr. George Bush of the CIA had been briefed on November 23rd , 1963 about the reaction of anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami to the assassination of President Kennedy .
George H. W. Bush has denied this , although he was in Texas and cannot account for his whereabouts at the time .
Hale Boggs
He sat on the Warren Commission , which concluded that President Kennedy was slain by a lone assassin .
Later , in 1971 and ' 72 , Boggs said that the Warren Report was false and that J. Edgar Hoover 's FBI not only helped cover up the JFK murder but blackmailed Congress with massive wire - tapping and spying .
He named Warren Commission staff member Arlen Specter as a major cover - up artist .
Congressman Boggs ' plane disappeared on a flight to Alaska in 1972 .
The press , the military , and the CIA publicly proclaimed the plane could not be located .
Investigators later said that was a lie , that the plane had been found .
On the plane were Nick Begich , a very popular Democratic Congressman , and Don Jonz , an aide to Mr. Boggs .
All were killed .
George de Mohrenschildt
A rich Russian oilman , he was described with his wife as being the two people friendliest to Oswald at the time of the assassination .
De Mohrenschildt was the man who moved Oswald to Dallas .
In the late 1970's , shortly before the first meeting of the House Select Committee on Assassinations , de Mohrenschildt started seeing a new doctor in town .
He quickly became mentally unstable , at which time his wife convinced him to stop seeing the doctor .
They moved away and left a false forwarding address .
On the same day that the Committee tried to contact him about testifying , he was found dead of a gunshot wound .
In his personal address book was the entry Bush , George H.W. ( Poppy ) and Zapata Petroleum Midland ( the oil company owned by George H.W. Bush ) .
Mrs. E. Howard Hunt In December 1972 , while George H. W. Bush was at the Republican National Convention , a United Airlines flight carrying Mrs. Dorothy Hunt , CIA operative and wife of Howard Hunt , ( CIA operative and suspect in the Kennedy assassination ) crashed .
Believed to be carrying $ 25,000 in " hush money " , she died in this crash .
George H.W. Bush - Bodies Gary Caradori
He was investigating Lawrence E. King , Jr. , a very influential black Republican who was also a friend of George H.W. Bush .
King was director of the Franklin Community Credit Union in Omaha , Nebraska , and was suspected of embezzling $ 40 million .
The Nebraska Senate questioned child prostitutes , who accused King of running a child prostitution ring .
One of these children said that she saw George H.W. Bush at one of King 's parties .
" Pronto " , a newspaper in Barcelona , Spain , reported that the scandal " appears to directly implicate politicos of the state of Nebraska and Washington DC who are very close to the White House and George Bush himself " .
On July 11 , 1990 , Gary Caradori was killed along with his 6 - year old son in the crash of his small plane , after a mid-air explosion , the cause of which was never discovered .
He had told friends repeatedly in the weeks before his death that he was afraid his plane would be sabotaged .
Orlando Letelier
He was torn to bits by a car bomb on the streets of Washington DC just before he was to testify against the Chilean dictator Pinochet .
After the bombing , CIA Director George H. W. Bush told the FBI that there had been no Chilean involvement whatsoever .
In 1991 the post - Pinochet Chilean Supreme Court asked George H. W. Bush if he would submit to questioning .
BUSH REFUSED .
Ronni Moffit
She was Letelier 's assistant .
She and her husband were riding in the car with Letelier when the bomb exploded .
Mr. Moffit survived .
Ronni did n't .
Jack Delaney and Ted White
These young men were killed when pilot George H. W. Bush abandoned his plane when it was hit by enemy fire .
Much has been made of this story - Bush propaganda would have us believe that he was a hero .
An eyewitness to the event tells us otherwise : Chester Mierzejewski , who was the turret gunner in another plane , had an unobstructed view .
He states that he saw a " puff of smoke " come from Bush 's plane and quickly dissipate .
He states that the plane was never on fire and that Bush never attempted a water landing , which was standard procedure , and which would have given Mr. Delaney and Mr. White a chance .
Silent Voices - Bodies Steve Kangas
His web site , Liberalism Resurgent , was meticulously researched and presented such a problem to the " real boss " of George Bush , Richard Scaife , that he hired a private detective to look into Kangas ' past .
Steve Kangas was found in a 39th - floor bathroom outside of Scaife 's offices at One Oxford Centre , in Pittsburgh , an apparent suicide .
Mr. Kangas , a very prolific writer , left no note .
He had brought a fully - packed suitcase of clothes with him to Pittsburgh .
He bought a burglar alarm shortly before he left for Pittsburgh .
Why did he need a burglar alarm if he was going to commit suicide ?
An avowed advocate of gun control , he nevertheless bought a gun .
What was he afraid of ?
Why did he go to Pittsburgh ?
After his death , his computer was sold for $ 150 and its hard drive wiped clean .
Everything in his apartment was thrown away .
Danny Casolaro
He was working on a book that tied together the scandals surrounding the presidency of George H. W. Bush .
He told his friends he was going to " bring back " the head of the Octopus .
Instead , his body was found in a hotel in Martinsburg , West Virginia , on August 10 , 1991 , an apparent suicide .
Mark Lombardi
He was an accomplished conceptual artist who , while chatting on the phone with a banker friend about the Bush savings and loan scandal , started doodling a diagram and was inspired to create a complex series of drawings and sketches that charted the details of the scandal .
According to the New York Times , " He was soon charting the complex matrices of personal and professional relationships , conflict of interest , malfeasance and fraud uncovered by investigations into the major financial and political scandals of the day ; to keep facts and sources straight , he created a handwritten database that now includes around 12,000 3 - by - 5 - inch cards . "
On the evening of March 22 , 2000 , Mark Lombardi was found hanging in his loft , an apparent suicide .
James Hatfield Mr. Hatfield was the author of Fortunate Son , an unauthorized biography of George W. Bush .
The book detailed Bush 's cocaine use and cover up of a cocaine arrest .
He was found Wednesday , July 18 , in a motel room , an apparent suicide .
Prescott Bush - Bodies William S. Farish
He was one of Prescott Bush 's partners in business deals with Adolph Hitler .
He was devastated by the intense grilling he received from the Senate about his dealings with Nazis , and while Prescott Bush skated free , Farish collapsed and died on November 29 , 1942 .
James Forrestal
He was U.S. Secretary of Defense , and become a problem for Prescott Bush when he proposed racial integration of the Armed Forces .
On March 28 , 1949 , he was forced out of office and flown on a military plane to Jupiter Island in Florida .
From there he was taken to Walter Reed Army Hospital , where he was given insulin shock treatments .
He was shielded from all visitors except his estranged wife .
From " George Bush , the Unauthorized Biography " : On May 22 , Forrestal 's body was found , his bathrobe cord tied tightly around his neck , after he had plunged from a sixteenth - story hospital window .
The chief psychiatrist called the death a suicide even before any investigation was started .
The results of the Army 's inquest were kept secret .
Forrestal 's diaries were published , 80 percent deleted , after a year of direct government censorship and rewriting Texas Justice - Bodies Karla Faye Tucker
She was executed in spite of enormous protest from the public , even those religious groups that advocate the death penalty .
Even Pat Robertson thought that Karla was truly repentant and asked George W. Bush to spare her life .
He refused .
Afterward , in a Talk Magazine interview , Bush mocked the woman whose death warrant he had sanctioned , pursing his lips and whimpering , " Please do n't kill me ! " David Wayne Spence David Wayne Spence was executed in Texas in 1997 in spite of compelling evidence of his innocence .
Two of the State 's witnesses were co-defendants who testified to avoid the death penalty , one of whom changed his story three times in response to discrepancies .
He later testified that D.A. Simons encouraged him to alter his testimony .
Two other witnesses for the State were jailhouse snitches who recanted later and stated that Simons offered them favors in exchange for testimony .
All of this and more was supposedly reviewed by Governor George W. Bush , but Bush refused to commute his sentence , and did not order the Board of Pardons and Paroles to review his request for clemency .
It is a myth that a Texas Governor can do nothing to stop executions ; the Board will almost always go with his recommendation .
Bush washed his hands of the matter and did nothing .
Reasonable doubt is not a factor in Texas justice .
Gary Graham Gary Graham was convicted of the robbery and murder of a white man in 1981 .
Nearly two weeks after the crime , the state 's prime witness could not pick Gary 's picture out of a photo line - up .
Mr. Graham was arrested with a 22 caliber pistol .
The victim had been killed with a 22 , but the police firearms examiner determined that Mr. Graham 's gun DID NOT fire the fatal bullet .
Four witnesses said Gary Graham was with them , miles away from the convenience store , when the murder occured .
All four took and passed polygraph tests .
George W. Bush , predictably , expressed his faith in the Texas judicial system and allowed Mr. Graham to be put to death .
Mr. Graham maintained his innocence to the end .

Iran Contra - Bodies Olof Palme
He was the prime minister of Sweden , assassinated in 1986 .
Oliver North , the golden boy of the Bush / Reagan machine , had met with Mr. Palme to discuss the possibility of obtaining false end - user certificates for the plethora of weapons that were being purchased , so that they would seem to have come from a country other than the U.S. Mr. Palme refused to participate , after the plan was presented to him .
He was dead within weeks .
William Casey William Casey was CIA Director during the Reagan / Bush Administration .
He died 2 days before he was to testify about his and others ' involvement in the Iran / Contra scandal .

Charles M. McKee and Matthew Gannon Charles M. McKee , ostensibly a military attache for the DIA in Beirut , Matthew Gannon , CIA Deputy Station Chief in Beirut , and three others were on board Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland .
They were part of a counterterrorist team in Beirut investigating the possible rescue of 9 American hostages in Lebanon .
The McKee team uncovered evidence that a rogue CIA unit called COREA , based in Wiesbaden , was doing business with a man called Monzer Al - Kassar , a Syrian arms dealer and drug trafficker .
Al - Kassar was part of the covert network run by U.S. Lieut .
Colonel Oliver North .
Outraged that the COREA unit in Wiesbaden was doing business with a Syrian who had close terrorist connections and might endanger their chances of rescuing the hostages , the McKee team decided to fly back to Virginia unannounced and expose the COREA unit 's secret deal with al - Kassar .
They never got there .
" For three years , I 've had a feeling that if Chuck had n't been on that plane , it would n't have been bombed , " said Beulah McKee , 75 , Charles McKee 's mother , to Time Magazine .
Four months after her son was killed for his efforts to expose the CIA , Mrs. McKee received a sympathy letter from George H. W. Bush .
Mrs. McKee has never been satisfied with the government 's version of events .
Don Aronow
He was a close friend of George H. W. Bush .
According to the book " George Bush , the Unauthorized Biography , " there is compelling evidence to conclude that Aronow was a drug smuggler and suspected drug - money launderer .
He was murdered by professional killers on February 3 , 1987 .
In the days before his death , he made many personal calls to George H. W. Bush .
Tommy Teagle , a man interviewed by author Thomas Burdick , was afraid of being murdered by Bush because he had knowledge that Aronow and Jeb Bush had been partners in cocaine trafficking .
Michael Hand
He was a Green Beret and an Army Colonel assigned to the CIA .
He ran the Nugan Hand Bank , a front for CIA drug money , in Sydney , Australia .
He was in frequent contact with George Bush after his election to Vice President , according to CIA operative Trento Parker .

Don C. Wiley Dr. Wiley disappeared November 15 , 2001 in Memphis , Tennessee .
He was attending a two - day annual meeting of the scientific advisory board of St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital .
His work on deadly diseases such as ebola and HIV raised fears of a terrorist kidnapping .
Four hours later , his rental car was found on a bridge , raising the question of suicide , which his family vehemently refuted .
Dr. Wiley was found a month later in the Mississipi River .
Salem bin Laden
In 1979 Bush business Arbusto Energy obtained financing from James Bath , a close family friend .
Bath had extensive ties to BCCI and the bin Laden family .
Bath was the sole U.S. business representative for Salem bin Laden , the brother of Osama bin Laden .
It is well known in certain circles that the Arbusto money came straight from Salem bin Laden , although Bush denies it .
Salem bin Laden died when for no apparent reason , he flew his airplane into power lines where it became entangled , and fell 150 feet to the ground .
" He was a very experienced pilot .
He was a good pilot .
We just can't understand why he decided to go right instead of left , " recalled airstrip owner Earl May field .
Thomas Morris Jr. Mr. Morris was a postal worker who died October 21 , 2001 , of inhalation anthrax .
When people expressed concern to the current occupant of the White House about the anthrax cases in New York and Washington , his response was to tell us not to worry , that he does not have anthrax .
Joseph Curseen Mr. Curseen died October 22 , 2001 , of inhalation anthrax .
It has been reported that the anthrax infections since September 11 are of the same strain that was kept in a military facility .
Kathy T. Nguyen Ms. Nguyen died on October 31 , 2001 , of inhalation anthrax .
But we should n't worry - George W. Bush remains anthrax - free .

She had been implicated in February in a phony passport scheme said to be related to the September 11 hijackers .
One day before she was due in court , she was incinerated in her car after having hit a utility pole .
An investigation revealed that the crash was minor and was not the cause of the fire that burned Smith beyond recognition .
Who was really behind 9/11 ?
Was Katherine Smith privy to that information ?
Why did she have to die , and who killed her ?

" I do n't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people -- this is not acceptable , " Brown said .
[ Reuters ]
–adjective
1. of , pertaining to , or causing death ; deadly ; fatal : a lethal weapon ; a lethal dose .
2. made to cause death : a lethal chamber ; a lethal attack .
3. causing great harm or destruction :
The disclosures were lethal to his candidacy .
As British PM Gordon Browne prepares to ignore the recommendation of his own Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and increase penalties for marijuana , he reveals once again how little he actually knows about the subject :
Any way you look at it , this is just a total lie .
The word " lethal " as defined by dictionary .com means the following :
Even the 3rd definition , which may be the one Browne intends , is essentially figurative and is only used to describe non-living things , in this case a political campaign .
The word is derived from the latin letalis , meaning death .
It 's just an incredibly poor adjective to describe a substance that has never killed anyone in human history .
He says he wants to " send out a message to young people , " but his message is just a big lie .
Thus , Browne is now expected to move forward with a plan to upgrade the criminal status of marijuana based on his own ignorant and wrong understanding of what the drug does , while disregarding the contrary advice of a whole council of experts who might actually know something about this .
This , my friends , is precisely how bad public policy gets made .
Restaurants could be forced to introduce a " traffic light " labelling system on menus to help curb rising levels of obesity , it was revealed to The Independent on Sunday last night .
Diners could be faced with green , amber and red circles to guide them to the healthiest dishes on the menu .
A green circle would show food is safe and advisable to eat , while amber foods should be eaten in moderation .
The unhealthiest food would carry a red circle warning of high fat , sugar and salt content and eaten only occasionally .
Supermarkets already follow a similar voluntary code , but some firms have refused to comply and show guideline daily amounts of ingredients ( GDAs ) instead .

Ministers are stepping up their anti-obesity campaign by considering a radical extension of the system to restaurant chains to persuade people to choose a healthier diet .
This month , New York will introduce a scheme forcing all chains of restaurants and fast food outlets to list calorie content next to their food .
The city argues it could prevent 30,000 cases of diabetes and reduce the number of people suffering from obesity by 150,000 over five years .
The Department of Health is watching the New York scheme closely and is actively considering a version for the UK .
It is hardening its policies on public health as obesity levels continue to rise .
Two - thirds of adults and a third of 10 - year - olds are classed as overweight or obese .
The Food Standards Agency has already held talks with some restaurant chains on a traffic light system .
The move is likely to face stiff resistance from the food industry , which would be forced to spend money updating menus .
It is also controversial for smaller chains because many dishes do not contain standardised levels of ingredients , while menus change from season to season .
McDonald's , which is affected by the New York regulations , said it was already having talks on introducing guidelines in the UK .
" We have provided nutritional information on our UK packaging since 2006 .
The information we provide is the nutritional value of the menu item and how it relates to daily nutrient recommendations ( GDAs ) .
We also provide the information on the back of all tray liners . "
In supermarkets , Asda and Marks & Spencer have agreed to the traffic light code , but Tesco claims the amber circle is too ambiguous and instead shows percentages of fat , sugar and salt in GDAs .
The Conservatives criticised the move .
Health spokesman Andrew Lansley said : " We 're in favour of giving people the information necessary to construct a healthy diet , but all we 've had from Labour so far is dithering and delays .
Food labelling must include GDAs , not just traffic lights .
We need to emphasise the importance of a good diet , not just a good or bad food . "
A Department of Health spokesman said it was considering the plan " in the future as part of a healthy food code of good practice " .
In 2006 , for the first time more money was spent on eating out than on meals cooked at home .

If a turret bitches about its job and nobody is around to hear it , does it make a sound ?
You bet it does .
“ A Day in the Life of a Turret ” catches two turrets on the job during a typical day at the Aperture Science Enrichment Center , and the monotony that lies within .

A British astronomer has discovered a strange spinning object .
The fact that it is spinning in itself is not strange , but the speed it is doing so has raised some eyebrows .
The near - Earth asteroid 2008 HJ has been spotted spinning at a rate of one rotation every 42.7 seconds , breaking the record for the fastest rotating natural object in the Solar System .
It is so fast that it has been designated as a “ super - fast rotator ” .
What makes this discovery even more interesting was that it was spotted by an amateur astronomer when using the Australian Faulkes Telescope South observatory , operating it remotely over the Internet , in his Dorset home in the south of the UK …
Asteroid 2008 HJ smashes the previous record for fastest rotating object by 35 seconds .
The previous record holder was asteroid 2000 DO8 ( discovered eight years ago ) with a rotational period of 78 seconds .
This new discovery comes from a new project funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , which gives UK schools and colleges access to the world - class Faulkes Telescopes based in Australia and Hawaii .
This finding is one of four recent successes in the search for small near - Earth asteroids under 150 meters in diameter .
In April this year , the first significant discovery by the project was of asteroid 2008 GP3 with a measured rotation period of 11.8 minutes .
Perhaps even more exciting than the discovery itself is who spotted asteroid 2008 HJ in the first place .
This is n’t a news release from the Australian observatory , it is n’t even an announcement from an academic institution ; the discovery was made by retiree Richard Miles from the comfort of his own home .
Miles is an amateur astronomer and vice - president of the British Astronomical Association ( BAA ) .
He was able to carry out his research via a remote connection to the Faulkes Telescope South on the other side of the planet , in the UK .
This charity based program enables enthusiasts and students to control the research - grade two - metre diameter telescopes , and the discoveries are coming thick and fast .
“ A discovery like this demonstrates the capabilities of amateur astronomers and school students to produce exciting scientific results if given the right tools .
By providing Richard with access to a big telescope we have smashed the previous record , and opened up the search for even faster objects to UK amateur astronomers and school students .
This helps to put all that classroom science , maths and IT to real use ! ” – Dr Paul Roche , Director of the Faulkes Telescope Project at Cardiff University , Wales
The finding of the 12×24 metre asteroid appears to be consistent with near - Earth asteroid theory , and many sub-minute period asteroids can be expected .
It ’s just that not very many have been discovered as yet , so with the help of UK schools and amateur astronomers , more can be expected to be found .
Near - Earth asteroids are a concern for the future of the planet as there are many Earth - crossing rocky bodies that could cause significant damage to us on the ground should one come our way .
Although the skies appear clear for now , our knowledge of these rogue objects is very limited .
It is generally understood that these spinning pieces of rock ( often weighing in at thousands of tonnes ) are fragments from ancient collisions in the early Solar System .
Projects such as Faulkes have an obvious advantage in increasing our knowledge in that it opens up observation time to a vast number of astronomers .

Attn : Dick Costolo , CEO
Dear Sir :
I ’ve become more and more alarmed by the threatening , harassing tweets bombarding people like GottaLaff and urge you to take them seriously .
One man who sends one tweet after another threatening her , even sending her a map of her neighborhood , forced her to resort to using a pseudonym on Twitter and he still does n’t stop .
Spam is bad enough but when one is verbally bashed and / or threatened it is not to Twitter ’s benefit and such tweets should not be ignored .
Just reporting or blocking them is n’t sufficient to stop their abuse ; they simply open a new account under a different name - as you know .
Surely Twitter can trace an account back to an IP address and demand that they cease such dangerous behavior .
I understand that tweets can be sent from IP addresses that are used by many people ( at cafes , for instance ) but there is such a thing as product liability .
I ’m urging you to hold the owners of such IP addresses responsible for the damage their users do .
Even bar owners who serve people after they are drunk are held responsible for the damage their customers do .
I ’ve enjoyed Twitter for a few years and want to continue to do so but such threatening behavior makes a pleasant experience completely abhorrent and there ’s a limit to the amount of such behavior I , and others , will accept .
Please develop a policy to identify & ban such people from the Twitter feed .
Twitter is an open forum for anyone who wants to tweet their mind .
That 's great .
I partake in a big way .
But when I get tweets -- daily , hourly , sometimes piling on one after the other -- that are abusive , insulting , viciously demeaning , hostile , and sometimes violent , then it 's time to take action .
Twitter sure does n't .
I know that for a fact , because I 've tried over and over again to convince them that in some cases , it stops being free speech and starts feeling like assault .
This post is not about cyber bullies , although they , too , are abusive ; I 've been harassed and smeared for years by one " progressive " who many of you became aware of and have since avoided .
This is about extremist trolls , who also happen to bully . ]
I regularly hear from right wing extremists , tea partiers , and total nutcases ( that 's not hyperbole , there are some very sick people out there ) .
When they 're civil , I simply ignore or block them , and even debate them once in awhile .
And yes , I admit to succumbing to occasional lapses of playing Whack a Troll just to share their ignorance with my followers , using as much snarky mockitude as I can muster up .
But then there are those who pop in repeatedly to suggest various activities that they want me to engage in -- with my own body or theirs -- and apply colorful words like c**t and suck my c**k , simply because they 've read my tweets and do n't agree with me .
I do n't know these people nor am I familiar with their accounts , but they get some kind of perverse pleasure out of following my threads and entering my stream with slurs , attacks , and irrational tirades .
Almost without exception , these trolls oppose me politically , and that 's fine .
But the intense hatred spewed by many of them is disruptive , highly offensive , and completely out of line .
There is a particularly rabid one who should be in jail or in a padded cell -- again , no hyperbole .
If I were to post screen grabs of his avatars , messages , and profile photos , you 'd literally want to gag .
My own husband could n't get through them .
Unfortunately , catching sight of them is unavoidable when they 're in my stream or when I go to block and report .
Imagine the most frantically vile , graphic images depicting blatant racism , anti-Semitism , misogyny , bigotry , and self - loathing .
They include explicit close - up photos of defecation and the most hard - core XXX porn you can imagine , abominable references , every kind of debasement of women and young men , degrading photos of celebrities and our president and first lady , you name it .
And the crude , twisted tweets he sends me match the vulgar visuals .
He has also opened accounts using my likeness ( taken from my Twitter account ) , as well as those of other high - profile liberals like Rachel Maddow , Lizz Winstead , John Fugelsang , Bill Maher , and Rosie O'Donnell , among others .
In short , he is an obsessed , deranged , seething , hostile , psychologically impotent ( and likely , physically ) conservative coward who consistently targets progressives , mostly women .
Here are semi-cleaned up , edited grabs of two of his tamer suspended accounts .
Trust me when I say , they get much worse than these :
This is one reason I stay anonymous .
It started when a stalker came to close , sending me a Google map of my neighborhood , so that was that .
This person has been suspended well over 500 times .
I 've reported him to Twitter well over 100 times , and finally contacted my local authorities as well as the FBI more than once .
But because he did n't threaten my life , they did nothing .
As I type this , he 's added at least three more Twitter accounts that I 'm aware of .
I 've endured this for years , literally .
Because of this , I felt it was time to put out a call to action .
Perhaps if enough of us demand more oversight from Twitter , especially those of us who are sick to death of being barraged with disgustingly offensive messages and photos , then maybe Twitter will take notice and do something .
It 's unimaginable that they can't devise a better system to rid Twitter of such filth .
By the way , when I tried to fill out one of their complaint forms , I did n't have a link to the offending tweet , so the form would n't go through .
I did n't have a link because I blocked him , and the account was immediately suspended so the tweet was no longer accessible .
So I 'm snail mailing them , and I 'm including about two dozen graphic screen shots of 93 of the suspended profiles I 've captured .
Here is the tweet :
Please share this post and contact Twitter .
It 's worth a shot to at least try to turn things around for once .
I 'm fed up with having to so much as glance at the malignancies that come my way .
Thank you .

Greenpeace took the consoles and controllers apart
Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo are not doing enough to eliminate potentially harmful chemicals and metals from their games consoles , Greenpeace has said .
The body examined materials used inside the Sony PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) , Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii .
Greenpeace said that while all three machines complied with European laws , the consoles still contained harmful materials that " needed to be replaced " .
Nintendo's environment policies were " non-existent " , Greenpeace added .
" Nintendo does n't have any environmental policies , " said Zeina Al - Hajj , Greenpeace 's International Toxic Campaign co-ordinator .
This is an industry that is changing our way of life and if it does not take these challenges upon themselves to be more green we are going to be in deep trouble very , very soon
Zeina Al - Hajj , Greenpeace " We were shocked with Nintendo ; it was our biggest surprise . "
Nintendo is ranked at the bottom of Greenpeace 's global assessment of " green " technology companies .
" Recently they added a list of certain commitments they have , which purely comply with legislation , " said Ms Al - Hajj .
The organisation has called on all technology firms to take immediate action to eliminate toxic chemicals from products .
The report found that the PS3 and 360 both contained " very high " levels of chemicals , called phthalates , which are used to " soften " flexible materials like wires and cable coatings .
They are not permitted in toys sold in Europe but under EU regulations games consoles are not classed as toys .
Ms Al - Hajj said : " We see a gap there .
For us this is still a toy .
" And whether or not it 's a toy , we do not want these chemicals in our products . "
The report found that all three consoles contained varying levels of the toxic element bromine , which is used as a flame retardant .
The presence of beryllium was found in both the PS3 and Xbox 360 .
The element is not banned under EU law but it has been linked to lung cancer when dust and fumes are created through some recycling processes .
A Nintendo spokesman told BBC News : " We fully comply with all the necessary EU Directives on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances aimed at environmental protection and consumer health and safety .
" Furthermore , in order to ensure our products are safe for use by young children we also take into consideration the standards applicable to toys . "
According to the United Nations Environment Programme 50 tonnes of hazardous e-waste is generated every year .
Greenpeace said it was concerned that there was no " safe way " to dispose of old consoles and called on games console makers to introduce return and recycle policies .
A spokesman for Sony said the firm had joined with other companies , Braun , HP and Electrolux , to establish the European Recycling Platform .
The consoles were dismantled at Greenpeace Research Labs at Exeter University Microsoft has committed to eliminating the use of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , which includes phthalates , and brominated flame retardants ( BFR ) by 2010 .
Nintendo has also committed to removing PVC from future products , but has not given a specific timeframe .
The Nintendo spokesman said : " We have endeavoured to eliminate the use of PVC by replacing it with other materials and other methods .
" However , we continue to use PVC in certain products such as AC adaptors , within the scope of regulations from the viewpoint of ensuring safety . "
Greenpeace criticised Sony for failing to agree to eliminate PVC and BFR from its games consoles , while at the same time pledging their removal from its mobile products .
Ms Al - Hajj said : " Sony has a very good record in our ranking guide .
They have committed to eliminating these chemicals from mobile devices .
" But why are we finding them in such high percentages in a console ?
This is a tool used by children in our homes .
" None of these chemicals exist in Sony 's Vaio laptop .
So if they can do it for a laptop , why can't they push this for the console also ? "
A spokesman for Sony told BBC News that the company would eliminate PVC and BFR from all of its products " as and when we are satisfied that we can produce products of equal Sony quality in all regards using new alternative materials " .
Ms Al - Hajj said the electronics industry needed take more responsibility .
" This is one of the most innovative industries we have on the planet .
" This is an industry that is changing our way of life and if it does not take these challenges upon themselves to be more green , we are going to be in deep trouble very , very soon .
" It is not enough just to comply with the law for such an industry . "
She said the European Union 's Restriction of Hazardous Substances ( RoHS ) directive was not strong enough .
" RoHS is not enough now to control the electronics industry .
" If they are pushed to putting the environment as the priority the electronics industries will come up with alternatives because they are technically capable . "
No-one from Microsoft was available for comment on the findings of the Greenpeace report .

What are these ?
Excerpts from the Preface :
This book contains programming experiments that are designed to reinforce the learning of discrete mathematics , logic , and computability .
It is the outgrowth of the experimental portion of a one - year course in discrete structures , logic , and computability for sophomores at Portland State University .
The course has evolved over the last ten years from a standard course into a course that uses programming experiments as part of the required activity .
Most of the experiments are short and to the point , just like traditional homework problems , so that they reflect the daily classroom work .
The experiments in the book are organized to accompany the material in Discrete Structures , Logic , and Computability , Second Edition , by James L. Hein .
In traditional experimental laboratories , there are many different tools that are used to perform various experiments .
The Prolog programming language is the tool used for the experiments in this book .
Prolog has both commercial and public versions .
The language is easy to learn and use because its syntax and semantics are similar to that of mathematics and logic .
So the learning curve is steep and no prior knowledge of the language is assumed .
In fact , the experiments are designed to introduce language features as tools to help explore the problems being studied .
The instant feedback provided by Prolog 's interactive environment can help the process of learning .
When students get immediate feedback to indicate success or failure , there is a powerful incentive to try and get the right solution .
This encourages students to ask questions like , " What happens if I do this ? "
This supports the idea that exploration and experimentation are keys to learning .
The book builds on the traditional laboratory experiences that most students receive in high school science courses .
i.e. , experimentation , observation , and conclusion .
Each section contains an informal description of a topic — with examples as necessary — and presents a list of experiements to perform .
Some experiements are simple , like using a program to check answers to hand calculations , and some experiements are more sophisticated , like checking whether a definition works , or constructing a small program to explore a concept .
About The Author(s )
Investment banks are machines for turning undergraduates into money .
They 're a talent vortex , a recruiting machine so well adapted that an entire school system has sprung up to feed it .
Banks take advantage of smart kids who think it 's time for an impressive job but are n't sure what to do .
They show up with cash in hand , practically pissing prestige , and offer a position guaranteed to keep the " complete fuck - up " scenario at bay .
Soon enough you 're 45 , rich , tired , and anxious about the Nikkei .
It helps that investment banking has a low barrier to entry , because that way the applicant pool grows from a handful of specialists to anyone who can think and talk at a high level .
Search costs are minimal : send a recruiter to each of the top schools and cherry pick their best programs .
Take care of the rest in a rigorous internal training program .
What we 're left with is an imbalance : talent leaning towards finance at the expense of everything else .
Of course , the job market is precisely that — a market — and we 've all learned not to begrudge an equilibrium .
But I 'm left to ask : is a society that sends so many of its brightest college graduates into a capital markets monkey pit maximizing welfare ?

Order This Issue Did We Know What Was Coming ?
by William Norman Grigg The September 11th terrorist attacks required extensive planning .
Our intelligence services knew enough to have responded better .
John Philip Walker Lindh , better known as the " American Taliban , " is accused of conspiring with Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network to kill American citizens .
According to the federal criminal complaint , Lindh 's role in the terrorist conspiracy " began in May or June of 2001 . "
It was then that Lindh " agreed to attend an al - Qaeda training camp for additional and extensive military training , knowing that America and its citizens were the enemies of bin Laden and al - Qaeda and that a principal purpose of al - Qaeda was to fight and kill Americans . "
While at the training camp , Lindh allegedly learned that " bin Laden had sent forth some fifty people to carry out twenty suicide terrorist operations against the United States and Israel . "
Significantly , the indictment does not accuse Lindh of actively participating in the terrorist plot .
During a visit with senior al - Qaeda official Abu Mohammad Al - Masri , the self - exiled American was invited to take part in " operations against the United States and Israel . "
Lindh allegedly declined to carry out terrorist missions , choosing instead to fight on the front lines of the Taliban 's civil war with its Northern Alliance rivals .
The case against Lindh rests heavily on proving that he had foreknowledge of al - Qaeda 's plot to commit mass murder .
To make that case it is not necessary to prove that Lindh actually killed Americans , or that he had specific knowledge regarding the target of the attack , or the means by which it would be carried out .
The burden on the prosecution is to validate its conspiracy theory against Lindh by proving that the defendant knew the attack was coming , and freely chose to associate with the terrorist cabal who plotted the atrocity .
Federal authorities will be much more eager to prosecute Lindh than to question how he was able to penetrate to the very core of Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network .
This eccentric , alienated California teenager fascinated with radical Islam managed to do what highly skilled intelligence professionals supposedly could not : Insinuate himself so deeply into al - Qaeda - even meeting " The Evil One " himself on one occasion - that he obtained critical intelligence about the forthcoming attack on America .
Lindh stands accused of hideous crimes .
But from the federal government 's perspective , Lindh is dangerous for another reason :
His success as an infiltrator underscores the consummate failure of our hugely expensive " intelligence community " to protect our nation from foreign attack .
But the trial could pose an even graver threat to the intelligence community if it prompts the public to think seriously about the charges against the " American Taliban . "
What if it can be demonstrated that federal authorities responsible for defending our nation knew as much about the impending terrorist attack as Lindh did ?
What would be the political , moral , and legal liabilities of officials who were in possession of such knowledge , and failed to act upon it ?
FBI Whistleblowers
As we will show , the feds knew no later than June that an attack from bin Laden was coming .
By August it had identified several key co-conspirators , and had one in custody .
And two days after the attack Chicago attorney David Schippers - a lifelong Democrat who was chief investigative counsel in the Clinton impeachment - disclosed that he had attempted to warn Attorney General John Ashcroft about the coming attack .
As previously reported in this magazine ( " OKC Bombing : Precursor to 9 - 11 ? " in our January 28 , 2002 issue ) , Schippers told a Pittsburgh radio audience on September 13th that he had learned from FBI agents in Minnesota and Chicago that a massive terrorist attack had been planned for lower Manhattan .
He had developed this information six weeks before the Black Tuesday atrocity .
However , Justice Department officials repeatedly spurned Schippers ' attempts to provide the information to Ashcroft ; one of them reportedly sneered , " We do n't start our investigations at the top . "
This is a curious objection , given Schippers ' credentials and professional standing - and given that Ashcroft himself had warned in June that " Americans are a high - priority target for terrorists . "
Three veteran federal law enforcement agents confirmed to T HE N EW A MERICAN that the information provided to Schippers was widely known within the Bureau before September 11th .
Because these individuals face possible personal or professional retaliation , they agreed to speak with us on condition of anonymity .
Two of them , however , have expressed a willingness to testify before Congress regarding the views they have shared with us .
" I do n't buy the idea that we did n't know what was coming , " a former FBI official with extensive counter - terrorism experience commented to T HE N EW A MERICAN .
" Within 24 hours [ of the attack ] the Bureau had about 20 people identified , and photos were sent out to the news media .
Obviously this information was available in the files and somebody was sitting on it . "
This former FBI agent noted that before Zacarias Moussaoui , the so - called " Twentieth Hijacker , " was detained in Minneapolis , he had undergone flight instruction in Oklahoma , " where we know that Arab terrorist networks have been established for many years . "
An active federal counter - terrorism investigator told T HE N EW A MERICAN that it was well known " all over the Bureau , how these [ warnings ] were ignored by Washington ....
All indications are that this information came from some of [ the Bureau 's ] most experienced guys , people who have devoted their lives to this kind of work .
But their warnings were placed in a pile in someone 's office in Washington ....
In some cases , these field agents predicted , almost precisely , what happened on September 11th .
So we were all holding our breath � hoping that the situation would be remedied . "
According to the former FBI agent quoted above , the Bureau could have prevented the Black Tuesday massacre if it had adequately investigated the Middle East connection to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .*
This assessment is supported by another former FBI agent who spoke with this magazine .
" We knew that there were Arab terrorist groups working in Oklahoma during the mid-1990s , but nothing was done about it , " he recalls .
" We were constantly getting information about terrorist groups working in the area , and it would be put in what was called a �zero file . '
Once you sent it in , you were never told to act on it .
And you were never told to follow up on it . "
Nor were the agents allowed to share that intelligence with state and local police : " We had a dissemination form that we could use in sharing intelligence with local law enforcement .
We 'd have to get clearance to give the information out .
And this led to a favorite saying of administrative people in the Bureau : � This is on a need to know basis , and the locals do n't need to know . ' "
" This is pretty appalling , " comments the first former agent .
" The FBI has had access to this information since at least 1997 .
We 're obviously not doing our job .
I never expected to see something like this happen in our country , but in a way I was n't shocked when it did .
There 's got to be more to this than we can see - high - level people whose careers are at stake , and do n't want the truth coming out ....
What agenda is someone following ?
Obviously , people had to know - there had to be people who knew this information was being circulated .
People like [ the Black Tuesday terrorists ] do n't just move in and out of the country undetected .
If somebody in D.C. is taking this information and burying it - and it's very easy to control things from D.C. - then this problem goes much , much deeper ....
It 's terrible to think this , but this must have been allowed to happen as part of some other agenda . "
Negligence - or Worse ?
When one talks of hidden agendas behind the official story of the Black Tuesday attack , he can expect to be denounced as a " conspiracy theorist . "
In fact , President Bush himself condemned such supposedly irresponsible talk during his November 10th address to the UN General Assembly .
" We must speak the truth about terror , " insisted the president .
" Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th - malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves , away from the guilty . "
The president 's denunciation of " conspiracy theorists " was echoed in a January 14th " news analysis " by James Rosen , a Washington correspondent for the McClatchy News Service .
" Even in the wake of unspeakable evil , some people can't leave bad enough alone , " groused Rosen .
" While the vast majority of Americans accept their government 's claim that Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network launched the attacks , a number of boisterous malcontents are peddling alternative explanations . "
It hardly detracts from the guilt of bin Laden and his henchmen to point out that there are plausible " alternative explanations " to the government 's account of Black Tuesday - namely , that our conscientious federal law enforcement and security agencies were caught completely off - guard by an attack they could not prevent .
There is evidence that the feds knew of bin Laden 's impending terrorist strike no later than June .
And we know for certain that by August , federal authorities had identified several key co-conspirators , and had one in custody .
On June 23rd , air industry officials received a remarkably detailed warning about a threat from Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network to use airliners to attack Americans .
Citing a report from the Arabic - language MBC satellite television channel , the AirlineBiz.com news service reported : " In recent years , U.S. citizens have found themselves the target of several attacks by the terror network of Osama bin Laden .
One such attack involved a plot to destroy 12 U.S. airliners in Asia .
A jury found Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , the alleged mastermind of the scheme , and two other defendants , guilty on all counts .
Yousef is also the alleged mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center .... "
The scheme to use jetliners as terrorist weapons , called " Project Bojinka , " had been uncovered by police in the Philippines in 1995 , and the details had been provided to American law enforcement officials .
( See " Could We Have Prevented the Attacks ? " in our November 5 , 2001 issue . )
The significance of bin Laden 's threats was not lost upon Bob Monetti , president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 , which was destroyed by a terrorist bomb in 1988 .
" I hope the airlines are watching this situation closely , " declared Monetti .
" The airlines are at risk .
They need to take all appropriate measures and counter - measures to ensure the safety of their passengers . "
According to the June 23rd AirlineBiz.com report , the Arabic satellite television network MBC claimed that " the next two weeks will witness a big surprise . "
An MBC reporter who had met with bin Laden in Afghanistan on June 21st predicted that " a severe blow is expected against U.S. and Israeli interests worldwide .
There is a major state of mobilization among the Osama bin Laden forces .
It seems that there is a race of who will strike first .
Will it be the United States or Osama bin Laden ? "
Despite such detailed advance warnings , bin Laden won that " race . "
Ignoring the " 20th Hijacker " By September 11th , federal authorities not only had 10 weeks ' advance notice of an impending attack from bin Laden , they also had one of the alleged plotters in custody .
This was acknowledged by CIA Director George Tenet as the 9 - 11 attack was underway .
Amid reports of the suicide hijackings , Tenet was overheard saying : " I wonder if it has anything to do with this guy taking pilot training . "
Tenet " was referring to Zacarias Moussaoui , who had been detained in August after attracting suspicion when he sought training at a Minnesota flight school , " observed the January 27th Washington Post .
After the suspect was taken into custody , " the FBI had asked the CIA and the National Security Agency to run phone traces on Moussaoui , already the subject of a five - inch - thick file in the bureau . "
According to the December 29th Minneapolis Star - Tribune , " Moussaoui raised suspicions at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Egan [ Minnesota ] " when he showed up in August for instruction in piloting jumbo jets .
He " first raised eyebrows when , during a simple introductory exchange , he said he was from France , but then did n't seem to understand when the instructor spoke French to him , " recalled the paper .
" Moussaoui then became belligerent and evasive about his background ....
In addition , he seemed inept in basic flying procedures , while seeking expensive training on an advanced commercial jet simulator . "
Flight school employees " began whispering that he could be a hijacker , " reported the February 8th New York Times .
John Rosengren , director of operations at the school , recalled that Moussaoui 's instructor was " concerned and wondered why someone who was not a pilot and had so little experience was trying to pack so much training into such a short time . "
" The more he was able to talk to him , the more he decided he was not pilot material , " observes Rosengren .
In addition , " There was discussion about how much fuel was on board a 747- 400 and how much damage that could cause if it hit anything . "
By this time , Moussaoui 's instructor had already scurried to a telephone to call the FBI 's Minneapolis office .
" Do you realize how serious this is ? " he asked an FBI agent during the August 15th phone conversation .
" This man wants training on a 747 .
A 747 fully loaded with fuel could be used as a weapon ! "
The FBI arrested Moussaoui the next day .
However , notes the Star - Tribune , " the Minneapolis agents were unable to persuade FBI lawyers in Washington , D.C. , to seek a warrant to search his possessions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires evidence that the suspect is an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist group . "
The frustrated field agents were trying to gather sufficient evidence to get a warrant when Moussaoui 's alleged co-conspirators piloted jetliners into the Trade Center towers and the Pentagon .
Charged with conspiracy to commit mass murder , Moussaoui is not the only member of the Black Tuesday plot whom federal authorities knew about .
On the morning of September 11th , noted the December 30th New York Times , " two people already identified by the government as suspected terrorists boarded separate American Airlines flights from Boston using their own names . "
Federal officials were also aware of a third hijacker , Hani Hanjour , who had come to the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) while studying at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in Phoenix .
Officials at the school had raised questions about Hanjour 's inability to speak English , the international language of aviation .
When they expressed concerns to the FAA , the agency stepped in to provide assistance - to Hanjour .
According to the Star - Tribune , " An FAA representative sat in on a class to observe Hanjour � and discussed with school officials finding an Arabic - speaking person to help him with his English .... "
Hanjour returned the favor by plowing American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon .
A Limited Inquiry ?
As Congress probes the security issues raised by the Black Tuesday attack , the investigation must be framed by a question similar to that dealt with in the " American Taliban " trial :
What did our federal security and intelligence agencies know of the impending attack , and when did they know it ?
Recall that Lindh supposedly learned of the terrorist plot in May or June of last year .
Evidence available in the public record makes it clear that the Justice Department and other branches of the federal government were aware of at least as much as Lindh is accused of knowing .
Unfortunately , Congress seems content thus far to defer to the White House 's desire to limit the scope and intensity of any inquiries into the tragedy .
In meetings and phone conversations with congressional leaders , President Bush and Vice President Cheney " expressed the concern that a review of what happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from the effort in the war on terrorism , " Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) told CNN .
Daschle promised that he would " limit the scope and overall review of what happened . "
Congressman Porter Goss ( R - Fla . ) and Senator Bob Graham ( D - Fla. ) , who head the intelligence committees in their respective houses of Congress , extended similar assurances as the joint congressional investigation began in February .
" This is not a who - shall - we - hang type of investigation , " stated Rep. Goss .
" It is [ a ] � where are the gaps in America 's defense and what do we do about it ' type of investigation " - a " forward - looking " inquiry intended to bring about needed reforms .
But without accountability , " gaps " will handicap even the most comprehensive security system .
As Washington Post columnist Howard Kurtz observed , " How can we prevent future attacks if we do n't understand how we missed the last one ? "
Those responsible for the lethal " intelligence failure " of September 11th must be made to answer for their inaction .
The congressional investigative panel has subpoena power .
It should use it to summon responsible figures from the FBI , CIA , National Security Agency , and other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies .
These officials should be subject to congressional scrutiny at least as severe as that being devoted to the actions of Enron officials - whose alleged crimes , serious as they may be , did not contribute to the death of thousands of American citizens .
In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee , CIA director Tenet " objected to the very word � failure ' in connection with the intelligence gathering ahead of the devastating surprise attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , " reported the New York Times .
" The director said the CIA knew �in broad terms ' last summer that terrorists might be planning major operations in the United States .
But , he said , �we never had the texture ' - meaning enough specific information - to stop what happened . "
Much the same can be said of John Walker Lindh :
He knew " in broad terms " that the attacks were coming , even though the specific " texture " was not explained to him .
For refusing to act to prevent the massacre , Lindh has been charged with conspiracy to murder Americans .
In contrast , the FBI and CIA , which had the same intelligence as Lindh , have been rewarded with generous budget increases .
Though administrators of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies would prefer to cloak the issue in self - serving euphemisms , Black Tuesday was - at best - a singular intelligence failure , for which those officials must be held responsible .
And if , as one of the above - quoted former FBI counter - terrorism agents suggests , efforts to prevent that attack were compromised because of covert " agendas " in Washington , Congress must be prepared to take even more serious action .
In any case , the American public must demand that Congress ask unpleasant questions about federal foreknowledge of the 9 - 11 atrocity - and that the inquiry unflinchingly follow the facts wherever they lead .

Using a Proof Assistant to Teach Programming Language Foundations , or , Lambda , the Ultimate TA .
April 2008 .
White paper .
In Fall 2007 , I taught an introductory course on logic and the theory of programming languages entirely in Coq .
The experience was quite demanding â€ ” for the students and especially for me !â € ” but the overall payoff in terms of student engagement and performance on exams far exceeded my hopes .
I am now convinced that this is the right way to teach programming language foundations and am working on course materials that will allow the approach to be replicated elsewhere .
Just this weekend I talked with someone about E - Learning , and he mentioned " immediate nonjudgmental feedback " as one of the main advantages of using computers in the classroom .
In the context of teaching logic and the art of constructing proofs this boils down to using proof - assistants as " personal TAs " .
This is what Pierce tried to do ( Paul will be pleased : Coq was the proof assistant Pierce chose ) , and this note describes his experiences and conclusions .
The teaching materials are available online , if you prefer to look at them and form your own opinion before reading Pierce 's conclusions ...

Anatomy of the Penis , Mechanics of Intercourse
This page presents information that most parents are not aware of at the time they make the circumcision decision .
Doctors usually do not provide this information .
If you are under 18 , we recommend that you share and discuss this information with your parents .
For a further look at this anatomy , including photographs , visit Circumstitions ( Hugh Young ) .
Hugh 's site also includes an excellent animation to illustrate retraction .
Dr John R. Taylor , co-author of two medical anatomical papers about the foreskin , explains the latest research at the Ridged Band website .
Fig .
1 . Intact adult penis
This illustration represents an average normal adult human penis .
The head of the penis ( glans ) has a covering , called the foreskin ( prepuce ) .
This covering folds in on itself , forming a double layer .
The foreskin is not a `flap ' of skin on the end of the penis , and it is not `useless ' or `redundant ' skin .
There is some natural variation in the length of the foreskin , which often covers a bit more or less of the glans than illustrated .
In an average circumcised adult man , the area of skin that is missing because of penile reduction surgery would , when erect and unfolded , measure approximately three by five inches , or a little smaller than a postcard .
That is about half the total skin of the penis .
Structures of the penis
The outer foreskin layer is a continuation of the skin of the shaft of the penis .

During erection , the ridged band forms ridges that go all the way around , about halfway down the shaft .

The frenulum , or frenum , is a connecting membrane on the underside of the penis , similar to that beneath the tongue .
Fig. 2 . Intact penis ( hidden structures shown ) .
The foreskin has twelve known functions .
They are : to cover and bond with the synechia so as to permit the development of the mucosal surface of the glans and inner foreskin .
to protect the infant 's glans from feces and ammonia in diapers .
to protect the glans penis from friction and abrasion throughout life .
to keep the glans moisturized and soft with emollient oils .
to lubricate the glans .
to coat the glans with a waxy protective substance .
to provide sufficient skin to cover an erection by unfolding .
to provide an aid to masturbation and foreplay .
to serve as an aid to penetration .
to reduce friction and chafing during intercourse .
to serve as erogenous tissue because of its rich supply of erogenous receptors .
to contact and stimulate the G - spot of the female partner .
The above list was compiled from various sources by George Hill .
Click here for more information about the skin system of the penis .
Fig. 3 : Erection process : Intact penis
When fully retracted , the foreskin is designed to cover essentially the entire penile shaft , yet is loose enough to " glide " .
The ridged bands are situated about halfway down the shaft , when the foreskin is retracted fully .
Note :
In some cases , a man may have difficulty retracting the foreskin .
This is not an indication for circumcision , because there are good alternative treatments available that preserve the structure and function of the foreskin .
Scientific references for information on this topic can be found in CIRP 's Circumcision Reference Library .

Penile stimulation
The most important components of the physical erogenous stimulation of the penis during foreplay and intercourse are the sensations from the foreskin , frenulum / frenar band , and glans .
These structures each have their own feeling , and each contributes in its own way to the man 's total experience of lovemaking .
It must be emphasized that emotional excitement is an extremely important component of sexual enjoyment , and intensifies the man 's perception of any physical sensations from his penis .
The foreskin has an inner and outer layer .
The outer foreskin layer contains nerve endings which respond to gentle touching during the early stages of sexual arousal .
This helps to trigger an erection .
The nerves of the inner and outer foreskin contribute to the experience of penile stimulation , up to and including orgasm .
These receptors are stimulated by stretching , or when the foreskin rolls over the surface of the glans during intercourse or masturbation .
( see ` the gliding mechanism , ' below ) .

These receptors are stimulated by stretching , or when the foreskin rolls over the surface of the glans during intercourse or masturbation .
( see ` the gliding mechanism , ' below ) .
The foreskin contains sensory receptors called Meissner corpuscles .
We believe that these nerves , similar to nerve endings in the fingertips , are there to provide pleasure , as well as fine sensory perception .
This seems to help a man to enjoy sex longer without ejaculating prematurely , because he can more easily tell when he is approaching the threshold of orgasm .

Stimulation of the frenulum and ridged band results in intense pleasurable feelings during arousal .
The ridged band consists of a number of " ridges " , described by Dr. John Taylor in his recent article .
Sensations from these structures during intercourse or masturbation are thought to be the primary trigger of orgasm in the intact male .
Dr. George Denniston writes :
The ridged bands , which are like horseshoes only in that they curve forward underneath toward the point where the frenulum attaches , can be found in several pictures in John 's paper .
There are some 20 concentric ridged bands which rub over the corona .
Each ridge has Meissner 's corpuscles , which respond to pressure , and they produce the sexual pleasure which no individual has a right to take away from another individual .
and results in intense pleasurable feelings during arousal .
The ridged band consists of a number of " ridges " , described by Dr. John Taylor in his recent article .
Sensations from these structures during intercourse or masturbation are thought to be the primary trigger of orgasm in the intact male .
Dr. George Denniston writes :
We believe that stimulation of the glans is most significant in the later stages of sexual intercourse , when penetration is deepest and emotions are running at their highest .
Sensations from the glans contribute to the quality of the sensual experience .
They are also apparently capable of triggering orgasm on their own , as would be the case in a circumcised man .
Fig .
4 . Circumcised adult penis Fig. 5 . The circumcised penis : Erect state Following circumcision , the foreskin of the penis has been cut away .
The surface of the glans has developed a thick , dry layer of keratin ( toughened skin ) , which makes it less sensitive to unwanted stimulation , but also less sensitive to the more subtle qualities of lovemaking .
All circumcised men have an annular scar on the shaft of the penis .
The location of the scar varies , from near the head to far down the shaft .
For some men , so much skin has been removed that erection becomes difficult and even painful .
This was one of the most common complaints reported by circumcised men in a recent poll . [ 11 ]
The gliding mechanism During intercourse the loose skin of the intact penis slides up and down the shaft of the penis , stimulating the glans and the sensitive erogenous receptors of the foreskin itself .
On the outstroke the glans is partially or completely engulfed by the foreskin .
This is known as the `gliding mechanism . '
The gliding mechanism is Nature 's intended mechanism of intercourse .
As such , it contributes greatly to sexual pleasure .
Also , since more of the loose skin of the penis remains inside the vagina , the woman 's natural lubrication is not drawn out to evaporate to a great extent , which makes sex easier without using artificial lubricants .
The prepuce is a highly innervated and vascularized genital structure .
It is entirely lined with the peripenic muscle sheet .
Specialized ecoptic sebaceous glans on the inner preputial surface produce natural emollients and lubricants necessary for normal sexual function .
The primary orgasmic triggers are found in the preputial orifice and frenulum .
When unfolded , the prepuce is large enough to cover the length and circumference of the erect penis and acts as a natural sheath through which the shaft glides during coitus .
Only the presence and functions of the prepuce allow for physiologically normal coitus to occur as designed by nature .
( Fleiss , Paul M ; Frederick Hodges .
" Nontherapeutic Circumcision Should not be Performed , " American Medical News , vol. 38 , no. 26 ( July 17 , 1995 ) : p. 16 . ) Fig. 6 . The gliding mechanism
Effects of penile reduction surgery ( circumcision ) on sexual intercourse
Although still pleasurable for the man , intercourse without the participation of the prepuce lacks the gliding mechanism .
The only source of stimulation is the glans rubbing against the wall of the vagina .
The sensations from the specialised receptors of the frenar band , frenulum and inner foreskin layer are missing .
" With intravaginal containment of the normal penis , the male 's mobile sheath is placed within the woman 's vaginal sheath .
It is impossible to imagine a better mechanical arrangement for non-abrasive stimulation of the male and female genitalia than this slick ' sheath within a sheath . '
Circumcision destroys this one sheath within a sheath . . .
I would hazard a guess , that dyspareunia [ painful intercourse ] is more common in the women whose husband is circumcised . . . one would be foolish to discount the circumcised male 's immobile penile skin sheath as an ancillary item contributing to vaginal , abrasive discomfort . . .
The male with a penis already moderately obtunded by circumcision may be less apt to use a condom , which he feels may further decrease his genital sensitivity . . . because most American males lack a facile prepuce , the period of foreplay and dalliance may be abbreviated in the rush to the intra-vaginal method of penile stimulation .
Both these factors conceivably could be of significance in increasing the rate of venereal disease , including AIDS . . . "
( Say No to Circumcision !
40 Compelling Reasons Why You Should Respect His Birthright and Leave Your Son Whole ( 2nd edition ) , by Thomas A. Ritter , MD , Hourglass Book Publishing 1996 )
If the surgery was performed on an infant , by adulthood a relatively thick keratin layer will have formed on the normally skinless mucosal surface of the glans , which further reduces the stimulation .
If the circumcision was performed as an adult , the keratin layer will form , and the sensitivity of the glans will gradually be reduced over time .

( * Note : this post / series originally ran in March , 2007 but is a good introduction / refresher to Peak Oil issues -- if you 're new to this , read this piece and / or Gail 's Peak Oil Overview in the top menu bar )
If you 're like me , you might have spent a moment or two in recent months pondering how billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens , oil banker Matthew Simmons , and many others are suggesting that the world is reaching Peak Oil now , and at the same time , Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) headed by Pulitzer Prize writer Daniel Yergin , and others such as Exxon Mobil , are not predicting a Peak in global oil production until circa 2040 followed by a slow gradual decline .
How can such smart and successful people disagree by decades on a topic so vital ?
Is it possible they use different data sources ?
Do they mean different things when they say " Peak Oil " ?
Do they get different secret handshakes from Saudi princes ?
Do they have different agendas ?
Are they using different boundaries of analysis ?
Is one of them kidding ?
This 3 part post will address how people can differ so much on something so important as a peak and subsequent decline in world oil availability , addressing both factual and psychological reasons .
Does the world have plenty of oil ?
Maybe , but as I will discuss below the fold , this is not among the questions we should be asking .
Part
One is a general background and history on why people can disagree so much on peak oil .
Part
Two will explore the many factual areas that are confusing and lead to different conclusions .
Part
Three will look at social and psychological reasons for disparate opinions on this critical topic .
BIG PICTURE
Humans like to eat and have sex ( 1 ) .
We also are designed to compete with each other and other species for resources ( 2 ) ( 3 ) .
This function of population times demand will continue to increase , ceteris paribus .
We live on a planet subject to natural laws .
The procurement of oil , a finite resource critical to our globally interconnected society , follows the general laws of diminishing return , - more ' heat loss ' occurs as we find and pull out the more difficult oil .
Technology is thus in a battle with depletion , and so far depletion is winning .
What once returned over 100:1 on an energy investment is now below 20:1 .
( 4&5 ) The ease of finding , harvesting , refining and distributing liquid fuels to society , will continue to decrease over time , ceteris paribus .
Yet we continue to rely on abstract ( fiat ) accounting methods to measure our real resource base - furthermore , the debt and credit that allow the world economic system to grow are increasing exponentially , while at the same time the real economic driver , cheap availability of high flow rate liquid fuels , is becoming more scarce .
Peak oil , as will be discussed below , has many definitions .
Simply put , it is about the intersection of the above two trends .
It represents the general time frame when human demand for the energy services derived from oil will permanently diverge from our capacity to provide them .
In effect , though the resources exist , we will not be able to afford the prices necessary to procure them for a global democracy .
Modern human culture , capitalism , globalization , food production , and essentially all aspects of life as we know it ( unless * we * are Amish , 3rd world , or off - the - gridders ) , centers around oil , electricity and natural gas .
Peak Strawberries or Peak Snapple obviously would n't be as big of deal .
Peak Oil is not a theory .
It is a fact .
Only the timing , magnitude , and implications are open to interpretation .
How we interpret them should be a top priority for us individually and collectively .
This post addresses why there are so many disparate opinions on this subject - many are concerned - many are unconcerned - many flip / flop from being concerned to unconcerned , etc .
Why ?
PRE -AMBLE
There exists considerable rancor between increasingly polarized groups on this topic .
Many names for the two camps have been used : cornucopians / doomers , optimists / pessimists , pollyannas / cassandras , etc .
I prefer to group them as the ' relatively unconcerned ' and ' relatively concerned ' , as it is the level of concern that will motivate near term actions and policies .
So far , the ' unconcerned ' group ( which includes the ' unaware ' ) comprises the vast majority of the population .
I obviously am in the ' concerned ' camp .
For people interested in my motives , here they are : - I am getting my Ph.D. in Ecological Economics specializing in the energy / human nature side of the Peak Oil problem .
Like my fellow Oil Drum contributors , I offer my time freely because I believe this issue needs to be urgently addressed , especially at the regional , local and community levels , due to the long time lag between policy change and meaningful response .
Neither the mainstream media nor the scientific community have connected enough dots to communicate the urgency with which this problem needs to be addressed .
My writing here is an attempt to get people in macro-policy and decision - making positions to think in ways that exposure to typical media and stimuli - laden schedules may not elicit .
If my efforts result in a slight course change of current misguided energy and environmental policy or help citizens or communities better prepare , the effort will have been worthwhile ( and , if I should randomly receive an email from a single , attractive off - the - grid farmer , I would view that as a positive externality ( female only pls ... )
AND NOW , A WORD FROM THE UNCONCERNED
CERA and Exxon are probably the most vocal oil optimists ( not all oil companies are inherently optimistic , as evident by some Chevron and Shell ads ) .
Here are three recent reports and interviews by CERA and Peter Jackson :
Some of the main points of these pieces include :
Based on a detailed bottom - up approach , CERA sees no evidence of a peak before 2030 .
Global production eventually will follow an undulating plateau for one or more decades before declining slowly .
Global resources , including both conventional and unconventional oil , are adequate to support strong production growth and a period on an undulating plateau .
We hold that aboveground factors will play the major role in dictating the end of the age of oil .
Despite his valuable contribution , M. King Hubbert ’s methodology falls down because it does not consider likely resource growth , application of new technology , basic commercial factors , or the impact of geopolitics on production .
His approach does not work in all cases — including on the United States itself — and cannot reliably model a global production outlook .
For example , production in 2005 in the contiguous 48 states in the United States was 66 % higher than Hubbert projected .
The peak oil theory causes confusion and can lead to inappropriate actions and turn attention away from the real issues .
Corporations , governments , and other groups , including nongovernmental organizations , need to have a coherent description of how and when the undulating plateau will evolve so that rational policy and investment choices can be made .
It is likely that the situation will unfold in slow motion and that there will be a number of decades to prepare for the start of the undulating plateau .
A FEW WORDS ON WHY THE CORNUCOPIAN THEORY FALLS DOWN
Before I add my own thoughts to this debate , here are some recent rebuttals of CERAs claims , predictions and analysis :
Some of the main points of these posts include :
CERA conflates reserves with resources
CERA conflates productive capacity with productive flows
CERA misprepresents what King Hubbert modeled , and how subsequent modelers use linearization methods .
Approximately 50 countries have already peaked , more are peaking or about to peak ( China , Mexico )
peaked , more are peaking or about to peak ( China , Mexico )
So far the discovery forecast that CERA uses from the USGS is 77 % too optimistic ( see here )
CERA 's track record on individual countries is poor because its been too optimistic ( see here )
CERA needs to publish production intervals ( i.e. a lower bound + a higher bound ) not just production capacity .
The Hubbert high forecast was spot on for the lower - 48 ( 1 % error on the 2005 cumulative production after 40 years ! )
Unconventional sources are slow sources of oil ( low flow rates )
The Super - giant fields with high flow rates are dying ( Ghawar , Cantarell , Burgan etc. )
Reserve growth remains unproven at the world level and is based on observed reserve growth for the US ( Attanasi et al. ) which is likely biased due to the inclusion of censored statistics
CERA fails to acknowledge ( or realize ) that the long list of ' above ground factors ' exist precisely because of increased geologic constraints on ' below ground resources '
The best technology in the world and higher prices did little to change the production profile of the United States , which peaked in production in 1970 .
MAN ON THE STREET
As with my last article on discount rates , I thought I 'd include an interview with one of my friends , who happens to be an energy broker at a middle - tier Wall Street firm .
His name is John ( not really ) .
Nate : Yo Johnny - how 's it going ?
John : Not lousy Nate .
I 'm sure your environmental friends are dancing a jig on this TXU deal but they are going to be singing a different tune in 2009 - 2010 .
Nate :
Why is that ?
John :
They defeated the construction of new coal plants .
Texas needs that energy man - there are going to be blackouts in a few years and not just sporadic ones .
Someone else will have to build those coal plants .
Nate : I did n't know that - perhaps we can talk more about that another time .
I 'm writing another Oil Drum piece .
Did you ever read my last one on how we steeply value the present over the future ?
John :
Um , I actually started it then got called away -
It looked real good .
But maybe you should put the summary points up top so busy people can get the special sauce without spending 20 minutes trying to read everything - you are kind of wordy you know .
Nate :
Thanks for that .
So what do you know about CERA - I am thinking about writing a piece criticizing their criticism of Peak Oil .
Are they respected ?
Do your clients talk about their research ?
John :
They are respected .
Probably upper 25 % .
Real mensa types .
Nate :
How can they realistically disregard net liquids and flow rates and instead focus only on productive capacity , which in the end is basically just an academic exercise ?
John :
Hey man - they are not policy wonks - they try and make money for their clients and thus themselves .
CERA is a cash cow for IHS Energy .
Their clients think the same way mine do - their long term strategy is to make short - term profits .
So if they paint the oil picture a certain way thats advantageous to their clients , they make money .
And it 's all about money man .
And what do you mean , net liquids ?
Nate : Actually it 's not all about money .
But thats a different topic .
Do your clients agree with the cornucopian rhetoric behind those recent peak oil denial reports from CERA ?
John : Cornucopian rhetoric ?
Man have you turned into a philosopher or something ?
Like I said , my clients are looking at how to make money in the oil markets over the next 6 months .
They realize Peak Oil probably is for real but still view it from an investment perspective , not a life perspective .
My smartest clients think that CERA is using 2007 geology with 1970 cost structures and 2050 technology in their projections - but the story still sells .
CERA has smart people but they 're definitely drinking the kool - aid .
Nate :
Do your clients understand net energy ?
That producing energy requires energy and this comes out of a shrinking pool as the quality resource depletes ?
John : I think less than 5 % of the street thinks of things that way , and most of those are the analysts .
The ethanol debate started people thinking about net energy but most everyone still thinks in dollar terms .
Nate :
But do n't they realize that oil is finite and dollars are not , meaning this increase in oil prices is going to accelerate once we permanently cross peak in net oil available for purchase ?
John :
There is the beginning of such conversations .
Obviously with $ 60 oil , the E&P sector should be printing money , but alot of companies ' costs are going up more than their revenues .
New finds of oil are really expensive , especially domestically .
Chevron , with all the hoopla a few months back , has still not sanctioned Jack II .
I 'm guessing it 's cost related .
Nate :
But do you thi ---( phone rings )
John : Nate buddy .
I gotta hop .
This is one of those clients whose long - term strategy is short - term profits .
Later .
Nate : Bye
REASON #1 - THE PHRASE " PEAK OIL " MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
When someone says ' oil has already peaked ' or ' peak is n't until 2020 ' , what do they mean ?
Peak Oil can ( and will ) have many definitions .
It would benefit policy debates and discussions if there were a universal , agreed - upon definition .
The most common is the year in which global crude oil production reaches its maximum sustained level , followed by a permanent decline .
Some ( Ken Deffeyes ) define Peak as the date when 50 % of the world 's oil has been used irrespective of the annual flow rate ( presumably , we could have used 50 % + of our oil and still have rising production if technology is allowing us to borrow from what would have been a bell shaped curve . )
Other definitions differ in what is included as ' oil ' .
The most restrictive includes only oil graded as " Light Sweet " .
More common definitions include condensate and Natural Gas Plant Liquids ( NGPL ) .
Still broader definitions include the heavy oils , the Orinoco oil sands , and the Alberta tar sands .
And the broadest measure of ' what is oil ' might include corn and sugarcane turned to ethanol , palm nuts turned to biodiesel , and coal turned to diesel fuel .
This is referred to as " All liquids " and is what is commonly reported as total oil production in the media .
Ultimately , we want oil for the energy services it provides .
None of us should care about how much daily or annual gross oil production of this and that there is , other than these statistics being precursors to a more important statistic : net liquids available to the non-energy , non-governmental sectors of society .
This is the oil that is able to ' do work ' for the world economy .
As I will discuss in Part Two , gross statistics are misleading on three counts : 1 ) NGPL and ethanol have lower BTU content than crude oil yet are counted the same 2 ) procuring energy requires energy - a low energy requirement product is counted the same as a high energy input product and 3 ) following best first principles , depletion eventually overtakes technology , until one day an energy break - even point is reached in the extraction of a resource , irrespective of price .
Thus future projections that assume oil in 2040 has the same ability to do work for society , after its energy costs have been subtracted will prove to be optimistic .

SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS WHY PEOPLE DISAGREE ON PEAK OIL

As miracles go , it is hardly in the same league as turning water into wine .
But Michael Cartwright was still pretty impressed when Jesus appeared in the foil wrapping of his cider bottle down at the pub .
Scroll down for more ...
Michael Cartwright discovered the face of Jesus on his bottle of cider
" When I saw it I got goose pimples , " 35 - year - old Mr Cartwright said yesterday .
" I have no doubt it is the face of Jesus .
You can even see his beard and hair . "
Mr Cartwright , a taxi driver from Darlington , noticed the extraordinary image while drinking with a group of friends at his local , the Tanners Hall .
" As the barmaid removed the cap to the cider I suddenly realised what was staring back at me , " he added .
One of Mr Cartwright 's friends took a photograph .
It was only the following morning that he realised how clear the image was .
But by then it was too late to retrieve the bottle .
" It ended up getting collected by a barmaid when no one was paying attention and thrown away , " said Mr Cartwright .
Scroll down for more ...
Drinkers at the Darlington pub were amazed to see the face at the top of the cider bottle

Had they only held on to the bottle it could have been worth considerably more than the £ 2.49 it cost over the bar .

Jesse Ventura has been surfing in Mexico , learning about revolution .
Metropolitan Police Department officials said yesterday patrol officers will be issued assault rifles by the summer , after policies on their use are released this month .
The Washington Times reported Wednesday that the department is arming the officers with the rifles as part of a national trend to protect them from criminals with increasingly powerful weapons .
Assistant Chief Joshua Ederheimer said the department has spent the past year converting 500 AR - 15 rifles from fully - automatic to semi-automatic and drafting training curriculum and policies governing the weapons .
“ We did n’t want to rush these out on the street , ” he said .
“ I think the department acted prudently . ”
Police in Miami and Los Angeles already use the weapons , and Chicago police have plans to use them in the near future .
Prince George ’s and Montgomery counties also give officers the option of carrying them .
Chief Ederheimer said the department has 352 officer trained to use the weapons and is prepared to train more , despite criticism from the police union that some tactical officers who already carry the weapons have been unable to get re-certified to use them .
Officer Scott Fike , a canine handler , said his certification for the AR - 15 expired in the past three months and was told he cannot re-qualify because the department does not have ammunition .
Officer Fike , speaking for the union that represents D.C. officers , said he is concerned about special police units , which already have the weapons , because if those officers cannot get re-certified they must surrender their weapons .
“ If [ special units ] do n’t have them , that just cuts deeper into them not having them in the streets , ” he said .
Kristopher Baumann , chairman of the labor committee that represents D.C. officers , also expressed concern about the department ’s repeated delays in distributing the weapons .
Chief Ederheimer acknowledged the department has no practice ammunition , but said higher - quality street ammunition is instead being used and that no certifications have been cancelled .
He also said the program started more recently than five years ago , with the military - surplus guns arriving in spring 2007 .
D.C. Council member Phil Mendelson , at large Democrat , said he would not oppose the decision to use assault rifles , but is skeptical that criminals are using more powerful weapons .
“ I do n’t think the firepower has gotten much higher , ” said Mr. Mendelson who heads the council ’s committee on public safety .
“ I think it ’s an easy argument to make to justify more armaments . ”
The department did not respond for a second day to a request for data on the types of weapons used in crimes in the District .
Concerns about D.C. officers using excessive force surfaced after the city lowered standards in police recruiting in 1989 and 1990 .
City officers fatally shot 12 people in 1998 , and the department led the country in fatal shootings in the 1990s .
However , the number of fatal police - involved shootings was five or fewer each year from 1999 to 2006 , according to a report from the D.C. police department .
Last month , the department qualified to end a seven - year , voluntary Justice Department oversight of incidents in which officers used their weapons or other forms of force in the line of duty .
The department is now investigating the conduct of two officers who this month were exonerated by federal investigators in the fatal shooting of 14 - year - old DeOnte Rawlings , whom they suspected in the theft of a mini- bike .

Prosecutors have long been shielded from lawsuits brought by people who were wrongly convicted .
Even if a defendant is later shown to be entirely innocent , the prosecutor who brought the charges cannot be held liable for the mistake .
The Supreme Court has ruled that “ absolute immunity ” is needed so that prosecutors -- and judges -- can do their jobs without fear of legal retaliation .
But a California case that the high court is considering taking could open a back door for such lawsuits .
Prosecutors in Los Angeles are urging the court to block a suit from a man who was wrongly convicted of murder because , they say , it will allow “ a potential flood ” of similar claims across the nation .
Last year , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals set off alarms among prosecutors in the West when it ruled that supervising prosecutors could be sued for alleged management failures that led to a wrongful conviction .
Its ruling cleared the way for Thomas L. Goldstein to sue former Los Angeles Dist .
Atty .
John K. Van de Kamp .

The suit does not allege that Van de Kamp , the county ’s chief prosecutor from 1975 to 1983 , played a direct role in Goldstein ’s wrongful conviction for a shotgun murder in Long Beach in 1979 .
Indeed , Van de Kamp said he was unaware of the details of this case until decades later when the conviction was reversed .
Rather , the suit alleges that Van de Kamp and his top deputy , Curt Livesay , failed to set up a system to monitor the use of testimony from jail informants .
The Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office , the nation ’s largest prosecution office , once made regular use of jail informants , but at the time it had no system for sharing information among prosecutors countywide about which informants were reliable and what they had been promised .
Goldstein was ordered released after 24 years in prison after the sole eyewitness recanted and doubts emerged about a supposed confession by Goldstein to an informant .
Years after his conviction , Goldstein learned that his jailhouse accuser -- a three - time felon -- had lied in court when he denied having received promises of special treatment from another county prosecutor in exchange for his testimony .

“ This suit is 29 years in the making , and it ’s about accountability , ” said Goldstein . " [ It ] will put every prosecutor ’s office on notice that they need a system for sharing information .
And by doing so , it will result in fewer wrongful convictions . ”
In 1982 , Van de Kamp was elected California attorney general .
He served two terms .
He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 and has been a lawyer in private practice in Los Angeles since .
“ I had never been sued in all my years in public office .
But if this were the law , defense lawyers and civil counsel would be suing all the time .
You can always allege a ‘ failure to train ’ or a management failure , ” Van de Kamp said .
Though Van de Kamp is personally named in the suit , legal experts said Los Angeles County would pay any judgment if Goldstein won .
Public officials sued in the course of duties are indemnified by their agencies .

“ John is not paying a dime , ” said Laurie Levenson , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
Regardless , the immunity rule should be preserved as an important judicial safeguard , Levenson said .
“ We do n’t want [ prosecutors ] looking over their shoulders .
In order to be independent and to make tough calls , they ca n’t be worrying about whether they will be sued . ”
Prosecutors are not immune from all sanctions .
The state bar can discipline them for violating the code of conduct .
And outside the courtroom , they open themselves to lawsuits if , for example , they make inflammatory statements to the press .
In December , Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley , the California District Attorneys Assn. and the National District Attorneys Assn. joined lawyers for Van de Kamp in petitioning the Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit ’s ruling .
They said the appellate ruling was a dramatic shift in the law .
Complaints against prosecutors could easily become management - related suits against supervisors , they argued .
Advertisement
W. Scott Thorpe of the California D.A. group said the ruling created a perverse situation in which absolute immunity would shield a trial prosecutor who committed an “ intentional violation of civil rights ” yet a supervisor could be held personally liable for “ unintentional violations ” related to policies .
The justices may announce as soon as Monday whether they will hear Van de Kamp vs. Goldstein .
If the court takes up the case , it will be argued in the fall .
If the appeal petition is rejected , leaving the 9th Circuit ’s decision in place , lawyers for Goldstein plan to question Van de Kamp and Livesay , also named in the suit , under oath .
The lawyers want to determine what steps , if any , were taken in the 1970s to protect defendants from false testimony from jailhouse informants .
In 1972 , the Supreme Court overturned a man ’s conviction in a forgery case because an unwitting prosecutor had told the jury that a business partner had not been promised anything in exchange for his testimony .
In fact , an assistant prosecutor had promised the business partner that he would escape prosecution if he testified for the government .
In its ruling , the high court said “ the prosecution ’s office is an entity , ” and it had a duty to disclose the full truth about its dealings with informants .
Advertisement
Lawyers for Goldstein say that ruling in Giglio vs. United States put prosecutors on notice of their responsibilities .
“ An informant has a huge incentive to make up a story , to say they heard the defendant confess .
That ’s what was going on here , ” said David McLane , a lawyer in Pasadena .
“ It seemed like every murder case in Los Angeles in the 1970s had testimony from a jailhouse informant . ”
“ As to whether the district attorney had knowledge of what happened , that ’s not the issue in this case , ” he added .
Van de Kamp sees a note of irony in the situation .
He is the chair of the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice , a group set up to prevent wrongful convictions .
It has pressed for a law that would require corroboration before testimony from a jailhouse informant could be used in a criminal trial .

The Legislature approved such a bill last year , but it in October Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it .
He called the measure “ unnecessary ” because this “ perceived problem . . . arises in very few criminal cases . ”

Revelation ( the final book of the New Testament ) and Nostradamus ’ Prophecies are two all - purpose befuddling works .
If you want to sow fear , uncertainty , and doubt ( or simply yank people ’s chains ) , simply claim that some prominent person or recent event corresponds to descriptions that presage the end of the world , as elaborated by Revelation or Nostradamus .
After all , comparatively few people have read either of those works ; most people just have some vague idea that they describe , in detail , a coming apocalypse and the signs that will herald its imminent arrival .
So pick your target , make up a list of reasons to explain how it supposedly matches up with end - of - the - world predictions , and watch the process of bewilderment begin .
( We saw this happen in spades with bogus Nostradamus prophecies immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks . )
The item quoted above , linking presidential candidate Barack Obama with the figure of the anti-Christ , is more of the same type of denigrative fiction .
Contrary to popular belief , the New Testament book of Revelation ( not “ Revelations , ” as it is commonly rendered ) does not provide a laundry list of signs for identifying the appearance of an anti-Christ .
In fact , it neither uses the term “ anti-Christ ” nor describes such a figure ; Chapter 13 of that book merely recounts the appearance of “ beasts , ” who are depicted in animalistic terms ( as rendered in the King James version of the Bible ) :
And I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns , and upon his heads the name of blasphemy .
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed : and all the world wondered after the beast .
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ?
Who is able to make war with him ?
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
If any man have an ear , let him hear .
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword .
Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men , And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live .
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
Here is wisdom .
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .
The term “ anti-Christ ” is mentioned several times in the first and second letters of John , but none of those passages specifically describes or identifies the anti-Christ figure ( other than as a denier of the divinity of Jesus ) :
Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ?
He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh .
This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Nothing in the Bible , in Revelation or elsewhere , describes the anti-Christ as being “ a man , in his 40s , of Muslim descent . ”
In fact , since the book of Revelation was complete by the end of the second century , yet the religion of Islam was n’t founded until about four hundred years later , the notion that Revelation would have mentioned a “ Muslim ” at all is rather far - fetched .
( And even if it did , it could n’t be construed as a reference to Barack Obama , since he is n’t a Muslim . )
A July 2009 video purportedly demonstrating how “ Jesus revealed the name of the anti-Christ ” to be “ Barack Obama ” was publicized by the disreputable WND web site :
Salon pointed out some of the questionable linguistic manipulations employed in the video and noted that :
The linguistic twists needed to produce the whole theory give away the game .
Once you start playing around with language and deliberate mistranslations , of course , it ’s not too hard to come up with something that fits whatever preconceived notions you may have already had .
“ It would take us about a half an hour to come up with a crackpot theory , and we can make just about anybody into either the Messiah or the Antichrist ” by picking and choosing words from the Bible , [ Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz , president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College ] says .
“ [ The video ] does n’t hold up even within its own silly logic , ” Ehrenkrantz says .
In essence , the whole video seems to be the political conspiracy theory equivalent of taking a phrase and running it back and forth among different languages in Babelfish until it becomes gibberish .
The Biblical citation most relevant to this issue might not be one from Revelation , but rather this passage from the Gospel of Matthew : “ Watch out for false prophets .
They come to you in sheep ’s clothing , but inwardly they are ferocious wolves . ”
AMERICANS EMBRACING THE IRON FIST OF TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT
By : Devvy
May 26 , 2008
ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
Despite the massive , overwhelming documentation proving that elite groups around the world have been planning the complete annihilation of this constitutional republic for a more than a hundred years , Americans continue to deny , deny , deny .
Let me give you this example .
It 's an email I received a few days ago regarding a January 7 , 2005 , column I wrote titled , President Bush supporting global communist domination :
" That is the most absurd statement I have ever heard and you fail to detail just how this is transpiring .
Either you are outright ignorant or you are joking .
Communism is the exact opposite of what Georgie boy stands for .
He is a capitalist and has tried to kill suspected terrorist communist Hugo Chavez .
How in hell do you equate Bush with communism ?
You are too absurd to even bother with ! "
I politely directed him to two columns for research : The Proper Role of America 's Military and The Praetorian Guard .
Of course , this person never bothered to get the facts from them because he addressed me as Sir in a snit he fired off :
" Sir , I have three graduate degrees , taught history and education courses in colleges and am 67 years old and I have done more research than you can even imagine .
I eschew lying television news but you sound like a Fox bred brat .
Do n't tell me to do any more research , yours was faulty and at some two bit college no doubt .
I am a big ten man .
Get lost with your bunk ! "
Wow !
He 's a big ten man !
It is just this level of ignorance and denial that has allowed the destroyers to bring this nation to the brink of ruin and a police state .
A closed mind is a dangerous weapon .
This country is full of Americans who also suffer from a mass case of infantilism .
A couple of months ago a man who identified himself as a college professor wanted me to review his book .
While I am sincerely flattered , it 's impossible for me to read every request from individuals who write books .
My Reading Room has a list of books I have read which I need to update it because I 've read another hundred books since the posting .
In any event , when I politely declined , this author sent me a snotty email telling me I was making a big mistake , his book had facts no one else had !
Just like a little kid who can't have his way .
Hundreds , if not thousands of writers and investigative journalists have been pumping out the facts on the implementation of a one world government .
We have exposed the players , the organizations and the politicians .
We have exposed the corrupt " mainstream " media ( print and electronic ) , including cable networks ( MSNBC , FAUX , CNN ) who lie through omission and openly support those who are carrying the water for the global lunatics .
Our biggest cannon has been the Internet .
This tool has allowed us to reach millions of Americans with the truth and we will continue to do so .
However , the bottom line as I have said so many times before is that only we the people can stop these united States of America from becoming part of a global region is by rejecting the agenda .
The mendacity by these evil individuals world wide pushing globalization down our throats has been incredible .
The program adopted to bring these plans to fruition has worked beyond their wildest dreams because tens of millions of Americans have allowed it to happen either through laziness , blind party loyalty , indifference and apathy .
However , as time has gone by and conditions worsen for the American people , millions are waking up .
Sadly , many more millions are willing to surrender their freedom and liberty for scraps from the King 's table .
In my last column , I strongly recommended that people read an assessment by my dearest friend , retired USAF Brigadier General Ben Partin , titled , Deadly Failures in Intelligence Analysis and Defense Preparedness .
Ben is no lightweight ; his bio is in the link .
There is a three volume tome on the communist blueprint for world domination titled ' The Program , ' which Ben and I discussed at great length when I was at his home a week ago in Virginia .
I have been pounding on this for years in my columns .
Copies of these three books are hard to find and cost more than a $ 100 dollars per book .
This work titled , ' The Communist International , ' is broken down into time periods .
It was issued under the Royal Institute of International Affairs .
This organization touts itself as a home for " forward thinking . "
Another global operation .
Beware the forward thinkers and progressives .
They are dangerous to freedom .
The Communist Party USA is alive and well in this country .
They are working to over throw our constitutional republic .
They consistently endorse Democrat candidates like Al Gore and John Kerry .
Right now they 're leaning towards a fellow comrade , Barack Obama .
The Sixth Congress put on by the commies over in Moscow made clear their goals and there has never been any retreat despite the massive propaganda thrown at the American people - " Take down that wall , Mr. Gorebechev ! "
Reagan had nothing to do with the collapse of the Soviet Union .
From the main U.S. Marxist web site :
" And the most important thing in all this is that Social - Democracy is the main channel of imperialist pacifism within the working class -- consequently , it is capitalism 's main support among the working class in preparing for new wars and intervention .
But for the preparation of new wars pacifism alone is not enough , even if it is supported by so serious a force as Social - Democracy .
For this , certain means of suppressing the masses in the imperialist centres are also needed .
It is impossible to wage war for imperialism unless the rear of imperialism is strengthened .
It is impossible to strengthen the rear of imperialism without suppressing the workers .
And that is what fascism is for . "
Michael Bloomberg , Mayor of New York City , is the classic Fascist .
He and Benito Mussolini would have been great pals .
' The Communist International , ' Volume II , 1919 - 1943 , is a precise blue print for establishing world wide communism and destroying capitalist countries like these united States of America .
It contains the usual gushing about colonial peoples ( that 's us ) , the bourgeoisie and other deadly mumbo jumbo .
Each subsection has it's own title , i.e. , ' The Struggle for World Proletarian Dictatorship and the Principal Types of Revolution . '
The Reds laid it all out nice and plain .
Of course , this is of little interest to a population taught fluff in the government 's indoctrination centers ( public schools ) and bred to government dependency by design .
Tens of millions will watch garbage like American Idol , spend endless hours looking at porn on the Net , twittering at the costmetics counter or rotting in front of the boob tube watching sports ad nauseum , but anything above that level simply does n't interest them or is beyond their ability to grasp .
Today millions of Americans depend on mother government for their very livelihood .
The American people have been expertly boxed into a corner .
With the destruction of our most important job bases caused by Congress , their financial well being now depends on continuing to support the very programs destroying this country .
When it comes to the U.S. Constitution vs jobs , guess what loses ?
If you click here , you will get a pdf file that contains pages from ' The Communist International . '
Read them this weekend .
It will give you a better grasp on ' The Program ' and how the American people are being led to the slaughter .
Those who think communism is dead are making a fatal mistake .
The push for world domination has never subsided .
This link is to eleven pages from the transcript of ' Public Hearings , Joint Committee on Regional Government , September 26 , 1978 , ' in Edwardsville , Illinois .
Regional governance is one of the major building blocks to destroy private property rights and keep the American people in their proper herds .
These hearings also deal with a malignant cancer called tax exempt foundations working to destroy this country .
They also employ tens of thousands of Americans .
At the very least , ring leaders like David Rockefeller should have been charged with sedition decades ago .
If I were the U.S. Attorney General , I would have charged them with treason .
Please read on page 52 , the testimony of Norman Dodd , chief investigator in 1953 for U.S. Congressman B. Carroll Reece , whose committee investigated tax - exempt foundations run by the biggest traitors in this nation .
This investigation eventually narrowed down to about 10 foundations , those chief among them for Un - American activities were Rockefeller , Ford , Carnegie and the Rhodes Scholarship Fund :
" Mr. Dodd , we have invited you to come to NY and stop in and see us in the hope that , off the record , you would tell us why the Congress of the U.S. should be interested in an operation such as ours . "
Before I could think of just exactly how I would reply , Mr. Gaither volunteered the following information , and these are practically in his exact words : " Mr. Dodd , we operate here under directives which emanate from the White House .
Would you like to know what the substance of these directives is ? "
I said , " Indeed , I would , Mr. Gaither . "

" Whereupon he then said the following : " We here , operate and control our grant making policies in harmony with the directives , the substance of which is as follows :
We shall use our grant making power so to alter life in the U.S. that it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union . "
Page 53 : " Now , the second experience that I would like to share with you , oh , and incidentally , it is the Ford Foundation 's grants which are responsible for the formulation of this idea of regional government , and also the idea that given regional government , we must , in turn , develop and accept and agree to a totally New Constitution which has already been drawn up , as was mentioned just a few minutes ago . "
Take a look at " Americans " who were Rhodes Scholarship Fund recipients .
You can also view a number of documents from my Reading Room which clearly shows how many elected officials ( state and federal ) who endorse one world government .
This is the link .
Page 103 , Congressional Record , Minnesota 's endorsement of a Declaration of Interdependence to " join with others to bring forth a new world order . " pages 107 , 109 - 116 ; 121 - 123 ; 129 ; 131 : UNESCO is " another attempt to destroy the United States " ; pg. 135 Bricker ; pages 139 - 146 , March 25 , 1976 : " A major event ... forumation of the Declaration of Interdependence ... endorsed by 30 Senators and almost 100 Congressmen . "
That 's just a small sampling of documents I spent days scanning .
Treason right out in the open .
Back on February 4 , 2008 , I quoted this in my column :
" We must realize that our party 's most powerful weapon is racial tension .
By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites , we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party .
In America we will aim for subtle victory .
While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites , we will endeavor to install in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes .
We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life , in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment .
With this prestige , the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause . "
Israel Cohen , a leading Communist in England , in his ' A Racial Program For The 20th Century ( 1912 ) . '
Quoted by Congressman Abernathy , Congressional Record , June 7 , 1957 , p. 8559
I was accused of being a racist ; same old worn out attack .
If you click here , you 'll see another page from ' The Communist International ' which reads : " On 14 September 1925 the orgbureau discussed the Negro congress to be held the following month in Chicago , organized by the American CP ( Communist Party ) . "
The goal was / is to use our fellow Americans of the Negro race to further inculcate the communist doctrine .
It 's sickening .
Agitate , continue with constant haranguing that the Negro is oppressed by white America and all the other propaganda so they will turn to the imaginary utopia of communism .
It is why Martin Luther King was brought to prominence .
We know for a fact that Barack Obama was mentored and trained by communists ; click here .
People continue to have selective blindness because they forget Obama is a mulatto ; half Caucasian , half Negro .
However , for the purposes of the masters behind the scenes who pull the strings , Obama has black skin and therefore is their useful fool of choice this election .
Should Obama 's stinking baggage somehow derail him , fellow comrade , Marxist Hillary Clinton is waiting in the wings .
Perhaps those in denial would like to read the truth from someone who would know : ' New Lies for Old : The Communist Strategy of Deception and Disinformation ' by Anatoliy Golitsyn , a former KGB officer .
" This book is the product of nearly twenty years of my life .
It presents my convictions that , throughout that period , the West has misunderstood the nature of changes in the communist world and has been misled and outmaneuvered by communist guile . "
This book is now available for free on the Internet .
I urge you to listen to Ben Partin on the Jeff Rense radio show , May 29th .
Ben knows this material inside and out .
He should because he 's been on it for six decades .
What he has to tell the American people is critical in understanding how the people of this country are embracing their own destruction .
Ask family and friends to listen .
Tell them you would like their opinion on what they hear .
Click here to get the broadcast .
You might tune in a few minutes early just to make sure you 're set for the broadcast .
Do n't miss this critical program .
If for some reason you can't listen , you can watch Ben explain OKC , WACO and world communism for free .
I put on a sold out event at the Santa Clara Convention Center in June , 1998 ; Ben was a featured speaker .
He was 72 years old then ; a remarkable man who has never been given the credit due him for all his work in exposing the lies and ' The Program ' to destroy this republic .
This free Internet video is a must watch .
Change is not possible with the same players .
We can only destroy the destroyers by identifying who they are and refusing to enrich them with our buying power and support .
Americans have been taking a knife to a gun fight because they do not understand the genesis of the problems ( health care , SS , failed foreign policy , energy , our monetary system and these endless wars ) plaguing this country .
You can't solve a problem if you do n't know how it started .
We cannot and will not defeat the planned destruction of this republic unless each and every one of us that now number in the millions reject the program and that requires a solid understanding .
More on this in my next column .
Also , you can listen to dozens of my columns on audio ( free ) on my web site ; download to your IPod or to a CD and listen while driving .
In addition to Ben 's speech referenced above , you can also watch two other speakers from that day , constitutional attorney Larry Becraft and Dr. Eugene Schroeder on the War and Emergency Powers issue .

The U.S. economy may be in a funk , but that 's nothing compared with the pall hanging over Wall Street .
Some of the biggest U.S. investors said on Tuesday they expected the nation 's economy to get worse , but then work its way toward recovery later this year .
On Wall Street , however , the road back to health will take much longer .
" It is the Great Depression on Wall Street .
It sure is n't on Main Street , " Ken Griffin , chief executive of hedge fund Citadel Investment Group , said during a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills , California .
According to Griffin and other top U.S. investors at the conference , the credit and housing crises that led to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses for Wall Street firms will take those investment banks years to claw back from .
" Until you see Wall Street put on their party hats again and get on the tables and start dancing is going to be years , " said Ken Moelis , a former UBS banker who now runs his own investment firm , Moelis & Company .
" It will be a long time for Wall Street to come back to where it was . "
Leon Black , billionaire investor and founding partner of hedge fund Apollo Advisors , said the banking system has been " broken " since last summer and has fostered a credit crisis " the likes of which I 've never seen in the 30 years I 've been in the business . "
Notwithstanding that , however , Moelis said he did not expect to see " a deep Main Street recession . "
In parts of the country , such as Pittsburgh , he said , business is booming thanks to soaring prices on commodities such as steel .
" They are looking for strategic deals and they are not interested in hearing how bad it is on Wall Street , " Moelis said .
Chuck Ward , chairman of Lazard Asset Management Group , and Peter Weinberg , a partner with " boutique " investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners , agreed that the U.S. economic downturn would likely be a short one .
" We are just starting to see the slide in the economy and I think that will play out over six months , " Ward said .
" I do n't think it will be a big recession .
But by the end of the year I gotta believe that that 's going to be behind us . "
The stock market , which has been pummelled this year , will likely recover sooner , Weinberg said .
" I would say that the crisis starts to work itself out toward the end of the year and the equity market will sense that a bit before that , " he said .
Ward said , however , that he expected to see more job losses on Wall Street as investment banks struggle to regain their footing .
It will take at least a year before they are fully back in the business of offering loans , said Apollo 's Black .
" My guess is it will take six to 18 months , probably 12 to 18 months , before the banks are back lending , " he said , adding that the leveraged buyouts of recent years would likely be " on hold " for up to 18 months .
" Competition in private equity , " Black said , " is going to be fairly dormant for the next 12 to 18 months .
And even when it comes back , my guess is that it 's not going to come back in the size that we 've experienced in the last few years . "
One investor , however , said he was less pessimistic , and expected to see small LBO deals later this year .
" You will start to see LBO activity for deals in the $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion range in the next six months , " said Bennett Goodman , senior managing partner of hedge fund GSO Capital Partners , a unit of private equity firm Blackstone Group .
Recreational drugs are a ridiculously fun topic for scientific research .
They could also be the inspiration for powerful new medications .
We are often amazed by the fascinating , and sometimes hilarious , stories that make their way into peer - reviewed journals .
Here are some of our very favorites :
5. Harvard Scientists Build a Device to Smoke Weed During a Brain Scan
To better understand addiction , and how to treat it , scientists need to get a better look at the human brain as it is under the influence of weed .
Unfortunately , smoking weed inside the narrow chamber of a functional MRI is not easy .
To prevent smoke damage and allow their research subjects to puff without moving around too much , Blaise Frederick and his team at Harvard built what amounts to a giant bong .
4. Stanford Chemists make THC from Scratch
Since 1965 , chemists have been trying to make the active ingredient of marijuana [ pdf ] from scratch .
Back then , the researchers could only make tetrahydrocannabinol along with its enantiomers — impurities that have the same chemical composition , but a different shape .
Then , in 2006 , a pair of chemists from Stanford University used a Molybdenum catalyst and other sophisticated techniques to produce the coveted molecule in its pure form .
Despite their discovery , mother nature is still the best chemist and closets with high - intensity lamps will outperform the most sophisticated laboratories .
3. Researchers Learn How Salvia Works
Diviner ’s sage contains a powerful hallucinogen that may someday inspire a new class of depression , pain , and addiction medications .
In at least one instance , a woman has used the substance to rid herself of depression .
Tests on animals have shown that the Oxaccan plant , a relative of the culinary herb , can also control pain .
Last year , Catherine Willmore and her colleagues at Ohio Northern University ended a controversy about how the drug works .
In the Sep. 2007 issue of Neruopharmacology , she confirmed that the active chemical , Salvinorin A , binds to signal - carrying proteins called kappa opioid receptors .
Willmore and her team trained rats to recognize the sensations caused by a well - understood drug that also targets kappa opioid receptors .
It is impossible to know exactly how the rats felt during the test , but they could not tell the difference between the active chemical in sage and the one they had been trained to identify .
Since the drugs feel the same , both of them must activate the same target .
2. British Army Tests LSD on Soldiers
1. Researchers Combine Chemicals from Sea Urchin Eggs and Weed to Make Powerful Painkillers
Scientists at organix , a small research and development firm , made hybrid molecules which resemble the euphoria - causing compounds THC and anandamide .
In the Dec. 2007 issue of Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry they explained that both drugs have their own unique advantages and disadvantages .
Anandamide starts working faster than its marijuana - derived counterpart , but it is more quickly destroyed by the body .
A fusion of the two chemicals may last longer while maintaining an equal or stronger effect .
Although the researchers at Organix did not comment on the recreational potential of their new chemicals , their data makes it very clear that the new drugs push the same pleasure buttons as THC and anandamide .

Did you happen to watch any of the " Office " reruns last night on NBC ?

There are a few ways that stars can go kaboom , and each variant is different enough that astronomers can figure out what kind of object detonated as a supernova .
But when a bizarre explosion was detected last year , it left astronomers puzzled .
Now , it looks like SN 2006gz might have been caused by two white dwarfs colliding together .
Millions of years ago , there were two regular stars in a binary system , orbiting one another .
Over time , one , and then the other ran out of hydrogen fuel , bulged up as red giants , and then settled down to live out their futures as slowly cooling white dwarfs .
But instead of billions of years of quiet cooling , the two stars had decaying orbits .
They spiraled inward , and finally collided , detonating as supernova 2006gz .
When SN 2006gz was first discovered last year , astronomers thought they were dealing with a type Ia event .
This is where a white dwarf is in a binary system with another star .
Like a vampire , the white dwarf feeds on material from the companion star until it reaches 1.4 times the mass of the Sun .
This magic point , called the Chandrasekhar limit , is the upper limit of mass a white dwarf can have .
And when that limit is reached , the white dwarf detonates as a supernova , visible for billions of light years .
The problem is that SN 2006gz seemed to be too bright .
In other words , it must have gotten more mass than the Chandrasekhar limit before detonating .
It also had the strongest spectral signature of unburned carbon ever seen .
And that was the key .
Mathematical models suggested that colliding white dwarfs would generate this specific signature of unburned carbon .
They also suggested that an explosion should contain evidence of compressed layers of silicon , created during the explosion and then compressed during the shockwave that rebounded from the surrounding layers of carbon and oxygen – this too was seen .
Thanks to good observations , SN 2006gz was relatively easy to recognize as a collision between white dwarfs .
But this event might be more common in the Universe , and astronomers will need to go back and carefully analyze supernovae on record to see if they ’ve been wrongly categorized .

Reverse File Iterator and Premature Optimization
This afternoon , I had a need for a reverse file iterator in a script I was writing to process a quite large log file .
After some unsuccessful googling followed by some quick hacking , I was left with a frustratingly close , but nonfunctional , iterator .
Instead of fixing it while I was at work , I hacked up a solution calling " tail " and left it for a while .
When I came back to finish the job this evening , I figured that I ought to go look at the source of tail for some inspiration .
Surely the unix hackers had figured this problem out long ago ?
In reverse.c , I found the inspiration I needed :
for ( ; pos >= start ; pos -- ) { /*
A seek per char is n't a problem with a smart stdio */ if ( fseeko ( fp , pos , SEEK_SET ) != 0 ) { // snip if ( ( ch = get c ( fp ) ) == '\ n ' )
I had been reading the file in chunks , splitting the chunk into lines , handling a cache of the lines , and compensating for unfinished lines , all because I had buried deep down in my lizard brain the idea that an fseek per character was " slow " .
In pure python , for chrissake !
Properly reminded of the fact that premature optimization can sneak up anywhere , I ended up with this code :
import os class reversefile ( object ) : " " " Iterate backwards through a file .
f should be an open file handle " " " def __init__ ( self , f ) : self .
_f = f self .
end = os . stat(f . name ) .
st_size def __iter__ ( self ) : return self def next ( self ) : if self .
end == 0 : raise StopIteration pos = self .
end - 2 while pos >= 0 : self . _f . seek ( pos ) if self . _f . read( 1 ) == ' \ n' : end = self .
end self .
end = pos return self .
_f . read ( end - pos - 1 ) pos -= 1 end = self .
end self .
end = 0 self . _f . seek ( 0 ) return self . _f . read( end ) . strip ( " \ n " )
You can see the whole thing , with source and some very brief tests I hacked up , here .

The BBC's Middle East Editor , Jeremy Bowen , and his cameraman Ian Druce have come under fire while filming in a pro-government stronghold in Lebanon .
The pair were not harmed in the attack which happened just south of Beirut .
As home prices continue their free fall and banks shy away from lending , Washington officials have increasingly relied on two giant mortgage companies  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to keep the housing market afloat .
But with mortgage defaults and foreclosures rising , Bush administration officials , regulators and lawmakers are nervously asking whether these two companies , would - be saviors of the housing market , will soon need saving themselves .
The companies , which say fears that they might falter are baseless , have recently received broad new powers and billions of dollars of investing authority from the federal government .
And as Wall Street all but abandons the mortgage business , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now overwhelmingly dominate it , handling more than 80 percent of all mortgages bought by investors in the first quarter of this year .
That is more than double their market share in 2006 .
But some financial experts worry that the companies are dangerously close to the edge , especially if home prices go through another steep decline .
Their combined cushion of $ 83 billion  the capital that their regulator requires them to hold  underpins a colossal $ 5 trillion in debt and other financial commitments .
CANNABIS would be sold legally in post offices in packets that warn against its effects under a proposal outlined by the head of a Sydney drug and alcohol clinic .

During a 2005 sermon , a fundamentalist pastor whom Senator John McCain has praised and campaigned with called Islam “ the greatest religious enemy of our civilization and the world , ” claiming that the historic mission of America is to see “ this false religion destroyed . ”
In this taped sermon , currently sold by his megachurch , the Reverend Rod Parsley reiterates and amplifies harsh and derogatory comments about Islam he made in his book , Silent No More , published the same year he delivered these remarks .
Meanwhile , McCain has stuck to his stance of not criticizing Parsley , an important political ally in a crucial swing state .
In March 2008 — two weeks after McCain appeared with Parsley at a Cincinnati campaign rally , hailing him as “ one of the truly great leaders in America , a moral compass , a spiritual guide ” — Mother Jones reported that Parsley had urged Christians to wage a “ war ” to eradicate Islam in his 2005 book .
McCain ’s campaign refused to respond to questions about Parsley , and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee declined to denounce Parsley ’s anti-Islam remarks or renounce his endorsement .
At a time when Barack Obama was mired in a searing controversy involving Reverend Jeremiah Wright , McCain escaped any trouble for his political alliance with Parsley , who leads the World Harvest Church , a supersized Pentecostal institution in Columbus , Ohio .
Parsley , whose sermons are broadcast around the world , has been credited with helping George W. Bush win Ohio in 2004 by registering social conservatives and encouraging them to vote .
McCain certainly would like to see Parsley do the same for him — which could explain his reluctance to do any harm to his relationship with this anti-Islam extremist .
Here ’s a video — produced by Mother Jones and Brave New films — highlighting Parsley ’s remarks and McCain ’s praise of the pastor :
In the 2005 sermon , Parsley repeatedly blasts Islam .
“ It is not a God of love that is presented to those of the Islamic faith , ” he tells his parishioners .
He notes that 9/11 was not “ anything new , ” describing the terrorist attack as merely the latest battle in “ a war between Islam and Christian civilization … raging for centuries . ”
Speaking from the pulpit , and wiping sweat from his brow , Parsley exclaims ,
I ca n’t begin to tell you how important it is that we understand the true nature of Islam .
That we see it for what it really is .
In fact … I do not believe that our nation can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand our historical conflict with Islam … I know that this statement sounds extreme .
But I am not shrinking back from its implications .
The fact is that …America was founded in part with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed .
And I believe September 11 , 2001 , was a generational call to arms that we no longer can afford to ignore .
Parsley approvingly quotes Christian theologian Jonathan Edwards ’ reference to Islam as “ Satan ’s Mohammedan kingdom . ”
He points out that the United States ’ first war — the battle against the Barbary Coast pirates — was “ waged against Muslim pirates who took our people captive because they believed in a Jesus crucified by the Jews . ”
( With that one statement , Parsley slams both Islam and Judaism . )
He repeatedly refers to the United States ’ “ historic conflict with Islam , ” and adds , “ We have no choice .
The time has come .
In fact , we may be already losing the battle .
As I scan the world , I find that Islam at this moment is responsible for more pain , more bloodshed , more devastation than nearly any other force on Earth . ”
With the crowd in the pews listening intently , Parsley continues to denigrate Islam , claiming that the religion itself was responsible for 9/11 and that hostility and violence is “ the spirit that has come to fill Islam or perhaps that Islam encompassed from the very beginning . ”
He tries to frighten his followers :
This is about to freak you out …
Since September 11 , 2001 , 34,000 Americans have become Muslims … This means that thousands of Americans have embraced the very religion that inspired the worst assault upon their nation in a generation .
Did you know that there are some 1,209 mosques in America ?
Twenty - five percent of which have been built since 1994 .
Did you know that there are nearly a billion and a half Muslims in the world …
But how would you know it ?
After all , it ’s not in People magazine .
According to Parsley , there ’s no coexisitng with Muslims .
He tells the tale of a Christian man who once dared to sell land to a mosque rather than to a church — an ominous sign that Christianity is losing the struggle against Islam .
“ You need to understand today ” who was responsible for 9/11 , Parsley nearly shouts .
“ Muslim Islamic fundamentalists and extremists are what did that , and your government and politicians and preachers want you to snuggle up next door to them and allow them to build a mosque next door to your church , while you sing hallelujah . ”
The preacher paints a dark picture :
Islam is growing rapidly and is becoming more violent .
America has historically understood herself to be a bastion against Islam in the world …
History is crashing in upon us …Americans need to wake up … We can tell you …Britney Spears ’ lyrics to her latest CD .
But we do n’t know anything about other religions …
’ We ought to just all get along ’ … ’ We should n’t say anything about other faiths . ’
Excuse me .
Excuse me .
The fact is that Americans are woefully ignorant of other faiths .
This is not only tragic .
But when it comes to Islam , now the greatest religious enemy of our civilization and the world , it ’s dangerous .
The problem , Parsley insists , is not radical Muslims who have hijacked a faith , but the religion itself :
I must state three important truths … No. 1 , the God of Christianity and the God of Islam are two separate beings … Mr. Bush , I support you .
You need to stop saying that the God of Islam and the God of Christianity are the same God… No.
2 , Muhammad received revelations from demon spirits , not from the living God. No. 3 , Islam is an anti-Christ religion that intends , through violence , to conquer the world .
Did you get those three truths ?
In a long riff , Parsley maintains that Muhammad was tricked by a demon into believing that he had heard the word of God .
Thus , he asserts , the entire religion of Islam is based upon a satanic deception : “ Muhammad was tragically beset by a demon which he mistook for the living God .
He thus became a mouthpiece of a conspiracy of spiritual evil …
There are so few who will talk about [ this ] . ”
But Parsley is willing .
And he also readily offered McCain his endorsement during that February 26 , 2008 , campaign rally in Cincinnati .
At the event , McCain extolled Parsley for his “ leadership ” and “ guidance . ”
Since then , McCain aides have said that the senator ’s acceptance of Parsley ’s endorsement was not an endorsement of Parsley ’s views .
And they have dismissed any comparison between Reverend Wright and Reverend Parsley , noting that McCain has never attended a service conducted by Parsley .
But imagine if Barack Obama had campaigned with an imam who had called for destroying Christianity .
A media and political uproar would ensue — with wide - ranging calls for Obama to condemn the imam .
McCain has also refused to reject the endorsement he received from the Reverend John Hagee , a Texas - based televangelist who referred to the Catholic Church as “ the great whore ” and a “ false cult system ” and who called Hurricane Katrina retribution from God for the sins of New Orleans ’ homosexual residents .
But Parsley may be the more politically crucial pastor for McCain .
McCain probably cannot win Ohio in November without the support of large numbers of social conservative voters .
In 2004 , Parsley , whose megachurch boasts thousands of members , led so - called values voters to the polls , where they helped propel George W. Bush to victory over John Kerry .
If McCain were to repudiate Parsley , he would risk losing Parsley as a surrogate and , perhaps worse , alienate his flock .
So McCain has ducked , keeping quiet about an anti-Islam extremist who repeatedly proclaims in sermons , “ I will be silent no more . ”
— Vance County District Attorney Sam Currin on Thursday asked for a state investigation into a recent traffic stop involving the daughter of Vance County Sheriff Peter White .
Currin asked the state Attorney General 's Office for a State Bureau of Investigation review of the March 23 stop in which Shahita White , 34 , was charged with reckless driving .
The move came after WRAL obtained memos filed by two Henderson police officers who participated in the traffic stop with county officers .
Two Vance County deputies stopped a sport utility vehicle on U.S. Highway 1 near Henderson after drivers called 911 to report the vehicle was swerving through traffic as it headed the wrong way on the highway .
Callers said the driver appeared to be drunk .
After they stopped the SUV and realized who was behind the wheel , the deputies called radio dispatchers , saying Shahita White was " blistered . "
The dispatchers then called the sheriff and told him his daughter had been stopped and was " 55 , " radio shorthand for an intoxicated driver .
White went to the scene to pick up his daughter .
Shahita
White was charged with reckless driving , and Currin said previously he could n't pursue drunken driving charges against her because no roadside sobriety test had been administered .
Henderson officers B.R. Hobgood and H.L. Williams stated in police department memos about the traffic stop that one deputy tried to give Shahita
White a breath test to check her sobriety , but could n't obtain a reading .
White then slapped the deputy 's arm away and refused to cooperate with another test , they said in the memos .
The officers described her as smelling of alcohol , being unsteady on her feet , slurring her speech and having red , glassy eyes .
They also said she appeared to have urinated on herself .
The SUV had damage on the driver 's side , the officers noted in the memos .
Currin said the accounts by the Henderson officers establish probable cause for a drunken - driving case against Shahita White .
He said evidence is mounting that the Vance County Sheriff 's Office made mistakes , so he wants an independent investigation .
" They messed it up one time .
I do n't want them to do it again , " Currin said of the sheriff 's office .
Peter
White has denied interfering in the initial investigation and said his deputies handled everything properly .
He could n't be reached for comment Thursday .
The SBI investigation would focus on the drunken - driving allegations , not the sheriff 's handling of the case , Currin said .
But he said that he would review any evidence of a cover - up if agents brought it to him .
Vance County commissioners said they want to find out what happened during the traffic stop and why it did .
" We want answers like all the citizens , and we want to find out exactly what went wrong , " said Danny Wright , chairman of the Vance County Board of Commissioners .
" The commissioners are concerned about it , and it appears there was probable cause for a sobriety test to be administered , but one was not administered .
So , we 're interested in why not . "

It ’s too bad Lou Dobbs did n’t have his notes together when he was confronted recently by Paul Waldman of Media Matters for America , a “ progressive , ” read Democrat , organization ( see video ) .
Waldman described the NAFTA Superhighway as a “ myth ” and challenged Dobbs to provide evidence of its existence .
Lou was unable to provide specific evidence , thus lending credence to Waldman ’s assertion that the whole thing is a baseless conspiracy theory .
First , it should be noted that Media Matters is a Soros inspired if not funded organization , that is to say it operates as a shill for the globalist agenda .
Media Matters , led by “ conservative ” turned “ liberal ” writer David Brock , does n’t like to be called out on its association with billionaire financier , Bilderberg member , Trilateralist , and former director of the Council on Foreign Relations , George Soros .
“ A Cybercast News Service examination of Brock ’s financial records and public documents showed that the heavily funded Soros liberal think tank , The Center for American Progress , was instrumental in getting Brock ’s media group off the ground … .
Soros has reportedly given $ 3 million to CAP and its senior vice president , Morton H. Halperin , is also the director of Soros ’s Open Society Institute . ”
Added John Carlisle , director of policy for the conservative National Legal and Policy Center , “ Clearly MMA worked very closely with Soros - funded groups [ including Soros “ affiliates ” like MoveOn.org — strangely or not so strangely , funded by Laurance and Wendy Rockefeller — and the Center for American Progress ] .
There is definitely a Soros connection there . ”
Joseph Wanzala characterizes Soros as “ a latter day Rockefeller , ” a title that fits well , as Soros sits on the World Economic Forum with many Rockefeller interests .
“ Soros ’ Open Society Institute has a finger in every pot , ” explains Heather Cottin .
“ Its board of directors reads like a ‘ Who ’s Who ’ of Cold War and New World Order pundits … .
Soros is operating exactly within the confines of the intelligence complex , ” that is to say he is funding and compromising so - called “ liberals ” through his organizations and NGOs , including Media Matters .
So it stands to reason Media Matters would be tasked with attempting to shut down Lou Dobbs on the globalist NAFTA Superhighway agenda .
But even slick talking Paul Waldman cannot skirt the facts , specifically in regard to the NAFTA Superhighway , which he deems a “ myth . ”
“ Directly stated , NAFTA Superhighway deniers either negligently overlook a large body of specific references by transportation economists , transportation trade associations and numerous government reports , or they intentionally disregard these references to make a political point , ” writes Jerome R. Corsi .
Corsi points to a 1998 paper entitled “ North American Free Trade Agreement Truck Highway Corridors : U.S. - Mexican Truck Rivers of Trade , ” authored by John P. McCray .
“ By 2003 , McCray ’s analysis expanded to include a growing volume of World Trade Organization container freight coming from China , headed to enter the continent largely through U.S. ports on the West Coast and now increasingly through Mexican ports on the Pacific . ”
As the Sierra Club wrote in 2000 , the “ concept of the ‘ NAFTA trade corridor ’ has gained traction .
Broadly defined , the corridors comprise the transportation infrastructure and systems that facilitate the flow of traffic both domestically and across the North American borders , particularly those traffic flows prompted by the trade liberalization of NAFTA . ”
It should be noted that the Sierra Club has received money from the Ford Foundation — a fact admitted by the foundation in its annual reports — and the putative enviro organization was created in response to the “ Earth Charter , ” as dreamed up by David Rockefeller and Maurice Strong , the latter serving as the United Nations Environmental Program ’s first director .
Thus it makes perfect sense the Sierra Club would describe the “ NAFTA trade corridor ” as “ inherently dynamic ” and as a “ useful construct , ” never mind the environmental impact .
In 1998 , Corsi continues , the Federal Highway Administration produced a study “ on the ‘ I - 35 Trade Corridor ’ and involved five states directly along the highway ( Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Iowa , and Minnesota ) , plus the adjoining state of Missouri … .
This FHWA study motivated by the stated logic that I - 35 would carry a greater percentage of trade among the NAFTA partners than any other interstate highway , simply because of the central position I - 35 occupies in the continent … .
The published conclusion of this 1998 FHWA study did much to identify I -35 as the ‘ NAFTA Superhighway . ' ”
In fact , by 1997 , the term was so far advanced the “ NAFTA Superhighway Coalition , a not - for - profit corporation organized to support NAFTA trade ” was created .
If Mr. Waldman doubts this organization ’s existence or considers it just another John Bircher conspiracy theory , he may want to surf over the Coalition ’s website .
“ The Coalition is committed to making the [ Highway 401 ] a state of the art , high - speed , safe , clean , automated superhighway that ensures the smooth , fast transportation of goods between Canada and the U.S. , ” in other words , a NAFTA Superhighway .
“ Today , the professional transportation industry and government references to ‘ NAFTA trade corridors ’ and ‘ NAFTA superhighways ’ are too numerous to list , ” explains Jerome Corsi .
Organizations active in creating north - south continental NAFTA / WTO trade corridors include : The International Mobility and Trade Corridor Project , CANAMEX Corridor Coalition , Central North American Trade Corridor Association , Ports to Plains Trade Corridor , Champlain - Hudson Trade Corridor and Gateway Coalition , and the I - 95 Corridor Coalition .
Add to this NASCO , North America ’s SuperCorridor Coalition , “ officially amalgamated ” by the North American International Trade Corridor Partnership “ to promote the development of a trade corridor designed to expedite the flow of trade through the North American Continent , ” according to Henry Lamb .
“ NASCO is a not - for - profit lobbying organization that has received $ 2.5 million in Congressional earmarks from the Department of Transportation to promote the corridor concept .
Their 24 - member board of directors includes county commissioners from four Texas Counties ; an Oklahoma state senator , and a member of OK - DOT ; two officials from the Texas DOT ; attorneys , a couple of construction company officials , and an official of the U.S. - Mexico Chamber of Commerce . ”
All of this “ fits nicely into the vision of the Council on Foreign Relations ’ [ May 2005 ] report : Building a North American Community , which advocates ‘ unlimited access to each other ’s territory ’ ( page 47 ) , including allowing Mexican or Canadian companies to freely enter the U.S. to compete with U.S. trucking companies , hauling freight between U.S. cities . ”
As Corsi notes , this report “ has been described as a blueprint for the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America . ”
But then , of course , for Soros funded “ liberals , ” the idea that the Council on Foreign Relations is anything but a harmless confab of rich people and business leaders getting together to chew the fat is another conspiracy theory .
“ Perhaps the NAFTA Superhighway deniers have simply taken a page from Bill Clinton ’s playbook , ” Corsi concludes .
“ Clinton ’s most memorable sentence in eight years as president involved denying he had sex with his White House intern , an argument he buttressed by insisting that the question depended upon ‘ what the meaning of “ is ” is . ' ”
It really is too bad Lou Dobbs was not prepared to argue logically with Paul Waldman of Media Matters for America — or maybe that should be Media Matters for the North American Union .

The book jacket of The Shack .
THE IDEA CLUB THE IDEA CLUB USA TODAY 's Cathy Grossman wants to hear from you .
Join her weekly discussion on values , religious beliefs and spiritual ideas here .
A little novel written by an Oregon salesman and self - published by two former pastors with a $ 300 marketing budget is lighting up USA TODAY 's Best - Selling Books list with a wrenching parable about God 's grace .
First - time author William P. Young 's book The Shack , in which the father of a murdered child encounters God the Father as a sarcastic black woman , Jesus as a Middle Eastern laborer and the Holy Spirit as an Asian girl , is No. 8 on the list .
IDEA CLUB : Do you care about doctrine ?
Published a year ago and promoted by snowballing attention on Christian radio , websites and blogs , The Shack ( $ 14.99 ) is now in mainstream bookstores and Wal - Marts nationwide , and the trio behind it are talking to Hollywood about a possible film deal .
Aimed at the " spiritually interested , " the novel had an inauspicious start , says co-publisher Brad Cummings , who is still shipping books from the garage of his home in Thousand Oaks , Calif . , and nearby mini-warehouses .
Young says that when he wrote the book in 2005 , " my only goal was to get copied and bound at Kinko 's in time for Christmas as a gift to my kids . "
Until The Shack sales soared , he was a manufacturer 's representative for a technology company by day and did website design work on the side .
But he had always been a writer , he says , who gave poems and stories as gifts .
He wrote the book to explain his own harrowing journey through pain and misery to " light , love and transformation " in God to his six children , ages 14 to 27 .
Eleven years ago , Young says , he was hanging on by a thread , haunted by his history as a victim of sexual abuse , by his own adulterous affair , by a life of shame and pain , all stuffed deep in his psyche .
" The shack " was what he called the ugly place inside where everything awful was hidden away .
The book is about confronting evil and stripping the darkness away to reveal a loving God within , he says .
Shortly after he finished the manuscript , Young read a parable book by Wayne Jacobsen , a former pastor who had turned to publishing his own spiritual titles .
When he discovered Jacobsen was doing a reading at a bookstore near Young 's home in Gresham , Ore. , Young brought him the manuscript .
" I was taken immediately , " Jacobsen says .
Even so , " Christian publishers told us it was too edgy , and secular ones said it was too Jesus-y , " Cummings says .

Today ’s guest blogger is Environmental Defense scientist Tim Fitzgerald .
Last month ’s New York Times report on high mercury levels in tuna sushi was certainly cause for concern for serious sushi lovers .
( See my previous post Plenty of Safe , Eco-Friendly Fish in the Sea . )
The report might have also made many parents uneasy about the ubiquitous tuna sandwich in their kids ’ lunch boxes .
Many of us rely on canned tuna for a wholesome , high - protein meal .
Once considered a “ nuisance food ” or “ pauper ’s food , ” today almost half of all American households serve canned tuna monthly .
Only shrimp surpasses canned tuna as Americans ’ favorite seafood .
But does this beloved fish in a can deliver a helping of toxic mercury , too ?
Given the popularity of canned tuna fish and its moderate levels of mercury , parents should monitor how much their kids eat .
Here ’s why : Children ( and infants and fetuses ) are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of mercury , since their brains and nervous systems are still developing .
They may suffer learning disabilities and developmental delays from prolonged or repeated exposure to even small amounts of mercury .
Children who were exposed to mercury before birth may experience problems with mental development and coordination , including how they think , learn and problem - solve later in life .
Parents can still feed kids tuna , if they are mindful of which types they feed their children and how often .
There are two main kinds of canned tuna : Canned light ( chunk light ) and canned albacore tuna ( solid / chunk white )
Canned white , or albacore , contains higher mercury levels , so meals should be limited .
Children up to age six should eat no more than one meal a month , and children ages 6 - 12 should eat no more than two meals a month ( see Environmental Defense ’s Health Alert list for all fish ) .
Adults , too , should limit how much albacore they eat , especially if they are pregnant or of child - bearing age ( more details on seafood and contaminants ) .
The safer choice is canned light , but kids should still not eat it every day .
Parents should limit their young children ’s meals of canned light tuna to 3 meals per month .
Older kids and adults can safely eat it once a week or more .
Why the difference in mercury for the two types of canned tuna ?
The reason , simply put , is that albacore ( white ) is a larger , more predatory species of tuna , so it accumulates more mercury in its tissues .
Skipjack , which accounts for most canned light tuna , does n’t grow nearly as large as albacore , so it has approximately one - third the mercury levels .
But read the canned light label carefully :
Some canned light tuna reportedly contains yellowfin tuna , which has similar mercury levels to albacore .
These products are sometimes ( but not always ) labeled “ gourmet ” or “ tonno , ” and their consumption should be limited by both adults and children .
Armed with information , parents can still safely include tuna salad sandwiches in their lunch boxes , in moderation .
An even better choice is canned salmon .
Canned salmon is mainly sockeye or pink from Alaska — a wise choice not only because the fish are low in contaminants and high in heart - healthy omega - 3s , but also because they are sustainably caught .
Please share this post with the parents and kids you know — they ’ll appreciate knowing how to keep their exposure down .
At least 1,000 people suffer horrific burns from ' toxic ' leather sofas
At least 1,000 people have suffered horrific burns from leather sofas sprayed with a toxic substance to stop them going mouldy .
Baby Archie Lloyd - Bennett is among the victims who have suffered chronic skin complaints from contact with one of the sofas .
He suffered blisters all over his body after lying on the chair , and has had hospital treatment for the angry red burns .
Archie Lloyd - Bennett , suffered serious burns and rashes after an allergic reaction believed to have been caused by his family 's leather sofa
The nine - month - old boy now has seven lotions , creams and pills to treat his condition .
The Chinese - made settees are sold by High Street chain Argos and Land of Leather for between £ 600 and £ 850
Victims have visited A&E departments and doctors ' surgeries with severe skin complaints after buying the leather suites from the shops .
The chairs had been treated with a fungicide to stop them going mouldy in storage .
But the substance triggered violent irritant - related eczema in some customers .
Archie , pictured with mother Rebecca , was rushed to hospital after suffering burns to his face , back and legs
Baby Archie 's mother Rebecca Lloyd - Bennett , 25 , had to take her son to Birmingham Children 's Hospital .
' He was red raw after lying on the sofa in his nappy , ' Mrs Lloyd - Bennett told The Sun .
' He has been in agony .
It is very itchy and he now has gloves to stop him scratching .'
The family 's dog Kes was also affected by the toxic chemical .
His hair fell out and he needed £ 1,000 of vet 's treatment .
Solicitors have been approached by customers who have suffered from serious skin complaints from the settees , including one who claimed they were hospitalised for a week .
Last year there were 60 complaints about sofas from Argos and northern chain Walmsley 's bought from the Linkwise Furniture factory in southern China .
Customers were told that not everyone who bought a sofa would suffer a reaction but the number was high enough to call it a ' widespread ' outbreak .
Painful : 1,000 people have suffered horrific burns from sofas because they were sprayed with a toxic substance to stop them going mouldy in storage
Ms Miyati's condition was compelling physical evidence of abuse , HRW says
Human Rights
Watch has called on Saudi judges to overturn a decision to drop charges against a Saudi couple accused of severely abusing an Indonesian maid .
A judge in Riyadh awarded $ 670 damages to the maid , Nour Miyati , but dropped all charges against her employers .
The female employer , who admitted the abuse and was originally sentenced to 35 lashes , had her sentence overturned .
Human Rights
Watch said the ruling on Monday was " outrageous " , and sent " a dangerous message " to Saudi employers .
Ms Miyati , 25 , contracted gangrene after allegedly being tied up for a month and left without food in 2005 .
She had to have several fingers and toes amputated .
New York - based Human Rights
Watch called for an appeals court to " impose stiff penalties on the employers , including imprisonment , and payment of significant financial compensation " .
Saudi officials have not commented on the report .
' Impunity '
Human Rights
Watch says
Ms Miyati was treated in a Riyadh hospital in March 2005 for gangrene , malnourishment and other injuries .
All charges against Ms Miyati's male employer were dropped early in the investigation , Human Rights Watch says .
On Monday a Riyadh judge found the female employer not guilty , despite her earlier admission and " compelling physical evidence " , the group says .
A prior Saudi judgement , subsequently overturned , had seen Ms Miyati convicted of falsely accusing her employers and sentenced to 79 lashes .
Human Rights
Watch said the latest ruling " sends a dangerous message to Saudi employers that they can beat domestic workers with impunity and that victims have little hope of justice " .
Rights organisations say many foreign domestic maids in Saudi Arabia work in harsh circumstances and often suffer abuse by their employers .
The Saudi Labour Ministry has acknowledged some problems , but the government also says foreign workers ' rights are protected under Islamic law .
A new study conducted by researchers at East Carolina University suggests that playing casual games like Peggle or Bejeweled can have a significant impact on a player 's mood or stress level , but you do n't have to take their word for it .
You can take mine – I was one of the subjects tested for the study .
The purpose of the experiment , which was underwritten by PopCap Games , was not only to determine whether or not playing casual games had any effect on a person 's mental state , but to attempt to quantify the change with some kind of hard data .
Saying that gaming is relaxing may seem obvious to those of us who play regularly , but Dr. Carmen Russoniello and his team at ECU wanted to obtain evidence to back up the feeling , if possible .
Doing my part for science had sounded exciting when I was first approached about being part of the study , but as I watched a lovely young assistant head my way with a coil of wires in one hand and what appeared to be a moth - eaten swim cap in the other , I began to have second thoughts .
Her name was Jennifer Parks , and she explained that the holes in snug - fitting cloth cap were to help position the electrodes that would be monitoring my brain waves as I conducted the trial .
As Jennifer fit me with the cap and used her extensive scientific knowledge to determine the best spots on my noggin for siphoning brain waves I chewed my lip , hoping that my shampoo was doing its best to keep me silky smooth and dandruff - free .
After she had marked the electrodes ' landing zones with stickers , Jennifer pulled off the cap and reached for a tub of goo that she informed me was a conducting material .
Slathering it onto my scalp , she assured me that the sticky globs would wash out of my hair .
Eventually .
When Jennifer had finished her ministrations , I had four electrodes attached to my head and a pulseometer clipped to my ear .
She then bade me to pick an envelope , the contents of which would determine if I was to be part of the control group , or the test group .
The control group would be given a list of articles to find on the internet , while members of the test group would play one of three PopCap games : Peggle , Bejeweled 2 , or Bookworm Adventures .
I ripped open the numbered envelope and was relieved to find that I would be gaming for science .
Next , I had to choose the game that I would play .
I went with Bookworm Adventures because of the three choices , it was the one I had played the least .
I do n't know if familiarity with a game would skew the results or not , but I wanted to try and be as fair as possible .
Jennifer performed some scientific hoodoo on the computer , and suddenly my brainwaves were sketching across the screen .
I tried thinking various kinds of thoughts – happy ones , angry ones , crazy ones – to see if I could get the readings to move , but no such luck .
Coughing , on the other hand , makes the readings spike like crazy .
Weird .
Before I could begin the test , I had to fill out a Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) that used virtually every adjective you can think of to determine my mood .
Was I angry ?
Expectant ?
Regretful ?
Guilty ?
Did I feel anxious ?
Foggy ?
Cautious ?
Hungry was n't on the list , but I was keenly regretting turning down the bagel that Dr. Russoniello had offered me .
After completing the POMS , I had to sit quietly , without talking or moving , so that Jennifer could obtain a baseline for my readings .
Then , finally , I got to play a game for science .
Jennifer quietly left the small room to let me play Bookworm Adventures in peace for fifteen minutes .
I forgot about the electrodes , the goop in my hair , the fact that the computer opposite me was recording the workings of my brain .
I made it through two levels and was just at a boss fight when Jennifer returned to unhook me .
I filled out another POMS immediately after playing the game .
As I answered the questions , I realized that I felt sharper , more alert , more capable than I had when I began .
It was a subtle distinction , and not one that I likely would 've noticed had I not had to fill out the questionnaire , but it was definitely there .
Dr. Russoniello came in to explain that the electrodes had been measuring my Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) , which measures sympathetic ( fight or flight ) and para - sympathetic ( relaxation ) nervous system activity .
This is Dr. Russoniello 's first study to determine the potential therapeutic value of playing videogames .
In my case , the results were quite dramatic .
According to the data , my stress level dropped by 400 % .
My choice of Bookworm Adventures may have been the reason that my mental acuity achieved perfect balance ; according to the study data , it had the greatest impact on right / left brain synchrony , an increase of 421 % .
All three games increased mood , but in different ways .
Bejeweled 2 and Peggle were the best choices for reducing anger ( 65 % and 63 % , respectively ) , and playing Peggle drastically reduced psychological tension as well ( 66 % ) .
All three games did a respectable job of reducing depression and confusion , but Peggle was the best for lowering levels of fatigue .
In some cases , the gender of the player made a difference on the results .
Women playing Peggle experienced a 40 % greater improvement in mood than men who played , while men playing Bejeweled 2 experienced a 10 % greater mood improvement than women .
A player 's age made a difference in some cases , too .
Bejeweled 2 players under 25 experienced a significant increase in emotional balance when compared with players over age 25 .
A more detailed breakout of the findings can be found at ECU 's web site .
The data from this study will hopefully serve as a launching point for future investigations .
There are simply so many more variables that need to be addressed .
Do violent games lower stress levels as significantly as casual games ?
What about a player 's proficiency level ?
Does the length of time a game is played make a difference ?
There 's clearly still much to be learned .
East Carolina University 's Psychophysiology Lab is planning to start clinical trials in the fall to determine the efficacy of these games and their prescriptive parameters .
Maybe they 'll need my help for that one , too , and I 'll get another crack at playing games for science .

Emails are messy things , leaving traces of themselves all over your company 's network .
That 's why the attempts of employees in the Houston office of accountants Arthur Andersen to delete emails relating to failed commodities exchange Enron were futile .
According to published reports , Andersen acknowledges that in October and November , its employees deleted emails related to their work as accountants and auditors for Enron .
Enron was an energy company and one of the largest commodity trading firms in the world .
It went bankrupt at the end of 2001 .
Billions of dollars were lost from company pension schemes as Enron 's stock price collapsed .
Andersen has been under scrutiny ever since and has fielded pointed questions as to why it disposed of large quantities of Enron - related documents before the bankruptcy .
" It is impossible that [ government investigators ] cannot find data on those hard drives .
There are too many computers involved , " said Michael Sanders , a computer forensics expert who specialises in email recovery .
" [ They ] will find enough information to make a story . "
Though email servers and applications vary in how they move and store electronic messages , all of them hoard information on hard drives in the same way as if they were running on Windows - based PCs , according to Sanders .
He added that Lotus Notes is a particularly easy program from which to recover deleted messages .
Arthur Andersen uses email software and servers from IBM - owned Lotus Software , according to Lotus chief Al Zollar .
Lotus declined an offer to comment for this story .
Representatives for the other companies could not be reached at the time this story was filed .
CNNMoney / Fortune has a story out saying that Eve , the female character to stand opposite Wall - E in the movie of the same name , was designed in part by Apple lead designer Jonathan Ive .
The robot design is kinda cool , in that it reminds me of the most recent incarnation of Marvin the Paranoid Android , but the real story to be told is of Ive 's day spent with the Pixar guys working on Eve .
Advertisement
Wall - E director Andrew Stanton said he wanted the design to be high - end , but also " seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous . "
Stanton called this philosophy straight out of the Apple playbook and called up El Jobso in 2005 .
Steve sent over Johnny
Ive for the day .
But oddly enough , Ive was as tight lipped as ever , despite being commissioned by Jobs for the task .
So while the Pixar designers were running design ideas by Ive for Eve , all he would do is nod his head yes or no , as to whether or not he agreed .
" Apple is so proprietary and so secretive that he could n't even really allude to where the future of technology was going , " said Stanton .
And Pixar is a company which Jobs owns a stake in .
Kinda creepy if you ask me .

I 'm always fascinated by kinetic sculptures , which is why I like this clock by painter and sculptor George Rhodes .
You tell the hours from the numbered cylinders that 're picked up on that wheel , and the minutes from the pointer arm .
It strikes the hours when the cylinder rolls down the track and hits a bell .
I 'd love to see it in action , but since it 's a limited edition of 50 , costing $ 4,000 , there 's not much chance of that .
If you do bag one of these 17 - pound creations , it 's signed by the artist himself .

Rubyに人気があるため 、Ruby on RailsやMerb、CampingといったWebフレームワークが誕生した。Wavesという新しいWebフレームワークが最近リリースされたが、
Ruby開発者が興味を持って試してみようと思うような特徴が、Wavesにはある。
Waves はRuby on RailsのようにMVCフレームワークであり、Request Lambda ( source ) と呼ばれるものを使うが、各マッピングはルールとブロックで構成されている。ルールが要求と一致すると、そのブロックが実行される。
Wavesに独特な特徴の１つである。
Wavesのこの他の優れた特徴には以下が挙げられる。
真のコード再ローディング
ホットパッチン グ
クラスタのサポー ト
スレッド・セーフテ ィ
InfoQは、Wavesの開発 者Dan YoderとWavesについて話す機会を得た。
Robert Bazinet（RB）：Wavesとは何ですか。
Dan Yoder（DY）：Wavesは次世代のWebアプリケーションフレームワークであり、MITライセンスです。Railsが止めたところから始めてお
り、主にそれが理由で「次世代」となっています。スレッドセーフであることやフットプリントが小さいことなど、基本的な事柄もあります。JITR
（Just In Time Resources）のような特徴により、DRYは次レベルに押し上げられるわけですが、JITRによってアプリケーション全域でMVCコードの再利用が
容易になるか、アプリケーション全体の再利用さえ可能になります（その理由は、アプリケーションが何よりもモジュールの中にカプセル化されているからで す）。Wavesはよりオープンでかつ拡張可能でもあります。
例えば、容易に自分だけのViewクラスを書いて、ビューの選択もしくはレンダリングの方法を変更したり、モデル向けに別のデータベースプラットフォーム
を使用したりすることができます（デフォルトはRuby Sequelです）。 「 Rubyにおけ るWebアプリケーション用MVC」という意味で、基本的な考えはRailsと同じですが、数年におよぶRails
の使用経験を基に、さらに優れて、強力なフレームワークを開発しようと作り上げたものです。
RB：開発した理由はなんでしょうか。
DY：一言で答えるなら 、Campingです。
もう少し詳しく説明すると、私自身のアプリケーションで、Railsの厳然たる限界に達してしまったことが主な理由です。Wavesは実のところ、プラグ
インの豊富なセットとしてスタートしました。けれども、本当にリリースしたいと思う段階までは達しませんでした。なぜなら、実のところ、Railsの上に
乗っかっただけの新規フレームワークを作っているとわかっていたからです。普通のプラグインというより、どちらかというと
Streamlinedのようでした。また、Railsコードを回避するか、モンキーパッチを当てて、フレームワークの予想行動を本質的に変更していたこ
とに気付きました。ですから、Railsの世界で必ずしも他者と調子よく動かなかったのです。ちょうどよい例が、Just
In Time Resourcesの初期実装でした。ObjectとModuleではActiveDependencyがconst_missing
に優先してコードの再ロードを処理します。この行動を変えたかったので、Railsがしていたことを無効にする必要がありました。私にはObjectや
Moduleに触る必要のないソリューションがあったため、Railsのソリューションが好きではありませんでしたが、Railsのやり方という理由で、
身動きが取れなかったのです。
そんなある日、私 はCampingを眺めていました。理由は思い出せないのですが、コードの簡潔性に驚いたことは覚えています。その時、ひらめいたので
す。Railsに対処する必要なしに、私が望むだけの特徴を持った新しいフレームワークを作れば、事はより単純ではないかと。その時までにどうにか、こう
にかRailsのアドオンとして作ってきたものをリリースしようと計画しており、そちらの方がずっと困難の少ない道でしたから、難しい決断ではありまし
た。加えて、書き直しの必要なコードがたくさんありました。骨が折れました。けれども、出来上がったコードは、ずっとリーンで、拡張も作業もより簡単に
なったと思います。そうしたら、DuckTyped.comのBenがRackを教えてくれて、私がコードに埋もれている間にRackがリリースされ、そしてそれが基本的にぴったり合ったのです。それと同時に、DataMapperとSequelの成熟が進んでいたため、課題のうちのMVC
Webアプリケーション部分にのみ徹底的に焦点を当てた、フル機能のフレームワークの導入が可能になったのです。
RB：Wavesは誕生からどの位経っていますか。
DY ： Wavesに取り掛かり始めたのは、つい2007年8月のことです。最初のベータリリースは2月初旬でした。ですから非常に新しいフレームワークで、旅は
始まったばかりです。私は保守的なので、私にとってベータ版は「本番使用のための準備が整っていない」を意味します。
RB：Waves を利用してアプリケーションを書くことについて、開発者が試してみて、さらに多くを体験できる最良の方法は何でしょうか。
DY：おそらく最も良い出発点はスクリーンキャストで、チュートリアルを説明していますが、このスクリーンキャストで興味を持ったら、チュートリアルを体
験できます。また、かなり完全に近いRDocsもあります。サポートフォーラムもあり、どんな質問にも、数時間か、遅くとも１日以内に返答するよう努めて
います。チュートリアルを体験し、RDocsに入っているものを基に試してみて、フォーラムをチェックして、そして、にっちもさっちもいかなくなったら、 質問すればいいのです。
RB：WavesはRailsのように、MVCフレームワークですね。WavesはRailsとどのような相違があるのでしょうか。
DY：無数の点で異なります。これまでに言ったように、Wavesは「次世代」であり、Railsの進化版です。スレッドセーフであり、フットプリントも
小さいのです。JITRやモジュール内でカプセル化しているアプリケーションなど、アプリケーションの中、また複数のアプリケーションにまたがっての両方
で、再利用にさらに重点をおいています。ルート相当物はRequest Lambdasであり、より強力であり、道理にかなっている場合はMVC行の外に色をつけることができます。また、すべてのコントローラーをまたいで１ヵ
所に、アプリケーションを安全に保持することができます。望みのORMフレームワークにモデルを連結させることができますが、もし1つも使わないなら、メ
モリ利用やメモリパフォーマンスにORMを使うことに対し、代償を払うことはありません。例えば、ファイルストレージを使い、そして本当にORMを必要と しない、WavesベースのCMS（コンテンツマネジメントシステム）があります。Wavesには、Railsよりさらにコントローラーから切り離されて
いる、一流のビューがあります。例えばレイアウトは、コントローラーではなく、ビュー自体の中で指定できます。同様に、レイアウトを入れ子にするか、
ビューの中からコントローラーメソッドを呼び出せます。もう1つの実に重要な相違は、
Wavesでは本当の意味のコード再ロードができることです。すなわち、コードが再ロードされる前に、自動的にアンロードされ、そのため以前のロードから
残っているアーチファクトが存在しないのです。これがなぜ重要かというと、デバッグが多少容易にはなるだけでなく、LiveConsoleを使って比較的安全にホットパッチを本番コードに当てることもできるからです。両者の違いを示す良い例でしょう。Rubyの中でMVCパラダイムが本当に進化しているのです。
RB：どのようなタイプのサイトがWavesを実行しているのでしょうか。
DY ：様々な種類のサイトを動かしてい るCMSがあり、そうしたサイトにはもちろん、Ruby Wavesのサイト、RubyWaves.com も含まれます。また、Wavesを使ったテーマ構築アプリケーションもあります。こうしたものは元々Rails上で動作していたものですが、現在では
Wavesになっています。必要メモリは従来の約３分の１から４分の１になり、コードベースもRailsと比較して小さくなっています。また、再起動不要
で、何週間も動作します。ですから、私は勢いづいています。他のデータポイントも手に入れたいと思っていますが、入手先は自分以外を望んでいます。うまく
いけば、間もなく手に入るでしょう。
RB：Wavesはオープンソースですか。もしそうなら、開発者はどのように関与できますか。
DY ：WavesはMITライセンスであり、これ以上のオープンはないでしょう。プラットフォームを前進させる手伝いをしてくれる中核的な貢献者の参加を
心から望んでいます。関与への第一歩は、サポートフォーラムで私に連絡し、どういった種類のことに取り組みたいか知らせてください。今のところ、空きが
いっぱいあります。やるべきことは山ほどあり、Wavesだけでなく、少しでも意味のあるフレームワークを成功させるには、それに取り組む開発者のコミュ
ニティが欠かせないと思います。Waves は Rack、Sequel、Markabyの存在から非常に利益を得てきました。RackやSequel、Markabyでは実質的に、本当に素晴らしい
オープンソースの取り組みに、多大な作業が任されたのです。おかげでWavesは、MVCグルーの提供に貢献すること、この点の改善だけに集中できるので す。けれども、Wavesをさらに改良する機会はたくさんあります。
RB：Wavesはスレッドセーフだそうですが、これを説明していただけますか。
DY ：Waves は 「要求毎のスレッド」モデルをサポートし、異なるスレッドがお互いぶつからないように、要求はミューテックス内で処理されます。
Wavesはクラスタリングをサポートし、Rackを使うので、これがサポートしている唯一のモデルではありませんが、特にRuby1.9がネイティブで
OS スレッドをサポートするでしょうから、開発者に選択肢を与えることは重要だと思います。現在のところ、Rubyコミュニティ内でスレッドにとりわけ魅
力があるわけではありませんが、ネイティブのスレッディングがサポートされるようになった途端に、返り咲きするのではないかと思っています。なにしろ、事
がはかどりますから。利点は、動作させるアプリケーションインスタンスをより減らしてスケール可能なことで、パラレルアーキテクチャを活用できる、優れた
スレッド実装を有するマシン上では、特にその傾向が強くなります。そしてWavesでは、それがかなり簡単にできます。
RB：Ruby 1.9には「ネイティブ」スレッドがあるのを知って、Wavesが1.9とどのように連動すると思いますか。
DY ： Wavesは今のところ、1.9上ではサポートしていないと明言しておくべきでしょう。しかしながら、1.9でのサポートがWaves前進の主な目標であ り、それは1.9にはWavesで活用できる多数の魅力的な特徴があるからだけでなく、スレッドセーフであることが1.9上でのWavesのパフォーマン
スを飛躍的に向上させるからです。例えばMerbの皆さんはパフォーマンスについて心配していらっしゃいますが、私がMerbの方たちほどパフォーマンス
を心配する必要のない理由のひとつがここにあります。そして、次のリリースでは、WavesをThin上で動作させ、パフォーマンスを向上できるはずで
す。けれども、1.9に移行した途端に、もっとずっと面白くなると思っています。
RB：JRubyのサポートはどうなっていますか。Wavesでは、JRubyで完全サポートはしていないSequelを使っていますよね。
DY：その件はおそらくロードマップでは、1.9サポートの後になる予定ですが、提案を聞く用意はあります。Sequel は新規アプリケーションのデフォルトになっているだけで、WavesがSequel
に依存しているわけではないことを指摘しておきましょう。しかし、そうは言っても、今のところはパフォーマンスより特徴に重点を置いているため、
JRubyは最優先課題ではないのです。私はSequelの機能の混合が本当に気に入っていたので、それが良い例でしょう。うまくいけば、Waves用の
重要ライブラリは、ロードマップの十分早期の段階で、1.9とJRubyへマイグレーションするでしょう。ここでも、Rubyコミュニティからフィード
バックがあれば変更の可能性もあり、とりわけ貢献することに興味のある方がいらっしゃれば、その可能性は高くなります（暗に貢献のお願いです！）。
RB：Wavesの予定について、詳細を教えていただけますか。
DY ：第一に、すでに素晴らしい提案をもらっています。その中には、Tenjin、Haml、SassのテンプレートライブラリやThin Webサーバに対するサポート追加が入っており、近々実現することになっています。そして、クラスタリングサポートのバグ・フィックスです。現在は欠けて
いるデータベース支援のセッションをサポートに加えることも計画しており、request lambdaも若干改良する予定です。
Wavesのスキーマ反映能力の強化には多大な努力が必要です。今のところ、ここがSequelとDataMapperの弱点であり、WavesにはORMに依存しないスキーマの概念を持たせたいのです。JIT主義をViewsに拡張する上で、スキーマ反映が非常に重要と考えているからです。
テストに最良のデフォルトアプローチを見極めたいと思っています。これまでいろいろなアプローチを使ってきて、RSpecをとても気に入っているのです が、デフォルトのWavesアプリケーションに組み込むのにはためらいがあります。その理由は、検査に関しては現在、Rubyコミュニティに非常に多種多
様な意見とアプローチがあるからです。Sequelはとても簡単に決定できましたが、その理由は、ミグレーションをサポートしていること、Rubyの表現
式をクエリとして容認することで、これは本当に素晴らしい特徴だと思います。しかし、RSpecをデフォルトにすることに関しては、Sequelほど自信 を持てません。ですから、この分野で助けていただけると、非常に嬉しいです。
パフォーマンスへの取り組みも開始したいと思っており、最初は、問題の可能性がある箇所のベンチマークとプロファイリングのみ行います。本当に、これから
やるべき興味深いことが山積しています。Wavesはすでにかなりいい線まできていると思いますが、Wavesが魅力的になるかどうかは、Wavesが不
可能を可能にできるかにもかかっているのです。見えているのは氷山の一角に過ぎないのです。ロードマップ項目のリストをhttp://rubywaves.com/roadmapに管理していますので、まだ改良の初期段階ですが、さらに詳細をお知りになりたい方はご覧ください。
RB：時間を割い てWavesについてお話しいただき、ありがとうございました。

If you drop molten glass into a bucket of water , it will solidify into what 's called a " Prince Rupert 's Drop . "
According to this Corning video , the surface of the drop is in a state of great compression , while the interior is in a state of great tension .
You can squeeze the bulbous part of the drop with pliers or bang on it with a hammer to no avail .
However , if you snap off the hair - thin tail at the end of the drop , it 'll shatter into dust .

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting , when you start to dig a little deeper .
Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity .
Some twenty - five years after it was first released to the world , Slackware is indeed still going strong .
It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many .
As of this writing , it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace .
If you ’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options , you will hear about Slackware a lot .
There are several reasons as to why that is the case .
An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware , we have to cover two major subjects .
First , let ’s take a quick at the history of Slackware .
That begins in 1993 , although work began on it even earlier than that .
With this foundation , we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware .
These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades .
They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019 .
As of this year , Slackware is the longest - standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated .
A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux , Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993 .
It was released to the world at large in April of that year , and it has been well - regarded and updated ever since .
One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix - like distribution option for Linux .
Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again .
Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware .
According to Scott Chow of Theblogstarter.com , Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream .
Furthermore , it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases , or precluding the decisions of the user .
There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation .
You also wo n’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package .
It utilizes plain text files , and utilizes a small set of shell scripts , when it comes to configuration and administration .
Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common - line interface .
Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years .
Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates , which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present .
The most recent update was released in June of 2016 — just two years ago .
As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware , let ’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect .
Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate .
It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly , and that would be regardless of your level of experience .
We wo n’t cover every single Slackware feature here , but let ’s unpack some of the top things to expect :
• X - Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP - related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities
As you can see , Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning .
That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself , but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind .
Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately , it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs .
The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately .
Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately .
Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time - consuming requirements .
For now , let ’s explore some of the most commonly - cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux :
• Stability : Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable .
Over the course of the past twenty - five years , Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems .
It has moved nicely with the times , but it really has n’t changed all that much .
Few things related to computers have such stability .
• Security : Even for Linux distributions , there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind .
By and large , Slackware does n’t have that problem .
It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready .
• Neutral : Remember that Slackware is n’t dependent upon a package manager .
This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source .
Slackware is not affiliated with any company either .
Distribution was community - driven in the early 90s , and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later .
• Speediness :
Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want .
Because of this , and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above , Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions .
• Clean configuration :
One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it does n’t have graphical config utilities .
No matter what you want to do , you are going to need to use the command line .
Some people find this frustrating , but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with .
• Want to understand Linux :
There are other benefits to Slackware , but this one might just be our favorite .
Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions , there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort .
Some do n’t even experience this extra effort .
However , if you do , think about Linux in broader terms .
If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux , you really ca n’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware .
When you ’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware , you will have pretty much mastered using Linux , as well .
Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart .
At the end of the day , nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement .
People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution .
Nonetheless , Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore .
It has worked for an incredibly long time , and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that ca n’t be intensely / comprehensively useful .
You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else .
Is Slackware right for you ?
At this point , you are in the best position possible to make that determination .
As we mentioned before , Slackware is best experienced in a hands - on capacity .
You can research the subject to death , and you still wo n’t really know for sure .
The only thing we can promise you , as we mentioned before , is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly .
It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made , in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals .
Caging the Effects Monster
Simon Peyton Jones gave an outstanding keynote on functional programming at ACCU 2008 .
A language researcher at Microsoft in Cambridge , he ’s perhaps best known as the man behind the Haskell programming language and GHC , the leading Haskell compiler .
He also happens to be a superb presenter who positively exudes enthusiasm .
Not many compiler writers connect so well with an audience .
I ’m a huge fan of a functional programming style , by which I mean I like first class functions , higher order functions , anonymous functions , list comprehensions , closures and so on .
In the languages I use most often , C++ , Python and Shell , functional programming is a central paradigm — every bit as useful and important as object - oriented and procedural programming .
For Haskell and other pure functional languages it ’s not just about style .
Simon Peyton Jones ’ central argument was that programming will increasingly be about the control of side - effects : to write correct programs , side - effects must be contained .
A pure function has no side - effects .
Thus you can be sure what it does .
You can even prove it correct .
A pure program built entirely from pure functions is equally correct but , sadly , of limited use .
Haskell ’s type system distinguishes pure functions from impure ones — the ones which change the world .
If you minimise and contain impurity , you ’re winning !
It ’s certainly a compelling argument .
In the languages I use from day to day , as already mentioned , I favour a functional style .
I also adopt value - based programming ( sometimes known as single assignment programming — once you ’ve set something , you do n’t change it ) as far as possible : it ’s easier to figure out what a program does , and you can avoid a whole class of defects .
Simon Peyton Jones describes my approach as “ Plan A ” , the mainstream route towards writing programs which are both useful and safe .
He promotes “ Plan B ” , a more radical approach , where “ useless ” languages like Haskell find ways to change the world .
Strong Static Typing
Static type checking is central to Haskell and the language comes with a rich type system allowing static analysis and compile - time checking .
It ’s the type system which determines , rigorously , which parts of a program have side - effects .
Unlike C++ , the type system does n’t seem to get in the way .
A lot more is inferred .
In fact , some type declarations are unnecessary since the compiler could deduce them from the code — but in Haskell type declarations , at least for module exports , are seen as a good thing .
I found this interesting .
Although I like dynamic languages I also like strong typing ( yes , you can have both ) .
In theory , static strong typing would be best of all ; you eliminate the bug before you run the code .
My experience with languages like C++ and Java have caused me to kick against this theory .
The C++ type system just seems to get in your way : by the time you ’ve wrestled the compiler into submission and got a program you can actually run you ’ve worked so hard you feel like it must be good , when actually you ’d have been better off running , testing , revising the code in an iterative manner .
You ’d certainly have had more fun !
Haskell , though , may cause me to revise my opinion once again .
It may indeed offer the benefits of strong static typing without the baggage .
A Taste of Haskell
In the afternoon I attended Simon Peyton Jones ’ “ Taste of Haskell ” tutorial , which went into Haskell in more depth .
The room was packed and people had to be turned away .
Although I have written and read some Haskell I know very little about it , and three hours training with the world expert on the subject have n’t really altered that .
Nonetheless , I ’d like to record my first impressions here .
They may all turn out to be wrong !
State sees costly increase in teen birthrate
The increase costs California 's taxpayers $ 1.7 billion a year
- - Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close State sees costly increase in teen birthrate 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
The teenage birthrate in California increased in 2006 for the first time in 15 years and costs taxpayers $ 1.7 billion a year - or $ 2,493 per baby , according to a report released Wednesday by the Oakland - based Public Health Institute .
San Francisco was one of a handful of counties in the state where the teen birthrate continued to decline , but even there , births to teenage parents are placing a significant burden on taxpayers to the tune of $ 9.3 million a year .
The financial losses cover a range of things , said the study 's authors , from public assistance to foster care to diminished future taxable wages and spending power among the parents .
" The costs are really starting to climb now .
That 's not money we can afford to lose , " said Dr. Norman Constantine , a clinical professor of public health at UC Berkeley and lead author of the Public Health Institute study .
The actual number of births to teens started increasing in 2004 , due to a growing population of teens in the state , and the annual costs to taxpayers has climbed at the same time - the state hit a low of about $ 1.45 billion a year in 2002 , and then saw a sharp climb in costs through 2006 .
There were 52,770 babies born to teen moms in California in 2006 , the most recent year available , for a rate of 37.8 births per 1,000 teens .
That was a small increase over the previous year 's rate of 37.2 births per 1,000 , but it was remarkable for ending a streak of declining rates that the state 's public health officials had pointed to with great pride .
In San Francisco , 288 babies were born to teen moms in 2006 , for a rate of 18.9 per 1,000 teens .
California 's teen birthrate is still well below the peak of 70.9 births per 1,000 in 1991 , and it also is below the national average today of 41.9 births per 1,000 teens .
But public health officials throughout the Bay Area said part of the blame for the sudden increase statewide is complacency among themselves .
" We know that California has led the nation in reducing its birthrate , and we 've all been very proud of it , " Constantine said .
" When the number ( of births ) started creeping up , even while the rate was going down , we were n't paying enough attention . "
Many factors contribute
Teen health experts said the increase can't be attributed to one factor ; likely causes include higher poverty rates statewide and a growing teenage population .
Funding for sex education has not grown fast enough to keep up with the increasing number of teenagers , public health officials said .
The costs to individual families can be devastating .
Girls who give birth as teenagers are usually less educated than their peers , make less money , are more likely to be single moms , and run a higher risk of having a baby with health problems , public health officials say .
Lost income and private medical expenses resulting from babies born to teens cost their families more than $ 3,000 a year , according to the Public Health Institute report .
To calculate taxpayer costs , Constantine used a model that analyzed factors such as loss of tax revenue based on the teenage parents ' lowered income ; reliance on public assistance , including welfare and Medi-Cal ; and costs for increased placement in foster care .
The calculations also included loss of income for the child when he or she reaches adulthood .
" California ca n't risk the economic and social impact of increased teenage pregnancy rates , " said Amy Moy , a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Golden Gate .
" We know teens need information and access to resources to make responsible decisions .
Although the state has made a lot of headway over the past decade , the recent increase points to a growing need for better access to sex education . "
Room for improvement in S.F .
Even San Francisco can improve its services , public health officials said , noting that the county still has a high rate of sexually transmitted diseases among teens .
Part of the reason San Francisco has such a low rate of teenage births may be simple demographics - the county has a fairly small population of teenagers to begin with , said Virginia Smyly , deputy director of community programs at the San Francisco Department of Public Health .
Smyly said San Francisco has done a good job of providing services to teens , offering sex education starting in elementary school through high school that includes everything from biology to family planning .
Condoms are available in the high schools , and teenagers are encouraged to visit a health clinic if they decide to have sex .
" We really want to protect young people , " Smyly said .
" We have built a web around them , and there are a few who fall through the cracks , but overall , they have support for what they want to do . "
In Alameda County , where the teenage birthrate climbed from 26.6 births per 1,000 teens to 30 births per 1,000 in 2006 , public health officials are testing new programs to reach teen girls , Latinas in particular .
The teen birthrate among Latinas is almost twice the national average , according to the Public Health Institute .
" I do n't think we need a big overhaul in our programs , because they already worked once in getting the rates down , " said Wendy Calimag , director of community development at Girls Inc. , a San Leandro nonprofit .
" But we need more resources , and we need to keep being innovative .
We train girls to be peer health educators , because you know teenagers , they 're tend to go to their friends for help . "

If your test has an assertion , do not add any mock expectations ( instead use stubs for any methods that need to be changed for the test ) .
If you add a mock expectation you probably do n't need it to return a meaningful value ( since you wo n't be verifying that value ) .
If you already have a mock expectation you should use the stubs method for any other method where you do n't want to use the implementation .
Do not use . with when using a stub unless you need to .
If you are stubbing , you do n't need to verify the arguments .
When returning stubs , prefer stub_everything so that additional calls to the stub will not cause unnecessary exceptions to be raised .
In a previous entry I discussed why I prefer One Assertion Per Test .
In that entry I give a few state based examples , but did n't address the topic of mocks .
This entry is going to focus on how you can use mocks while maintaining focus on maintainability .
Let 's start with an example .
The SuiteRunner class is fairly straightforward , it 's simply delegating the block on to the instance_eval method on the suite attribute , which is an instance of the Suite class .
Even though the class is n't doing anything very interesting the test is n't completely simple .
Due to the chain of method calls you need to set up 2 mocks and a total of 3 expectations .
While the test is n't unmaintainable , if the description ( the method name ) is n't kept up to date you could easily lose the intent of the test .
A step in the right direction toward making this test more readable is to introduce a few stubs .
However , before we decide what to stub we need to decide what this test is trying to verify .
Given the description it seems that eval 'ing in the context of the suite is what is being tested , thus the suite mock should probably remain .
Since the suite mock is the focus of the test , the rest of the mocks are probably better expressed as stubs .
The test can be written more concisely now that we 've chosen to use stubs .
With one mock and one expectation the test expresses it 's purpose .
Code should not only express how it works , but also why it 's been written in a particular way .
The new test not only executes , but it conveys the intent of the test ( even if the description becomes stale ) .
Converting that test was easy , but tests that have behavior expectations and state based assertions can be a bit more complicated to clean up .
There 's a lot going on in this test .
Test :: Unit even reports that 7 assertions have been met .
Unfortunately , with that much going on in a test , it 's hard to tell what the original intent of the test was .
Even worse , it would be hard to change anything in the book_for method without breaking this test .
The test is completely tied to the implementation and if that implementation changes you 'll break one or more of the assertions within the test .
What really bothers me about this test is the ability to break " one or more " assertions .
If you change themethod to also take the hotel as an argument the test will immediately stop executing with the following error .
Knowing that an assertion failed is good , knowing that other assertions might also fail when you fix the first problem is not so good .
The problem with this test is that it 's verifying 7 different things .
This can most likely be resolved by writing several different tests that all focus on one thing .
( There are several tests that can be written , here are 5 examples ) The above tests take more lines of code than the original , but they are far more maintainable .
You can change the implementation of the book_for method in various ways and only break the tests that are relevant to the change .
The tests have become more robust .
They 've also become more readable because they express what their focus is .
The tests that have a mock with an expectation are written to test a behavior that is expected .
The tests that have an assertion are written to statefully verify that the object has been set as expected .
When the implementation does inevitably change the tests can communicate on their own what the original author intended .
Writing tests in this way is actually quite easy if you follow a few simple suggestions .
The above suggestions focus on creating tests that assert ( or expect ) one thing at a time and specify as little other implementation as possible .
Every expectation , . with , and .returns statement is specifying implementation .
The less implementation you express in a test , the more that test becomes .
I consider each call to stub ( or stub_everything ) , stubs , mock , expects , with , and returns to be 1 implementation specification point .
Any test that has an implementation specification score of 5 or more has the high implementation specification smell .
As with all smells , everything might be okay , but I 'm going to take the extra time to see if anything can be broken up by moving responsibilities or creating smaller methods .
By limiting your tests to one assertion or one expectation you create tests that express their intent .
By creating tests that specify as little implementation as possible you reduce the amount of noise taking away from the intent of the test .
An additional consequence of creating tests that focus on intent is that they specify less and are therefore more robust .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Scientists studying the icy depths of the sea around Antarctica have detected changes in salinity that could have profound effects on the world ’s climate and ocean currents .

The scientists returned to the southern Australian city of Hobart on Thursday after a one - month voyage studying the Southern Ocean to see how it is changing and what those changes might mean for global climate patterns .
Voyage leader Steve Rintoul said his team found that salty , dense water that sinks near the edge of Antarctica to the bottom of the ocean about 5 km ( 3 miles ) down was becoming fresher and more buoyant .
So - called Antarctic bottom water helps power the great ocean conveyor belt , a system of currents spanning the Southern , Pacific , Indian and Atlantic Oceans that shifts heat around the globe .
“ The main reason we ’re paying attention to this is because it is one of the switches in the climate system and we need to know if we are about to flip that switch or not , ” said Rintoul of Australia ’s government - backed research arm the CSIRO .
“ If that freshening trend continues for long enough , eventually the water near Antarctica would be too light , too buoyant to sink and that limb of the global - scale circulation would shut down , ” he said on Friday .
Cold , salty water also sinks to the depths in the far north Atlantic Ocean near Greenland and , together with the vast amount of water that sinks off Antarctica , this drives the ocean conveyor belt .
This system brings warm water into the far north Atlantic , making Europe warmer than it would otherwise be , and also drives the large flow of upper ocean water from the tropical Pacific to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesia Archipelago .
If these currents were to slow or stop , the world ’s climate would eventually be thrown into chaos .
“ We do n’t see any evidence yet that the amount of bottom water that ’s sinking has declined .
But by becoming fresher and less dense it ’s moving in the direction of an ultimate shutdown . ”
Rintoul said results of the bottom water samples in the Ross Sea directly south of New Zealand and off Antarctica ’s Adelie Land further to the west , were a crucial finding .
“ We did n’t know that before we left but it ’s now clear that both of those regions are becoming fresher for some reason . ”
GLOBAL WARMING TO BLAME ?
During the voyage , scientists from Australia , Britain , France and the United States measured salinity , carbon dioxide and iron concentrations as well as currents between Antarctica and Australia .
Rintoul said his team are studying if faster melting of icesheets or sea ice is the source of the fresher water but he said it was too early to tell if global warming was to blame .
Over the coming months , his team will study oxygen isotopes collected from water samples .
“ Oxygen isotopes act as a tracer of ice melt and that information should help pin down exactly what the cause of the freshening is in the deep ocean , ” said Rintoul , of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre .
“ The leading hypothesis at the moment for why it ’s freshening is that the floating ice around Antarctica is melting more rapidly than in the past . ”
He pointed to studies showing winds around Antarctica changing because of global warming and the ozone hole .
“ The most likely scenario is that those changes in winds have changed the circulation of the ocean , in particular caused more upwelling of relatively warm water from below and that could have caused the increased melting of ice around Antarctica , ” he said .
“ The next challenge over the coming months and year will be to see just how well we can this pin down . ”

Camille Paglia ( born 1947 ) is a modern goddess .
I do n't know about you , but she is to me , in all the glory of that word .
In fact , she 'd be a sex goddess .
Young chicks are good for porn , but intelligent women turns me on deeply .
Camille Paglia Interview by Playboy
Here 's a excerpt of interview by Playboy , 1995 May .
The source is from this site : http://privat.ub.uib.no/BUBSY/playboy.htm
PLAYBOY : Do you support the men's movement ?
PAGLIA : I think it 's absolutely necessary .
It 's no coincidence that Tim Allen 's book is vying with the Pope 's for the top of the best - seller lists .
He is one of the voices of men who are looking to define masculinity in this age .
Robert
Bly does this , too .
We have allowed the sexual debate to be defined by women , and that 's not right .
Men must speak , and speak in their own voices , not voices coerced by feminist moralists .
Warren Farrell , in The Myth of Male Power , points out how much propaganda has infiltrated the culture .
For example , he says that the assertion that women earn so much less than men is bullshit .
The reason women earn less than men is that women do n't want the dirty jobs .
They are n't picking up the garbage , taking the janitorial jobs and so on .
They are n't taking the sales commission jobs that require you to work all night and on weekends .
Most women like clean , safe offices , which is why they are still secretaries .
They do n't want to get too dirty .
Also , women want offices to be nice , happy places .
What bullshit .
The women 's movement is rooted in the belief that we do n't even need men .
All it will take is one natural disaster to prove how wrong that is .
Then , the only thing holding this culture together will be masculine men of the working class .
The cultural elite — women and men — will be pleading for the plumbers and the construction workers .
We are such a parasitic class .
I began to realize this in the Seventies when I thought women could do it on their own .
But then something would go wrong with my car and I 'd have to go to the men .
Men would stop , men would lift up the hood , more men would come with a truck and take the car to a place where there were other men who would call other men who would arrive with parts .
I saw how feminism was completely removed from this reality .
I also learned something from the men at the garage .
At Bennington , I would go to a faculty meeting and be aware that everyone hated me .
The men were appalled by a strong , loud woman .
But I went to this auto shop and the men there thought I was cute .
“ Oh , there 's that Professor Paglia from the college . ”
The real men , men who work on cars , find me cute .
They are not frightened by me , no matter how loud I am .
But the men at the college were terrified because they are eunuchs , and I threatened every goddamned one of them .
PLAYBOY : Do you think that feminism is antisexual ?
PAGLIA : The problem with America is that there 's too little sex , not too much .
The more our instincts are repressed , the more we need sex , pornography and all that .
The problem is that feminists have taken over with their attempts to inhibit sex .
We have a serious testosterone problem in this country .
PLAYBOY : Caused by what ?
PAGLIA : It 's a mess out there .
Men are suspicious of women 's intentions .
Feminism has crippled them .
They do n't know when to make a pass .
If they do make a pass , they do n't know if they 're going to end up in court .
PLAYBOY : Is that why you 've been so critical about the growing number of sexual harassment cases ?
PAGLIA : Yes , though I believe in moderate sexual harassment guidelines .
But you can't the Stalinist situation we have in America right now , where any neurotic woman can make any stupid charge and destroy a man 's reputation .
If there is evidence of false accusation , the accuser should be expelled .
Similarly , a woman who falsely accuses a man of rape should be sent to jail .
My definition of sexual harassment is specific .
It is only sexual harassment — by a man or a woman — if it is quid pro quo .
That is , if someone says , “ You must do this or I 'm going to do that ” — for instance , fire you .
And whereas touching is sexual harassment , speech is not .
I am militant on this .
Words must remain free .
The solution to speech is that women must signal the level of their tolerance — women are all different .
Some are very bawdy .
PLAYBOY : What , about women who are easily offended and too scared or intimidated to speak up ?
PAGLIA : Too bad .
You must develop the verbal tools to counter offensive language .
That 's life .
Feminism has created a privileged , white middle class of girls who claim they 're victims because they want to preserve their bourgeois decorum and passivity .
PLAYBOY : You 're expecting girls to stand up for themselves in a culture that discourages them from doing just that ?
PAGLIA : That 's right .
We must examine the degree to which we coddle middle - class girls .
There is something sick about it .
The girls I see on campuses are often innocuous , with completely homogenized personalities , miserable , anorexic and bulimic .
The feminist movement teaches them that it 's men's fault , but it is n't .
These girls go out into the world as heiresses of all the affluence in the universe .
They are the most pampered and most affluent girls on the globe .
So stop complaining about men .
You 're getting all the rewards that come with the nice - girl persona you 've chosen .
When you get into trouble and you 're batting your eyes and someone is offending you and you are too nice to deal with it , that 's a choice .
Assess your persona .
Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you — sometimes to violate your niceness .
The more you blush , the more people want to do it .
Understand your part of it and learn to parry .
Sex talk is a game .
The girls in the Sixties loved it .
If you do n't want some professor to call you honey , tell him .
PLAYBOY : What are the trends in the porn movie industry symptomatic of ?
PAGLIA : Feminist PC bullshit has taken over the industry so the videos , except for the gay male ones , are all boring .
There has been a horrible decline in quality .
There is just a bunch of professional porn actresses simulating orgasm .
The hot movies are from the Russ Meyer period , the late Sixties and early Seventies .
I loved that period .
And Debbie Does Dallas .
Good and lewd .
I mean , Deep Throat was a revelation .
PLAYBOY : How so ?
PAGLIA : Good fellatio is an art form .
I know this from gay men ; one of them said that they should have federal funding for the development of fellatio skills — it should be underwritten .
Well , when I was growing up , good middle class white girls never discussed it .
We 'd never even heard of it .
Women went with their boyfriends to see Deep Throat , and their mouths were hanging open .
No one could believe it .
Now , after 20 years , we 've seen so many demonstrations of it that it has become a part of the culture .
I think it 's a very good skill .

I was reading How to install Ubuntu Linux from USB Stick posted on this site a while ago , and found it to be quite some work to get Ubuntu working on a USB stick .
Besides , having to prepare your USB device , creating a separate partition on it which will be more or less " useless " after the installation , giving up 750 MB of space ?
There had to be a better way .
Together with a colleague of mine , I decided to figure out whether there could be an easier way to install Ubuntu on a USB device .
I found a way of doing it in a much simpler way ... without creating the separate partition to store the LiveCD :
A couple of assumptions to take into account when going through this manual :
My computer ( Dell D820 laptop ) has 1 internal disk , devided into 3 partitions ( dell utility -- windows -- Ubuntu 8.04 )
Just one USB device ( in my case a 250 GB harddisk
BIOS configured to enable boot from internal HDD , CD / DVD and USB Storage device
( I did n't take screenshots , so I will be explaining a lot about the screens ...
It looks like a lot of work , but trust me : it is not , and it really is easy : -)
Insert the LiveCD into your computer ; Connect your USB device ;
Boot your computer from the liveCD ; Once Ubuntu is started , go to System -- Administration -- Partition Manager
This will open the Partion Editor .
Select your USB device and delete all partitions on it .
Click Apply and exit Partition Editor ; Double Click the Install Icon .
This will start the Installer ; The Welcome Screen is shown .
Choose your language and click Forward ; Select your Time Zone and click Forward ; Choose your Keyboard Layout and click Forward ;
The partitioner will be started , and you will be given the choice where to install Ubuntu .
Choose Guided --
Use entire disk , selecting your USB device ( this will most likely be / dev/sdb , do n't choose / dev/sdb1 ! ) ;
The next sceen you will give your username / password information .
Provide the required info and hit Forward ;
If there is anything to migrate from other installations on your computer ( most likely not ) , do whatever you want , and click Forward ;
The next screen is important --
It is titled : " Ready to Install " .
Be careful here : before clicking on Forward , make sure you click on the " Advanced " Button !
This will open a new screen , giving you the option whether and where to install the bootloader .
Select your USB device ( in my case it was / dev/sdb ) to install the bootloader to ;
Exit this screen and click on Forward in the " Ready to Install " screen , which will be shown ;
The installation will be started now .
Just be patient , grab a cup of coffee and come back 15 minutes later , your installation will be more or less finished by then .
So you have finished the installation .
However , when you will be restarting your system from USB , you will find out that the partition you just installed Ubuntu to cannot be mounted .
Here comes the trick :
Once the installation is finished , reboot your PC ( this is the safest ) from your LiveCD , with your USB device connected ;
Once started , open up a terminal ( Applications -- Accessories -- Terminal ) ;
In the Terminal , type : sudo - i ( which will give you root privileges , so be careful from now on ! ) ;
Change directories to / media / disk / boot / grub --
This will take you to the " / boot / grub " directory on the USB device ; open menu.lst with vi ( make a backup first ! )
Go to line 130 ( or somewhere in that area ) .
You will find a line looking like :
## ## End Default options ##
And underneath it you will find three entries pointing to your Ubuntu you just installed :
title Ubuntu 8.04 , kernel 2.6.24-16-generic
root ( hd1,0 )
kernel / boot / vmlinuz .........
initrd / boot / initrd .......
quiet
( the above 5 lines repeat 3 times with slight differences )
The magic trick is to change ( hd 1,0 ) into ( hd0,0 ) for all these three entries .
Why ?
Booting from USB device makes your USB device hd0 , in stead of hd1 at time of installation .
Search for the line starting with " # groot = ( hd 1,0 ) " and change ( hd 1,0 ) to ( hd0,0 ) --
Do n't delete the # at te beginning of this line !
Once you did this , you can optionally remove the remaining of the file
( everything underneath ### END DEBIAN AUTOMATIC KERNELS LIST ) ;
Save the file , make sure it is owned by root : ubuntu ( chgrp ubuntu menu . * will do )
Edit device.map ( in the same directory ) and change the mapping of hd0 to / dev/sdb .
Reboot your machine , from USB , choose the Ubuntu installation from the Boot Loader and you are one happy person .
I guess that is it .
If I missed something , please comment .

With the conservative bloc so clearly in control , what leverage could the liberals possibly have ?
Recall the pledge that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made , both in his 2005 confirmation hearing and in the early months of his tenure , to seek consensus and to lead the court in speaking in a modest judicial voice .
That was not how the last term looked , as the majority took aim at precedents and appeared to have in mind an agenda much more ambitious than simply calling balls and strikes .
Indeed , much of the commentary on the court ’s performance during the last term was harsh , and it came not only from liberals .
Judge Richard A. Posner , the conservative icon who sits on the federal appeals court in Chicago , offers some pointed and unusually personal criticism of Chief Justice Roberts in his new book , “ How Judges Think , ” published this year by Harvard University Press .
The chief justice ’s self - description during his confirmation hearing as a simple baseball umpire might have been a “ tactical error ” for one who evidently “ aspires to remake significant areas of constitutional law , ” Judge Posner writes , adding :
“ The tension between what he said at his confirmation hearing and what he is doing as a justice is a blow to Roberts ’s reputation for candor and a further debasement of the already debased currency of the testimony of nominees at judicial confirmation hearings . ”
Such words from Richard Posner would cause any member of the court , let alone a relatively new and young chief justice who undoubtedly admires him , to swallow hard .
The court ’s modulated tone may also stem from the fact that this is an election year .
Lee Epstein , a political scientist and law professor at Northwestern University , said that political scientists had long observed an “ election effect ” on the court that results in more consensus and fewer 5 - to - 4 decisions during an election year than in the preceding term .
“ Of course , lots of things could explain this , but the pattern is pretty interesting , ” Ms. Epstein said in an e-mail exchange , adding that the justices “ probably do n’t want to provoke controversy , or become an issue , during the election  especially an election with a highly uncertain outcome . ”
Perhaps the conservative justices were taken aback by the public response to the Lilly Ledbetter case , a 5 - to - 4 decision in an employment discrimination case last term that placed a tight time limit on an employee ’s ability to file a pay discrimination claim .
The decision led to Congressional hearings during which the court was denounced as out of touch with the reality of women ’s working lives .
A bill to overturn the decision failed in the Senate , but came close .
Whether as a direct result , the court adopted a notably different tone in an employment discrimination case decided in February .
The court voted 7 to 2 to excuse an employee ’s failure to file the proper form to initiate an age discrimination case .
With only Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissenting , that case , Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki , produced one of the term ’s few liberal victories .
Another closely watched employment discrimination case ended , surprisingly , with a unanimous decision that avoided drawing the clear line that the two sides were arguing over .
None of this is to suggest that whatever strategic decisions the justices are making are being made collectively .
The court is by its nature an atomistic institution , its actions the aggregation of determinedly individual decisions .
But if any one individual is smiling , it is no doubt Chief Justice Roberts .
By this time last year , he had cast seven dissenting votes .
So far this term , he has dissented only once .
Recently declassified documents show that in the 1960's , the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to ( using an elaborate plan involving the switching of airplanes ) , and also to , and then to blame it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba .
If you view no other links in this article , please read the following ABC news report the official documents ; and watch this interview with the former Washington Investigative Producer for ABC 's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings
After having her first complaint dismissed , exonerated former RIAA target Tanya Andersen refiled an amended complaint in her malicious prosecution lawsuit against the record labels earlier this month at the judge 's request .
Instead of filing an answer to Andersen 's complaint , the RIAA is asking the presiding judge to dismiss the new complaint .
Should the judge choose not to dismiss the " verbose , confused and redundant complaint , " the RIAA would like some additional time to file a response .
The RIAA 's request was made in a filing late last week , one in which it argued that Andersen 's attorney , Lory Lybeck , ignored the judge 's instructions .
Andersen has filed a " massive " 108 - page , 353 - paragraph amended complaint that the RIAA says is " long on rhetoric , hyperbole , and scandalous allegations " and does not heed the judge 's direction to file a " plain and concise " complaint .
Although the record labels were willing to spend well over two years prosecuting their unsuccessful lawsuit against Andersen , they are now seeking to resolve Andersen v. Atlantic " as expeditiously as possible . "
One such expeditious resolution would be a dismissal of Andersen 's new complaint , the RIAA argues , citing a couple of cases where refiled complaints where dismissed for not following a judge 's directions .
" Indeed , under very similar circumstances , complaints significantly shorter than that filed by Plaintiff have been dismissed for failure to comply with the district court ’s order granting leave to amend and Rule 8 . "
Andersen was originally sued for copyright infringement by the RIAA in 2005 .
After the labels decided to dismiss the lawsuit , she fought back with her lawsuit which accuses MediaSentry , the record labels , and the RIAA of negligence .
The RIAA and the Settlement Support Center that handles the settlement letters are also accused of intentional infliction of emotional distress , RICO violations , conspiracy , unlawful trade practices , and a handful of other wrongs .
Tanya Andersen
In an interview just before the amended complaint was filed , Lybeck told Ars that he planned on taking advantage of the discovery process to look into agreements between the RIAA , its member companies , MediaSentry , and the Settlement Support Center .
The RIAA 's latest filing shows that it is poised to fight attempts at discovery tooth and nail , as the labels believe that " the vast majority " of Andersen 's allegations can be addressed with " little or no discovery . "
After reading through the RIAA 's filing last week as well as a 68 - page transcript of the February 13 hearing where Judge Anna J. Brown dismissed Andersen 's first complaint , I decided to reread the " massive " 108 - page amended complaint filed by Andersen ( all of the documents are available on PACER ; Threat Level also has a PDF available , and David Kravets covered the RIAA 's filing on Friday ) .
Part of the massiveness the RIAA objects to comes from Lybeck 's attempts to adhere to the judge 's instructions to explicitly lay out both the allegations and claims for release .
The vast majority of Andersen 's 18 claims for relief go into a fair amount of supporting detail .
( The 18th claim seeks an injunction barring the RIAA from " continuing to engage in criminal investigation of private American citizens . " )
Both parties would like to see this case wrapped up quickly ( but obviously with different results ) .
Given the scope of Andersen 's amended complaint and the RIAA 's response seeking ( at the very least ) additional time to respond , that appears to be an unlikely outcome .
Update
In a docket entry made today , Judge Anna J. Brown noted her agreement with some of the RIAA 's criticism 's of Andersen 's amended complaint .
Andersen will have until April 10 to file a third amended complaint " consistent with the Court 's directions during the hearing on February 11 , 2008 " if she desires , with a status conference scheduled a few days later .
“ THE crowd is turning on me , ” said Charles Gibson , the ABC anchor , when the audience jeered him in the final moments of Wednesday night ’s face - off between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
I ca n’t remember a debate in which the only memorable moment was the audience ’s heckling of a moderator .
Then again , I ca n’t remember a debate that became such an instant national gag , earning reviews more appropriate to a slasher movie like “ Prom Night ” than a civic event held in Philadelphia ’s National Constitution Center :
“ Shoddy , despicable ! ”  The Washington Post
“ A tawdry affair ! ”  The Boston Globe
“ A televised train wreck ! ”  The Philadelphia Daily News
And those were the polite ones .
Let ’s not even go to the blogosphere .
Of course , Obama fans were angry because of the barrage of McCarthyesque guilt - by - association charges against their candidate , portraying him as a fellow traveler of bomb - throwing , America - hating , flag - denigrating terrorists .
The debate ’s co-moderator , George Stephanopoulos , second to no journalist in his firsthand knowledge of the Clinton White House , could have easily rectified the imbalance .
All he had to do was draw on his expertise to ask similar questions about Bill Clinton ’s check - bearing business and foundation associates circling a potential new Clinton administration .
He did not .
But viewers of all political persuasions were affronted by the moderators ’ failure to ask about the mortgage crisis , health care , the environment , torture , education , China policy , the pending G.I. bill to aid veterans , or the war we ’re losing in Afghanistan .
Those minutes were devoted not just to recycling the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Bosnian sniper fire and another lame question about a possible “ dream ticket ” but to the unseemly number of intrusive commercials and network promos that prompted the jeering at the end .
The trashiest ads often bumped directly into an ABC announcer ’s periodic recitations of quotations from the Constitution .
Such defacing of American values is to be expected , I guess , from a network whose debate moderators refuse to wear flag pins .

Air boss defends charging passengers by weight on BBC News 2nd Apr 2013 .
Update : Eight years after I wrote this , The Economist remarks
In fact , on a purely economic basis , it makes sense to charge passengers by weight , since that is directly correlated with fuel usage , which goes a long way in determining flight costs in article 21st Oct 2016
When you send a parcel by air , the price depends on the volume and weight of that parcel .
Volume , because you are buying a certain amount of space in the plane .
Weight , because the heavier the plane ’s cargo , the more fuel it takes to get it off the ground .
You pay for the fuel to fly your parcel .
The pricing structure for air mail / air freight is closely linked to the costs faced by the airline .
When you travel with your parcels , a disconnect appears .
You buy a certain amount of space – typically a seat for yourself , a small bag and one or two big bags .
A bigger seat ( ‘ business ’ , ‘ premium ’ , etc ) is more money .
Extra bags is more money .
But you ’re not paying by weight – and I think that will have to change .
Currently you get a fixed amount of weight for your bags , and an unlimited amount of weight for yourself .
A 120 lb ( 55kg ) waif with no luggage pays the same as a 260 lb ( 115kg ) behemoth with their full complement of luggage ( 2 x 50 lbs in the hold plus 40 lb in the cabin , on American Airlines ) .
That ’s the same price for 120 lb as for 400 lb !
Try convincing an air freight company ( UPS , Fedex , etc ) to use that pricing structure !
The reason it works is that the 120lb person subsidizes the 400lb one , and the airlines hope it evens out .
Now , whenever you see that type of setup , there is an opportunity .
Attract only the most valuable customers ( the light low - luggage ones , who are over - paying their share of the fuel ) , split the difference with them , and you have a business .
The reason I think this will happen is that it will only take one airline to switch .
The first one to start charging by weight will get a lot of press coverage , and higher profits ( from over - charging the light customers slightly less than the other airlines ) .
Once the high - value customers start using an airline that offers them better rates , the balance stops working everywhere else .
The other airlines end up with only the heavy high - luggage customers that are paying less than their share of the fuel .
They have to change to survive .
Airline pricing should be a flat rate for your seat ( depending on the ‘ class ’ of your seat ) , and a price per lb or kg you want the airline to carry .
The weight price should fluctuate as often as the price at the petrol pump .

Ah , the magic of science !
You can't get french fries much faster than from a vending machine on your favorite street corner !
A Spanish company , Patatas Chef , has developed a vending machine of the same name , that will do just that .
Here 's their description :
" The fully automatic french - fries vending machine provides , in a record time , a delicious portion of hot crunchy and golden fries .
" The potatoes are fried on the spot , and a tray is provided to collect your portion .
Also , the salt and ketchup , if wished , are dispensed automatically .
" It works like a clean and small sophisticated factory with the most absolute respect for the environment , and maintains the hygienic conditions required by edible products , and is equipped to maintain the quality of natural products that are being used . "

Two Guns Used in RFK Assassination , Experts Say Two forensic scientists conclude Sirhan Sirhan was not lone RFK shooter .
March 27 , 2008  --
Two forensic scientists have added their names to the list of people who do n't believe Sirhan Sirhan acted alone when he shot Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 .
Kennedy was gunned down on June 5 , 1968 , at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles .
A gunman identified as Sirhan Sirhan was wrestled to the ground and later convicted as the man solely responsible for Kennedy 's murder .
But doubts lingered and conspiracy theories took root that perhaps others were involved in Kennedy 's death .
In their new book , " An Open and Shut Case , " Robert Joling and Philip Van Praag say that after analyzing audio recordings of the assassination they concluded that at least 13 shots were fired .
But the handgun Sirhan used only had the capacity to fire eight shots .
The critical piece of evidence , they say , is an audiotape recorded by a journalist who was traveling with Kennedy .
They also believe that the bullet that likely killed Kennedy entered from the back of his head and pierced his brain .
Sirhan is believed to have fired his weapon as he faced the candidate .
" It can be established conclusively that Sirhan did not shoot Senator Kennedy .
And in fact not only did he not do it , he could not have done it , " Joling said .
Joling and Van Praag 's findings support the conclusion of experts who contributed to a Discovery Channel investigation in June .
They claimed that the shots heard on the audiotape came from two guns .
But other forensic scientists dismiss these theories , saying the analysis is flat - out wrong .
Van Praag and Joling are talking to forensic experts around the country and lobbying for the case to be re-opened .
" What we would basically like to see at this point , is a new investigation certainly based on new facts that we have come up with , take a fresh look at this case and to bring the authorities in , " Van Praag said .
The question is whether , after nearly 40 years , authorities will have any interest in reopening a painful chapter in American history .
Sirhan , now in his 60's , is serving a life sentence in California 's Corcoran State Prison .
In recent years , Sirhan has claimed he was hypnotized at the time of the shooting .
He has been denied parole 13 times .

I 've been reading David Boren 's Letter to America and this slender volume is taking me a week longer to get through than I ever thought it would because I 'm scribbling notes on every page .
The former US Senator from Oklahoma and current President of the University of Oklahoma never caught my attention during his tenure in the Congress , though I do remember his name mentioned when he served as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee for many years .
His thoughts on the state of our nation and on what we must attempt if we are to survive as a society and a culture are certainly not " radical " by any definition .
This is a gentle , thoughtful and wise man reflecting on his understanding of how we have arrived at our current state of affairs and offering his recipe for turning it around .
To me what makes Boren 's insights so valuable is that his approach is not that of the policy wonk , full of technical solutions and specific recommendations sharpened through a committee process and honed by experts and consultants .
Instead he takes a step back and speaks of us as a people ; of trends , wrong turns , attitudes and values .
He thinks we have wandered far from the vision of the giants who wrote the Constitution .
He argues that in Iraq we have missed the golden opportunity to renew the Marshall Plan which rebuilt Europe after World War II and which made the US the most admired nation in the world for our generosity and our altruism .
Now he sees the US as a great empire but one in the final throes of decline .
Boren 's solution is interesting : he would start to restore our Democratic values and rediscover what made this nation great in the first place by dismantling the imperial Presidency .
We need to remember that the Founding Fathers were obsessive on this point : in the US we elect temporary leaders , not royalty .
So , to restore balance to our governmental processes we begin by stripping away the aura which has been built around the Executive Branch .
No more " executive privilege . "
Much has been written of the dangers in selecting for President a " guy you 'd feel comfortable having a beer with . "
This " likeability " factor has proven to be a disastrous criterion for electing someone to the White House .
Ironically , the candidates we select for their " likeability " have been the quickest to assume the broadest of imperial powers upon being elected .
In a country where reading has become a darkly suspicious act ; where " economics " means little more than " what 's in it for me " and where " issue analysis " amounts to which talking head speaks faster and shouts louder than the others on the television panel , I fear that this year we are once more in danger of picking our President on the most superficial of bases .
This makes me weep for Democracy , much as David Boren does .
At the same time , though , I am encouraged that Barack Obama , the likely Democratic candidate this year , does seem to understand the importance of returning to a balanced Democracy .
He conveys a calm , reflective and humorous attitude , frequently self - deprecating .
He comes across as the antithesis of an Imperial President .
He seems capable of listening to others ... and of understanding what they are saying .
Last week I heard an incredible example of what we have allowed " POTUS " to self - inflate into .
( " POTUS " is the acronym for President of the United States by which the Secret Service refers to whoever is running the country at a given moment . )
Well , the office of POTUS has just ordered a new helicopter to replace the one which we see on C - SPAN or the networks , whisking our President off from the White House lawn to Camp David or Air Force
One or wherever he needs to go .
Fair enough .
A new helicopter does n't seem outlandish ... it makes sense to have a vehicle with all the best safety equipment possible and to replace the old one regularly to avoid mechanical problems .

The Star Tribune reports , " Minnesota Republicans are scolding DFL Senate candidate Al Franken for a campaign fundraiser hosted Monday by Playboy CEO Christie Hefner at her Chicago - area home -- and taking him to task for a sexually explicit satire he wrote for that magazine eight years ago . "
" The Franken article criticized Monday by Republicans , a satirical piece with the headline ' Porn - O - Rama ! ' describes a fantasy visit that Franken makes to a virtual sex institute , guided by a voluptuous futurist trained in Minnesota , " the paper reports .
" In the narrative , Franken writes that ' [s ] ince I 've been married 23 years , I naturally chose ' virtual oral sex , and he describes the experience in explicit detail . "
Mark Silva , writing for The Swamp observes , " This is what happens when humorists start taking the Senate seriously . "
The Republican Party of Minnesota web site , notes that " Rep. Laura Brod , Dr. Laura Dean , Sen. Michelle Fischbach , Mary Igo , Annette Meeks and Laura Merickel called Frankens column an 'extreme example of the kind of disrespect for the role of women in society that all of us have fought our entire lives ' and called on Franken to ' denounce this article and apologize immediately . ' "
" While you may attempt to defend your writing as satire , we hardly find anything defensible about your finding humor in your desire to have sex with women or robots that look like women simply to give yourself a good time , " the letter stated .
A DC newspaper reports , " Franken told The Hill last month that hes not going to respond when Republicans bring up his past statements because ' thats all Id do '  an allusion to the amount of material out there similar to the Playboy column . "
Excerpts from Hill article : # Campaign spokesman Andy Barr indicated during the April interview that the campaign thought Republicans had already used their best opposition research against Franken .
On Thursday , Franken spokeswoman Jess McIntosh said :  Al had a long career as a satirist .
But he understands the difference between what you say as a satirist and what you do as a senator .
And as a senator , Norm Coleman has disrespected the people of Minnesota by putting the Exxons and Halliburtons ahead of working families .
And theres nothing funny about that .
Frankens history of sometimes crude and vulgar satire promises to be an issue throughout his race against Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) .
Franken , a former  Saturday Night Live star , is the Democratic favorite in next months state endorsing convention .

The Windows Mobile hackers over at XDA forums seem to have gotten Android working on an AT&T Tilt ( HTC TyTN II ) , meaning that eventually you might be able to get an Android phone working without actually buying a particularly " Android " phone .
The stability is pretty nonexistent , but you can see that it actually works insofar as you can load it up on top of Windows Mobile and do stuff with it .
Entirely replacing the phone with Android 's ROM is another story , but if anyone can do it , the nerdlingers on XDA can .

The type of robot chosen as a personal companion by participants at the University of Hertfordshire Science and Technology Research Institute ’s ( STRI ) Showcase next week will very much depend on their personality type .
This is a recent finding from Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn ’s team at the university ’s School of Computer Science , who took the robot out of the laboratory last year and had it living in a house nearby so that they could observe how it interacted with humans .
People with extroverted personalities will choose more human - looking robots with facial features and a human - like voice , results say , while introverted people tend to prefer mechanical - looking robots , more like a box on wheels with a metal head .
Japanese men will head straight for this Actroid DER2 fembot :

A member of the team , Dr Mick Walters conducted his PhD project on the investigation of people ’s perceptions of different robot appearances and an assessment of how they would like to be approached by the robot and in what manner .
“ Our research allowed us to identify two broad demographics of people who have preferences , ” said Dr Walters .
“ It seems that there are those who prefer an unobtrusive robot and then others who want a cheerier presence . ”

We think he needs to visit Japan .
“ After years of investigating Human Robot Interaction with hundreds of participants , we have looked at proxemics , an area which has not been studied before , and condensed all of this information into an empirical framework , ” added Professor Dautenhahn .
“ Also , rather than producing a robot and then finding an application for it , we have involved people in the development of these People Bots right from the start . ”

In an article in the New York Times evaluating John McCain ’s foreign policy vision , Lawrence Eagleburger , secretary of state under the first President George Bush , described a fight currently being waged within the Republican party over the potential direction of McCain ’s foreign policy : “ It may be too strong a term to say a fight is going on over John McCain ’s soul .
But … there is at least going to be an attempt . ”
Eagleburger was referring to was the foreign policy chasm between the Republican party of Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , and George H. W. Bush and the Republican party of George W. Bush ; between the realists and the idealists ; between the paleo - cons and the neo-cons .
John McCain been playing both sides of this intra-Republican war since George W. Bush took office .
In his most prominent speech on foreign policy , he described himself as a “ realistic idealist . ”
He explained that his particular approach to the world came from his idealistic core being tempered by “ hard experience . ”
He claims to bridge the chasm between these two approaches , and through his career he has mainly managed to assuage both sides .
On the most prominent issue in recent years , Iraq , most of the pragmatists questioned , and often publicly opposed , the decision to launch a preemptive war in the Middle East ; the neo-cons were the main proponents of the war .
McCain managed to placate both sides by criticizing the execution of the war and the tactical decisions of the Bush administration while defending the overall strategy strongly .
In this , McCain was essentially taking the neo-con side in the long - term , but allying himself for the short - term with the realists .
Though this approach has worked well for McCain as a senator , it would be impossible to continue as president because McCain would then have responsibility for both the overall strategy of the War on Terrorism and the tactics used .
For the moment , both the realist camps and the neo-conservative camps believe McCain is on their side at heart .
But he ca n’t be on both sides .
If we are to try to figure out what a McCain foreign policy would look like , it is unhelpful to list the specific policies and attitudes he has stated he will adopt towards particular nations .
Foreign policy is a constantly shifting , adjusting use of power – and the single area of policy most directly and completely within the control of the executive .
What is useful in trying to figure out what a McCain foreign policy would look like is an understanding of the basic assumptions McCain has about foreign policy .
A focus , first and foremost , on the overriding and existential threat of “ radical Islamist extremism . ”
McCain considers problems such as China ’s rise , Russia ’s increasing belligerence , and global climate change as far less important than the defining “ national security challenge of our time . ”
I posited in an earlier post that it is because of the importance of the fight against Islamist extremism that McCain has flip - flopped on so many other domestic and national security issues : “ After September 11 , McCain had found a new enemy that was greater than the corruption of the political process and he was willing to put aside all of his domestic agenda to focus on the new enemy . ”
A demand for moral clarity .
McCain has , throughout his career , sought enemies to fight .
His personal sense of his self seems to demand that he be the white knight and those opposing him be the forces of evil itself .
This is an exaggeration certainly , but this demand for absolute clarity leads to a poor understanding of the world , especially of our enemies .
For example , McCain does not merely lack an understanding of the Muslim world ; his positions indicate he has imposed a particular ideological framework on his understanding – a framework which does not allow for distinctions among radical groups .
While many on the right praise McCain ’s moral clarity for condemning radical Islamist extremists as the evil - doers they are , it seems an unquestionably poor strategy in a War on Terrorism to unite our enemies instead of attempting to divide them .
It is notable that McCain does not mention the clear and tactically vital divisions among our enemies and among our allies in the Middle East .
The words “ Sunni ” or “ Shia ” are not mentioned in either of McCain ’s two attempts to lay out his entire foreign policy .
In this way , McCain is continuing the tradition of George W. Bush .
Iraq as the central front in the War on Terrorism .
McCain cites Al Qaeda as proof that Iraq is a central front in the War on Terrorism .
But Sun
Tzu , ancient and wise author of The Art of War , has said that one of the first steps to winning a war is to choose the battlefield that gives you the most advantages .
Al Qaeda apparently feels that Iraq plays to their advantages .
In many ways , they are right .
In an extraordinary article in The New Republic , Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank write of the “ jihadist revolt against Bin Laden . ”
They cite a range of Muslim religious leaders , former and current terrorists , and a man described the “ the ideological father of Al Qaeda ” who were sympathetic to Bin Laden , even after September 11 , who have all publicly broken from Al Qaeda in the past several years .
Bergen and Cruickshank caution that :
Most of these clerics and former militants , of course , have not suddenly switched to particularly progressive forms of Islam or fallen in love with the United States ( all those we talked to saw the Iraqi insurgency as a defensive jihad ) But Bergen and Cruickshank still believe that the anti-Al Qaeda positions of these radicals are making Americans safer .
John McCain refuses to differentiate between the insurgency and the forces of Al Qaeda in Iraq – an enormous tactical blunder .
And it is mainly because of this confusion that he has declared that Iraq is the central front of the War on Terrorism , when in fact , it is one of the few areas that unite jihadists opposed to Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda itself .
Premised on the exclusive power of nation - states .
In contrast to Richard Haas , editor of Foreign Affairs magazine , who believes we are in an age of non-polarity with non-state forces multiplying and state power dispersing , McCain premises his foreign policy on the power of nation - states – both America ’s power and that of other nations – to affect virtually every area of policy .
As McCain sets forth his foreign policy vision , he describes his policy country by country ; for those issues he considered global , he describes how he will get other countries to act with us .
While his aims here are clearly worthy , he seems to misunderstand how the world has been developing since the end of the Cold War .
This assumption also underlies his focus on Iraq in the War on Terrorism .
Even as Al Qaeda did much of the planning for it ’s attacks in the lawless areas of Pakistan and within the free societies of Berlin , London , and New York City , McCain , like Bush , has focused on the role of states in assisting terrorism .
Although this is certainly one component of any War Against Terrorism , it clearly should not be the main focus .
One of the achievements of four years of a McCain presidency would be , according to a speech given by the candidate two weeks ago , that “ There is no longer any place in the world al Qaeda can consider a safe haven . ”
Certainly a worthy goal – but it is belied by the fact that Al Qaeda can function within the freedoms offered by a Western democracy .
The theory underpinning this claim , this hope , of McCain ’s is that Al Qaeda can only function with some form of state sponsorship – which does not seem to be a supportable assumption .
Demonstrations of toughness .
Since John F. Kennedy suffered through his meeting with Kruschev in Vienna , presidents have been trying to prove their toughness to the world .
The Cuban Missile Crisis was mainly a demonstration of toughness on the part of Kennedy ; Lyndon Johnson pushed the line in Vietnam to show he was tough ; Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada to demonstrate his toughness after retreating when attacked by Muslim extremists in Lebanon ; Bill Clinton bombed countries to show his toughness ; George W. Bush invaded Iraq and authorized torture .
In the current campaign , each of the remaining candidates has tried to demonstrate their toughness in revealing ways .
Hillary Clinton threatened to obliterate Iran ; Barack Obama vowed to take out Bin Laden or a top Al Qaeda operative with or without Pakistan ’s permission ; John McCain has promised to continue the War in Iraq .
The lesson I take from the historical examples is that “ demonstrations of toughness ” provide a boost domestically for a short time but rarely make the desired impression internationally , and are an exceptionally bad basis for a policy .
McCain , by promising not to back down from Al Qaeda in Iraq , is buying into the Bush doctrine of replacing a genuine strategy to combat terrorism with “ demonstrations of toughness ” .
Acting as “ good global citizens . ”
This is the central difference between John McCain ’s foreign policy vision and George W. Bush ’s .
He believes it is important that America act as a “ good global citizen ” and a good ally .
For McCain , this means working internationally to combat global climate change , being open to persuasion by our allies , ending the policy of military torture of detainees , and numerous goodwill gestures .
The Bush administration has begun to move in this direction in his second term already .
McCain would be able to move further along , and could make genuine progress on global climate change .
Inherent American exceptionalism .
This idea is directly related to McCain ’s demand for moral clarity .
Just as he sees himself as essentially incorruptible , so he sees America .
This idealization of America is what made his opposition to torture so inspiring .
He was calling on the ideal conception of America to combat a corrupting evil which had been introduced into our system .
In a similar way , he used his ideal conception of America to argue for the reform of our political process in his 2000 campaign .
His foreign policy though demonstrates how this can be a very bad assumption to make .
It is one thing to point to American history and to say that we have been an exceptional nation – as Obama regularly does .
McCain implies an inherence to America ’s goodness , one that exists irrespective of our actions .
This assumption underlies McCain ’s insistence that the decision to invade Iraq was right ; that the Bush administration ’s strategy in the War on Terrorism is essentially sound ; that a change in tone is what is mainly needed to rally our allies ; that we remain the world ’s “ only monument of human rights ” in spite of Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , secret prisons , torture , and Iraq ; that we must still “ protect and promote ” democracy to the Middle East ; and that America offers a “ unique form of leadership – the antithesis of empire – [ which ] gives us moral credibility , which is more powerful than any show of arms . ”
This is a dangerous idea in a large part because it is not shared by most of the world .
For example , although we can declare we are the “ antithesis of empire ” , we will still be treated as one as long as we are projecting our military , economic , and political power around the world and occupying a sovereign nation .
Some questions remain about McCain ’s basic views on foreign policy – many stemming from his triangulation between the neo-cons and realists for the past decade .
I ’ll be posting some of them later .

~ Abe Lincoln
The Future is Now
How you choose to live your life will impact your children's .
Your life is there future .
Your life will change forever .
Kids will forever change your life .
You can expect that nothing will be the same , and your life will no longer be your own .
This is probably not the first time you are hearing this .
Politics become more important .
Keep a close eye on politics and stand up for yourself and your children .
Politicians write the future of the nation , and your children will have to live in that future .

Your decisions effect people .
The government is not perfect .
There are a lot of things that fall through the cracks .
It is up to you to make better decisions than whatever gets thrown in front of your face on TV .
Recycle when you can .
Although it can be fun to watch the kids rip off wrapping paper , it is a bit more sensible to package things in something they can actually re-use once they get the gift out of it .
Enjoy the present ( while they 're little )
It is also a great idea to take advantage of the fact they 're immobile while they still are , and make really cutesy things .
Enjoy the present ( even when you 're tired )
When you feel " too tired " to play with or read to your children , remember that in 10 years , you wo n't have so many prime opportunities to enrich their lives .
Good habits and behaviors start early !
If you feel particularly burnt out , take a " mom is off " vacation .
Stay at home if you can .
At some point you will realize that staying home with the kids was the best decision you ever made .
Praise over punishment .
It 's more important to praise than to punish .
Even if you sound like a broken record , praise your child for every little thing they do right - from not pulling down all the books in a library to keeping their food on the plate ( ok , that 's too much to ask - how about on the table ? ) .
Be a kid again .
One of the best ways to enjoy your children is to enjoy your own ( extended ) childhood .
Be a kid again , revel in their joy of seeing things for the first time , and open up that box you have been living in .
Let kids make mistakes
While it is important to make sure your children are safe , being protective has big downfalls .
Coddled children become closed - minded and naive adults , and they are much more likely to end up making bigger mistakes than they would have if they messed up ( or went through something terrible ) with supervision and consultation .
Conversely , being too loose leaves too much opportunity for life - long and unsurmountable regrets .
Set up very specific boundaries to protect what is really important - life , sanity , and for a time virginity - and be prepared to let those boundaries slide so long as they do it under your roof .
Do n't be overprotective .
If that is n't incentive enough to let your kids make their mistakes , at least realize how other people view over - protective parents .
Keep yourself happy first .
Then again , no matter what you do , you can't please everyone all the time .
Everyone has different ideas about good parenting - best you can do is please yourself .
Explain things to your children .
Do n't think of any topic as being " too complicated " or mature .
The tough questions are the most important to answer ( and honestly ! ) , even if you only give a simplified synopsis .
If they do n't get it from you , their curiosity might lead them to other , perhaps less healthy , sources .
Bad marriages are worse than bad divorces .
Never ever stay together for the kids .

You should know your family history , and you should teach it to your children .

Give attention equally and you will have a very peaceful experience !
Control your reactions .
To a kid , reactions = attention .
It does n't matter whether you 're yelling at them or shocked at what they did .
Learn to control your reactions ( the little ones too ! ) and you will teach your children to control their behavior .
Show good habits .
Monkey see , monkey do .
Your kids will mimic your every step , so if you make an effort to take care of yourself , your children will pick up the good habits .
Positively reinforce .
Teach yourself how to talk to kids in a non-threatening manner .
" No " is a bad word in my home .
I just give the consequences , no matter how complicated , and that usually starts a productive conversation rather than a temper tantrum .
Make no a game .
Making " no " into a game is an excellent way to skirt the issue with an amusing twist .
Know when to say no .
Of course , how to say no is second only to knowing when to say no .
Monitor the net .
Know what your children are doing on the Internet , and at the very least , monitor what they do and make an effort to educate them on what might not be so healthy .
It 's impossible to block everything negative , so take a " so , what cool stuff did you find online today ? " approach over dinner .
Educate them young .
While they 're still really young and impressionable , it 's a good idea to turn them on to much better educational websites .
Be ready for add - ons .
And at some point you 're probably going to need an addition to your home .
You may as well do it intelligently .
Be ready to move .
However , if you opt to move , here 's a neat trick for packing your plates to keep them in pristine condition .
Pets are fun .
But remember , if your kids do n't ruin it , the dog will .
They 're Not Kids Anymore
It 's a sad day when you realize you have to let go , but it can be empowering as well .
If you did your best , you should have nothing to worry about , and be able to enjoy your golden years ( then have them take care of you ! )
" Treat your kid like a darling for the first five years .
For the next five years , scold them .
By the time they turn sixteen , treat them like a friend .
Your grown up children are your best friends . "
~ Chanakya
You 'll have to let go .
Mom - you have got to let go sometime .
I know I know , it is going to be really hard , but at some point you will have to accept that they are an adult and entitled to their own mind space , make their own decisions , and come crying to you when it all goes wrong again .
Set boundaries on financial support .
If they ask for money once they are on their own , and you can afford it - give it to them - but with limits .
Say something like , " I ca n't do this often " or " I can only do this for you a couple more times . "
Just knowing eventually they will have to be fully responsible is often enough to get them out of your purse .
Do n't forget to actually cut them off at some point though .
You made it !
( have some more babies or raise the grandkids ? )
Congratulations - you did it !
Now what ?
Oh , you did n't have any plans besides raising children ?
Quick - think of something before they 're out of the nest so you do n't have to meddle in their lives all the time !
Irrawaddy is a key rice growing region in Burma Rice prices have risen for the fourth consecutive day , as tight supplies are aggravated by the disaster in Burma 's key rice - growing region .
The cost of rice , the staple food for almost half the world 's population , increased by 2.4 % to $ 21.6 per 100 lb on the Chicago Board of Trade .
Cyclone Nargis , which has killed tens of thousands of people , struck areas where 65 % of Burma 's rice is grown .
The disaster comes as rice and other food prices are already soaring .
The higher price of US long - grain rice in Chicago has been replicated around the world , with Thai and India rice also increasing sharply .
Food shortages
The cyclone hit the Irrawaddy delta and other key rice - growing areas in Burma .
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) said the region had been due to export 600,000 tonnes of milled rice in 2008 .
Banning the export of rice produces a domino effect across the world market
RS Seshadri , Tilda director
However , it said secondary crops , normally harvested from April to June , could have been damaged by the cyclone , while rice already harvested might have suffered from poor storage .
The FAO said " localised food shortages " were possible , while exports could also be hit .
Export limits Global rice prices have now risen by more than 50 % since the start of the year .
This rise has been driven by both supply and demand factors , including shortages due to poor harvests , as well as growing populations in some rice - importing nations .
More recently , forecasts of further price rises have prompted hoarding , making matters worse .
Thailand , India , Bangladesh and Egypt have moved to set limits on rice exports to try to guarantee sufficient domestic supplies and calm price rises .
However , this has only made prices rise further on the global market .
" Banning the export of rice produces a domino effect across the world market , increasing the pressure on demand from those remaining countries whose markets are still open and causing inflation in countries reliant on imports , " said RS Seshadri a director of rice giant Tilda .
' Shrinking supply '
The higher prices have hit all types of rice , from standard long - grain to India 's premium Basmati variety .
" Increasing global demand and shrinking supply , combined with soaring production and distribution costs are simultaneously conspiring to create a ' perfect storm ' of high Basmati prices , " added Mr Seshadri .
China is the world 's biggest rice producer , but almost all of its crop is kept for the domestic market .
With the world 's largest population to feed , Beijing keeps rice prices subsidised .
Thailand is the world 's largest rice exporter .

What are these ?
Cuban leader Fidel Castro poses in this photo taken by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during their meeting in Havana January 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva / CubaVision TV / Handout
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuban leader Fidel Castro blasted Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Friday for his criticism of the Cuban government this week , saying McCain had shown why he finished near the bottom of his class at West Point .
In his latest newspaper column , Castro also attacked President George W. Bush for his speech on Wednesday announcing that U.S. citizens would be allowed to send cell phones to Cuba .
“ A deluge of speeches and lies they directed at Cuba , ” Castro said in a column published in Communist Party newspaper Granma .
“ How far they are from knowing Cuba and its people . ”
McCain , speaking in Miami on Tuesday , vowed to maintain the United States ’ 46 - year - long trade embargo against the island until , among other things , the Cuban government frees political prisoners and holds internationally monitored , multi-party elections .
“ McCain , in his book ‘ Faith of My Fathers , ’ admitted that he was among the last five students in his course in West Point , ” Castro wrote .
“ He ’s showing it . ”
Castro provisionally stepped aside in July 2006 following intestinal surgery but still writes periodic columns .
In February , he resigned the presidency , opening the way for the National Assembly to elect his younger brother Raul to replace him .
Despite the embargo , Bush said Americans would be allowed to send cell phones to their relatives in Cuba , in what appeared to be a response to recent reforms initiated by Raul Castro .
Bush called the reforms a “ cruel joke ” and accused Cuba of mistreating political opponents and oppressing the Cuban people .
“ He does n’t speak of the circle of hunger and blockade ( embargo ) that last decades , ” Castro said , describing the comments of McCain and Bush as “ gross lies . ”

Abstract maths easier , not harder
Frustrated maths students may have a good excuse .
Some teaching methods meant to make maths more relevant may be making it harder to understand , US researchers say .
They say students who are taught abstract maths concepts fare better in experiments than those taught with real - world examples .
Adding extra details makes it hard for students to extract the basic mathematical concepts and apply them to new problems , they say .
" We 're really making it difficult for students because we are distracting them from the underlying maths , " says Jennifer Kaminski from Ohio State University , whose study appears today in the journal Science .
The findings cast doubt on the widely used practice of using friendly , concrete examples to teach abstract maths concepts .
For example , a teacher might use a bag of coloured marbles to explain probability , or teach a formula about distance with the classic example of two trains departing from different cities and travelling at different speeds .
" The danger with teaching using this example is that many students only learn how to solve the problem with the trains , " Kaminski says .
Symbols or examples ?
To find out the best methods of teaching basic maths concepts , the researchers conducted several experiments using college students in which some students were taught concepts using basic symbols , while others were taught with concrete examples .
For example , they studied different approaches at teaching the basic mathematical property of commutativity .
This means that you can switch up the order of elements and still get the same answer , as in 3 + 2 or 2 + 3 equals 5 .
Some students learned the concepts using generic symbols .
Others were taught with concrete examples such as pictures of measuring cups filled with liquid , or slices of pizza or tennis balls in a container .
While all of students mastered these concepts easily , the students who first learned maths concepts using abstract symbols were better able to transfer that learning to other problems when tested .
End of real - world examples ?
That is not to say story problems should disappear .
Kaminski says story problems offer a good way to test whether a student has mastered the abstract concept .
" Story problems are n't out , but they are probably not the way we want to go about introducing concepts or problem solving , " she says .
" That would be best done through symbolic maths . "

They wanna myopically self - teach yet we 're the ones who indoctrinate ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Steadfast in their belief that recently - passed gay rights measures will turn the state 's schools into queer orgy dens , the folks at California 's Campaign for Children and Families has launched a ridiculous new website called :
The gist ?
They want parents to put their kids in private schools or homeschooling , so as to rescue their precious minds from the crippling gay - acceptance in their midst .
Here 's but one bit of brilliance one can find on the site :
Q : How can I do homeschooling when I did n’t do well in school myself ?
A : If you can read at a fifth - grade level , you can homeschool .
By using a low - cost , turn - key homeschooling system , a parent only needs to generally supervise their child ’s home school education by simply following the instructions for the curriculum you choose .
You do not need to be “ the teacher . ”
For the difficult questions , homeschool companies provide teachers in another state by phone or Internet .
Think you ca n’t homeschool ?
Think again .
Yes , that 's right -- in the world of far - right social conservatism , a fifth grade reading level is good enough to teach an eighth grader , but the " radical " thought that gay people deserve to be treated like humans is a deal breaker .
Qualifications , schmalifications .
After all , why would kids need trained professional to prepare them with a large body of knowledge when all they need to know is in one - sided interpretations of the Bible ?
:: sigh : :
And it 's our parental skills that are continually under suspicion .
Rescue Your Child [ CCF 's spinoff site ]
Your thoughts
Not really surprising .
This seems to be a very popular response whenever the religious right loses a battle over some educational issue .
The sad thing is that homeschooling , when done properly and for good reasons , can be an excellent option and provide a great deal of opportunities for kids .
But that fact gets lost in all the noise created by those who promote homeschooling in the wrong ways and for the wrong reasons .
Posted by : Jarred | Feb 11 , 2008 3:40:49 PM
Jarred : Yea , this is not to pooh - pooh homeschooling one bit .
Responsible parents would only get into such an undertaking if they had the time and abilities to educate .
But these folks are going about it all backwards , saying to pull your kids and then somehow make it work .
There seems to be a woeful disregard for the children 's TRUE well - being .

This is a tough one .
On one hand I think its stupid the take a child out of public school just because it ’s the public school system job and responsibility to teach the value and protect the safety of all students regardless of gender , race , religion or orientation .
However some people ’s brand of faith tells them that accepting homosexuality as normal is wrong and if that is the case they should know that there ’s an avenue available to them to place kids in an environment that teaches them the values they want their children to be taught .
Posted by : Alonzo | Feb 11 , 2008 4:13:00 PM
Alonzo :
But this is nothing new -- there have always been religious schools for those who want their education infused with religion .
And there has always been homeschooling .
The nutty part is that they want PUBLIC schools to operate in non -gay - inclusive ways .
They also do n't want these schools to implement any policies that would help curb gay harassment .
And it 's all based on their personal faith views .
While everyone 's faith should be respected and harassment based on religion should be alleviated , personal faith - based arguments are not acceptable in these public school situation .
Gay bullying is real and demonstrable .
And we 've lived far too long in a world where gay people are marginalized .
Measures designed to curb these problems do not have to conflict with anyone 's religion .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Feb 11 , 2008 4:26:33 PM
G - A-Y : I agree with you as I said it is the job of the public school system to stop all forms of harassment of all of its students .
All I 'm saying is I do n't see what 's wrong with people who follow a certain brand of faith being made aware of an avenue to teach their kids in an environment they approve of .
The truth of the matter is not all parents know that home - schooling is available to them regardless of their own personal educational background .
Do n't get me wrong I 'm pretty much on the same page as you are but at the same time I know that there are people in this world who think homosexuality is wrong .
I do n't agree with that but at the same time just as we should n't be judge because of who we are - I do n't think it 's my place to judge somebody because of their deeply held beliefs .
Please note that like you I will continue fighting to make sure those deeply held beliefs are n’t being used to deny me and all GLBT people equal rights in the public square .
Posted by : Alonzo | Feb 11 , 2008 5:14:18 PM
It 's weird Alonzo , going over your comments from the past year or so , most every one has the same theme .
You play the Devil 's Advocate on things like the " ex - gay " movement and this situation , and then make sure to say that you are on the same page as us .
But a common theme of all of them is your failure to see that groups like the CCF and movements like the " ex- gay " are not just individuals living their lives , but rather political groups that are out to damage gay ones .
The thing is this :
If they were just trying to live their lives and this " rescue your children " site really was just a benign advocacy for homeschooling , it'd be an entirely different story .
Our opposition has nothing to do with homeschooling in general or anyone 's right to view homosexuality as against their religion .
But they are not benign -- they are trying to roll back gay rights at every corner .
So it 's their attempts to demonize queers that we are opposing !
By the way , this is not a criticism of your thoughts -- they are valued and appreciated .
It 's just an observation .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Feb 11 , 2008 5:51:12 PM
Wow you 're the first one to actually get it .
I 've been playing " Devil ’s Advocate " with the Christian Right and members of the GLBT equal rights movement for about two years now .
Let me make it clear I have always understood that these “ Christian ” groups are motivated politically and I disagree with them for that very reason .
But on the same token just as there are real people behind the gay equal rights movement there are real people behind the faith based movements as well .
In my opinion I think both movements tend to neglect that fact .
Posted by : Alonzo | Feb 11 , 2008 6:25:50 PM
Well ALonzo , I agree with you about the human aspect , which is why you do not see character assassinations or personal insults on this site .
The target is the message , the movement , and the mindset , not the human being .
The goal is unity , not harm .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Feb 11 , 2008 6:28:21 PM
GAY : Just wanted you to know that I blog all of my communications on myspace that I have with websites like AFTAH , CWA , Ex - Gay Watch and G - A - Y .
And my friend Belinda wanted me to let you know that she thinks you 're " one smart cookie " and I totally agree with her !

This node was originally titled I 've no idea why it was changed .
And here are the other twelve most powerful words in the English language
Darling
I 'm nearly four weeks late I think we might be pregnant
These words have been proven to evoke strong emotion in a listener .
not , by the way .
Just in case you were wondering .
Can you hear that low whirr above our school playgrounds ?
Can you smell the tang of fuel permeating our university campuses ?
They are the after - effects of Britain 's helicopter parents , who hover over their kids , ready to swoop when any risk or stress or spontaneity strikes .
These über - parents have had a starring role in a number of news stories recently .
A company called Blue Tree Services is marketing GPS devices you can plant on your child .
You will be able track their every move .
' He 's left the Wimpy !
She 's gone to Asda !
Oh my god , he 's buying a copy of Heat magazine ! '
The company 's managing director , Mike Smuts , says : " We have seen a huge demand for this product across all sectors of society . "
Meanwhile , universities and graduate employers complain they are being bombarded by pushy parents .
Dr Paul Redmond , head of the careers service at Liverpool University , says parents are coming to university career fairs to sell their kids – and if their kids are n't bought they want to know why .
Huddersfield University has even had to set up a " family liaison officer " to save the Goldman Sachs stall from a horde of angry middle - class mothers and feed information to parents round - the - clock about their kids ' progress .

This smother - love is spreading so fast that it is causing a slew of social problems .
Some are obvious : a major contributor to the rise in child obesity is the refusal of parents to let their kids outside – even though they are statistically no more likely to be kidnapped by a paedophile today than in 1958 or 1908 .
But I see more subtle psychological shifts among my helicopter - fed peers .
My parents were from the old working - class hands - off school of parenting – ' Let him walk !
Leave him be !
How else will he learn ? '
So I was bemused when many of my friends were never allowed out on to the street to play , or had their GCSE coursework drafted by their parents .
I was even more startled when I arrived at university to find it was still going on .
So many people – especially the rich – had parents who were still managing their lives well into their twenties .
University was once the breaking - point when even the most coddled kids could flee .
Now mobile phones have become the longest umbilical cord in history .
I 'd guess 20 per cent of British parents now count as helicopters , with many more veering towards it .
The Californian child psychologist Dr Madeline Levine has produced the most detailed studies of the consequences after she stumbled across something that seemed paradoxical in her treatment of teenagers .
" I found that kids from the wealthiest families had the highest rates of anxiety and depression and substance abuse , more than poor children , " she says .
" It just did n't make sense at first blush . "
Why would privileged kids be more miserable than poor kids ?
She found that instead of being listened to and allowed to develop naturally , the wealthiest children were allowed no space to develop – except as carbuncles on the side of their parents ' swollen egos .
They were constantly driven from one " Enriching Activity " to another , micro-managed by manager - parents .
Levine explains : " Paradoxically , the more [ the parents ] pour in , the less full many of my patients seem to be .
Indulged , coddled , pressured and micromanaged from the outside , my young patients appeared to be inadvertently deprived of an opportunity to develop an inside . "
It 's an essential part of growing up to learn to take risks , get in trouble , and sort it out on your own .
But helicopter parents are determined to strip any risk from their child 's life .
I have seen dozens of smart , sweet - natured people curdled by this parenting model .
In the end , it produces two kinds of kids : the puffed - up , and the paranoid .
The puffed - up see the world as an extension of their parents ' house .
When the world is not laid out neatly for their pleasure , they are angry and confused .
The Association of Graduate Employers last week issued a report saying that Generation Y – those born after 1982 – has a totally disproportionate number of " graduate divas " , who " expect everything to fall into their laps " .
The report cited a typical case of a 21 - year - old applying to work at a transport company who was overheard on the phone complaining to his mother .
" I have got to go to London tomorrow , " he whined , " and they have n't even told me how to get there . "
Then there are the paranoids .
They have been raised behind closed doors and taught to see the outside world as filled with unseen menace .
The London - based clinical psychologist Dr Cecilia D'Felice explains , " I see young people in my consulting room all the time now who are incredibly anxious about life .
It 's learnt behaviour .
They have been fussed over all of their lives , and they 've internalised that parental anxiety .
If you try to have a germ - free environment your child will actually get sick because she wo n't develop any resistance to germs .
If you try to have a risk - free environment your child will become psychologically sick . "
The rise in bulimia , anorexia and self - harm among teenagers is partly a product of all this over - parenting .
As Dr Levene says of a typical teenage self - harmer she treated – a 15 year - old girl who carved the word " empty " onto her arm with an old razor : " She felt little control over what happened to her .
Cutting was one of the few things over which she did feel control . "
Why is this happening ?
Why have so many of the baby - boomers turned out to be baby - Führers , strangling their kids with their apron -strings ?
Their children are the safest who have ever lived .
They are more likely to die in their beds of old age than any generation in history – yet their parents fear , constantly .
There is no detailed research explaining this paranoia but there are some prosaic explanations .
Parents are having fewer children , later in life , often after gruelling fertility treatments .
We live in a paranoid culture where every negligible risk is blown up by a 24/7 media into a drum - beat of doom .
We live in a hyper - consumerist culture where we define ourselves by what we own .
Children are inevitably drawn into this vortex , as another glistening status symbol .
' Have you seen my handbag ?
Have you seen my child ?'
Whenever I talk to my friends ' parents as they crash - land into their children 's lives for another burst of command - and - control , it 's clear this is not about their child 's needs but their own .
They need their children to be dependent on them ( and Successful with a capital - S ) because they see their kids as extensions of their own ego , not as separate individuals with their own lives to live .
This is n't love .
It is narcissism .
It 's time we told these middle - class Boomer parents : you need to grow up – or your children never will .

JERUSALEM 
The government of Israel said Sunday that it had approved the construction of hundreds of homes in a West Bank settlement north of Jerusalem , a move that could further complicate a peace effort already hobbled by violence .
The announcement slightly eased pressure on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert from the right wing in his government , particularly after a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem fatally shot eight students , most of them teenagers , at a prestigious Jewish seminary in western Jerusalem on Thursday .
But the move occurred days before an American envoy , Lt. Gen. William M. Fraser III , was expected to arrive in the region for the first three - party meeting with Israelis and Palestinians on fulfillment of obligations under the 2003 peace plan called the road map .
The plan calls for the Palestinians to halt all violence and for the Israelis to cease all settlement construction , including building meant to accommodate “ natural growth . ”
What Do We See When We Rub Our Eyes ?
If you close your eyes and rub them hard , you 'll probably see dots , spots , and flashes and dashes of colors .
These images are called phosphenes .
They are produced by pressure on your eyes .
Your optic nerve translates that pressure into all sorts or bizarre patterns .
That 's why being socked in the eye or hit on the head will make you " see stars " .
If you stare at a brightly lit sheet of white paper or at a clear , bright blue sky for a while , you might see luminous points or spots of light darting around in front of you , just out of reach .
Sometimes these spots appear as very bright circles with darker centers .
They often appear to have tails , like comets .
While no one is absolutely certain what it is you are seeing , the general consensus is that you are watching your own blood cells moving through the capillaries in your retina .
Sometimes , if the light is right , you can actually see the blood vessels running through your retina .
This might happen in a doctor 's office while your eyes are being examined through a special lamp that shines a light on the back portion of the surface of the eye .
The " tree branch " pattern you see corresponds to your retinal blood vessels .
Those Mysterious Floaters :
Sometimes we notice spots that seem to float across our field of vision , especially if we are looking at a bright background .
These " floaters " are usually caused by bits of debris floating around in the vitreous , the jelly - like substance that fills most of the eye .
These floaters flit between the cornea and retina , so the light entering the eye hits the spots and creates shadows on the retina itself - like a rotten tomato flying between a spotlight and the singer on stage .
As we get older , the vitreous becomes more liquid and less jelly - like , and the floaters become more prominent .
While phosphenes are really physically induced hallucinations , there are a number of other things you can see on the inside of your eyeballs that actually do exist - like the blood and blood vessels inside your eyes .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union has obtained previously withheld documents from the Defense Department , including internal investigations into the abuse of detainees in U.S. custody overseas .
Uncensored documents released as a result of the ACLU 's Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit shed light on the deaths of detainees in Iraq and internal disagreement within the military over harsh interrogation practices used at Guantánamo Bay .
" These documents provide further evidence that the torture of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad was not aberrational , but was widespread and systemic , " said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLU .
" They only underscore the need for an independent investigation into high - level responsibility for prisoner abuse . "
One of the documents released to the ACLU is a list of at least four prisoner deaths that were the subject of Navy Criminal Investigation Service ( NCIS ) investigations .
The NCIS document contains new information about the deaths of some of these prisoners , including details about Farhad Mohamed , who had contusions under his eyes and the bottom of his chin , a swollen nose , cuts and large bumps on his forehead when he died in Mosul in 2004 .
The document also includes details about Naem Sadoon Hatab , a 52 - year - old Iraqi man who was strangled to death at the Whitehorse detainment facility in Nasiriyah in June 2003 ; the shooting death of Hemdan El Gashame in Nasiriyah in March 2003 ; and the death of Manadel Jamadi during an interrogation after his head was beaten with a stove at Abu Ghraib in November 2003 .
Another document obtained by the ACLU provides further context to objections raised by the Army 's Criminal Investigation Task Force ( CITF ) about the use of harsh interrogation methods applied on Guantánamo prisoners .
The memo prepared for CITF commander Brittain Mallow appears to have been drafted for September 2002 , and identifies " unacceptable methods " involving " threats , " " discomfort , " and " sensory deprivation , " while also providing guidance to CITF agents on permissible interrogation methods for use on detainees .
The memo suggests that CITF expressed disapproval of abusive methods used at Guantánamo as far back as September 2002 .
In December 2002 , Mallow instructed his unit not to participate in " any questionable " interrogation techniques at the facility .
The ACLU has also obtained a Defense Department criminal investigation file , Justice Department emails , State Department cables , and a Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedure .
In October 2003 , the ACLU and New York Civil Liberties Union - along with the Center for Constitutional Rights , Physicians for Human Rights , Veterans for Common Sense , and Veterans for Peace - filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records concerning the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad .
To date , more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU 's subsequent FOIA lawsuit .
The previously withheld documents are available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/35271res20080514.html
In addition , many of the FOIA documents are also collected and analyzed in a recently published book by ACLU attorneys Jameel Jaffer and Singh , " Administration of Torture . "
More information is available online at : www.aclu.org/administrationoftorture
The documents received in the ACLU 's FOIA litigation are online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia
Attorneys in the FOIA case are Lawrence S. Lustberg and Melanca D. Clark of the New Jersey - based law firm Gibbons , P.C. ; Jaffer , Singh and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU ; Arthur Eisenberg and Beth Haroules of the NYCLU ; and Shayana Kadidal and Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights .
Is Osama bin Laden a rebel against the Saudi Arabian ruling class or a model member of it ?
That question lurks behind “ The Bin Ladens , ” by the Pulitzer Prize - winning New Yorker writer Steve Coll .
The world ’s most famous terrorist owes his fortune and his standing to a family business that Coll calls “ the kingdom ’s Halliburton . ”
Like Halliburton , the Saudi Binladin Group specializes in gigantic infrastructure projects .
Government connections are the key to the family ’s wealth .
So you would assume they would react with unmixed horror to a radical son , like the duchess in the Noël Coward song :
You could have pierced her with swords
When she discovered
Her youngest liked Lenin
And sold the Daily Worker near the House of Lords .
But Saudi Arabia , Coll shows , is a place where the interests of rulers and revolutionaries are less easy to distinguish .
Muhammad bin Laden , Osama ’s father , emigrated from the canyons of the Hadhramawt , in present - day Yemen , in the 1920s .
He arrived in Jidda , one - eyed and semiliterate , at a time when Saudi Arabia had hardly any paved roads and the king kept his treasury in a tin trunk .
Muhammad was charismatic .
His workers , with whom he prayed and sang at job sites , revered him .
He was scrupulously honest , as Arabian lore holds Hadhramis to be , and his company keeps this reputation still .
Most important , Muhammad would serve the greedy and capricious Saudi princes in ways that Bechtel and other foreign contractors balked at  doing humiliating jobs from digging gardens to fixing air conditioners .
The grateful royals made him their main palace - and highway - builder in the boom years after the war .
By the time Muhammad died in a plane crash in September 1967 , his company was worth an estimated $ 150 million , and he had fathered 54 children by about 22 wives .
Those children , Osama included , grew up in the shadow of a court society .
Royal favor was all .
Since the Saud family sent its sons to Princeton and Georgetown , Muhammad educated many of his own sons in the West , too , starting with Salem , his impious and ribald successor .
Coll ’s account of Salem is doting .

Remember the scene in Apocalypse Now where Marlon Brando ’s character , the crazed Colonel Kurtz , tells Captain Willard ( Martin Sheen ) of the shock he felt upon realizing the strength of his enemies ?
“ And then I realized … like I was shot … like I was shot with a diamond … a diamond bullet right through my forehead .
And I thought : My God … the genius of that .
The genius .
The will to do that .
Perfect , genuine , complete , crystalline , pure .
And then I realized they were stronger than we . ”
That same bullet struck me recently while reading Naomi Klein ’s “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism . ”
Her argument : that the U.S. government and now , ever increasingly , multinational corporations not only view disasters as fortune - making opportunities but actually work to hasten the onset of such opportunities , whether through coups , economic strong - arming or willful neglect ( think New Orleans ) .
Suddenly , it struck me that some of the world ’s power players might be viewing climate change the same way .
Maybe some corporate and political leaders see rising sea levels , widespread drought and global destabilization not as outcomes to be avoided but as opportunities to be exploited for maximum profit .
How else to explain the continued surge of cash to climate skeptic groups and the ongoing rush to build more and more coal - fired power plants ?
I put that question to author / activist Bill McKibben ( “ The End of Nature , ” “ Deep Economy ” ) during a recent blogger conference call , and discovered I ’m not the only one with that concern .
“ It ’s a very real possibility , ” McKibben said .
“ Disaster capitalism is strong .
It ’s a signal of the kind of bottom - feeding we ’ve allowed our economy to descend to . ”
McKibben says he sees some potential for change in the coming U.S. presidential elections , though not if the office goes to either John McCain or Hillary Clinton .
“ ( Barack Obama ) may be a necessary precondition , ” McKibben said .
“ Who knows whether he ’ll be able to reign in the Halliburtons of the world ? ”
The greatest and best hope for change , McKibben said , lies with us — individuals acting for change at the local level and mobilizing on a global scale via the Internet .
And the issue of climate change , he added , is the one rallying cry most likely to inspire us to act .
That ’s why he launched StepItUp in 2007 .
And that ’s why he ’s leading the 350 Challenge ( as in 350 parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide ) now .
“ It takes every bit of cleverness we can get from people , ” McKibben said .
“ The path in front of us is pretty darn daunting . ”
When I first met Nicolas Berggruen , I was struck by two things .
First , he was a multi- billionaire I 'd never heard of -- the most interesting kind .
Second , he did n't own a home .
" I stay in hotels , " he told me .
A billionaire without a home ?
This , I figured , was worth a story .
My article about Mr. Berggruen in today 's Journal focuses mainly ...
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s Rose Law Firm billing records , found in the White House residence in January 1996 two years after they had been subpoenaed by government regulators , disappeared shortly after the first lady was warned that the firm ’s billing problems were “ very serious ” and the then - ongoing Whitewater investigation could result in criminal charges , newly obtained records show .
More than 1,100 pages of grand jury testimony , investigative reports , memos , charging documents , chronologies , narratives and draft indictments , previously undisclosed but now being “ processed ” at the Library of Congress , say Mrs. Clinton knew considerably more about the firm ’s billing problems and their potential ramifications than she publicly acknowledged at the time .
According to the documents , given to the Library of Congress by the estate of Sam Dash , former ethics adviser to Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr , Mrs. Clinton also knew that her former Rose partner Webster L. Hubbell was both the focus of the firm ’s billing concerns and a federal conflict - of - interest investigation , in which he was suspected of lying in a sworn statement to regulators about the firm ’s representation of a failed Arkansas savings and loan .
While Mrs. Clinton told the public at the time that Mr. Hubbell ’s March 14 , 1994 , resignation as associate attorney general involved an “ internal billing dispute ” with his Rose partners that “ likely would be resolved , ” three months earlier she had been advised by another Rose partner , Allen Bird , that the “ billing problems were very serious , ” according to the newly disclosed records .
The records also said Mrs. Clinton was aware that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) and the Resolution Trust Corp. ( RTC ) had begun an investigation in December 1993 into a suspected conflict of interest involving a $ 400,000 payment to the Rose firm to defend the business practices of Little Rock ’s Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association .
At the time , Mrs. Clinton was publicly dismissing the seriousness of accusations against Mr. Hubbell , which were being widely reported by the media .
Madison was at the heart of the Whitewater investigation , which persisted through most of the eight years of the Clinton administration but eventually was shut down without charges against either President Clinton or Mrs. Clinton .
Fourteen other persons pleaded guilty or were convicted .
Mrs. Clinton is now the junior senator from New York and a Democratic presidential - primary candidate .
Her campaign has dismissed the new documents .
“ This is a baseless accusation which was looked into over a decade ago in an investigation that took $ 71.5 million and eight years to determine there was no case , ” said spokesman Jay Carson .
A Feb. 28 , 1994 , memo by White House Associate Counsel W. Neil Eggleston described Mr. Hubbell ’s extensive role in the Rose firm ’s legal representation of Madison , contradicting his sworn testimony to the RTC .
The memo , forwarded to Mrs. Clinton on March 1 , 1994 , by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes , noted concerns by the FDIC and the RTC as to whether the Rose firm had disclosed its prior legal representation of Madison in an FDIC lawsuit against the thrift ’s former auditors .
That same month , the RTC issued its first subpoena for Rose firm documents , including billing records for various Madison projects .
The documents show that both Mr. Hubbell and Mrs. Clinton were involved in doing legal work for the failing thrift despite Mrs. Clinton ’s public denials .
The Eggleston memo said an “ ultimate finding ” of nondisclosure would mean that “ Mr. Hubbell was not truthful in his recollection . ”
It also said that while it was “ not clear ” whether the FDIC or the RTC would review the accusations under an actual conflict standard , there was the possibility of sanctions in the case , including “ criminal liability . ”
On Jan. 5 , 1996 , the White House released copies of the billing records showing Mrs. Clinton ’s work for Madison and its projects while a partner at the Rose firm after they were discovered in the White House by Carolyn Huber , special assistant to the president .
Until that time , the White House had said they never existed , since Mrs. Clinton did little , if any , legal work for Madison .
Mrs. Huber , former office manager at the Rose firm who moved to Washington in 1992 with the Clintons , later told the Special Senate Whitewater Committee she initially and unexpectedly found the long - lost copies in August 1995 on a table in the White House residence ’s “ book room , ” whose access was limited to the president , Mrs. Clinton and “ selected houseguests . ”
“ They just appeared there , ” Mrs. Huber said , noting that she visited the room regularly in the course of her White House duties every two or three days .
“ I thought they had been left there for me to take down to put in the file . ”
She said she left them where she found them until their rediscovery five months later .
The committee had sought the records after hearing testimony in December 1995 from Clinton confidante Susan Thomases , a New York lawyer , who said Mrs. Clinton — contrary to her public statements of “ little or no ” involvement in the Madison case — had numerous conferences with Madison officials , reviewed documents , made calls to discuss a preferred stock plan aimed at keeping the failing thrift afloat , and “ did all the billing . ”
Mrs. Huber said she did not realize until she looked at the records again on Jan.
4 , 1996 , that they were the same documents that had originally been sought by the RTC in February 1994 and by the Whitewater committee under subpoena since October 1995 .
She said she was sure the records were not in the room “ two or three days ” earlier .
“ I do n’t think I could have missed them , ” she said , adding that she had “ no idea ” who might have left them sitting on books on the corner of a table in the center of the room .
The Rose firm ’s original billings for Madison have never been found , but the new documents show the Whitewater investigators thought that White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. had collected copies of them during the 1992 presidential campaign .
Notes in red ink and in Mr. Foster ’s handwriting are on the copies and appeared to be addressed to Mrs. Clinton .
Mr. Foster , whose July 1993 death at Fort Marcy Park in Virginia has been ruled a suicide , also served at the time as the Clintons ’ personal attorney .
He had expressed concern over the Clintons ’ involvement in Whitewater Development Corp. , an Arkansas real estate venture that also involved Madison ’s owners , James and Susan McDougal , and he is thought to have been involved in removing records from the Rose firm in 1992 that later turned up at the Clinton campaign headquarters .
The Clinton administration never explained how Rose billing records got to the White House nor why they were not produced in response to separate subpoenas by the RTC , Mr. Starr ’s office and the Whitewater committee .
Ronald M. Clark , managing partner at the Rose firm , told the Select Senate Whitewater Committee that the billing records showed Mrs. Clinton was involved with Madison and a project known as Castle Grande that federal regulators later described as a “ sham . ”
He said the records showed that she charged more than her usual $ 125 - an - hour rate for the work .
Mr. Clark also said he had not found the original billing records despite an extensive search , that he did not know how they got to the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign , and that Mrs. Clinton never told her law partners about her business dealings with Mr. McDougal or the Whitewater venture .
Mr. Hubbell pleaded guilty on Dec. 6 , 1994 , to defrauding his Rose firm partners and clients of $ 482,410 in overbillings and of failing to pay $ 143,747 in federal income taxes .
He was sentenced to 21 months in prison under a plea bargain and released after serving 16 months .
In the agreement , he promised to cooperate in the Whitewater investigation , although federal authorities have described that cooperation as less than expected .
Court records said some of the overbilled funds were used by Mr. Hubbell for questionable personal expenses , including purchases at a lingerie shop .

The mere fact that you ’ve clicked on this article shows that you realize the vital role that search engine optimization ( SEO ) plays in your company ’s success .
Hats off to you for recognizing that … you are a true titan of business !
One of the most important factors in optimizing your online presence is the use of keywords that are relevant to your niche .
However , it ’s not as simple as flooding your content with words associated with your industry .
It takes more strategy than that .
That ’s where keyword difficulty factors in .
Here ’s a guide on the SEO trick that is known as keyword difficulty and why you should prioritize it .
What is “ Keyword Difficulty ” ?
As if you did n’t already have enough to worry about … you ’re already focusing on keywords , internal links , external links , and high - quality content .
What makes keyword difficulty so important to your SEO tactics ?
To put it simply : it shows you the keywords that would be the hardest and easiest to rank highly in for your niche .
The common misconception people have with this is that they think “ keyword difficulty ” is the same thing as “ competition ” .
Not so much …
A “ competition ” metric for keyword research only refers to the paid search results .
Not an organic search , which is what you ’re shooting for .
You ’re already dedicating a lot of hard work and time towards the keywords you ’re placing into your content , do n’t let that effort be for naught .
Use the best backlink checker on the internet to find crucial keywords and study their keyword difficulty .
This will give you a higher chance of winding up on Google ’s top search results for that particular topic .
What Qualifies as an Eligible Keyword Difficulty Level ?
Now that you understand the “ why ” behind taking the time to prioritize and research the difficulty in all the keywords you use , it ’s time to figure out the “ what ” .
In other words : what keyword difficulty level should you be aiming for ?
That ’s a loaded question .
But you can gauge the level that you ’re wanting to aim for by simply understanding how the score works on a backlink checker like SEMrush .
The score itself varies from 0 to 100 .
Obviously , a score of “ zero ” is the least amount of difficulty and “ 100 ” is the most difficult to rank in .
Now , there are 3 different ranges that SEMrush suggests that you go by :
If the level is a score of 80 or higher , then it will be highly difficult to ever rank in .
You would need to place a ton of your marketing budget into your SEO ventures .
Why do that when you can spend less and have a higher chance at a lower difficulty level ?
If the level has a score between 60 to 80 , then they consider it to be a “ medium difficulty ” to place in .
In other words , it will take time and effort , but it ’s doable .
Lastly , if the score is 60 or below , then SEMrush considers it to have a low difficulty to rank in .
It bears repeating , that the lower the score is from 60 , the easier it will be for your content to reach the top search ranks on Google .
Be warned , however , that if you ’re just starting out on your SEO venture or building up a new website , you ’ll only want to use primary keywords that are 50 or less .
As your SEO rankings start to rise up , you can start to incorporate more keywords with a higher keyword difficulty score .
For now , as you ’re introducing your site to the world , focus on directing people to your content that has fewer sites to choose from .
How Is Keyword Difficulty Calculated ?
This is probably the main reason you clicked on this article , to figure out 1 ) what keyword difficulty is and 2 ) how its score is even determined in the first place .
There are three main factors that tools like SEMrush use to determine the keyword difficulty .
These reasons are the relevancy of content , searcher motives , external links .
Here ’s a brief description of each .
Content Relevancy
This factor should come as no surprise .
Everything in SEO surrounds the quality of a page ’s content .
So how do they gauge that ?
You need to be placing your primary keyword into the title , URL , headline , and first few lines of your content ’s body .
Think of it as a checklist that Google uses .
You need to check all the boxes to end up on the top search results for that keyword .
Searcher ’s Motives
The searcher ’s motives are the intent that a customer has when they type in their question into the Google search engine .
In other words : why are they typing in that specific keyword into Google ?
Does your content provide the solution for that “ why ” ?
The main reasons are when they want to know an answer , they want to buy , they want to go somewhere , or they want to accomplish something .
Used as an External Link ( from Other Sites )
Anytime your content is used as an external link for another site ’s content , Google views that as a credit to your content ’s quality .
The more times your content is used as such , the higher up you ’ll go in Google ’s top search results .
Period .
This aspect is a bit out of your control , but you can still use it when you link back to it for a guest post on another site or request a site to use your content .
Use Keyword Difficulty as Your Main SEO Trick
Now that you understand the reasoning behind prioritizing keyword difficulty , it ’s time to use that as an SEO trick for all your content .
Doing so will help you gain an advantage against all your competition both locally and beyond .
Be sure to read our other articles that pertain to both this topic and other topics that are just like it .
Gordon Brown has scrapped plans to buy two private jets to carry him and the Royal Family around the world , it was revealed today .
Instead the Government is scaling back proposals made by former premier Tony Blair , which were expected to cost taxpayers £ 100 million , and will buy only a small plane for trips around the UK .
The decision to abandon plans for the jets - nicknamed " Blair Force One " - was disclosed in a written statement to MPs by the Department for Transport .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick said the department had worked closely with the Royal Household , No 10 and the Foreign Office to reach the decision .
He said : " I am today recommending that the needs of the users of this service can best be met through procuring a small aircraft for official travel within the UK , chartered air services for longer journeys involving small parties , and a continuation of existing arrangements with UK airlines for journeys involving large parties .
" This approach ensures better value for money for the taxpayer whilst also minimising the environmental impact of royal and ministerial air travel , producing an estimated 10 - per-cent saving on O2 emissions . "
The statement to MPs said there had been " substantial increases in the cost of buying and operating commercial aircraft " since the idea was first raised in 2006 .
It also points out that the new Ministerial Code - introduced by Mr Brown when he entered No 10 last summer - sets out that scheduled flights should be used wherever possible .
" An increasing proportion of overseas journeys , including a number of those undertaken by the Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister , are now routinely made on scheduled flights . "
Campaigning in the Mountain West , Sen. Barack Obama said that the Bush administration ’s policies on warrantless wiretaps and executive authority would drive libertarian votes in his direction .
Libertarian voters played a big role in swinging control of Congress to the Democrats in 2006 .
Could Mr. Obama hold them against Arizona Sen. John McCain ?
While base voters still voted along party lines in 2006 , Republicans lost big among independents .
According to an analysis that David Kirby and I did , libertarians may be the largest bloc of such independent - minded swing voters .
Particularly in states with high concentrations of libertarians such as Arizona , Nevada , Colorado , Montana , and New Hampshire , disaffected libertarians likely cost Republicans House and Senate seats .
Recent polls suggest that 10 to 20 percent of Americans hold “ fiscally conservative , socially liberal ” or libertarian views .
Indeed , libertarians are a bigger share of the electorate than the much - discussed “ soccer moms , ” and they are increasingly a swing vote .
Libertarian voters have often given 70 percent or more of their votes to Republican candidates , including George W. Bush in 2000 .
But after six years of war , wiretapping and welfare - state social spending , libertarians gave barely half their votes to Republican candidates in 2006 .
The swing was even larger in Senate races .
It seems clear that a lot of the centrist , moderate , and independent voters who swung to the Democrats in 2006 were libertarian leaners .
The presidential campaign this year has been bleak for libertarian voters , with full slates of big - government liberals and big - government conservatives .
The campaign of former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani is especially interesting .
Many libertarian
Republicans were attracted to a candidate who was fiscally conservative , pro-choice , and gay - friendly .
That profile , along with his Sept. 11 , 2001 hero image , gave Mr. Giuliani an impressive lead in the polls for much of 2007 .
But then Mr. Giuliani clashed with Rep. Ron Paul over foreign policy issues in a May 15 debate , and that led to increased scrutiny of Mr. Giuliani .
Libertarian opinion leaders began to criticize Mr. Giuliani for his hawkishness and his authoritarian streak .
As voters paid closer attention and libertarian criticisms accelerated , he fell in the polls .
His fourth - place finish in libertarian - leaning New Hampshire - after spending a great deal of time and money there - was in retrospect the end of his campaign .
David Kirby has calculated that political futures markets were interpreting Ron Paul ’s successes as a setback for Mr. Giuliani , further evidence that it was a loss of libertarian support that caused Mr. Giuliani ’s campaign to plummet .
Now the choices are down to three .
Hillary Clinton , a self - proclaimed “ government junkie , ” is not likely to have much appeal for libertarians .
But what about the two frontrunners ?
Mr. McCain will try to keep libertarian voters in the Republican column by defining Mr. Obama as a big - government , big- spending liberal friend of Ted Kennedy and Nancy Pelosi .
But President Bush and the Republican Congress have severely undermined Republican credibility on fiscal conservatism .
Mr. McCain is also the leading supporter of the war in Iraq , which is unpopular with independent and libertarian voters .
And he has a long record of hostility to the First Amendment , from campaign finance regulation to regulating blogs to banning flag desecration .
But his maverick , “ straight talk ” image will appeal to libertarians , as will his support for free trade and a reasoned approach to immigration reform .
He could put some meat back on that maverick image by announcing that his attempt to crack down on political speech was misguided - and by reminding voters of disagreements with the religious right .
Mr. Obama offers virtually the opposite profile .
He ’s been against the war from the beginning .
He has tried to scale back the excesses of the Patriot Act and promises to review Bush ’s sweeping claims of executive power .
His rhetoric about moving beyond liberal - conservative fights appeals to libertarians and independents .
But buried inside the soaring eloquence of his speeches is a veritable laundry list of taxpayer handouts for every voting bloc , and he has even questioned the benefits of free trade .
If he wants to appeal to libertarian and independent voters , he should show a tiny bit of independence from the Kennedy - Pelosi - Clinton - labor agenda .
He could advocate Social Security private accounts as a way for low - income families to build wealth , or endorse school choice for children condemned to failing schools .
Republicans have been trying to drive libertarian voters out of their party .
But so far Democrats are n’t jumping on that opportunity .

Kind of a Fred Flinstone meets George Jetson thing going here .
Then again , Mr. Stedman said , the producers are looking for firm commitments on future gas tax rates from the state , giving some leverage back to the state and TransCanada .
“ How do you get it financed where there ’s a return to the investors and the state is treated fairly and compensated for its resources ? ”
Mr. Stedman said .
Two of the three major producers on the North Slope , BP and ConocoPhillips , announced last month that they were moving forward with building a pipeline on their own , and that demand and the high price of natural gas meant they would not need subsidies from the state .
They say they have committed to spending $ 600 million on early development of the pipeline .
“ We ’re confident we can build this project , ” said Steve Rinehart , a spokesman for BP Alaska , which runs Prudhoe Bay , the nation ’s largest oil field .
“ We ’re going forward no matter what .
We ’re interested in what ’s being said today , but we ’ve already started . ”
Ms. Palin said her plan was superior because it included “ enforceable commitments ” from TransCanada and gas producers that want to use the line , including an ability to expand the line so new companies can use it , at reasonable rates .
Mr. Rinehart said the producers were ready to meet those requirements , too , but Ms. Palin said there was no concrete evidence that was true .
With the state ’s economy in the balance as oil production declines , the governor said : “ We do n’t have time to mess around .
It is time to get the project built and not just keep guessing what the oil producers want from the state . ”

A speech given by Bertrand Russell , March 6 , 1927 , National Secular Society , South London branch , Battersea Town Hall
" As your chairman has told you , the subject about which I am to speak tonight is " Why I Am Not a Christian . "
Perhaps it would be as well , first of all , to try to make out what one means by the word " Christian . "
It is used these days in a very loose sense by a great many people .
Some people mean no more by it than a person who attempts to live a good life .
In that sense I suppose there would be Christians of all sects and creeds ; but I do not think that is the proper sense of the word , if only because it would imply that all the people who are not Christians -- all the Buddhists , Confucians , Mohammedans , and so on -- are not trying to live a good life .
I do not mean by a Christian any person who tries to live decently according to his lights .
I think you must have a certain amount of definite belief before you have a right to call yourself a Christian .
The word does not have quite such a full - blooded meaning now as it had in the times of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas .
In those days , if a man said that he was a Christian , it was known what he meant .
You accepted a whole collection of creeds which were set out with great precision , and every single syllable of those creeds you believed with the whole strength of your convictions .
What Is A Christian ?
Nowadays it is not quite that .
We have to be a little more vague in our meaning of Christianity .
I think , however , that there are two different items which are essential to anyone calling himself a Christian .
The first is one of a dogmatic nature -- namely , that you must believe in God and immortality .
If you do not believe in those two things , I do not think you can properly call yourself a Christian .
Then , further than that , as the name implies , you must have some kind of belief about Christ .
The Mohammedans , for instance , also believe in God and immortality , and yet they would not call themselves Christians .
I think that you must have at the very lowest the belief that Christ was , if not divine , at least the best and very wisest of men .
If you are not going to believe that much about Christ , I do not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian .
Of course , there is another sense , which you find in " Whitaker 's Almanack " and in geography books , where the population of the world is said to be divided into Christians , Mohammedans , Buddhists , fetish worshippers , and so on ; but in that sense we are all Christians .
The geography counts us all in , but that is a purely geographical sense , which I suppose we can ignore .
Therefore I take it that when I tell you why I am not a Christian I have to tell you two different things : first , why I do not believe in God and in immortality ; and , secondly , why I do not think that Christ was the very best and wisest of men , although I grant him a very high degree of moral goodness .
But for the successful efforts of unbelievers in the past , I could not take so elastic a definition of Christianity as that .
As I said before , in the olden days it had a much more full - blooded sense .
For instance , it included the belief in hell .
Belief in eternal hell - fire was an essential item of Christian belief until pretty recent times .
In this country , as you know , it ceased to be an essential item because of a decision of the Privy Council , and from that decision the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York dissented ; but in this country our religion is settled by Act of Parliament , and therefore the Privy Council was able to override Their Graces and Hell was no longer necessary to a Christian .
Consequently I shall not insist that a Christian must believe in hell .
The Existence Of God
To come to this question of the existence of God : it is a large and serious question , and if I were to attempt to deal with it in any adequate manner I should have to keep you here until Kingdom Come , so that you will have to excuse me if I deal with it in a somewhat summary fashion .
You know , of course , that the Catholic Church has laid it down as dogma that the existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason .
This is a somewhat curious dogma , but it is one of their dogmas .
They had to introduce it because at one time the freethinkers adopted the habit of saying that there were such and such arguments which mere reason might urge against the existence of God , but of course they knew as a matter of faith that God did exist .
The arguments and reasons were set out at great length , and the Catholic Church felt that they must stop it .
Therefore they laid it down as dogma that the existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason and they had to set up what they considered were arguments to prove it .
The First Cause Argument
Perhaps the simplest and easiest to understand is the argument of the First Cause .
( It is maintained that everything we see in the world has a cause , and as you go back in the chain of causes further and further you must come to a First Cause , and to that First Cause you give the name of God . )
That argument , I suppose , does not carry much weight nowadays , because , in the first place , cause is not quite what it used to be .
The philosophers and the men of science have got going on cause , and it has not anything like the vitality it used to have ; but apart from that , you can see that the argument that there must be a First Cause is one that cannot have any validity .
I may say that when I was a young man and was debating these questions very seriously in my mind , I for a long time accepted the argument of the First Cause , until one day , at the age of eighteen , I read John Stuart Mill 's autobiography , and I there found this sentence : " My father taught me that the question ' Who made me ? ' cannot be answered , since it immediately suggests the further question " Who made god ' " that very simple sentence showed me , as I still think , the fallacy in the argument of the First Cause .
If everything must have a cause , then God must have a cause .
If there can be anything without a cause , it may just as well be the world as God , so that there can not be any validity in that argument .
It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu 's view , that the world rested upon an elephant , and the elephant rested upon a tortoise ; and when they said , " How about the tortoise ? " the Indian said , " Suppose we change the subject . "
The argument is really no better than that .
There is no reason why the world could not have come into being without a cause ; nor , on the other hand , is there any reason why it should not have always existed .
There is no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at all .
The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imagination .
Therefore , perhaps , I need not waste any more time upon the argument about the First Cause .
The Natural - Law Argument
Then there is a very common argument from Natural Law .
That was a favorite argument all through the eighteenth century , especially under the influence of Sir Isaac Newton and his cosmogony .
People observed the planets going around the sun according to the law of gravitation , and the thought that God had given a behest to these planets to move in a particular fashion , and that was why they did so .
That was , of course , a convenient and simple explanation that saved them the trouble of looking any further for any explanation of the law of gravitation .
Nowadays we explain the law of gravitation in a somewhat complicated fashion that Einstein has introduced .
I do not propose to give you a lecture on the law of gravitation , as interpreted by Einstein , because that again would take some time ; at any rate , you no longer have the sort of Natural Law that you had in the Newtonian system , where , for some reason that nobody could understand , nature behaved in a uniform fashion .
We now find that a great many things we thought were Natural Laws are really human conventions .
You know that even in the remotest depth of stellar space there are still three feet to a yard .
That is , no doubt , a very remarkable fact , but you would hardly call it a law of nature .
And a great many things that have been regarded as laws of nature are of that kind .
On the other hand , where you can get down to any knowledge of what atoms actually do , you will find they are much less subject to law than people thought , and the laws at which you arrive are statistical averages of just the sort that would emerge from chance .
There is , as we all know , a law that says if you throw dice you will get double sixes only about once in thirty - six times , and we do not regard that as evidence to the contrary that the fall of the dice is regulated by design ; on the contrary , if the double sixes came every time we should think that there was design .
The laws of nature are of that sort as regards to a great many of them .
They are statistical averages such as would emerge from the laws of chance ; and that makes the whole business of natural law much less impressive than it formerly was .
Quite apart from that , which represents the momentary state of science that may change tomorrow , the whole idea that natural laws imply a lawgiver is due to a confusion between natural and human laws .
Human laws are behests commanding you to behave a certain way , in which you may choose to behave , or you may choose not to behave ; but natural laws are a description of how things do in fact behave , and being a mere description of what they in fact do , you cannot argue that there must be supposedly someone who told them to do that , because even supposing there were , you are faced with the question , " Why did god issue just those and no others ? "
If you say that he did it simply from his own good pleasure , and without any reason , you then find that there is something which is not subject to law , and so your train of natural law is interrupted .
If you say , as more orthodox theologians do , that in all the laws which God issues he had a reason for giving those laws rather than others -- the reason , of course , being to create the best universe , although you would never think it to look at it -- if there were a reason for the laws which God gave , then God himself was subject to law , and therefore you do not get any advantage by introducing God as an intermediary .
You really have a law outside and anterior to the divine edicts , and God does not serve your purpose , as he is not the ultimate lawgiver .
In short , this whole argument from natural law no longer has anything like the strength that it used to have .
I am traveling on in time in my review of these arguments .
The arguments that are used for the existence of God change their character as time goes on .
They were at first hard intellectual arguments embodying certain quite definite fallacies .
As we come to modern times they become less respectable intellectually and more and more affected by a kind of moralizing vagueness .
The Argument from Design
The next step in the process brings us to the argument from design .
You all know the argument from design : everything in the world is made just so that we can manage to live in the world , and if the world was ever so little different , we could not manage to live in it .
That is the argument from design .
It sometimes takes a rather curious form ; for instance , it is argued that rabbits have white tails in order to be easy to shoot .
I do not know how rabbits would view that application .
It is an easy argument to parody .
You all know Voltaire 's remark , that obviously the nose was designed to be such as to fit spectacles .
That sort of parody has turned out to be not nearly so wide of the mark as it might have seemed in the eighteenth century , because since the time of Darwin we understand much better why living creatures are adapted to their environment .
It is not that their environment was made to be suitable to them , but that they grew to be suitable to it , that is the basis of adaptation .
There is no evidence of design about it .
When you come to look into this argument from design , it is a most astonishing thing that people can believe that this world , with all the things that are in it , with all its defects , should be the best that omnipotence and omniscience have been able to produce in millions of years .
I really cannot believe it .
Do you think that , if you were granted omnipotence and omniscience and millions of years in which to perfect your world , you could produce nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan or the fascists ?
Moreover , if you accept the ordinary laws of science , you have to suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in due course : it is a stage in the decay of the solar system ; at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions and temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm , and there is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system .
You see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending -- something dead , cold , and lifeless .
I am told that that sort of view is depressing , and people will sometimes tell you that if they believed that , they would not be able to go on living .
Do not believe it ; it is all nonsense .
Nobody really worries about what is going to happen millions of years hence .
Even if they think they are worrying much about that , they are really deceiving themselves .
They are worried about something much more mundane , or it may merely be bad digestion ; but nobody is really seriously rendered unhappy by the thought of something that is going to happen in this world millions and millions of years hence .
Therefore , although it is of course a gloomy view to suppose that life will die out -- at least I suppose we may say so , although sometimes when I contemplate the things that people do with their lives I think it is almost a consolation -- it is not such as to render life miserable .
It merely makes you turn your attention to other things .
The Moral Arguments for Deity
Now we reach one stage further in what I shall call the intellectual descent that the Theists have made in their argumentations , and we come to what are called moral arguments for the existence of God .
You all know , of course , that there used to be in the old days three intellectual arguments for the existence of God , all of which were disposed of by Immanuel Kant in the " Critique of Pure Reason ; " but no sooner had he disposed of those arguments than he invented a new one , a moral argument , and that quite convinced him .
He was like many people : in intellectual matters he was skeptical , but in moral matters he believed implicitly in the maxims that he had imbibed at his mother 's knee .
That illustrates what the psychoanalysts so much emphasize -- the immensely stronger hold that our very early associations have than those of later times .
Kant , as I say , invented a new moral argument for the existence of God , and that in varying forms was extremely popular during the nineteenth century .
it has all sorts of forms .
One form is to say there would be no right and wrong unless god existed .
I am not for the moment concerned with whether there is a difference between right and wrong , or whether there is not : that is another question .
The point I am concerned with is that , if you are quite sure there is a difference between right and wrong , then you are in this situation : is that difference due to God 's fiat or is it not ?
If it is due to God 's fiat , then for God himself there is no difference between right and wrong , and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is good .
If you are going to say , as theologians do , that God is good , you must then say that right and wrong have some meaning which is independent of God 's fiat , because God 's fiats are good and not bad independently of the fact that he made them .
If you are going to say that , you will have to say that it is not only through God that right and wrong came into being , but that they are in their essence logically anterior to God .
You could , of course , if you liked , say that there was a superior deity who gave orders to the God that made this world , or could take up a line that some of the Gnostics took up -- a line which I often thought was a very plausible one -- that as a matter of fact this world that we know was made by the Devil at a moment when God was not looking .
There is a good deal to be said for that , and I am not concerned to refute it .
The Argument for the Remedying of Injustice
Then there is another very curious form of moral argument , which is this : they say that the existence of God is required to bring justice into the world .
In the part of the universe that we know there is a great injustice , and often the good suffer , and the often the wicked prosper , and one hardly knows which of those is more annoying ; but if you are going to have justice in the universe as a whole you have to suppose a future life to redress the balance of life here on earth .
So they say that there must be a God , and that there must be Heaven and Hell in order that in the long run there may be justice .
That is a very curious argument .
If you looked at the matter from a scientific point of view , you would say , " After all , I only know this world .
I do not know about the rest of the universe , but so far as one can argue from probabilities one would say that probably this world is a fair sample , and if there is injustice here then the odds are great that there is injustice elsewhere also .
"
Supposing you got a crate of oranges that you opened , and you found all the top layer of oranges bad , you would not argue , " The underneath ones must be good , so as to redress the balance . "
You would say , " Probably the whole lot is a bad consignment " ; and that is really what a scientific person would argue about the universe .
He would say , " Here we find in this world a great deal of injustice , and so far as that goes that is a reason for supposing that justice does not rule in this world , and therefore so far as it goes it supports a moral argument against deity and not in favor of one . "
Of course I know that the sort of intellectual arguments that I have been talking to you about is not really what moves people .
What really moves people to believe in God is not any intellectual argument at all .
Most people believe in God because they have been taught from early infancy to do it , and that is the main reason .
Then I think that the next most powerful reason is the wish for safety , a sort of feeling that there is a big brother who will look after you .
That plays a very profound part in influencing people 's desire for a belief in God .
The Character Of Christ
I now want to say a few words upon a topic which I often think is not quite sufficiently dealt with by rationalists , and that is the question whether Christ was the best and the wisest of men .
It is generally taken for granted that we should all agree that that was so .
I do not myself .
I think that there are a good many points upon which I agree with Christ a great deal more than the professing Christians do .
I do not know that I could go with Him all the way , but I could go with Him much further than most professing Christians can .
You will remember that He said , " Resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . "
That is not a new precept or a new principle .
It was used by Lao - Tse and Buddha some 500 or 600 years before Christ , but it is not a principle which as a matter of fact Christians accept .
I have no doubt that the present prime minister ( Stanley Baldwin ) , for instance , is a most sincere Christian , but I should not advise any of you to go and smite him on one cheek .
I think you might find that he thought this text was intended in a figurative sense .
Then there is another point which I consider excellent .
You will remember that Christ said , " Judge not lest ye be judged . "
That principle I do not think you would find was very popular in the law courts of Christian countries .
I have known in my time a number of judges who were very earnest Christians , and none of them felt that they were acting contrary to Christian principles in what they did .
Then Christ says , " Give to him that asketh of thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away . "
This is a very good principle .
Your chairman has reminded you that we are not here to talk politics , but I cannot help observing that the last general election was fought on the question of how desirable it was to turn away from him that would borrow of thee , so that one must assume that the liberals and conservatives of this country are composed of people who do not agree with the teaching of Christ , because they certainly did not behave that way on that occasion .
Then there is one other maxim of Christ 's teaching which I think has a great deal of good in it , but I do not find that it is very popular among some of our Christian friends .
He says , " If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that which thou hast , and give to the poor . "
That is a very excellent maxim , but , as I say , it is not much practised .
All these , I think , are good maxims , although they are a little difficult to live up to .
I do not profess to live up to them myself ; but then , after all , it is not quite the same thing as for a Christian .
Defects in Christ 's Teaching
Having granted the excellence of these maxims , I come to certain points in which I do not believe that one can grant either the superlative wisdom or the superlative goodness of Christ as depicted in the Gospels ; and here I may say that one is not concerned with the historical question .
Historically , it is quite doubtful whether Christ ever existed at all , and if He did we do not know anything about him , so that I am not concerned with the historical question , which is a very difficult one .
I am concerned with Christ as he appears in the Gospels , taking the Gospel narrative as it stands , and there one does find some things that do not seem to be very wise .
For one thing , he certainly thought his second coming would occur in clouds of glory before the death of all the people who were living at that time .
There are a great many texts that prove that .
He says , for instance , " Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of Man comes into his kingdom " ; and there are a lot of places where it is quite clear that he believed his second coming would happen during the lifetime of many then living .
That was the belief of his earlier followers , and it was the basis of a good deal of his moral teaching .
When
He said , " Take no thought for the morrow , " and things of that sort , it was very largely because
He thought the second coming was going to be very soon , and that all ordinary mundane affairs did not count .
I have , as a matter of fact , known some Christians who did believe the second coming was imminent .
I knew a parson who frightened his congregation terribly by telling them the second coming was very imminent indeed , but they were much consoled when they found that he was planting trees in his garden .
The early Christians really did believe it , and they did abstain from such things as planting trees in their gardens , because they did accept from Christ the belief that the second coming was imminent .
In this respect , clearly He was not so wise as some other people have been , and He certainly was not superlatively wise .
The Moral Problem
Then you come to moral questions .
There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ 's moral character , and that is that He believed in Hell .
I do not myself feel that any person that is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment .
Christ certainly as depicted in the Gospels did believe in everlasting punishment , and one does find repeatedly a vindictive fury against those people who would not listen to His preaching -- an attitude which is not uncommon with preachers , but which does somewhat detract from superlative excellence .
You do not , for instance , find that attitude in Socrates .
You find him quite bland and urbane toward the people who would not listen to him ; and it is , to my mind , far more worthy of a sage to take that line than to take the line of indignation .
You probably all remember the sorts of things that Socrates was saying when he was dying , and the sort of things that he generally did say to people who did not agree with him .
You will find that in the Gospels Christ said , " Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of Hell . "
That was said to people who did not like His preaching .
It is not really to my mind quite the best tone , and there are a great many of these things about Hell .
There is , of course , the familiar text about the sin against the Holy Ghost : " Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come . "
That text has caused an unspeakable amount of misery in the world , for all sorts of people have imagined that they have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost , and though that it would not be forgiven them either in this world or in the world to come .
I really do not think that a person with a proper degree of kindliness in his nature would have put fears and terrors of this sort into the world .
Then Christ says , " The Son of Man shall send forth his His angels , and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity , and shall cast them into a furnace of fire ; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth " ; and He goes on about the wailing and gnashing of teeth .
It comes in one verse after another , and it is quite manifest to the reader that there is a certain pleasure in contemplating wailing and gnashing of teeth , or else it would not occur so often .
Then you all , of course , remember about the sheep and the goats ; how at the second coming
He is going to divide the sheep from the goats , and He is going to say to the goats , " Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire . "
He continues , " And these shall go away into everlasting fire . "
Then
He says again , " If thy hand offend thee , cut it off ; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into Hell , into the fire that shall never be quenched , where the worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . "
He repeats that again and again also .
I must say that I think all this doctrine , that hell - fire is a punishment for sin , is a doctrine of cruelty .
It is a doctrine that put cruelty into the world , and gave the world generations of cruel torture ; and the Christ of the Gospels , if you could take Him as his chroniclers represent Him , would certainly have to be considered partly responsible for that .
There are other things of less importance .
There is the instance of the Gadarene swine , where it certainly was not very kind to the pigs to put the devils into them and make them rush down the hill into the sea .
You must remember that He was omnipotent , and He could have made the devils simply go away ; but He chose to send them into the pigs .
Then there is the curious story of the fig tree , which has always rather puzzled me .
You remember what happened about the fig tree .
" He was hungry ; and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , He came if haply He might find anything thereon ; and when he came to it He found nothing but leaves , for the time of figs was not yet .
And Jesus answered and said unto it : ' No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever ' ... and Peter ... saith unto Him : ' Master , behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away . ' "
This is a very curious story , because it was not the right time of year for figs , and you really could not blame the tree .
I cannot myself feel that either in the matter of wisdom or in the matter of virtue Christ stands quite as high as some other people known to history .
I think I should put Buddha and Socrates above Him in those respects .
The Emotional Factor
As I said before , I do not think that the real reason that people accept religion has anything to do with argumentation .
They accept religion on emotional grounds .
One is often told that it is a very wrong thing to do to attack religion , because religion makes men virtuous .
So I am told ; I have not noticed it .
You know , of course , the parody of that argument in Samuel Butler 's book , Erewhon Revisited .
You will remember that in Erewhon there is a certain Higgs who arrives in a remote country , and after spending some time there he escapes from that country in a balloon .
Twenty years later he comes back to that country and finds a new religion in which he is worshipped under the name of the " Sun Child , " and it is said that he ascended into Heaven .
He finds that the feast of the Ascension is about to be celebrated , and he hears Professors Hanky and Panky say to each other that they never set eyes on the man Higgs , and they hope they never will ; but they are the High Priests of the religion of the Sun Child .
He is very indignant , and he comes up to them , and he says , " I am going to expose all this humbug and tell the people of Erewhon that it was only I , the man Higgs , and I went up in a balloon . "
He was told , " You must not do that , because of all the morals of this country are bound round this myth , and if they once know that you did not ascend into Heaven they will all become wicked " ; and so he is persuaded of that and he goes quietly away .
That is the idea -- that we should all be wicked if we did not hold to the Christian religion .
It seems to me that the people who have held to it have been for the most part extremely wicked .
You find this curious fact , that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief , the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs .
In the so - called Ages of Faith , when men really did believe the Christian religion in all its completeness , there was the Inquisition , with all its tortures ; there were millions of unfortunate women burned as witches ; and there was every kind of cruelty practiced upon all sorts of people in the name of religion .
You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress of humane feeling , every improvement in the criminal law , every step toward the diminution of war , every step toward better treatment of the colored races , or ever mitigation of slavery , every moral progress that there has been in the world , has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world .
I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion , as organized in its churches , has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world .
How The Churches Have Retarded Progress
You may think that I am going too far when I say that that is still so , I do not think that I am .
Take one fact .
You will bear with me if I mention it .
It is not a pleasant fact , but the churches compel one to mention facts that are not pleasant .
Supposing that in this world that we live in today an inexperienced girl is married to a syphilitic man ; in that case the Catholic Church says , " This is an indissoluble sacrament .
You must endure celibacy or stay together .
And if you stay together , you must not use birth control to prevent the birth of syphilitic children . "
Nobody whose natural sympathies have not been warped by dogma , or whose moral nature was not absolutely dead to all sense of suffering could maintain that it is right and proper that this state of things should continue .
That is only an example .
There are a great many ways in which , at the present moment , the church , by its insistence upon what it chooses to call morality , inflicts upon all sorts of people undeserved and unnecessary suffering .
And of course , as we know , it is in its major part an opponent still of progress and improvement in all the ways that diminish suffering in the world , because it has chosen to label as morality a certain narrow set of rules of conduct which have nothing to do with human happiness ; and when you say that this or that ought to be done because it would make for human happiness , they think that has nothing to do with the matter at all .
" What has human happiness to do with morals ?
The object of morals is not to make people happy . "
Fear , The Foundation Of Religion
Religion is based , I think , primarily and mainly upon fear .
It is partly the terror of the unknown and partly , as I have said , the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes .
Fear is the basis of the whole thing -- fear of the mysterious , fear of defeat , fear of death .
Fear is the parent of cruelty , and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand .
It is because fear is at the basis of those two things .
In this world we can now begin a little to understand things , and a little to master them by the help of science , which has forced its way step by step against the Christian religion , against the churches , and against the opposition of all the old precepts .
Science can help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations .
Science can teach us , and I think our own hearts can teach us , no longer to look around for imaginary supports , no longer to invent allies in the sky , but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a better place to live in , instead of the sort of place the churches in all these centuries have made it .
What We Must Do
We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world -- its good facts , its bad facts , its beauties , and its ugliness ; see the world as it is and be not afraid of it .
Conquer the world by intelligence and not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it .
The whole conception of a god is a conception derived from the ancient oriental despotisms .
It is a conception quite unworthy of free men .
When you hear people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable sinners , and all the rest of it , it seems contemptible and not worthy of self - respecting human beings .
We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face .
We ought to make the best we can of the world , and if it is not so good as we wish , after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages .
A good world needs knowledge , kindliness , and courage ; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men .
It needs a fearless outlook and a free intelligence .
It needs hope for the future , not looking back all the time toward a past that is dead , which we trust will be far surpassed by the future that our intelligence can create . "
Goldman says there is light at the end of the tunnel for investors
The report says 40 % , or $ 480bn , of those losses will hit US banks , brokerages and other institutions .
Goldman estimates that US financial firms have already reported losses of $ 120 bn since the credit crunch began .
Banks made huge losses on investments backed by US mortgages .
That is now hampering their ability to loan money , which threatens US economic growth .
" US leveraged institutions have written off less than half of the losses associated with the bursting of the credit bubble , " the report said .
" There is light at the end of the tunnel , but it is still rather dim , " it added .
The credit crunch caused the near collapse of US investment bank Bear Stearns earlier this month .
The bank 's clients - worried about losses on mortgage - backed investments - started to withdraw funds , forcing it to ask for emergency funding .
Days later JP Morgan Chase announced a deal to buy the company .
One Friday afternoon in August , 2004 , a Washington , D.C. , attorney named Lynne Bernabei received a package from the Department of the Treasury .
The government was investigating one of her clients , the American branch of a Saudi charity called the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation , which had been active in fifty countries .
Al Haramain had come under scrutiny , as had many other Islamic charities , after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and Treasury Department investigators believed that Al Haramain ’s American branch , which was based in Oregon , had connections to Al Qaeda .
In response to a request from Bernabei for evidence against her client , the government had turned over two sets of documents , primarily media reports that referred to other branches of Al Haramain .
None of the materials demonstrated a direct connection between the Oregon branch and Al Qaeda .
Bernabei asked for any classified evidence the government might have , arguing that it was impossible to rebut evidence that she could n’t see .
When a third batch of evidence arrived , that August afternoon , the cover letter noted that the enclosed materials were “ unclassified , ” so Bernabei did n’t give much thought to the last item , a four - page document stamped “ Top Secret . ”
“ My impression was that it might have been something that was declassified , ” she told me recently .
Bernabei photocopied the materials and forwarded them to the half - dozen clients and attorneys associated with the case .
Several weeks later , the Treasury Department concluded its investigation , and declared the Oregon branch of Al Haramain a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity , citing “ direct links ” with Osama bin Laden .
Soon afterward , two F.B.I. agents visited Bernabei ’s office and informed her that a classified document had accidentally been turned over to her .
Bernabei told them that she had received only “ unclassified ” information , but she agreed to retrieve the document from her files .
According to Bernabei , one of the agents suggested that as she looked for the document she should try not to think about what it contained .
In the following weeks , F.B.I. agents tracked down the copies that she had distributed .
One lawyer for Al Haramain had an electronic copy .
The F.B.I. asked to purge it from his computers .
Bernabei said that she and her associates did not appreciate the significance of the document , and the government ’s efforts to recover it , until December , 2005 , when the New York Times revealed that the Bush Administration had authorized the National Security Agency to employ wiretaps inside the United States without first getting a warrant .
The document that the Treasury Department had turned over to Bernabei appears to have been a summary of intercepted telephone conversations between two of Al Haramain ’s American lawyers , in Washington , and one of the charity ’s officers , in Saudi Arabia .
The government had evidently passed along proof of surveillance to the targets of that surveillance , and supplied the Oregon branch of Al Haramain — a suspected terrorist organization — with ammunition to challenge the constitutionality of the warrantless - wiretapping program .
Well before September 11th , U.S. intelligence agencies had suspicions about the connections between Islamic charities and terrorism .
Zakat , or charitable tithing , is one of the five pillars of Islam , a duty for observant Muslims , and , by some estimates , Saudi charities raise four billion dollars a year .
They establish mosques and community centers , distribute religious literature , and dispatch clerics to spread Wahhabism , the severe strain of fundamentalist Islam that is the official religion of the kingdom .
“ This is an element of Saudi foreign policy , ” Lee Wolosky , a member of the National Security Council in the Clinton and Bush Administrations , told me .
“ It ’s very well coördinated .
It happens at the highest levels of the Saudi state . ”
In 2004 , David Aufhauser , who as the Treasury Department ’s general counsel oversaw its counterterrorism efforts after September 11th , estimated that in recent decades the kingdom had spent “ north of seventy - five billion dollars ” on Islamic evangelism .
Al Haramain was established , with help from the Saudi royal family , in 1991 .
Its headquarters were in Riyadh , with offices in foreign countries .
Within a few years , the charity was suspected by the C.I.A. of involvement in terrorism .
In 1996 , a C.I.A. report suggested that a third of Islamic N.G.O.s “ support terrorist groups or employ individuals who are suspected of having terrorist connections ” ; it named Al Haramain as an example .
In 1997 , a C.I.A. informant in Nairobi said that the local branch of Al Haramain planned to blow up the U.S. Embassy .
According to the Times , a C.I.A. inquiry turned up no evidence of a plot , but after the bombings of the American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , the following year , Kenyan authorities ordered Al Haramain from the country .
In a trial on the bombings in New York in 2001 , prosecutors introduced a collection of business cards that had been seized from the Nairobi home of Wadih el - Hage , an Al Qaeda operative who was eventually convicted for his role .
One belonged to Mansour al - Kadi , an Al Haramain official in Riyadh , who was the titular vice - president of the Oregon branch ( though he never played an active role there , and no further connection was made between the charity and the bombings ) .
Aqeel al - Aqil , who was Al Haramain ’s director during the nineties , told me by e-mail that he could not control aid and donations once they arrived in areas of conflict , such as Bosnia and Chechnya .
“ If you give a sack of flour to a needy family , ” he said , “ you cannot guarantee that some of their mujahideen sons will not eat some of the bread made of that flour . ”
U.S. authorities , however , believed that the charities must be held accountable .
“ Historically , Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have set up or exploited some charities , ” Stuart Levey , the Treasury Department ’s Under - Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence , told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month .
“ Those who reach for their wallets to fund terrorism must be pursued and punished in the same way as those who reach for a bomb or a gun . ”
After September 11th , the F.B.I. assigned Dennis Lormel , a veteran financial investigator , to look into how Al Qaeda secured its funding .
“ We latched on to charities immediately , ” he told me .
On September 23 , 2001 , President Bush signed an executive order authorizing the Treasury Department to “ designate ” individuals or entities believed to be supporting or “ otherwise associated ” with terrorism , in order to help shut down what Bush called “ the financial foundation of the global terror network . ”
Designations amount to a kind of economic embargo : anyone who does business with a designated person risks criminal or civil penalties .
The Treasury Department can act more quickly than the police or the F.B.I. , who may take action only after an investigation .
By preëmptively freezing a suspect ’s assets , “ the government does not have to watch these dollars continue to flow over a period of months or years as it investigates whether it will pursue criminal charges , ” a department spokesman , Andrew DeSouza , told me .
Authorities also need less evidence for a designation than they would for prosecution , and they can rely on evidence that would not be admissible in a criminal trial .
Matthew Levitt , who until last year was deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis at the Treasury Department , says that designations involve “ an extremely robust process .
This is not something that can be done easily or willy - nilly . ”
But Lormel , who retired from the F.B.I. in 2003 , says he would have been “ hard pressed ” to act on some of the material that Treasury officials used .
“ Oftentimes , I think they base their evidence on media stories or public - source information , whereas we would never use only that , ” he told me .
Today the KDE team announces a new project to re-synchronize our HTML engine ,
KHTML , with the WebKit engine .
Code named Unity , the project has so far focused on porting the WebKit engine to Qt 4 with minimal changes to the existing code - base .
WebKit is a derivative of the KHTML engine developed by Apple Computer Inc .
The initial work for this project was done by four KDE core developers at the
KDE Four Core meeting last week in Trysil , Norway .
The contributors were
Dirk Mueller , Zack Rusin , Simon Hausmann , and George Staikos .
The project also builds on lead - up work done over the past year by George Staikos and Maksim Orlovich , which synchronized the KDE and WebKit Javascript engines .
At this stage Unity is a research project to determine the feasibility of
merging much of the KHTML work done over the past few years into WebKit .
This
will provide us a means to synchronizing our engines .
There are no concrete
plans to replace KDE 's current KHTML component , which is also used by Konqueror to render HTML pages , with Unity .
Any such decision will be left to the KHTML and KDE core
development teams in the upcoming months .
It is dependent on many factors such
as our ability to keep the engines synchronized over time , our ability to
produce a high - performance , stable , and complete KPart , our level of comfort
with the new code - base , and our ability to come to a suitable working
arrangement with the other WebKit contributors .
With respect to the technical work , our efforts have resulted in a Qt 4 based WebKit library that is able to render a variety of web pages quite nicely .
There is still a considerable amount of work to do before it can be considered a complete browser engine on our platform but the basic foundations are complete .
The KDE build system , cmake , is integrated into the WebKit sources , rendering uses Qt 's graphics facilities , and a simple test driver has been developed .
A KDE layer will be added to integrate the engine with the desktop facilities provided by KDE as well as creating a KPart which can be loaded by any KDE application requesting a handler for HTML .
Anyone wishing to join the effort should contact the developers on the
k fm - devel mailing list .
Source code is accessible in KDE 's Subversion repository .
For press queries about this and other KDE announcements see the KDE press contacts page .
