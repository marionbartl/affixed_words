The company I worked for had our stock programs with E*TRADE for a brief period .
When they transferred the stock out , I was left with a balance of $ .49 in the account .
The company dutifully sent me quarterly statements telling me they still had my $ .49 .
I decided I should just close the account and let them stop sending me statements .
Below is a rough transcript of my communications with the E*TRADE customer representatives ( ECR ) : ECR : Welcome to E*TRADE customer service , my name is _____ , how can I be of assistance ?
Me : I would like to close my account with you .
ECR : Is there something the matter with our services ?
Me : No , My company was using you for their stock plan and moved to a different company .
There is a balance of $ .49 in my account and I figure that it would be easier to just get it back so you do n't have to keep sending me statements .
ECR : I understand , I 'll send you a check for $.49 and close the account .
Me : Thank you .
So I wait .
No check comes .
I get another quarterly statement saying I have $ .49 in my account .
I try again .
ECR : Welcome to E*TRADE customer service , my name is _____ , how can I be of assistance ?
Me : I called a few months ago about closing my account and was told I would be sent a check but have never recieved it and I just got a quarterly statement saying that I still have $ .49 in my account .
ECR : I can take care of that and get a check out to you .
Me : Thank You .
More waiting .
No check .
I let a couple of statements come and then decide it is annoying and I will try again .
ECR : Welcome to E*TRADE customer service , my name is _____ , how can I be of assistance ?
Me : I called a while ago about closing my account and was told I would be sent a check twice now but I have never recieved it and I just got a quarterly statement saying that I still have $ .49 in my account .
ECR : Let me see what I can find ...
I can't close your account over the phone , you would need to send a letter in requesting that we close it .
Me : So I have to spend $ .32 to get my $ .49 ?
Meanwhile you might send me another color printed statement that probably costs that much ?
ECR : Yeah it is pretty silly .
Let me see what I can do ...
I 'll be able to send you the check .
Me : Thank you .
More waiting ...
Still no check .
At this point life is busy and I figure if they want to keep sending me statements I 'll let them until I have a chance to call them .
But another year or two goes by and I decide to try again .
ECR : Welcome to E*TRADE customer service , my name is _____ , how can I be of assistance ?
Me : I have called multiple times to try and close my account and get a check for my $ .49 .
I have been told three times that a check would get sent out to me but it has never happened .
Meanwhile , you have sent me quarterly statements that I 'm sure cost a total of $ 3 - $ 4 for you to print .
Can I just close the account ?
ECR : I would be happy to close your account .
It will cost $ 10 for the check .
Me : What ?
ECR : Yes , our standard fee for writing a check is $ 10 .
Me : So you want me to pay $ 10 for my $ .49 ?
ECR : If you want to get the money out , yes .
We can just close your account and keep your money .
Me : I suppose that would at least stop the statements .
I protest though as the company has promised me my $ .49 three times and never delevered .
ECR : Shall I close your account then and we will keep the money ?
Me : I suppose so but I do this under protest .
ECR : I have closed your account .
Me :
Thanks , I think .
So it was done , the account was closed and I would n't get anymore statements .
Three months later , I get another statement .
I can't believe the effort I am putting into this so I send a letter to their customer service :
To whom it may concern , This email is being sent as a last contact from myself to your company .
The firm that I work in used E*TRADE for a while for our stock plan .
When our stock was transferred out , I was left with a balance of $ .49 cents or there about .
In the interveneing years , I have called E*TRADE customer service four times in an attempt to close out the account and get that $ .49 .
The first three times , I was promised that a check would be immediately sent out to me .
Needless to say , that check never arrived .
The fourth time I called , I was told that I would have to pay $ 10 in order to get my check for $ .49 .
I told them this was unacceptable .
At this point the woman helping me said she could close my account and just keep the $ .49 .
I told them that I protested that as I had been promised my check three times already but that it could stop the mailings .
She siad she would close the account .
Funny that a little while later , I got another statement saying I have $ .49 left in my account .
At this point , I hope that you will continue to send my account statements .
I figure that you have payed for at least 20 mailings to me and at least 4 hours of customer service time , all to keep hold of my $ .49 .
Since this appears to be the way you do business , please continue to send me statements which I will continue to ignore .
My time is n't worth the $ .49 but I 'm glad to know you will keep spending much more than that keeping me informed of it .

Operating under the sign of a Jolly Roger , The Pirate Bay website hopes to evoke a buccaneer spirit : swashbuckling swordsmen , or perhaps the pirate radio stations of the 1960s .
But as the internet 's number one destination for illegal downloads , it has raised the ­hackles of the entertainment industry and elevated its founders to the top of Hollywood 's most wanted list .
With more than two million visitors every day , The Pirate Bay has become one of the sharpest thorns in the side of the media business .
Its controversial success has caused havoc in the music , TV and film industries .
Current top downloads include The Bourne Ultimatum , Die Hard 4.0 and Knocked Up — all showing in British cinemas , but available to watch on a computer screen for those willing to take the risk .
The three - year campaign to bring down the website is almost an epic of Hollywood proportions , sprinkled with high - flying lawyers and accusations of political extremism .
And yet , so far , the chase has failed to bring the pirates down .
Despite their high profile , however , the men behind The Pirate Bay are not part of an organised crime syndicate .
Instead , they are an unlikely trio of Swedish computer geeks who began their war with the media from a small room in Stockholm .
The group , who spoke exclusively to the Guardian , live like students in the suburbs of Sweden 's major cities .
They wake late and work into the night .
The closest thing they have to an official headquarters is a desk on the suburban outskirts of Malmo — and that is simply because it has a working fax machine .
But as the most hated men in Hollywood , they said they have become used to the attention .
" We get legal threats every day , or we used to , " said Peter Sunde , 28 , one of the site 's main workers .
" But we do n't have a problem with them — we 're just a search engine . "
Fredrik Neij , a 29 - year - old IT consultant , has a more prosaic view : " It 's nice to be noticed , " he smiled .
Chief among those angered by The Pirate Bay 's popularity is the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , which represents the US film studios .
It is waging war against the site , which it claims is costing billions in lost sales .
John Malcolm , executive vice - president of the MPAA , has railed against the trio , accusing them of cashing in on illegal activity .
" The bottom line is that the operators of The Pirate Bay , and others like them , are criminals who profit handsomely by facilitating the distribution of millions of copyrighted creative works , " he said .
Mr Sunde insists the site does not profit its founders , and money raised from advertising is used to cover expenses .
Instead , he says , the team make their money from a variety of side projects and day jobs .
Filesharing and illegal downloading has been a big issue for media companies since the late 1990s .
But while pioneering services such as Napster and Kazaa were closed down by the courts , the campaign against The Pirate Bay has failed to make a breakthrough .
The crux of the defence is that The Pirate Bay operates like any internet search engine : it points to downloads , rather than hosting any illegal content itself .
Under Swedish law this has so far made it immune to prosecution .
" I do n't like the word untouchable , but we feel pretty safe , " said Mr Sunde .
He thinks that European enmity towards the Bush administration has bolstered support .
" The US government is losing popularity every day in Europe , and people do n't want to see us give in to them . "
Their apparent invulnerability to prosecution has made them heroes of the internet piracy movement , but not everybody feels the same way .
" I certainly do n't see them as romantic pirates : it 's out and out theft , " says John Kennedy , chief executive of the international music industry body IFPI .
" It 's pure , ruthless greed — or total naivety . "
But the group 's supporters around the world say they are vexed with what they see as the " corruption " of the media industry .
" This is already happening — you cannot stop it , " says Magnus Eriksson of Piratbyran , the Swedish thinktank which helped start the website in 2003 .
" But the thing is that the people who download the most are also the ones who spend the most on buying media .
Media companies already know that they have to change . "
The pirates suspect the cam­paign against them is gathering pace .
Last year police raided the site and held Gottfried Svartholm , the third member of the group , for questioning .
No charges resulted , but the site was offline for two days .
Lately critics have focused on potential political links , including one German failed attempt to link the organisation with far - right extremists .
More recently Swedish police said they were considering blocking the website because of a tip - off that some pages linked to images of child abuse .
This , says Mr Sunde , was just an attempt to smear The Pirate Bay 's reputation .
" There were three files in question , but it turned out that none of them contained child porn , " he said .
The group is adamant it is just a search engine , but Mr Kennedy rejects any analogy with traditional internet businesses .
" When I sit down with Google they are prepared to talk about copyright issues , " he says .
" If I thought The Pirate Bay guys were doing something really new and clever , then we'd look at it — but there 's no evidence of that . "
Mr Sunde remains unmoved .
He says piracy is a way of life on the internet .
" I started off copying disks on my computer when I was eight or nine , " he said .
" You should never tell people where they can't go or what they can't do . "
· This article was amended on Monday September 17 2007 .
We said that The Pirate Bay website keeps an index of torrent files , pointing people in the direction of downloads " whether they are copyrighted or not " .
We should have said whether or not there are restrictions on their use .
Qwest CEO 's ' classified defense ' raises question on NSA surveillance Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 12 , 2007

This A former CEO who stood up to the Bush administration 's demands that he assist in the warrantless surveillance of Americans suggests in court documents that the National Security Agency withdrew a lucrative contract in retaliation for his refusal .
Documents released as part of Qwest CEO Joe Nacchio's insider trading trail also seem to indicate that the NSA was discussing the secretive , possibly illegal , surveillance of Americans several months before the 9/11 attacks President Bush used to justify the program .
The heavily redacted legal filings reveal the " classified defense " Nacchio was unable to present during his trial , and they outline a Feb. 27 , 2001 , meeting between the Qwest CEO and NSA officials to discuss a $ 100 million infrastructure project , and another topic .
Discussion of the second topic was blacked - out in released court documents , but observers believe the NSA could 've been discussing its program to compile a database of tens of millions of Americans ' phone records .
According to one of the documents , Nacchio traveled to NSA headquarters in Ft. Meade , Md. , to discuss the agency 's " Groundbreaker " project , which the NSA said was aimed at modernizing its technology infrastructure .
Another lawsuit against AT&T alleging its cooperation in the domestic call monitoring has linked the Groundbreaker program to a secret surveillance equipment a former AT&T employee said the NSA installed in the company 's headquarters .
In the Qwest documents , Nacchio 's lawyer says the company " was denied significant work , " including the " Groundbreaker " contract after the CEO objected to another topic discussed in that February , 2001 , meeting .
Nacchio and an associate " went into that meeting expecting to talk about the ' Groundbreaker ' project and came out of the meeting with optimism about the prospect for 2001 revenues from NSA , " attorney Herbert J. Stern , in Nacchio 's latest appeal to include the evidence .
" [ T ]he Court has prohibited Mr. Nacchio from eliciting testimony regarding what also occurred at that meeting , [ redacted ] , " Stern writes .
" The Court has also refused to allow Mr. Nacchio to demonstrate that the agency retaliated for this refusal by denying the Groundbreaker and perhaps other work to Qwest . "
Nacchio is appealing his conviction on 19 accounts of insider trading for $ 52 million of stock sales in April and May 2001 .
He was sentenced last spring to six years in prison , but he is free pending appeal .
Prosecutors argued that the CEO did not warn investors before he sold his stock that Qwest was unlikely to meet its revenue goals , but his defense team argued that he acted in good faith with investors because he expected that the secret contracts would come through .
Although the redacted documents do not say what the program was , several mentions are made to Nacchio 's belief that the NSA 's proposal was inappropriate and illegal , the Rocky Mountain News reports .
Prosecutors said the classified defense " would have been proven false , " according to the paper .
USA Today revealed last year that Qwest was the only phone company not to comply with the NSA 's request to compile phone records into a massive computer database , which it said was instituted only after 9/11 .
Stern said at the time that Nacchio had asked the NSA whether " a warrant or other legal process had been secured . "
Stern said Nacchio learned there was a " disinclination on the part of the authorities to use any legal process " and concluded that " the requests violated the privacy requirements of the Telecommunications Act . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People with a disorder in which they are convinced they are ugly have a brain glitch when processing things they see , researchers said on Monday .
The findings , published in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry , shed light on body dysmorphic disorder , marked by a dramatically distorted self - image and obsessive thoughts about imagined or minor defects in their appearance .
An estimated 1 to 2 percent of people around the world have this condition , also called BDD , according to Dr. Jamie Feusner , a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles who led the research .
Some undergo repeated cosmetic surgery procedures in a futile attempts to fix the problems .
The cause of the disorder remains unknown , with experts suspecting that a variety of factors may contribute , from genetics to upbringing .
People with BDD often think of themselves as ugly or disfigured and may obsess about physical traits or minor and imagined flaws even when assured by others they look fine .
About a quarter of people with BDD attempt suicide .
Feusner ’s team performed functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , brain scans on 12 people with the disorder as they viewed black - and - white images of other people ’s faces , and compared the results to those of people who do not have BDD .
They saw differences in how the right and left sides of the brain worked in people with BDD , but no actual structural differences in the brain .
“ This is the first time where there ’s evidence that there is kind of a biological abnormality that may be contributing to the symptoms -- the distorted body image -- in body dysmorphic disorder , ” Feusner said in a telephone interview .
All were shown three pictures : a black - and - white photo of a face with a neutral expression , a black - and - white blurry image of a face , and a black - and - white image looking like a detailed line drawing of a face .
The brain scans showed that the people with BDD relied much more heavily on their brain ’s left side than the right side .
“ The left side of the brain really is really specialized for doing more detailed and analytic process , whereas the right side of the brain processes more holistically and globally , ” Feusner said .
People with BDD tend to fixate on their face and head , although other body parts can be involved .
The disorder tends to run in families and appears in both men and women .
It is more common in people with obsessive - compulsive disorder .
“ It affects them so they often ca n’t leave their house or function very well at work ; they ca n’t have relationships because of this concern : usually they ’re thinking about their appearance in some way multiple hours a day , checking the mirror , looking into cosmetic procedures , ” Feusner said .
Feusner said one patient he knew had undergone five nose jobs .
Others get repeated breast augmentations or chin and cheek implants .
Feusner said one woman got so many procedures that “ she does n’t even look like a human being anymore . ”
And invariably they are dissatisfied with the surgery and can end up feeling even more hopeless afterward , he said .
Britain : Guantánamo detainee details years of torture
By Paul Mitchell
15 August 2007
A British resident , Omar Deghayes , detained at Guantánamo Bay as an alleged terrorist , reports that he has suffered years of torture , sexual abuse and death threats .
Last week , Omar ’s family released a dossier documenting his terrible ordeal , which he dictated to a lawyer visiting the United States - run military prison .
Deghayes , a lawyer , aged 37 and married with a five - year - old son , has been incarcerated at Guantánamo Bay for years with four other British residents — Saudi Arabian - born Shaker Aamer , Jordanian Jamil el Banna , Ethiopian Binyam Mohamed and Algerian Abdennour Sameur .
In addition to their physical and mental ordeals , all have found themselves in a Catch 22 nightmare .
Although granted refugee status , indefinite leave or exceptional leave to remain in the UK because of threats of mistreatment in their own countries , the Labour government ignored pleas to press for their release from detention on the grounds that they were not UK citizens .
At the same time , the US administration refused to negotiate their release with the countries of their birth .
Omar ’s family was granted political asylum in the UK following the arrest and execution in 1980 of his father , a Libyan trade union leader and political opponent of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi .
He grew up in Brighton and studied law in the UK in the hope of becoming a human rights lawyer .
Although the rest of his family are British citizens , Omar missed an interview because he was abroad and still has a Libyan passport , which means the Gaddafi regime is legally responsible for making diplomatic representations on his behalf .
In 2001 , Omar decided to look for work abroad , ending up in Afghanistan where he started a business exporting dried fruit , married his wife and had a son .
When the US invaded Afghanistan , the family attempted to return to the UK via Pakistan , but were arrested in Lahore in April 2002 , reportedly for a bounty of US $ 5,000 .
In Pakistan , Omar says he was told the US had ordered his detention .
Guards subjected him to “ systematic beatings , ” threatened to leave him in a room full of snakes and submerged him under water until he thought he was going to drown .
Faced with electric shock treatment , Omar explains , “ The more I scream they will laugh and do it again ... my screams all in vain . ”
Omar was returned to Afghanistan and the US - run prison at Bagram air base , which he likened to “ Nazi camps that I saw in films . ”
When asked by his lawyer about his treatment , Omar replied , “ Of course , beating and torture is considered normal [ there ] . ”
His captors subjected him to forced nudity , deprived him of food for 45 days and locked him in a box with very little air for long periods .
British intelligence agents are reported to have interrogated Omar up to seven times while he was in Bagram .
Omar claims the “ guards forced petrol and benzene up the anuses of prisoners .
This would burn horribly . ”
He said guards issued death threats and that he witnessed them shoot one prisoner who tried to help a detainee being abused and then beat another one to death .
“ One by the name of Abdaulmalik , Moroccan and Italian , was beaten until I heard no sound of him after the screaming .
“ There was afterwards panic in prison and the guards running about in fear saying to each other the Arab has died .
I have not seen this young man again . ”
Omar claims another detainee was beaten to a bloody pulp , leaving him “ paralysed and mentally damaged . ”
US authorities transferred Omar to Guantánamo Bay in September 2002 , where he alleges he was beaten on his first day .
He says guards sexually assaulted him and other detainees during a strip search .
And when he challenged them he was repeatedly pepper - sprayed .
One guard forced his finger into one of Omar ’s eyes , blinding him .
After an eight - month period of solitary confinement , Libyan intelligence agents interrogated Omar in September 2004 and threatened him with violence and death .
One allegedly said , “ You will be brought to judgement in Libya .
In here I can not do anything but if I meet you [ later ] I will kill you . ”
Omar claims his captors said he would not receive a proper trial and faced execution .
He says , “ Many times one FBI interrogator by the name of Craig said , ‘ Omar , it is nothing like the law you studied in the UK .
There will never be a proper court and lawyers , etcetera , it would be only a military tribunal to determine your future and your life .
Your best choice is to cooperate with me . ”
Omar ’s family protest his innocence and are campaigning for his release .
His brother Abubaker says , “ I cannot believe how the Americans can do this to him , and astonished how he could survive this . ”
His mother , Zohra Zewawi , added , “ I worry that something has happened to his mind .
He is being tortured .
I read his diary .
When he gets out I fear he will not be normal Omar .
I ’m sure he will have changed . ”
They say that although Omar ’s name is on the FBI ’s Most Wanted list , the accompanying picture taken from a training video of a Chechen separatist group looks nothing like him , a view supported by facial recognition experts .
Three Britons — Asef Iqbal , Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul — held for two years in Guantánamo Bay , and who published a 115 - page dossier accusing the US of carrying out mental and physical torture , were flown back to the UK in March 2004 and freed without charge .
In a similar development last week , Sandy Hodgkinson , US deputy assistant secretary of defence for detainee affairs , said that although the inmates were “ still considered to be of a significant threat , ” the US government would not insist on their arrest and imprisonment in Britain as a condition for transfer .
Hodgkinson ’s statement was prompted by a formal request sent by British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking for the release of the British residents .
He claimed the UK government had changed its mind because of recent steps taken by the US government to reduce the numbers of those detained at the camp , initiate a “ move towards ” its closure and “ include an increasing emphasis on engagement with third countries over the transfer and resettlement of those detained . ”
Clive Stafford Smith , a lawyer who represents the five men , greeted the UK government ’s decision to ask for the detainee ’s release , stating , “ This is good news for everyone , even George Bush .
For all his statements about wanting to close Guantanamo , he ca n’t if it ’s chock - a- block .
The Europeans have been pretty pious in their criticism , but done nothing to help close it until now .
This is a remarkable turn for the British government . ’’
The “ remarkable turn ” is not based on a change of conscience by Tony Blair ’s successor , Gordon Brown , a sudden discovery of democratic principles as the media proclaims .
For one thing , the High Court had instructed the Home Office to decide by last week whether one of the five detainees , Jamil el Banna , would be allowed to return to live in the UK after his release .
More importantly , after the lies used to launch the Iraq war , and the systematic undermining of civil liberties in the name of the war on terror under Blair , Brown has come to office lacking any popular support .
In addition , there is mounting international condemnation of Guantánamo Bay and its violation of the US constitution and international law .
A report released in April by Amnesty International describes “ deteriorating ” conditions at the prison camp and called for its immediate closure of the camp and the right of victims to pursue reparations in US courts .
In an affidavit submitted to the US Supreme Court in June , Army reserve officer Stephen Abraham became the first officer to openly criticise the Guantánamo Bay military tribunals where he served as a panel member .
Abraham ’s affidavit provides first - hand evidence that the tribunals are a travesty of justice in which personnel are poorly trained , information is withheld or misused and panel members are pressured to declare detainees guilty of being “ enemy combatants . ”
Chemists have created a collection of molecules that may have effects superior to marijuana .
They are hybrids of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the psychoactive ingredient in weed , and anandamide , the euphoria - causing chemical found in sea urchin eggs .
Researchers intend to use the hybrids as tools to better understand the endocannabinoid system , which partially controls pleasure and pain signals .
In the December issue of Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry , scientists from Organix , a small research and development firm , explained that THC and anandamide each have their own unique advantages and disadvantages .
Anandamide starts working faster than its marijuana - derived counterpart , but it is more quickly destroyed by the body .
A fusion of the two chemicals may last longer while maintaining an equal or stronger effect .
At the beginning of the project , organic chemists made a bunch of slightly different molecules that resembled both of their natural inspirations – THC and anandamide .
Once those chemicals had been synthesized , other researchers tested them on the proteins that are stimulated by marijuana .
Checking the effects of slight tweaks to the shape of a molecule is called SAR – a structure - activity relationship study .
Although the researchers at Organix did not comment on the recreational potential of their new chemicals , their SAR data makes it very clear that the new drugs push the same pleasure buttons as THC and anandamide .
Toward the end of the study , they gave the best experimental chemicals to mice .
Small amounts of the most potent molecule prevented them from pulling their tails away from a hot surface .
That test , called a tail - flick assay , showed that the new drug is a rather powerful painkiller .

Ara Howard has discovered that the ActiveRecord validation mechanism does not ensure data integrity .
1
Validations feel a bit like database constraints but it turns out they are really only useful for producing human friendly error messages .
This is because the assertions they define are tested by reading from the database before the changes are written to the database .
As you will no doubt recall , phantom reads are not prevented by any isolation mode other than serializable .
So unless you are running your database in serializable isolation mode ( and you are n’t because nobody does ) that means that the use of ActiveRecord validations setup a classic race condition .
On my work project we found this out the hard way .
The appearance of multiple records should have been blocked by the validations was a bit surprising .
In our case , the impacted models happened to be immutable so we only had to solve this from for the #find_or_create case .
We ended up reimplementing # find_or_create so that it does the following :
do a find 2 . if we found a matching record return the model object if it does not exist create a savepoint insert the record 4 . if the insert succeeds return the new model object if the insert failed roll back to the savepoint re-run the find and return the result
This approach does requires the use of database constraints but , having your data integrity constraints separated from the data model definition has always felt a bit awkward .
So I think this more of a feature than a bug .
It would be really nice if this behavior were included by default in ActiveRecord .
A similar approach could be used to remove the race conditions in regular creates and saves by simply detecting the insert or update failures and re-executing the validations .
This would not even require that the validations / constraints be duplicated .
The validations could , in most cases , be generated mechanically from the database constraints .
For example , DrySQL already does this .
Such an approach would provide the pretty error messages Rails users expect , neatly combined with the data integrity guarantees that users of modern databases expect .

Summary of Events Leading up to the Genocide
Although Armenians were second class citizens in the Ottoman Empire , they lived in relative harmony with Turks for centuries before the forces of nationalism transformed the situation .
Armenians were known as the " loyal group " .
During these times , although Armenians were not equal and had to put up with certain special hardships , taxes and second class citizenship , they were pretty well accepted and there was relatively little violent conflict .
Things began to change for a number of reasons .
Nationalism , a new force in the world , reared its head and made ethnic groupings self - conscious , and the Ottoman Empire began to crumble .
It became known as " the sick man of Europe " and the only thing holding it together was the European powers ' lack of agreement on how to split it up .
As other Christian minorities gained their independence one by one , the Armenians became more isolated as the only major Christian minority .
Armenians and Turks began to have conflicting dreams of the future .
Some Armenians began to call for independence like the Greeks and others had already received , while some Turks began to envision a new Pan - Turkic empire spreading all the way to Turkic speaking parts of Central Asia .
Armenians were the only ethnic group in between these two major pockets of Turkish speakers and the nationalist Turks wanted to get rid of them altogether .
As European powers began to ask for assurances that Armenians receive better treatment , the government began to treat the Armenians worse and worse .
From 1894 - 6 hundreds of thousands of Armenians died in the Hamidian Massacres ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid II .
A coup by ' progressive ' Young Turks in 1908 replacing the Sultans government was supported by Armenians .
Unfortunately , promised reforms never came , and in fact a triumvirate of extreme Turkish nationalists took complete dictatorial control , Enver , Jemal and Talat .
It was they who masterminded the plan to completely eradicate the Armenian race in a step towards fulfilling their pan-Turkic dreams .
The Turkish massacres of Armenians in 1894 , 1895 , 1896 , and 1909 were still fresh in their minds . [ 1 ]

One gave the Young Turk government the cover and the excuse to carry out their plan .
The plan was simple and its goal was clear .
On April 24th 1915 , commemorated worldwide by Armenians as Genocide Memorial Day , hundreds of Armenian leaders were murdered in Istanbul after being summoned and gathered .
The now leaderless Armenian people were to follow .
Across the Ottoman Empire ( with the exception of Constantinople , presumably due to a large foreign presence ) , the same events transpired from village to village , from province to province .
The remarkable thing about the following events is the virtually complete cooperation of the Armenians .
For a number of reasons they did not know what was planned for them and went along with " their " government 's plan to " relocate them for their own good . "
First , the Armenians were asked to turn in hunting weapons for the war effort .
Communities were often given quotas and would have to buy additional weapons from Turks to meet their quota .
Later , the government would claim these weapons were proof that Armenians were about to rebel .
The able bodied men were then " drafted " to help in the wartime effort .
These men were either immediately killed or were worked to death .
Now the villages and towns , with only women , children , and elderly left were systematically emptied .
The remaining residents would be told to gather for a temporary relocation and to only bring what they could carry .
The Armenians again obediently followed instructions and were " escorted " by Turkish Gendarmes in death marches .
The death marches led across Anatolia , and the purpose was clear .
The Armenians were raped , starved , dehydrated , murdered , and kidnapped along the way .
The Turkish Gendarmes either led these atrocities or turned a blind eye .
Their eventual destination for resettlement was just as telling in revealing the Turkish governments goal : the Syrian Desert , Der Zor .
Those who miraculously survived the march would arrive to this bleak desert only to be killed upon arrival or to somehow survive until a way to escape the empire was found .
Usually those that survived and escaped received assistance from those who have come to be known as " good Turks , " from foreign missionaries who recorded much of these events and from Arabs .
After The Genocide
After the war ended , the Turkish government held criminal trials and found the triumvirate guilty in abstentia .
All three were later executed by Armenians .
Turkey agreed to let the US draw the border between the newly born Republic of Armenia and the Turkish government .
What is now called Wilsonian Armenia included most of the six western Ottoman provinces as well as a large coastline on the Black Sea .
Cilicia , a separate Armenian region on the Mediterranean , was to be a French mandate .
Mustafa Kemal 's forces pushed the newly returned Armenian refugees and forces from these lands and forced a new treaty to be written which was an insult to Armenian victims .
They were basically told never to return and that they would never receive compensation .
The Kars and Ardahan provinces of Armenia were taken as well in an agreement with the Soviet Union .
Contemporary Events
On the 50th anniversary of the genocide , the scattered survivors of the genocide and their children around the world began commemorating the genocide on April 24th , the day which marked the start of the full - scale massacres in 1915 .
Many Armenian Genocide Monuments have been built around the world since , as well as smaller plaques and dedications .
The Turkish government has in the past few decades been denying that a genocide ever occurred and spending millions of dollars to further that view .
This is adding insult to injury and will cause bad feelings to continue much longer than would otherwise be the case between the peoples .
Those who say forget about it , it is in the past , are wrong .
Unless crimes like this are faced up to and compensated for , they will be committed again and again by people who do not fear prosecution or justice .
Read what Hitler said before beginning the Jewish Holocaust here .
A class action suit against New York Life insurance company by genocide survivors was filed in 1999 .
They were sued for not being forthcoming in paying up for policies of those killed in the genocide .
The suit was settled in 2004 for $ 20 million , and payouts began to individuals and some Armenian charitable organizations .
A 2002 study by the International Center for Transitional Justice ( ICTJ ) , a New York - based human rights organization , ruled that the slaughter of some 1.5 million Armenians fits into the internationally accepted definition of genocide .
The study was commissioned by TARC - a group of Armenians and Turks set up by the US State Department .

BAGHDAD , Nov. 7 — American forces have routed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , the Iraqi militant network , from every neighborhood of Baghdad , a top American general said today , allowing American troops involved in the “ surge ” to depart as planned .
Maj . Gen. Joseph F. Fil Jr. , commander of United States forces in Baghdad , also said that American troops had yet to clear some 13 percent of the city , including Sadr City and several other areas controlled by Shiite militias .
But , he said , “ there ’s just no question ” that violence had declined since a spike in June .
“ Murder victims are down 80 percent from where they were at the peak , ” and attacks involving improvised bombs are down 70 percent , he said .
General Fil attributed the decline to improvements in the Iraqi security forces , a cease - fire ordered by the Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr , the disruption of financing for insurgents , and , most significant , Iraqis ’ rejection of “ the rule of the gun . ”

The other bloggers here are professional , political , and know how to write fascinating historical narrative .
I wanted to inaugurate my work here with an important diary first written back in September 2006 , but just as timely today .
I first published this piece over at Daily Kos .
Ostensibly a book review , it describes the participation of psychologists and psychiatrists in the construction of the U.S. government 's torture program when it was in its formative years ( the 1950s / 1960s ) .
The book is The Manipulation of Human Behavior ( MHB ) , edited by Albert Biderman and Herbert Zimmer .
I wo n't preempt the article below by a detailed description , but MHB has a series of essays that details the fundamentals of psychological torture , as researched by CIA and military psychologists and psychiatrists .
I continue to cover this subject , as this recent essay over at my blog Invictus demonstrates , but the essay here is special in introducing a rare historical look at how the massive governmental mind control program worked .
When I first wrote this essay , MHB was an out - of - print book difficult to obtain .
In the months since , it went on - line and and can be viewed at Internet Archive : Open Source Books .
Enjoy .
Frankenstein's Children : Modern Torture 's Scientific Bible ( reposted from September 2006 )
What if there was a book that dispassionately looked at the history and methodology of torture ?
What if this book looked at human physiology and psychology and tried to scientifically establish how to best break another human being and bend him or her to your will ?
What if this book were written by top behavioral scientists and published in the United States ?
And , finally , what if the studies published in this book were financed by the U.S. government ?
Look no farther , there is , or rather was , such a book .
Published in 1961 by John Wiley & Sons , The Manipulation of Human Behavior was edited by psychologists Albert D. Biderman and Herbert Zimmer .
This book , unfortunately , cannot be found online , nor was a second edition or printing ever made ( not surprisingly ) .
But I will provide a review here , and an introduction into the nightmare world of science , torture , and politics that helped shape our modern world and today 's news .
This book represents a critical examination of some of the conjectures about the application of scientific knowledge to the manipulation of human behavior .
The problem is explored within a particular frame of reference : the interrogation of an unwilling subject ....
Much of the work in this book was sponsored by the U.S. Air Force ...( p. 1 ) Albert Biderman had researched the so - called brainwashing of American POWs during the Korean War .
He worked as Principal Investigator of an Air Force Office of Scientific Research contract studying stresses associated with captivity .
Biderman was also Senior Research Associate at the Bureau of Social Science Research .
... the U.S. Air Force provided at least half of the budget of the Bureau of Social Science Research in the 1950s .
Military contracts supported studies at this Bureau such as the vulnerabilities of Eastern European peoples for the purposes of psychological warfare and comparisons of the effectiveness of " drugs , electroshock , violence , and other coercive techniques during interrogation of prisoners . " ( from a review of Chistopher Simpson 's Science of Coercion : Communication Research and Psychological Warfare , 1945 - 1960 )
His associate , Herbert Zimmer , was an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Georgetown University , and also worked at times as a consultant for the Air Force Office of Scientific Research .
When you read their book , The Manipulation of Human Behavior ( MHB ) , the various essays by other authors include statements crediting research to grants from the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology and the Office of Naval Research .
The titles of the book 's essays are bone - chilling in their scientific bland exactitude .
Here they are , with authors , for the record : 1 . The Physiological State of the Interrogation Subject as it Affects Brain Function , by Lawrence E. Hinkle , Jr. , Assoc . Professor of Clinical Medicine in Psychiatry , New York Hospital
[ I have come to see over the past months of research that this essay by Hinkle is often referenced , and is key in understanding later methods of psychological and modern torture . ]
2 . The Effects of Reduced Environmental Stimulation on Human Behavior : A Review , by Phillip E. Kubazansky , Chief Psychologist , Boston City Hospital 3 .
The Use of Drugs in Interrogation , by Louis A. Gottschalk , Assoc. Professor of Psychiatry and Research Coordinator , Cincinnati General Hospital
And because you probably can't wait , and to juice up this account , I 'll admit , yes , this is the chapter that goes into LSD , mescaline use and all that .
Gottschalk found enough data in the research literature to find that LSD - 25 might have " possible applications ... to interrogation techniques " .
The conclusions reached on mescaline hold equally for the possible applications of this drug to interrogation .
As a tool in the advancement of knowledge of psychopharmacology , LSD - 25 is a drug on which clinical and experimental research is likely to continue .
( pp. 123-124 ) Likely to continue ... "
An ironic understatement ?
4 . Physiological Responses as a Means of Evaluating Information , by R. C. Davis , Professor of Psychology , Indiana University 5 . The Potential Uses of Hypnosis in Interrogation , by Martin T. Orne , Teaching Fellow , Department of Psychiatry , Harvard University Medical School An aside : Some of you may recognize Martin Orne as the psychiatrist of the famous poet Anne Sexton , who in the early 1990s released the tapes of her psychotherapy sessions with him to a biographer , precipitating a storm of controversy .
6 . The Experimental Investigation of Interpersonal Influence , by Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton , Professor of Psychology , University of Texas , and Social Science Research Associate , University of Texas , respectively 7 .
Countermanipulation Through Malingering , by Malcolm L. Meltzer , Staff Psychologist , District of Columbia General Hospital
Six of the essay contributors were psychologists ; two were psychiatrists .
Cui bono ?
I cannot give a full review here of all the research and conclusions derived herein .
The significance of the book itself is hard to gauge , because nothing of its like was ever published again .
We can assume that the government agencies that financed the research passed along the results to those who could use it .
Biderman himself in his introduction to MHB put it this way :
In assuming the attitude of the " hard - headed " scientist toward the problem , there is a danger in falling into an equivalent misuse of science ....
The conclusions reached do in fact show that many developments can compound tremendously the already almost insuperable difficulties confronting the individual who seeks to resist an interrogator unrestrained by moral or legal scruples ....
Several scientists have reported on the possible applications of scientific knowledge that might be made by the most callous interrogator or power .
The results of their thinking are available here for anyone to use , including the unscrupulous .
( pp. 6 , 9 ) ( emphasis mine )
Spine feeling the shivers yet ?
When I first read the above , I thought I had stumbled into a fascist nightmare out of Robert Jay Lifton 's The Nazi Doctors .
But then , I read on :
The alternative is to confer on the would - be interrogator a monopoly of knowledge by default .
His success , as the various chapters of this book illustrate , depends heavily on the ignorance of his victims .
[ B. F. ]
Skinner has argued that those who are most concerned with restricting the vulnerability of men to control others have the most to gain from a clear understanding of the techniques employed .
( p. 9 ) Was Biderman saying that publishing this material publicly was an oblique attempt to expose what was going on ?
Was there a twinge of guilt in these men and women , working for the military under the guise of medical and university establishments ?
I do n't know .
But Biderman had a few other psychological observations about torture worth quoting ( and think about President Bush as you read this , as he said the other day that he has spent a significant amount of time studying the issue of interrogations , torture , etc. ) :
The profound fascination of the topic under consideration may stem from the primitive , unconscious , and extreme responses to these problems , which gain expression in myth , dreams , drama , and literature .
On the one hand , there is the dream - wish for omnipotence , on the other , the wish and fear of the loss of self through its capture by another .
The current interest in problems of manipulation of behavior involves basic ambivalence over omnipotence and dependency , which , if projected , find a ready target in the " omniscient " scientist ....
Conjectures concerning the prospects of " total annihilation of the human will " appear almost as frequently as those regarding the threat of mankind 's total destruction by thermonuclear of similar weapons .....
Viewing the problem in magical or diabolical terms is not an altogether irrational analogy , given the existence of those who simultaneously practice and seek perfection of the means for controlling behavior and conceive their efforts as directed toward
" possessing the will " of their victims ....
Thus , magical thinking and projections , as has been indicated , pervade prevalent judgments regarding the significance of the behavioral alterations that interrogators can effect .
( pp. 4 - 6 ) No matter whatever qualms these researchers had , they were sure of two things : " that some potentialities of interrogation have been overestimated " , particularly those that relied on old methods ( extreme violence ) ; and There is no question that it is possible for men to alter , impair , or even to destroy the effective psychological functioning of others over whom they exercise power .
( p. 10 ) The problem for the torturers , though , was the " elicitation of guarded factual information " .
For this , something more scientific was needed , something better than the old , unreliable techniques . --
In many ways , the disputes over interrogation now embroiling Washington are about the utility of methods , with Bush and Rumsfeld and Cheney representing the old ( omnipotence - craving ) school , and McCain , Powell , and the military representing those who understand that psychological manipulation ( often amounting to torture itself ) gets them what they want , without the international treaty entanglements .
The CIA is itself split within by a similar two wings .
The Experiments
The basic conclusions of the authors of MHB is that drug and hypnosis in interrogations is often not useful , and that while deserving more study ( from their 1961 standpoint ) , the most promising research was in the area of sensory deprivation and a study of personality and identity formation and interpersonal methods of control .
More than one MHB author pointed to the work of Donald O. Hebb , McGill University , also a President of the American Psychological Association , whose 1954 presidential address to the APA , Drives and the Conceptual Nervous System , is considered a classic psychology text .
Hebb focused on the effects of isolation and sensory deprivation upon the human organism .
Such isolation , in combination with sleep deprivation and self - induced fatigue ( through stress positions , etc. ) formed the new torture paradigm , producing what they called " disordered brain syndrome . "
From Hinkle 's chapter :
The experiments of Hebb and others ... who have concerned themselves with " sensory deprivation , " have consisted of putting men into situations where they received no patterned input from their eyes and ears , and as little patterned input as possible from their skin receptors ....
The subjects were deprived of opportunity for purposeful activity .
All of their bodily needs were taken care of -- food , fluids , rest , etc .
Yet after a few hours the mental capacities of the participants began to go awry .
( pp. 28 - 29 ) Alfred McCoy , author of A Question of Torture : CIA Interrogation from the Cold War to the War on Terror , and Professor of History at University of Wisconsin , Madison , gave an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Company , linking the torture of David Hicks in Guantanamo prison with the CIA - researched , Hebbsian torture paradigm MHB explores .
Dr Donald O. Hebb at McGill University found that he could induce a state akin to psychosis in a subject within 48 hours .
Now , what had the doctor done ?
Hypnosis , electroshock , LSD , drugs ?
No .
None of the above .
All Dr Hebb did was take student volunteers at McGill University where he was head of Psychology , put them in comfortable airconditioned cubicles and put goggles , gloves and ear muffs on them .
In 24 hours the hallucinations started .
In 48 hours they suffered a complete breakdown .
Dr. Hebb noted they suffered a disintegration of personality .
Just goggles , gloves and ear muffs and this discovered the foundation , or the key technique which has been applied under extreme conditions at Guantanamo .
The technique of sensory disorientation .
I 've tracked down some of the original subjects in Dr Hebb 's experiments of 1952 and men now in their 70s still suffer psychological damage from just two days of isolation with goggles , gloves and ear muffs .
David Hicks was subjected at peak to 244 days of isolation , the most extreme isolation in the 50 - year history of these CIA psychological torture techniques .
David Hicks has suffered untold psychological damage that will take a great deal of care , a great deal of treatment and probably the rest of his life to move beyond .
Kubazansky , 45 years before Prof. McCoy spoke on Australian TV , more dryly summarized the effects of isolation and sensory deprivation in his MHB essay :
The boredom , restlessness , irritability , and other mood changes observed also may well apply .
The stimulus - hunger and increased suggestibility which have been observed may make an individual more vulnerable to revealing information he might otherwise withhold , particularly when accompanied by the social uncertainty induced in the interrogation situation .
Unprepared for these consequences of isolation and deprivation , like many experimental subjects , an individual may become apprehensive and indeed panicked by his reactions .
The appearance of hallucinatory - like phenomena and their emotional accompaniments have often been quite anxiety provoking .
( p. 90 ) Then Kubazansky gave some unsolicited advice for those who could , very unfortunately , find themselves in such tortuous circumstances :
Knowledge of the importance of retaining spatial and time orientation , and self - stimulation in concrete tasks , are two examples of techniques for reducing stress by increasing psychological structure .
( p. 90 ) There is so much more I could write here , but I 'm aware this diary has already approached the limits of most people 's attention , at least to material presented in this format .
I hope that in providing this information I am providing a public service by widening our knowledge of the history of the subject , by showing the breadth and depth of the subject , and giving substance to the sometimes trivial or cursory examination of the issues that drive the most important political battles of our day .
If this diary gets an appropriate response , and there is demand , I 'll take up a second diary in the future examining the research from the rest of the book .

It is clear that the US media moguls would have us believe that the catastrophic invasion and occupation of Iraq was a sincere effort to promote freedom and democracy in the Middle East , gone awry .
But we must remember that everything associated with capitalism is about marketing : making the people believe that things and events are the opposite of what they really are , and creating artificial wants that neither benefit the individual nor society , while simultaneously embellishing corporate profits .
This understanding would have been equally evident in the mainstream mediaâ€™s buildup to the war had we a less propagandized , better read , and more informed citizenry .
Even the politically naÃ¯ve should have known that Saddam Husseinâ€™s threat to the US , so vividly hyped in the media , was pure marketing propaganda .
But the majority of the people bought it , and now we have no choice but to live with our purchase .
Short of a major social upheaval , we are going to be in Iraq for a very long time , and the death toll will continue to rise , especially for the Iraqisâ € ” the unwilling recipients of our corporate benevolence delivered through carpet bombs , terror , and torture .
For these are the undeniable legacy of our foreign policies , and the illegal , amoral , acquisition of property by blunt force trauma .
If we are to survive as a republic , we must appreciate that capitalism and its cousin , global corporatismâ€ ” not Saddam Hussein , not Communism or Socialism , nor Islamic terrorists , are the greatest threats to democracy .
Zionism and Christian fundamentalism , which attempt to provide the flimsy moral basis for our Middle East policy , also pose significant obstacles to world peace by denying justice to others and promoting ethnic cleansing .
It is beguiling that we have yet to learn this fundamental lesson , that we know so little about our own history , and the role that mass ignorance plays in determining the future .
The narcotic of state sponsored propaganda has a powerful and hypnotic effect on our collective senses , and it is rending asunder the fabric of what is supposed to be a free and civil society .
We believe what we are told and accept what we are given , without demanding truth , justice or accountability .
It is imperative for the purveyors of war to maintain a cloak of secrecy and a faÃ§ade of public support where , if the truth were known , none would exist .
It is necessary to keep the truth concealed in order to throw the public off the scent of the corruption that is the guiding principle of corporate governance and plutocracy , fomented by morally bankrupt men and women ; a system that causes irreparable harm and suffering to its innocent victims and then profits from the misery and suffering it inflicts .
These days it is popular to describe the events occurring in Iraq as the result of incompetence , mismanagement , miscalculation , and benevolent bungling ; to characterize them as a well intentioned mistake on the road to freedom and democracy , rather than the moral abomination they are .
What we have in Iraq is not the result of any of these phenomena .
It is the intended consequence of cold calculation to bomb Iraq into submission , to thoroughly disorient its people , and to apply economic shock therapy before they can recognize what is being done to them .
The intent is to invade sovereign nations either militarily , economically , or both ; and to force unbridled capitalism on them .
This means , of course , that we must first overthrow the existing governmentsâ€ ” many of them democracies , and replace them with ruthless dictatorships willing to betray their own people , and amenable to opening up their countries to corporate exploitation and privatization .
So called free market capitalism requires corrupt leadership on the receiving end that is willing to accept bribes while becoming a puppet to the US .
This is how some of the must brutal regimes in the world came into power .
Corporate America is always beating the drums of war in search of profits and ever increasing shares of the worldâ€™s markets .
Enough is never enoughâ € ” they want it all .
Aside from overthrowing popularly elected governments , the unspoken objective of mature capitalism , guided by the doctrine of economic shock therapy , is to turn once sovereign nations into totally deregulated corporate states , answerable to no one .
This objective will be accomplished by privatizing the nationalized infrastructure , inviting in foreign investors , removing tariffs that protect local business and cooperatives from predatory multinational corporations , and downsizing the workforce ; by eliminating social spending , and removing all forms of corporate controls .
In short , by conducting a fire sale of each nationâ€™s stolen assets and auctioning them off at bargain basement prices to wealthy multinational investors .
The intent is to create an unfettered corporate state in which the market , driven solely by profit , is the final arbiter of all things ; an Orwellian world in which human rights , labor laws , environmental protections , and social justice do not even exist , much less enter into market equations .
Aided by the World Bank and the IMF , we are rapidly arriving at a state of global corporate fascismâ € ” the free market reform of manic capitalism , greed on steroids ; a horrible economic monster unleashed upon unsuspecting people the world over , masquerading as democracy and free trade .
And it is occurring in blatant contradiction to everything that is free , decent , and fair ; a monstrosity utterly devoid of humanity and empathy for those struggling to survive .
But behind the marketing faÃ§ade of a beneficent capitalism that is more oxymoronic than real , the skeleton of Reaganism , free marketry , and trickle down economics is exposed for all to see .
We are witnessing naked greed unleashed upon the world like a swarm of locusts the size of North America .
The fabulously wealthy are realizing obscene profits , while the majority of the worldâ€™s people are forced into economic servitude , many of them living in abject poverty , scratching out a bleak existence on sweatshop wages under horrendous conditions .
Economic slavery and burdensome debt , not freedom and democracy , is what we are imposing upon Iraq , aided by the most powerful military in history and , all too often , with the blessings of an oblivious and propagandized citizenry .
Aside from the fierce resistance to the occupation , the US is achieving all of its major objectives in Iraq .
Like flies circling piles of stinking excrement , the lords of unfettered capitalism are buzzing around the bloated corpse of what is left of the world .
And they have no intentions of stopping at Iraq .
Iran and Syria are waiting in the wings : war that will not end in our lifetime .
If the world were as enamored with capitalism as its adherents proclaim , there would be no need to masquerade it as anything other than what it isâ€ ” economic self interest for the privileged , driven by insatiable greed , funded by the public treasure .
There would be no need to impose it on the world through high tech militarism and occupation , preceded by elaborate propagandistic media blitzes and tricks .
All people would seek it out , as they seek water to slake their thirst and nourishment for their bodies .
So we must ask ourselves :
When has it ever been in the pubic interest to over feed the rich and starve the poor ?
When has it ever been in the public interest to destroy the earth for the sake of profits ?
When has it ever been in the public interest to promote war and injustice over peace and shared prosperity ?
Just people everywhere must resist evil or run the risk of being complicit in it .
Neutrality , indifference and apathy , are untenable responses to what is being done in our name .
Somehow , we must awaken from this media induced cultural stupor .
We must do so under the prying eyes of government and private security contractors who are protecting corporate investors from democracy , and from people like us .
Each of us is being diminished just as the Declaration of Independence states : â€œharass our people and eat out their substance.â€ 
Every citizen is faced with a simple choice : organize or perish .
The storm clouds of World War Three are looming on the horizon .
These are extraordinary times that demand something from every one of us .

HISD officer fired over ` Ghetto Handbook ' HISD officer fired over booklet
Report says gang investigator put out ' ebonics ' pamphlet to get back at a boss
A 34 - year - old Houston Independent School District police officer was fired this week for creating and distributing a " Ghetto Handbook " to fellow police officers at a roll call meeting last spring , according to a report released Friday .
Roby Morris , a gang investigator who 's worked for HISD since 1999 , was placed on paid leave in late August for handing out an eight - page pamphlet with " ebonics " definitions — something he told district investigators he did to get back at one of his bosses .
He explained that he is married to a black woman and that together they have three biracial children , according to the report on the investigation .
But HISD officials said that does n't excuse the offensive publication .
" This incident represents an egregious violation of our standards of conduct and decency , " spokesman Terry Abbott said .
" HISD condemns it in the strongest possible terms . "
Morris , who was slated to earn $ 40,748 this year , could n't be reached for comment Friday .
About a dozen employees received a copy of the pamphlet — subtitled " Wucha dun din now " — at a May 23 roll call meeting at Barnett Stadium .
The document tells officers that learning the definitions will allow them to speak " as if you just came out of the hood . "
Six officers ' names are listed as having contributed to the booklet , but the investigation showed that Morris was the lone participant .
The report also said that Morris ' supervisors spoke to him shortly after the incident and issued a written reprimand in June .
But the follow - up was limited , the report concludes , and Superintendent Abelardo Saavedra was n't told about the incident until mid-August .
HISD trustee Larry Marshall said he hopes the district can move forward from the incident , which he said drew unflattering attention from media across the county .
" It 's been an embarrassment , " he said .
" To even discuss that kind of issue in these times is very troubling .
We can do better . "
But some activists said they do n't plan to let the issue rest .
They plan to push HISD to take action against Morris ' supervisors , including the police chief , for not issuing a harsher punishment in the spring .
" He should not be the only one losing his job , " activist Quanell X said .
" There should be others in the unemployment line with him . "

10 Simple Ways To Save Money And The Environment
This piece shares some simple ways to save money and the environment .
This is part of Blog Action Day , an online event that unites together our thoughts on the environment .
Sometimes , I wonder what our world would be like without us in it — a provocative thought experiment that I ’ve conjured more out of curiosity than anything else .
Without the human race and our impact on the atmosphere and our environment , would nature rejoice ?
A lot has been covered on this topic , including this interesting interactive graphic that illustrates a timeline for the world once it is left to its own devices .
Environmental pollution is prevalent in many places ( I ’ve lived in a few ) and a lot of it is due to a lack of awareness or concern for these issues .
But there are steps we can take to become more aware and to help conserve the world ’s resources .
Some ideas may be tougher to achieve , but there are small adjustments we can definitely make to help the environment rejoice even with us walking the Earth .
Even at this time , I know there are certain changes that may not be entirely practical to commit to , but I also see some simpler things that can be achieved with no trouble at all .
Here are my own tips that I ’ve written about or found around the blogosphere that I hope can be helpful towards conserving our budget , as well as towards preserving the environment .
Simple Ways To Save Money and The Environment
Here are some methods to go green while keeping more of the green in your pocket !
# 1 Stop receiving junk mail
Junk mail is such a nuisance .
I spend a couple of hours each week just to sort through them and shred them afterward .
I ’ve been swimming in them since time immemorial thinking I could n’t do anything about it .
But actually we all can fix this problem by following these Smart Money tips .
The easiest change is just to get your name delisted from a number of junk mail sources .
To get you going , think of these statistics :
The average American receives 11 pieces of unsolicited junk mail each week , according to the Center for a New American Dream , a nonprofit dedicated to promoting responsible consumerism .
Tallied up , that bulk accounts for 100 million trees lost each year .
By reducing the amount of junk mail you receive each year , you personally will save two trees and prevent some 92 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the air .
# 2 Go paperless .
There are so many benefits from going paperless , mainly by signing up for online services .
Your information will be more secure , you ’ll save a lot of paper and help businesses cut down on the costs of mailings .
Imagine having to get rid of an extra filing cabinet or two at home !
# 3 Telecommute .
If only all our work places and offices allowed us to work at home more often .
During this age of outsourcing , you ’d think this mentality of conducting work remotely would be more widespread .
We ’ve certainly made strides in the direction of workplace flexibility , but it ’s still not enough in my opinion .
I live about an hour away from where I work and not only is commuting a huge drain to my energy and pocket , it ’s also a gas guzzler .
With one day a week telecommuting privileges , I could save a tank of gas and $ 50 each month .
# 4 Use mass transit , try car pools or rethink your mode of transportation .
Consider mass transportation if you have access to trains and subways .
In my experience , it has been more inefficient time - wise to ride the trains , but not entirely so if you can somehow manage to do some work while on board or even just get some shut - eye .
I ’ve also seen some car pooling services and spots around the city .
How about a bike ?
Not so sure how ready we are with this sort of thing .
However , we can participate in our local city ’s Spare The Air programs , including the act of keeping our cars well - tuned , maintained and smog free .
# 5 Turn everything off when not in use .
One of the simplest tips to follow — turn off all your lights and anything that feeds off of electricity while not in use .
But see here , the holiday season will soon be upon us so how do we enjoy our Halloween and Christmas lights ?
With new energy efficient holiday lighting of course .
# 6 Replace less often
How about consuming less and conserving more ?
You can try to make things last longer such as soap , cleaning materials , clothes .
By using less than the suggested amounts , you wo n’t need to replace things as frequently .
# 7 Buy used .
Just recently , we got ourselves some well - made , used furniture from Craigslist .
We ’ve also sold many items through the online classifieds such as hardly used clothing , collectibles , electronic items , furniture and even a car !
We ’ve also picked up great bargains on unique , hard - to - find art pieces , beautiful tapestries and home decorations that we ’re quite proud of through eBay , our local flea markets , estate sales and home consignment centers .
# 8 Do n’t throw away leftovers !
I do n’t have any qualms about dining on leftovers but it can certainly be unexciting to one ’s palate after a while .
So instead , we ’ve recooked and recycled older meals into newer ones when we are able .
And when we do , we usually find those secondary dishes tasting pretty good !
# 9 Consider energy efficient alternatives .
There are energy - efficient light bulbs out there which we ’re already using and already , we ’re seeing a difference .
We ’ve also just replaced our old fridge with one that has more space but more importantly , has a water filter built in .
Thanks to this nice new refrigerator , we no longer purchase water in those plastic gallon containers .
# 10 Plant trees and other foliage
I ’ve written about my love affair with trees before .
Because I used to live in a suburb where soil had a high water table due to being on landfill , there were n’t too many trees to shield and insulate us from the weather during those days .
But we ’ve moved to an older neighborhood since , located by the woods , and it ’s much easier to grow trees .
New plants and trees have added to our environment but have also helped us receive weather insulation from our surroundings , which allows us less need to turn on the thermostat .
-ooOoo -
The above list is comprised of simpler tips , but if you ’re willing to make a serious change or a lifestyle decision , why not look into living in a smaller home ?
Or even join a community focused on simpler living .
Many of these moves can bring down your maintenance costs and exert less demand on our environment at the same time .

House committee hits RNC with e-mail subpoena , threatens Miers with contempt Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This After former White House Counsel Harriet Miers failed to attend a Thursday hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on the firing of 8 US Attorneys , House Democrats issued a subpoena for e-mail accounts supplied by the Republican National Committee and used by senior White House staff .
The committee 's chairman , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) also explicitly warned Miers that she may face criminal contempt charges for failing to comply with earlier subpoenas " The White House has been stonewalling this investigation at every turn , " said Rep.
Conyers in a statement .
" [ W ]e hope that the RNC - unlike Ms. Miers yesterday - will choose to comply with the legal obligation set out in this subpoena , as opposed to the opinion of the White House . "
Conyers also warned Miers through her attorney that she could face a criminal contempt citation for failing to appear before the House Committee in a separate letter .
" This letter is to formally notify you that we must insist on compliance with the subpoena , and that your client 's continued failure to promptly remedy her noncompliance could subject her to contempt proceedings , " he wrote to George T. Manning of the Jones Day law firm .
He went on to set the deadline for compliance at 5 PM on July 17 .
" If I do not hear from you in the affirmative by then , the Committee will have no choice but to consider appropriate recourse , " he stated .
Conyers ' subpoena offered further details of the document sought by the Judiciary Committee , also with a deadline of July 17 .
" [ T ]he RNC has identified , collected , and processed what I understand to be a substantial number of e-mail documents relevant to our investigation , " he notes .
" As I understand the circumstances , these documents are ready and available for production , and it is for this reason that I am comfortable issuing a subpoena with this relatively prompt return date . "
I have about 20 minutes to give my initial impressions on the new Digg profile redesign but have arrived at my conclusion : it sucks .
A few things come to mind based on everything I ’ve used Digg for in the past :
Digg took a step backwards in social news and took a step forward on social superfluity .
Digg is now letting you send shout outs to your friends but does n’t emphasize the initial foundation upon which the site was created : Digg is a social news site .
I already turned off shouts ; I use Digg for news .
Not for Facebook - Myspace - Yahoo !
Mash - like social networks .
Merging the two when there ’s already too much of it in the open is totally unnecessary .
Where did the descriptions go ?
Now , I ca n’t see descriptions of the stories I ’ve submitted nor can I see descriptions of stories that my friends have submitted .
Since most of us use descriptions from the article text itself , it ’s rather pointless to remove story descriptions because now I cannot easily discern if I ’ve read the story or not before .
Digg just killed usability .
Now , when I go to my friends ’ submitted page , I ca n’t Digg their stories .
I have to click on the link , a link that takes me to the original Digg submission page ( which includes the description that is so prominently missing in concern # 2 ) and then I have to click on the story to read the content .
What happened to making Digg usable ?
Why should I have to add unnecessary clicks to improve my Digg experience ?
And if you tell me it ’s because you ’re forcing me to read comments , what if the submission has no comments yet ?
I ’m not befriending users “ just because ” — I befriend users based on similar interests .
And now it ’s difficult to agree with my friends ’ submissions which totally kills the experience .
Overall , I think this is a step backwards to making Digg what it was before : a social news site .
It has become a place like Facebook where sharing stories has become secondary .
We do n’t need another Facebook .
Digg was once unique , but not anymore .
Halloween is still a month away , but the costumes are already out in full force outside major league baseball clubhouses .
And that , of course , means we 're deep in the thick of rookie hazing , a time - honored MLB rite of passage in which rookies -- from the lowliest September call - ups to international stars like Dice - K -- are forced to dress up ( or down , as the case might be ) .
The stunt is usually executed right before the last road trip of the year , so the rooks have to wear their costumes while hauling their luggage out to the team bus , at the airport ( bonus points for teams going to or from Toronto , since the rooks will have to go through customs ) , and on the plane .
Just about every team gets in on the hazing routine , but it's the Yankees -- their commitment to excellence extending to every corner of the game -- who 've set the highest standard in recent years .
In 2005 , the rookies wore cheerleader outfits , and last year the players had to dress up as George Steinbrenner .
This year , they went for a " Wizard of Oz " theme ( gleefully documented with dozens of photos here ) .
MLB 's pecking order is enforced in other ways , too .
The Reds played a pants prank on rookie Norris Hopper Sunday , removing his signature baggy pants from his locker and replacing them with a tighter , shorter look .
" I was taking -- they might rip if I swing , " Hopper said afterward .
( Further details here . )
And then there 's the long - standing bullpen bag protocol , which stipulates that the pitcher with the least seniority must pack a pink or purple knapsack with snacks for the rest of the bullpen -- and bring it to the 'pen before the game , in full view of howling fans .
Still , the costume schtick is the classic crowd - pleaser , with a long , rich tradition .
While nobody has yet compiled a definitive timeline of hazing history , here are three moments that stand out :
• The Twins took hazing to new heights last season , when they arrived in Cleveland on an off day and found that the Indians - Royals game was still in progress , so they made the rookies -- who'd been forced to dress up back in Minnesota and were still in costume -- go to Jacobs Field and watch the rest of the game .
• Quoting from the excellent 100 Percent Injury Rate blog : " Rangers rookie John Rheinecker forgot his passport and was unable to make a trip to Toronto [ last year ] , so he was sent home .
His punishment was that he had to ride BART after a game in Oakland in a penguin suit . "
• And there 's the time hazing saved a player from injury .
That was back in 2004 , when Indians pitcher Kyle Denney was dressed as a USC cheerleader , complete with white go - go boots .
In a bizarre sequence , Denny was hit in the leg by a stray bullet that pierced the team 's bus , with team doctors later proclaiming that his go - go boots may have saved him from greater harm .
So suck it up , rookies .
The life you save -- or haze -- may be your own .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - President Vladimir Putin signed a law on Friday suspending Russia ’s participation in a key post - Cold War arms treaty , a move which could allow it to deploy more forces close to western Europe .

Putin ’s moratorium on the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE )
Treaty follows months of increasingly aggressive rhetoric directed against the West ahead of a parliamentary election on Sunday and a presidential vote next March .
“ President Putin signed the federal law on suspending the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty , ” the Kremlin said in a short statement .
The bill was passed by parliament this month and needed the president ’s signature to become law .
The United States , the European Union and NATO had urged Putin not to suspend the treaty , seen as a cornerstone of European security .
But Putin , who has sought to restore the Kremlin ’s clout after the chaos which accompanied the fall of the Soviet Union , countered that NATO members had not ratified an amended version of the pact and had flexed their muscles near Russia ’s borders .
The suspension , which will come into effect from Dec 12 - 13 , would allow Moscow to boost military forces on its western and southern borders , although Russian generals have said that will not happen immediately .
Polls show that talking tough about Russia standing up to foreigners strikes a chord with millions of Russians who yearn for the Soviet Union ’s once mighty superpower status .
Putin has also been sparring with the United States and European Union over plans for a missile defence shield in Europe and proposed independence for Serbia ’s Kosovo province .
Signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 , the CFE treaty limits the number of battle tanks , heavy artillery , combat aircraft and attack helicopters deployed and stored between the Atlantic and Russia ’s Ural mountains .
It was originally negotiated among the then - 22 member states of NATO and the Warsaw Pact and Russia says it is outdated .
Moscow argues it has been used by an enlarged NATO to limit Russian military movements while NATO builds up forces close to Russia in contravention of earlier agreements .
Western partners have refused to ratify an amended version of the pact until Russia pulls its forces out of Georgia and Moldova as it promised in 1999 when the treaty was reviewed .
Moscow ’s key problem with the treaty are flank limits which prevent Russia from moving tanks and artillery around its own territory , Russia ’s top generals say .
NATO has said it would be worrying to see large amounts of equipment limited by the treaty suddenly moving around .
But Russia ’s top general , Yuri Baluyevsky , said this month said there would be no immediate movement of forces after the moratorium came into effect .
For several days , Rick was fighting with a third party vendor .
Rick 's system was supposed to talk to his vendor 's system using XML files , but their files were coming back with invalid XML data .
Rick complained to a technical contact ( " Terry " ) that the XML they returned was invalid .
Terry argued that they were processing the file wrong .
The issue that Rick discovered was that one of the attribute values in the XML file used single quotes instead of double quotes .
Terry insisted that the XML file used only double quotes , and made his case by sending over screenshots from XMLSpy and IE , showing that they were indeed double quotes .
The screenshot from IE would 've looked something like this :
" Yes , I see that , " Rick replied via email , " but XMLSpy and IE both correct minor errors — for instance , changing single quotes to double quotes . "
Rick sent
Terry a screenshot of the XML file in Notepad , which showed the attribute value with single quotes .
Later that day , Rick got a reply :
Hi Rick
We have viewed these messages in XMLspy , Notepad and a IE browser , only Notepad shows this as ' the other 2 programs use " , we believe that this is just away that notepad translates these files .
If required we are able to look at why Notepad translates these files with ' and not " , however this investigation will not be able to commence until early next week , although our thoughts are that the way that the file opens in notepad , has only clouded the issues ... ( snip )
Why Notepad has chosen to replace specific instances of double quotes with single quotes remains a mystery ...
Scientists are on the verge of decoding the special chemical language that bacteria use to " talk " to each other , British researchers report .
That achievement could lead to new treatments for antibiotic - resistant bacteria , including so - called superbugs that infect more than 90,000 people in the United States each year , they note .
David Spring , Martin Welch , and James T. Hodgkinson explain that researchers long have known that bacteria communicate with each other .
Microbes release small molecules that enable millions of individuals in a population to coordinate their behavior .
Disease - causing bacteria use this language to decide when to infect a person or other host .
Decoding the structure and function of compounds involved in this elaborate signaling process , known as " quorum sensing , " could lead to new medicines to block the signals and prevent infections .
The report describes development of a group of powerful compounds , called N - acylated homoserine lactone ( AHL ) analogues that are effective against a broad - range of bacterial types , including those that cause diseases in humans .
These compounds are " some of the most potent synthetic modulators of quorum sensing " identified to date , they say .
In addition to showing promise for fighting antibiotic - resistant infections , the compounds may help prevent the growth of biofilms that foul medical implants and cause tooth decay and gum disease , the scientists note .
The commentary article , " Learning the Language of Bacteria , " is published in the November issue of ACS Chemical Biology .
A Democrat , Larry LaRocco , is also running for the seat in 2008 , but political analysts say they expect a Republican , whether it is the one Mr. Otter appoints or someone else , to win a full term next fall in this conservative state .

If he had run , Mr. Craig was widely expected to win another term , but that was before this week .
Since Monday , national Republicans , fearful that the party would be damaged in the 2008 elections by yet another prolonged scandal , had led a concentrated , relentless effort to pressure Mr. Craig to abruptly end a 27 - year career in Washington that included a decade in the House and nearly three terms in the Senate .
Mr. Craig had been a powerful voice on many Republican issues in the West , fighting Democrats on issues ranging from gun control to proposals to protect salmon whose migration is blocked by dams that provide hydroelectric power and water to Idaho and other states .
He pushed to expand nuclear energy projects in Idaho and elsewhere but also to provide federal funding to rural areas hurt by declines in federal timber harvesting , funding that was sharply cut this year .
He also supported measures to restrict abortion and ban same - sex marriage .
On Tuesday , Senate Republican leaders stripped Mr. Craig of the committee leadership positions that helped make him influential .
Mitch McConnell , the Senate Republican leader , who outmaneuvered Mr. Craig for the position of Republican whip in 2002 , called his conduct “ unforgivable . ”
While Republican leaders in Idaho were far more measured in their reaction , few defended Mr. Craig and many state newspapers called for his resignation .
The senator was lampooned on local talk radio shows , which aired excepts of an interview in which Mr. Craig called former President Bill Clinton a “ naughty boy ” amid the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
At the same time many people , including some Democratic voters , said they were genuinely saddened by the turn of events .
Until today , Mr. Craig had said nothing publicly beyond a brief statement on Tuesday in which he insisted he was innocent and said he had made a mistake in pleading guilty .
Story Highlights • President draws comparison between Iraq and Vietnam wars
• Bush uses bin Laden intelligence to defend U.S. military presence in Iraq
• Bin Laden wanted to set up Iraq base for international attacks , White House says
• Bush discusses foiled aviation plots against the U.S .
Adjust font size :
NEW LONDON , Connecticut ( CNN ) -- President Bush used declassified intelligence about Osama bin Laden Wednesday to defend his Iraq war policy .
During a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy , the president mentioned declassified intelligence that said bin Laden discussed sending a top lieutenant in 2005 to Iraq to set up a base from which to launch attacks in the United States .
" There 's a reason bin Laden sent one of his most experienced paramilitary leaders to Iraq , " Bush said .
" He believes that if al Qaeda can drive us out , they can establish Iraq as a new terrorist sanctuary . "
The president acknowledged that critics " question whether the fight in Iraq is part of the war on terror . "
He said " the best way to protect our people is to take the fight to the enemy ... so we do not have to face them at home . "
The president also made a comparison between Iraq and the Vietnam War , saying , " There are many differences between the two conflicts , but one stands out above all .
The enemy in Vietnam had neither the intent nor the capability to strike our homeland .
...
The enemy in Iraq does . "
Bush said bin Laden warned the American people in January 2006 that " operations are under preparation and you will see them on your own ground once they are finished . "
Among the planned terrorist plots Bush said have been thwarted was one last summer , a plot broken up by British authorities to blow up passenger airplanes as they were flying toward the United States , Bush said .
It was disrupted " just two or three weeks away from execution , " he said , citing " our intelligence community " as the source of his information .
" If it had been carried out , it could have rivaled 9/11 in death and destruction , " he said .
Bush listed other alleged al Qaeda plots foiled since 9/11 :
In December 2001 , an operative was captured who had been trained in the use of poisons at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and sent to the United States prior to 9/11 " to serve as a sleeper agent ready for follow - on attacks , " Bush said .
The agent had been ordered to the United States by 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who is now in U.S. custody , Bush added .
" Our intelligence community believes that ( Mohammed ) brought ( the operative ) to meet Osama bin Laden , where he pledged his loyalty to the al Qaeda leader and offered himself up as a martyr , " Bush said .
Among the potential targets the intelligence community believes the man discussed with Mohammed were water reservoirs , the U.S. Stock Exchange and military academies , Bush said .
The president cited two other post - 9/11 alleged aviation plots -- the first devised by Mohammed in 2002 " to repeat the destruction of 9/11 by sending operatives to hijack an airplane and fly into the tallest building on the West Coast . "
Mohammed allegedly told " a hearing in Guantanamo Bay " that the intended target was Library Tower in Los Angeles , Bush said .
And in 2003 , another plot was uncovered and halted , this one intended to be another East Coast aviation attack in which multiple airplanes were to have been hijacked and then crashed into targets , he said .
Bush also said that , in 2005 , bin Laden was working to set up a unit inside Iraq from which to launch attacks in other countries .
Bush credited " bold action at home and abroad " with foiling the plans .
Although the White House rejected suggestions that the revelations were timed for political purposes , Bush 's address coincided with a push by Democrats in Congress to force an end to the U.S. military presence in the region .
During May , 81 U.S. military personnel have died in the Iraq war , bringing the total to 3,432 .
Bush vetoed a war - spending bill last month that included a timetable for withdrawing troops .
But timetables have been dropped from revised war - spending legislation , substituting benchmarks with consequences for Iraqi leaders .
Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory Wednesday as revised war spending legislation moved forward .

White House details bin Laden plot
On Tuesday , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said bin Laden and a top lieutenant -- Abu Faraj al - Libbi -- planned to form a terror cell in Iraq in order to launch attacks against the United States .
Al - Libbi was a " senior al Qaeda manager " who in 2005 suggested to bin Laden that bin Laden send Egyptian - born Hamza Rabia to Iraq to help plan attacks on American soil , Johndroe said .
Johndroe noted that bin Laden later suggested to Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , then leader of al Qaeda in Iraq , that America should be his top priority .
That was followed in the spring of 2005 with bin Laden 's ordering Rabia to brief al - Zarqawi on plans to attack the United States , Johndroe said .
Johndroe added the intelligence indicates al - Libbi later suggested Rabia should be sent to Iraq to carry out those operations .
But al - Libbi was captured in Pakistan and taken into CIA custody in May 2005 .
After al - Libbi's capture , the CIA 's former acting director , John McLaughlin , described him as bin Laden 's chief operating officer , the No. 3 man in al Qaeda .
" Catching terrorists is sometimes like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle without seeing the picture on the box , " McLaughlin said at the time .
" This is a guy who knows the picture on the box .
He knows what the big picture is . "
Al - Libbi is a Libyan who joined al Qaeda in the 1990s and fled to Pakistan after the United States invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 .
U.S. officials say al - Libbi was in contact with and directing alleged al Qaeda members in the United Kingdom who were planning attacks there and in the United States .
He was also believed to be behind two 2005 attempts to assassinate Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf .
Rabia took over al - Libbi 's position in the organization but was killed in in the North Waziristan tribal area of Pakistan near the Afghan border in December 2005 .
Jordanian - born al - Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike north of Baghdad in June 2006 .

On Sunday evening , Protecting Adult Welfare held its annual Bare Bowling fundraiser in a San Fernando Valley bowling alley .
Not surprisingly , these types of adult events are overwhelmingly attended by men of varying ages ( as opposed to an Erotica LA that caters to a mainstream audience that includes a much greater percentage of women ) , many of whom wield an impressive ( or in many cases frightening ) amount of camera equipment .
As for the pornstars in attendance , they included Abbey Brooks , Paulina James , Sunny Lane , Mindy Main , Misty Love , Miss Kitty ( who was the only one to be clad only in bowling shoes ) , and Francesca Chase .
Chase , a former Budweiser and Coors girl , is such a newcomer to the business that she has n't even shot her first film yet .
But that did n't stop a phalanx of photographers from surrounding her the entire night .
Meanwhile , Kitty , a 21 year old Texan blonde , has been in the business for just a month and has already shot five movies .
And when asked about her tattoos and piercings , she responded that it 's been difficult for her to get work , even in the alt porn genre .

Only a week ago , I was claiming that the Bush “ plan ” to streamline the mortgage - modification process was n’t a bailout .
A bailout is when the government actually spends money or drastically changes regulation in order to give an industry a helping hand .
That plan was n’t a bailout , for many reasons .
But the financial markets were n’t quite happy with this non-action .
And today , the Federal Reserve and European central banks chose to cow to their demands , by injecting inflation liquidity into the system :
A day after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors with a modest cut in interest rates , central banks in North America and Europe on Wednesday announced the most aggressive infusion of capital into the banking system since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 .
…
Economists and market specialists say policy makers are trying to reassure bankers that they will stand firm as the lenders of last resort .
The coordinated action is being led by the Fed , which will lend $ 40 billion this month .
The European Central Bank , the Bank of England , the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Canada will lend $ 50.2 billion this month and next .
“ This is basically a reinsurance policy , ” said William H. Gross , chief investment officer of the bond management firm Pimco .
Central bankers “ are saying , ‘ We will stand behind you . ’ ”
The market is reeling because the rapid expansion of credit is starting to come to an end , and the [ necessary ] resulting credit crunch will be nearly as painful as the heady days of credit expansion were joyful .
The problem is , pain takes the form of recession , and central banks do n’t want to stand idly by and let recessions occur , even if necessary .
So they ’re going to throw money into the system until lenders realize that a contraction wo n’t occur .
The Fed created this credit bubble .
Now when it ’s in danger of popping , they ’re going to try to patch it up .
Like many government actions , it might achieve its goal in the short term , but the long - term consequences will be far more damaging than allowing the system to correct today .
Stocks may have rebounded today , but so did gold , an indication that this is a sign of future inflation , adding another story to the house of cards built upon a foundation of sand .
( CNN ) -- Iran has launched its own 24 - hour news channel in English .
Iranian President Ahmadinejad , at the Press TV opening ceremony .
The satellite channel , called Press TV , is sponsored by Iran 's state - run television operation , Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ( IRIB ) and is aiming " to break the stranglehold of the West over the world 's media . "
The channel plans to compete with other 24 - hour English - language satellite channels like the BBC , CNN and Al Jazeera International , which is based in Qatar .
" Press TV plans to present a new perspective to its viewers around the world , " said Muhammad Sarafraz , the deputy director for international affairs , the Mehr News Agency reported .
" Iran and Shiite Muslims in particular have become a focal point of world propaganda .
From a media point of view , we are trying to give a second eye to Western audiences , " Sarafraz said .
Press TV's
Web site says the channel has 400 staff and 26 reporters worldwide .
Some of its correspondents are based in Washington , New York , London , Beirut and Damascus , it says .
Among them is Yvonne Ridley , who broadcasts out of Press TV's London bureau .
A former journalist for Britain 's Sunday Express , Ridley converted to Islam after being captured by the Taliban , whilst reporting in Afghanistan .
" Press TV offers independent news without an edge ... we are just reporting the news as we see it . "
Ridley told CNN .
But experts question Press TV 's capacity to attract many viewers worldwide .
Do n't Miss Press TV
Dr. Alireza Nurizadeh , the head of the Center for Arab and Iranian Studies in London , says Iran 's other international channels have failed to draw a global audience .
" Iran has spent millions of dollars in the past years to set up channels such as Sahar or Al - Alam , " he said .
" But , unfortunately , these investments have brought no results .
The Islamic republic has never succeeded in attracting viewers who want to watch or to hear alternative news . "
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , inaugurated Press TV during the channels official unveiling .
" Press TV should stay beside the oppressed people of the world ...
Broadcasting the truth immediately , providing precise analysis and exposing the plots of propaganda networks of the enemy is among its duties . "

All About Iran
Civil libertarians are worried that a little - known anti-terrorism bill now making its way through the U.S. Congress with virtually no debate could be planting the seeds of another USA PATRIOT Act , which was hurriedly enacted into law after the al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , co-authored by the former chair of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , Jane Harman , a California Democrat , passed the House by an overwhelming 400 - 6 vote last month , and will soon be considered by the Senate .
The bill ’s co-author is Republican Congressman David Reichert of Washington state .
The Senate version is being drafted by Susan Collins of Maine , the ranking Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , which is chaired by hawkish Connecticut independent Sen. Joe Lieberman .
Harman is chair of the House Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee .
Civil liberties groups , including the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , say the measure could herald a new government crackdown on dissident activity and infiltration of universities under the guise of fighting terrorism .
The CCR ’s Kamau Franklin , a Racial Justice Fellow , told IPS , " This measure looks benign enough , but we should be concerned about where it will lead .
It may well result in recommendations for new laws that criminalize radical thought and peaceful dissent , posing as academic study . "
Franklin added , " Crimes such as conspiracy or incitement to violence are already covered by both state and federal statute .
There is no need for additional criminal laws . "
He speculated that Congress " may want to get this measure passed and signed into law to head off peaceful demonstrations " at the upcoming Republican and Democratic Party conventions .
" And no congressperson of either political party wants to vote against this bill and get labeled as being soft on terrorism . "
Harman ’s bill would convene a 10 - member national commission to study " violent radicalization " ( defined as " the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically - based violence to advance political , religious , or social change " ) and " homegrown terrorism " ( defined as " the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or based and operating primarily within the United States [ ] to intimidate or coerce the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives " ) .
The bill also directs the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to designate a university - based research " center of excellence " where academics , policy - makers , members of the private sector and other stakeholders can collaborate to better understand and prevent radicalization and homegrown terrorism .
Some experts are concerned that politics will unduly influence which institution DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff will designate .
In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , Chertoff was head of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and played a key role in implementing the department ’s roundup of hundreds of Muslims who were detained without charge , frequently abused , and denied access to legal counsel .
Critics of Harman ’s bill point out that commission members would all be appointed by a high - ranking elected official .
Those making these appointments would include the president , the secretary of Homeland Security , the speaker and ranking member of the House , the majority and minority leaders of the Senate , and senior members of the House and Senate committees overseeing homeland security .
Critics also fear that the bill ’s definitions of " extremism " and " terrorism " are too vague and its mandate too broad , and that government - appointed commissions could be used as ideological cover to push through harsher laws .
Congressional sponsors of the bill claim it is limited in scope .
" Though not a silver bullet , the legislation will help the nation develop a better understanding of the forces that lead to homegrown terrorism , and the steps we can take to stop it , " Harman told Congress .
But the bill ’s purpose goes beyond academic inquiry .
In a Nov. 7 press release , Harman said , " the National Commission [ will ] propose to both Congress and Chertoff initiatives to intercede before radicalized individuals turn violent . "
According to the Center for Constitutional Rights , the commission " will focus in on passing additional federal criminal penalties that are sweeping and inclusive in criminalizing dissent and protest work more surveillance on thought rather than on actions .
Further , this bipartisan attempt can set the ground for an even more acquiescent Congress to presidential power , never wanting to look weak on terrorism . "
The commission would be tasked with compiling information about what leads up to violent radicalization , and how to prevent or combat it with the intent to issue a final report with recommendations for both preventative and counter measures .
Implementing the bill would likely cost some $ 22 million over the 2008 - 2012 period , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
But critics point out that the bill would duplicate work already being done in and out of government .
For example , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) already has a domestic terrorism unit ; the U.S. intelligence community monitors the homegrown terrorists and overseas networks that might be reaching out to U.S. residents ; and many universities and think tanks are already specializing in studying the subject .
But Harman argues that a national commission on homegrown terrorism could benefit the country in much the same way as the 9/11 Commission , the Silberman / Robb Commission , or other high - profile national security inquiries .
But groups like the CCR are wondering what exactly is meant by " an extremist belief system . "
" The term is left undefined and open to many interpretations  socialism , anarchism , communism , nationalism , liberalism , etc .  that would serve to undermine expressions that do n’t fit within the allowable areas of debate .
A direct action led by any group that blocks traffic can be looked upon as being coercive , " CCR says .
The bill says the Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the U.S. by providing access to " broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to U.S. citizens . "
While civil liberties groups agree that focus on the Internet is crucial , they fear it could set up far more intrusive surveillance techniques , without warrants , and the potential to criminalize ideas and not actions could mean penalties for a stance rather than a criminal act .
The bill also uses the term " ideologically - based violence , meaning the use , planned use , or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individual ’s political , religious , or social beliefs . "
But the CCR and other groups ask , " What is force ?
Is civil disobedience covered under that , if arrested at a protest rally and charged with disorderly conduct , obstructing governmental administration , or even assault , does that now open you up to possible terrorist charges in the future ? "
Some of the most egregious terrorist attacks in U.S. history have been carried out by U.S. citizens , including the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 .
There 's high mileage , and then there 's this .
A 1995 Honda Civic is for sale in Atlanta with , count 'em , 939,899 miles .
That 's 200 - plus miles a day .
Every day .
Including Sundays .
For 12 years .
It even has a CARFAX report from when the car had 907,000 miles on it .
According to the seller , the car runs like new , with no leaks , no noises , no oil burning , and not even a scratch on the body .
In fact , the only blemish listed is that one of the dashboard lights does n't work , and that 's only sometimes .
The car is on its ninth timing belt , ninth water pump , and fourth clutch .
But the engine and transmission are original , as are the floor mats .
The car even comes with records .
The most incredible thing is n't the mileage , though .
It 's how the owner put the miles on the car : driving on business trips from Atlanta ... to Seattle ... and San Francisco .
We want to know what kind of business -- or what kind of boss -- makes a guy drive across the country and back , and then some , every single month for 12 straight years .
To paraphrase The Proclaimers , if you buy this car then you can drive a million miles and you can drive a million more ...
Thanks for the tip , Ronnie !

As we consider the worst fast - food offering ever , let us begin with the artifact itself : KFC ’s new Famous Bowls product consists of a plastic tub of mashed potatoes or rice , topped with yellow corn , fried chicken nuggets ,
gravy and three varieties of grated cheese .
All in one container , all to be consumed as a single homogenous mass , spork after spork of undifferentiated food matter .
And there it sits on my desk , a steaming , sweating pound of food goo that I purchased at a drive - in window ( more anonymous that way ) for $ 3.99 .
Let me tell you , it ’s one thing to muse upon the Famous Bowls in a detached , ne ’er - shall - pass - my - lips sort of way .
Quite another to address the product , spork in hand .
And now , in the interests of participatory journalism , I take a bite .
Hmmm .
Uh -huh .
OK .
It ’s like throwing up in reverse .

The French culinary aesthete Jean Anthelme Brillat - Savarin reminded us that food is culture , and so we have to wonder what he would say about the Famous Bowls and life in this America .
The French , after all , knew something about revolting peasants .
Even in a nation that has made the bulk fast - food bolus something of a culinary art , KFC ’s Famous Bowls are somehow splendidly , transcendently awful .
Perhaps it ’s because , if you retain any of your childhood aversion to foods touching , the Famous Bowls will send you shrieking into traffic .
Perhaps it ’s because it so brazenly exposes its own purpose : to economically pack the gullets of the poor .
Gone is even the pretense that someone might eat this for its taste .
This is gerbil food for the disenfranchised .
One KFC marketing exec , in a moment of linguistic clarity I ’ll bet he wishes he had back , is quoted as saying the meals are directed at “ heavy fast - food users . ”
Never was the connection between fast food and addictive drugs made more explicit .
The Famous Bowls , according to KFC , are designed to lure more lunchtime customers with a meal that has all the goodness of KFC ’s popular dishes -- like gravy -- in one convenient , portable , easy - to - inhale serving .
And thus the gustatory equivalent of composting .
A couple of questions immediately present themselves :
Why not go all the way and top the Famous Bowls with an apple pie and pour Coca - Cola over them ?
To save customers the struggle to pocket their change at the drive - thru , why not throw it on top as well ?
If the product developers thought Famous Bowls were a good idea , I have two words for them : chicken smoothie .

You might have expected , after Morgan Spurlock ’s hilarious and scary “ Super Size Me " -- the 2004 documentary that charts his declining health on a steady diet of McDonald ’s -- that the fast - food industry would be at least a little self - conscious about such offerings .
Actually , no .
McDonald ’s did begin to offer healthier menu options and retired the notorious Super Size option .
But what has fueled McDonald ’s recent turnaround ( revenues up 33 % in three years ) is the company ’s Dollar Menu , a smorgasbord of slow - acting poisons ( trans fats , sugars , sodium and kilo - calories ) , marketed primarily at teenagers and minorities .
To keep pace with McDonald ’s , Burger King and Wendy ’s pumped up their dollar - priced menu offerings .
Wendy ’s , deciding its Biggie drink was n’t biggie enough , recently began offering sodas in 42 - ounce cups .
Great , a beverage I can swim in .
In the face of criticism drummed up by “ Super Size Me " -- and the 2001 book “ Fast Food Nation , ” the film version of which will appear in theaters this fall -- the industry has executed a marvelous bit of jujitsu , marketing even more heinous concoctions as manly , red -state antidotes to froufrou girlie food that would be imposed by the meddlesome big - government lunch lady .
I love the Burger King ad for the Texas Double Whopper in which a mob of men burns its tighty whities , waving signs that say “ Eat This Meat ” and singing , to the tune of Helen Reddy ’s “ I Am Woman ” : “ I am man , I am incorrigible , and I ’m way too hungry to settle for chick food . ”
There is no shortage of fast - food travesties by which to be astonished .
Consider the Carl ’s Jr. Double Six Dollar Burger , weighing in at a heart - plugging 1,420 calories , 101 grams of fat and 2.4 grams of sodium .
A ballpark in St. Louis offers a bacon- cheeseburger served on a Krispy Kreme doughnut ( which does n’t sound half - bad , actually ) .
The Southern California restaurant chain
The Hat serves French fries in a paper grocery bag and a Pastrami Burger the size of a moose ’s head .
It ’s the only place I know where meat is a condiment .

Compared to these offerings , the Famous Bowls ( 710 calories , with 29 grams of fat and 2 grams of sodium ) are relatively healthy .
And so what if it ’s all in one bowl ?
NASA used to serve astronauts Thanksgiving meals in a squeeze tube .
And yet I remain appalled -- as well as a little woozy from all the salt .
It ’s one thing to say Americans eat like pigs , it ’s another to give it the force of literalism .
But that ’s just what the trough - like Famous Bowls do .
If there were a Food Court at The Hague , the Colonel would be in big trouble .
DIGG THIS
Ron Paul is a protest candidate .
No more .
No less .
What you have to consider , though , is that Dr. Paul ’s campaign is a political dream come true for a lot of people in America right now .
More proof of that can be found in the first ten days of the fourth quarter , where he ’s already raised over half of what Huckabee did all of last 3rd quarter .
The day after the poorly moderated Michigan debates , Dr. Paul had a $ 100,000 day online ( imagine how much more he could have raised if he'd have been treated like a candidate who had just raised $ 5 million dollars from enthusiastic Americans ready to vote for him ) .
What the media and Republican power center has n't quite figured out yet is that Ron Paul ’s campaign is not going away .
At some point in time the media ( and the people in general ) are going to have to recognize the facts here .
We have a fiscally conservative candidate who is garnering huge amounts of people - powered cash , talking about peoples ' top issue ( getting out of the Iraqi civil war ) , while returning American government to its Constitutional roots .
His voting record is as stellar in its adherence to Constitutional principle as you could ever imagine a voting record could be .
Oh yeah , and he does n’t accept money from special interests .
Oh , and one more thing : the Ron Paul package comes tremendously steeped in Reagan tradition .
Reagan ’s genial conservativism proved to be a powerfully winning formula for drawing people on both sides of the aisle .
Ron Paul has already proven that this formula works like a charm in two separate elections in Texas , one where he beat a well - funded Democrat incumbent , and another where he beat a well - funded Republican who had previously been a Democrat .
This is a man with bona fide cross -party appeal .
Ron Paul ’s Revolution is n’t just a neat slogan .
Whether the average person understands / believes it or not , there is radical change being peacefully born in our political system .
The establishment is only going to be able to hide and marginalize Paul ’s campaign for so long .
He ’s going to start ( smartly ) spending money soon .
He has spent hardly a dime yet and he ’s gained ground in nearly every poll you can point to over the last six months ( especially in primary states ) .
These poll numbers have risen thanks to his debate performances , his non -stop touring across the states  from Washington DC , to Washington State  and his most powerful ( yet thus far ignored ) superweapon : the most free , and abundant political advertising that a candidate has ever enjoyed having in the history of political advertising .
People are going to find him …
And when they do , they ’re going to find that this man is an open book .
He ’s not afraid to talk at length about his principles to anyone who will listen , unabashedly and consistently speaking truth to power .
With each debate , his willingness to stand up against popular and popularly backwards thought is going to gain him a lot of fans on both the left and the right .
And as these reasonable folks explore their feelings of agreement on different issues ( nearly everybody in America strongly agrees with Ron Paul on at least one core issue that ’s important to them ) , those who speak out about their political confusion and raise discussion about it will find themselves being brow - beat and driven out of their respective party by loyalists who demand near fealty to their flawed mainstream candidates ( you can witness this already happening every day on RedState , FreeRepublic , or Daily Kos ) .
If Ron Paul does n’t get the Republican nomination , you have to remember that Ross Perot got 18 % of the vote as a third - party candidate with a message nowhere near as powerful as Dr. Paul's .
Perot 's third party was something that he had just invented on the spot  the Reform Party .
Dr. Paul already has a strong association to an existing political party to funnel his supporters into should his bid for the Republican Nomination fall short .
With the backing of a party and enough widespread grassroots support , Ron Paul is the only candidate who ’s spot in the post - primary debates is virtually cemented .
Everyone else still has to get by the primaries .
All he has to do is make a decent showing in the primaries and then say yes to the supporters who have donated and will do everything they can to ensure that his name is on the ballot , even if this means accepting the Libertarian party nomination .
Let Dr. Paul be coy now , but his campaign is like Plato 's cave , and nobody is going back down .
Dr. Paul 's name will be on the ballot come hell or high water .
That ’s when the fireworks will really begin , because Ron Paul out - flanks both sides of the establishment candidates on issues that are crucial to their base ’s .
Hillary vs. Rudy vs. Ron Paul in a debate is going to be Must See TV for the ages .
It ’s going to be beautiful watching the establishment snakes double talk on their bases core issues , while Dr. Paul talks credibly about things like State ’s Rights , local controls , less government , fewer taxes , more personal liberty , a fundamentally sound economy , and peace through non-intervention teamed with free and abundant commerce .
And when election day comes , and people are in that voting booth with the curtain closed , and nothing but themselves , their United States ballot , and their own personal best interests in mind , they ’re going to find themselves faced with an unfamiliar reality : that they have a decision , and that they ’re not making a choice between Hillary and Rudy ( the lesser of two evils ) , but that they ’re making a choice between Hillary and Ron Paul , and Rudy and Ron Paul .
And they ’re going to remember how their party has treated them .
They ’re going to remember how the system has treated them .
They ’re going to remember .
And I ’ll tell you what : they ’re going to protest .

We cyclists are simple folk .
We do n’t need much to keep us happy .
Really , all we need are clear skies and a road or trail to make us happy .
Advertisement
And a helmet , of course .
And gloves .
And shorts with a special antimicrobial chamois insert .
And form - fitting shirts .
And very stiff - soled shoes , preferably Italian - made .
And specialty sports drinks , with an incomprehensible combination of carbohydrates , proteins , electrolytes , and a lemon - lime flavoring that for some reason makes one think of furniture polish .
Oh , and we need bikes .
More specifically , we need another bike .
Always .
And that means we need to pay for another bike .
Now , it ’s not the paying per se that ’s difficult .
We can always find a way to get the money we need for bike stuff — take a second job , sell a kidney , money laundering , whatever .
What ’s difficult is justifying the expense of yet another bicycle , whether it be to our wives , our parents , or to our own nagging conscience .
Sometimes we fail in our justification , and then where are we ?
We ’re in the Purgatory of No New Bikes , that ’s where we are .
That ’s a bad place .
A bad , bad place .
We should never have to be in that place .
And if you will follow these techniques , you will never be in that place again .
It will save money on gas
This may surprise you , but bikes can actually be used as transportation , and there are some people who — oddly enough — actually use their bikes to get around from place to place , instead of driving .
Explain that with this new bike you will be saving serious transportation costs and doing your part for the environment .
Caveat :
Do not explain that the new bike you ’re considering costs approximately the same as three years ’ worth of fuel , and most especially do not explain that any of the bikes you already have would work as transportation , too .
If brought up as a counterargument , explain — dismissively — that your other bikes are n’t really for that kind of thing .
It ’s less expensive than a humongous HDTV
This will take a little bit of preparation , but is well worth it .
For about three weeks , do n’t mention the new bike you want .
At all .
Instead , with increasing intensity and frequency , begin talking about how you ’re thinking about getting a giant high - def television .
And a Blu - Ray DVD player .
And a subscription to high - def cable / satellite ( or both ! ) .
And a serious sound system to go with it .
Be very , very open about how much this will cost — about three times as much as the bike you want .
Argue convincingly ( not too convincingly , though ) and loudly about why you ought to get this massive entertainment system .
About the time your boyfriend / girlfriend / spouse / parent is at wit ’s end , capitulate .
Right in the middle of an argument , act like a light ’s just come on in your head .
“ You know , you ’re right ! ” you say , catching them off - guard .
“ It ’s outrageously expensive and it would just rot my brain , especially when a new bike would cost me less than half as much ! ”
They ’ll be so relieved — not to mention pleased at having clearly won an argument with you — they ’ll just let that remark go .
Next day , you come home with the new bike , as the two of you agreed .
Bonus :
It ’s possible this technique will backfire on you and your significant other will really get into the idea of buying a home theatre system .
That ’s the beauty of this technique : even if you lose , you win !
You Will Easily Recoup the Cost of This Bike in Prize Money
Did you know there ’s big money in bike racing ?
There is !
Just ask Lance Armstrong ; he ’s made a very comfortable living by racing his bicycle .
Do you think Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times riding a piece of crap like the one you ride ?
No , he most certainly did not .
If you ’re going to start winning races and making millions of dollars like Lance , you ’re going to need a better bike .
The prize money will follow naturally .
This bike will hardly cost anything after the trade - in
Thinking of trading in an old bike for the new one ?
Excellent .
You ’ll want to get out your soft math skills for this technique .
First , find out the suggested retail for the new bike you want .
Reduce that figure by 25 % , because nobody pays MSRP for anything these days .
Then take another 10 % off because you ’re friends with a guy at the shop .
Take another 5 % off because you ’re a sharp negotiator .
Tell your significant other that ’s how much your new bike will cost .
Next , estimate how much your current bike is actually worth .
Add 10 % to that , because I can tell you ’ve taken really good care of your bike .
Add 5 % because I think you ’re just being too modest .
Then add 15 % to that figure because you want some negotiating room .
Tell your significant other that ’s how much you ’ll be selling your old bike for .
If you ’re any good at all with creative math , you should actually be able to make a case that you may well be pocketing some money when all is said and done .
Note :
When it turns out that the actual cost of the new bike is much higher — and the amount you sell the old bike for is lower — than you expect , I highly recommend shrugging and blaming taxes , shipping , and the fees the online site charged .
“ Man , everyone wants a slice , ” you can say , resignedly .
This bike is the bike to end all bikes
I fully admit that this approach is dangerous , but desperate times call for desperate measures , as I think all of us who have ever had a carbon fiber jones can attest .
“ I know I have a lot of bikes already , ” you should say ( it ’s good to start with a true statement , because that fools people into thinking other things you say may also be true ) .
“ This one , though , is different .
It fits me unlike any bike ever made .
It will never break .
It is both beautiful and functional .
It weighs 2.3Kg , fully loaded . ”
Continue with , “ This is the ultimate expression of a bicycle .
I shall never need another . ”
Look her / him right in the eyes as you conclude , “ Hey , it ’s not like I ’m talking about buying a Ferrari here , but how often in my life will I have a chance to own something that is truly perfect ? ”
( Note : Do not say this if you own a Ferrari . )
Try to mist up a little as you say this .
It adds impact .
Warning :
Do not use this technique more than twice per year .

Bilderberg May Make U.S. Pay For Unsanctioned War Against Iraq WEB EXCLUSIVE : Front page and Complete PDF of AFP Bilderberg coverage 23 May 2005 By James P. Tucker Jr. ROTTACH -EGERN , Germany Will the price of oil reach $ 150 a barrel in two years ?
Henry Kissinger made this prediction to Richard Holbrooke , according to two friendly sources inside the secret Bilderberg meeting .
 It should not be long ,  Kissinger told Holbrooke , vice chairman of Perseus LLC and longtime Bilderberg luminary .
Kissinger said the demand for oil has far exceeded the supply .
Oil , and who gets it , is part of the bitter Bilderberg dispute over Middle East policy .
One source said James Baker had made the same pre-diction while representing the Carlyle Group at an earli-er business conference , saying look for $ 150 a barrel . 
Baker represented the White House at Bilderberg meetings under former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush the Elder , where he served as chief of staff and treasury secretary , respectively .
The economic impact of tripling already - high oil prices would be staggering .
Inflation would soar , because transportation from raw material to finished product to marketplace has a significant impact on virtually everything you buy from neckties to houses .
Bilderberg hunkered down here May 5 - 8 to decide how the world should deal with European - American relations , the Middle East powder keg , the Iraq war , the global economy and potential war in Iran .
The first appearance of Virginia Gov. Mark Warner ( D ) indicates Bilderberg considers him a presidential contender .
The absence of former Sen. John Edwards ( N.C. ) , John Kerrys presidential running mate in 2004 , indi-cates the Sun has set on his political career .
Last year was Edwardss first appearance and , like most of the fringe invitees , he has been cast aside like an old shoe .
European hostility toward Americans for the invasion of Iraq was rekindled by reports in the European press that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had secretly agreed with President Bush to go to war months in advance of the U.S. invasion .
The Guardian of London , among other newspapers , carried detailed accounts of a transcript of conversations between Blair and President Bush three months before the March 2002 invasion .
The transcript clearly shows Blair promising , in advance , to join the United States in the war on Iraq .
This prompted hostile comments while Kissinger was presiding over a panel discussion on the meaning of peace .
Europeans demanded to know if  Iran is next ,  and when does it end ? 
America was repeatedly warned not to rush to war with Iran . 
But history demonstrates that Americans are no more the war party  than the European Bilderbergers .
Europeans joined in supporting the 1991 invasion of Iraq by President Bush the Elder , celebrating the end of  Americas Vietnam syndrome . 
Europeans also support-ed former President Bill Clintons invasion of Yugoslavia , bringing NATO into the operation .
The first shot ever fired in anger by NATO troops were in Yugoslavia .
Bilderberg had made NATO , effectively , the UNs standing army .
The British election results pleased Europeans , who grudgingly supported Blair because of his commitment to the European Constitution ( EC ) .
Britons will vote in 2006 on ratifying the EC .
But they are happy that Blairs Labor Partys majority in Parliament shrank from 160 to 60 and he will likely be replaced as prime minister with - in two years .
To address the Mideast issue , Bilderberg brought together Eival Gilady and Natan Sharansky of Israel and Palestinian Ziad Abu - Amr .
Gilady is strategic adviser to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
Sharansky is a former minister for Jerusalem and diaspora affairs .
Abu - Amr is a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council , president of the Palestinian Council on Foreign Relation and professor of political science at Birzeit University .
The Council on Foreign Relations , always richly represented at Bilderberg , serves as Bilderbergs propaganda ministry .
Scholarly white papers  advocating Bilderberg policies routinely follow the secret sessions .
This year , Bilderberg ordered Israel to keep its prom-ise to withdraw from some settlements in the West Bank and Gaza .
Also , they noted that Palestinians must be grateful for the portion of their territory they get back and not insist on pre-1967 borders .
Israel seized these lands in a surprise attack in 1967 .
 We must get along , despite our harsh differences , because we now live in an interdependent , global econ-omy ,  said a lanky , gray - haired European in a discussion of trans - Atlantic Relations . 
Poverty in Africa or South America or wherever  is a threat to all of us , anywhere in the world ,  he said .
Again , the United States was denounced for not pro-viding a fair share of economic aid to poor countries .
Again , Kissinger and David Rockefeller , among other Americans , beamed and nodded approval .
Bilderberg argues that , as a percentage of gross national product , Americans are stingy . 
There was discussion of timing for a vote in the United Nations on establishing a direct global tax by imposing a 10 - cents - a - barrel levy on oil at the well - head .
This is important to the Bilderberg goal of establishing the UN as a formal world government .
Such a direct tax on individuals is symbolically important .
Bilderbergs global tax proposal has been pending before the UN for three years but the issue has been blacked out by the Bilderberg - controlled U.S. media .
Said one Bilderberger of the pending UN tax :  Let the tax pass the UN with absolutely no publicity .
Talk with the ( news ) boys in advance and warn them about triggering right - wing hysteria .
People wont even notice that fraction of a penny per gallon .
When people do become aware , perhaps in three years , theyll simply say aint that sumphin .  
Other topics of discussion this year included  China and energy ,   Russias role in the world ,  economic lib-eration ,  and U.S. Social Security reform . 
Bilderbergs interest in how the United States deals with Social Security remains unclear .
Chinas demand for oil has increased dramatically in recent years , contributing to the current $ 50 price per barrel .
Bilderbergers debated whether a proposed pipeline should move oil to Japan or China from Russia .
Bilderbergers were downcast when word came that some Senate Democrats , who had voted for free trade bills in the past , were threatening to kill the Central America Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) because of insufficient worker protections .
CAFTA is a crucial step in expanding NAFTA into the Free Trade Area of the Americas , which is to include the entire Western Hemi-sphere except for Cuba until Fidel Castro is gone .
Kenneth Clarke , Conservative member of Parliament and a former chancellor of the exchequer in Britain , a long - time Bilderberg luminary , once told this journalist that the goal is to establish an  American Union similar to the European Union with the dollar as the common currency .
The  Asia - Pacific Union is also emerging , which will complete the division of the Earth into three great regions for the administrative convenience of the planned world government .
Mac OS Xを使っていないプログラマは、時間の80％を無駄にしている、かどうかは知りませんが、堅いGUIとUNIX系のコマンドラインツールを使えるMac OS Xは、開発環境として使いやすいことは確か。
が、デフォルトのままでは 、Terminal.appで日本語が表示できないとか、lsやfindがGNU系じゃなくてBSD系だとか、要するにOSだってカスタマイズしてなんぼというわけであります。
というわけで、私 のMac OS Xのカスタマイズをこのあたりに書いておきます。
※2008/2/3追記 : Leopard版書きました > 開発環境として のMac OS X Leopard
Terminal.app Mac OS Xにはデフォルトで 「 ターミナル」（/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app）が付いてきますが、これがデフォルトではまったくイケてない。主要な問題は以下の３点。 日本語を表示できない
DeleteやHomeキーが使えない
色が見にく い
まず日本語が表示できない問題は、Terminal.appの設定と、readlineの設定の２点に起因しているようです。
Terminal.appの「ウィンドウ設定」をいじる（後述） ~/.inputrcを修 正 で解決します。~/.inputrcは確かデフォルトでは存在しないので、vimやemacsなどなどお好みのエディタで作成して、以下を記述。
set meta - flag on set convert - meta off set input - meta on set output - meta on 続い てDelete やHomeキーが使えないのは、これま たTerminal.appの設定と、readlineの設定。というわけで、
Terminal.appの「ウィンドウ設定」（後述） ~/.inputrcの修正 で解決します。Terminal.appのウィンドウ設定は後述として、とりあえず~/.inputrcに以下を追記。 " \033 [ 3 ~ " : delete - char
vimな方は~/.vimrcに↓これも書いておくと良いです。 map < C - [ >[ H < Home > map ! < C -[ >[ H < Home > map < C -[ >[ F < End > map ! <C -[ >[ F < End > 色が見にくいのは、黒背景にすると青が見にくいし、白背景にすると黄色が見にくいし…。~/.dir_colorsや~/.vimrcで見にくい色を使わないようにするのも手ですが、TerminalColorsを使うのが最適です。これを入れると、Terminal.appでもANSIカラーを変更できるようになります。
さて 、Terminal.appの設定ですが、お手軽な方法は↓このファイルを~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plistに上書きすればOKです。（元のファイルはバックアップをとっておいてください）
com.apple.Terminal.plist
手で設定する場合は 、Terminal.appの「ウィンドウ設定」で↓を設定すればたぶんOK。 「 エミュレーション」で、「 非ASCII文字をエスケープする」のチェックを外す

MacPortsをホームディレクトリにインストール 最近やっとMacPortsを入れました。これはステキです。
ただ、dmgに入っているインストーラでインストールすると、/opt/local以下にインストールされるのが気に入らない。ホームディレクトリに入れて欲しい。というわけでMacPortsをソースからコンパイルして、$HOME/portsにインストールしてみました。以下その手順を。
まずreadlineの最新版を入れておきます。readlineを新しくしないとコンパイル時にエラーが出ます（でももしかしたらウチのMacだけかも？）。GPLがアレな場合はlibeditでも良いかも。 wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-5.2.tar.gz wget http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-5.2-patches/readline52-00{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} tar zxvf readline - 5.2.tar.gz cd readline - 5.2 for p in ../ readline52-* ; do patch - p2 < $ p ; done ./ configure --enable-multibyte -- prefix=$HOME / ports make - j3 make install 2 >&1 | tee make - install - readline.log
続いてMacPortsをインストール。./configureの引数が長い。 wget http://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/downloads/MacPorts-1.5.0/MacPorts-1.5.0.tar.bz2 tar jxvf MacPorts -1.5.0.tar.bz2 cd MacPorts - 1.5.0 LDFLAGS= " - L$HOME / ports / lib " CFLAGS= " - L$HOME / ports / lib " ./ configure --prefix=$HOME/ports --with-included - sqlite3 --with-install-group=`id -g` --with-install-user=`id -u` --with-tclpackage=$HOME/ ports / tcl make - j3 make install 2>&1 | tee make - install - macports.log
環境変数 で$ TCLLIBPATH と$PATHを~/.bashrc（とか~/.zshrcとか~/.cshrc）で設定しておきます。
export TCLLIBPATH =" $ HOME / ports /tcl " export PATH = " $ HOME / ports / bin : $ PATH "
あとはport selfupdateしてお好みのパッケージをインストールパーティすればOKです。ユーザー権限でインストールできます。sudo要りません。 port selfupdate port install coreutils + with_default_names port install findutils port install wget port install ruby

So I have an interesting career , I work in Urology as a PA / Andrologist .
I touch alot of penis , and I play with alot of sperm .
Most of my patients are pretty uncomfortable with their visit ( gizzing in a cup in a doctors office can be stressful , I understand ! ) so I can see how it can be stressful .
I did n't realize how stressful until this morning .
Now on to the rave , today I am on my way into the office and running late .
I called to see if my first patient arrived and he was apparently stuck in the same traffic as me , so it was all going to work out okay .
Now I am not a huge fan of cell phone talking while driving , but I do n't harass people .
As I am merging to get off the highway and finishing my conversation with the office this ass decided to beep , scream , ride my ass , bascially being a real pain in his car .
He is behind me for a while , continuing his screaming fit and making gestures in the rear view .
Finally , he passes me while screaming and giving me the finger .
I pulled into DnD to get the office coffee and then went on my merry way to the office .
Guess who was my patient today , none other than Mister nice driver .
He needed a testicular biopsy ... what a nice pleasant moment it was to see the look on his face when he realized where he had seen me before .
So next time you decide to get a case of road rage , think twice about who you might be screaming and swearing at through the windown .
It could be someone who will soon be palpating your scrotom , injecting local anesthesia , and / or removing a small piece of tissue . :)
JFK International Airport is set to become the first in the World with a Laser Missile Defense Protective Shield .
The system is known as Skyguard it is manufactured by Northrop Grumman and it offers a never before level of safety to jet aircraft at their most vulnerable time , takeoff and landing .
The high tech Tactical High Energy Laser is designed to destroy the most sophisticated threats even those that reach supersonic speed .
Terrorists are a determined breed and they have shown that they will go to any means to strike at America ’s most symbolic targets and after this summer ’s attempted attack on the JFK Fuel Pipeline was foiled Homeland Security is taking no chances and is preparing the high tech shield for deployment , the final cost of the system including installation is expected to be about $ 40 million .
Northrop Grumman which developed the Laser has been testing it since the year 2000 , it generates a protective shield of about 7 Miles in diameter and is effective against short - range missiles , short and long - range rockets , unmanned aerial vehicles and even cruise missiles .
It works by using the reactive gases stored in its fuel tanks which are then directed down a pressurized vacuum tube , the charged atoms are beamed at special resonator mirrors and the laser - beam fires a short burst of intense light at the incoming projectile ’s explosive element , destroying it instantly .
According to the Associated Press , " Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul 's supporters raised over $ 6 million Sunday to boost the 10 - term congressman 's campaign for the White House . "
The AP report also said , " The [ Paul ] campaign 's previous fundraiser brought in $ 4.2 million . "
According to the Paul campaign website , " In a 24 - hour period on December 16 , the campaign raised $ 6.026 million dollars , surpassing the one - day record of $ 5.7 million held by John Kerry .
" During the day , over 58,000 people contributed to Dr. Paul 's campaign , including 24,940 first - time donors .
Over 118,000 Americans have donated to the campaign in the fourth quarter .
" The $ 6 million one - day total means the campaign has raised over $ 18 million this quarter , far exceeding its goal of $ 12 million . "
Now , if one listens to most of the political pundits in the major media , Ron Paul is some kind of " kook , " and his supporters are also a bunch of " kooks . "
So , the question must be asked , Just who are these kooks that are supporting him , and why are they giving Ron Paul all this money ?
First , let 's take a look at this " kook " who is receiving all this money .
Ron Paul was born the third son of Howard and Margaret Paul , and was brought up with a work ethic in which one worked six days a week and went to church on Sunday .
His first job was at age 5 helping his uncle wash bottles .
He worked all the way through his youth mowing lawns , delivering newspapers , working in a drug store , delivering furniture and laundry , etc .
In high school , Ron was a track star , winning state as a junior in the 220 - yard dash and running 2nd in the 440 .
His time in the 100 - yard dash was 9.8 .
That 's pretty good .
I was never able to break 10 - flat in the 100 .
Although , I bet I could have beaten him in the 50 - yard dash .
He also wrestled in high school .
Coincidentally , so did I .
But here Ron leaves me : he was president of the student council and an honor student .
I never accomplished that .
I was just glad to get promoted to the next grade .
Even as a senior statesman , Ron Paul keeps himself in terrific shape .
Have you seen him lately ?
He still maintains a rigorous exercise regimen .
Ron 's two brothers are both ministers , and he became a medical doctor .
He graduated from Duke University School of Medicine .
When the Cuban Missile Crisis arose , Ron became a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force .
He also served in the Air National Guard .
As an OB / GYN physician , Dr. Paul has delivered more than 4,000 babies , and he and his wife , Carol , have been married for more than 50 years .
They have 5 children , 18 grandchildren and 1 great - grandchild .
Ron Paul is currently in his 10th term as a congressman from Texas .
As a congressman , Ron Paul has never taken a government - paid junket .
He is not accepting a government pension .
He returns a portion of his office budget every year to the taxpayers .
As a member of Congress , he has never voted a raise for himself .
Do you know any other member of Congress that can make such a claim ?
Of course you do n't , because Ron Paul is truly one - of - a- kind .
Former President Ronald Reagan said this about Ron Paul , " Ron Paul is one of the outstanding leaders fighting for a stronger national defense .
As a former Air Force officer , he knows well the needs of our armed forces , and he always puts them first .
We need to keep him fighting for our country . "
Perhaps this helps explain why many of the " kooks " supporting Ron Paul are active - duty military personnel .
In fact , Ron Paul has received more campaign contributions from active - duty military personnel than any other Presidential candidate from either party .
But who are the other " kooks " supporting Ron Paul ?
What kind of people give more than $ 18 million in a quarter - year to a Presidential candidate that is almost universally ignored by the mainstream press ?
What kind of people give record contributions to a Presidential candidate that is lampooned by his fellow Republican Presidential contenders ?
For example , Mike Huckabee recently said he could support any of the other Republican Presidential contenders ( including Rudy Giuliani ) , except Ron Paul .
That means , Mike Huckabee would rather support a pro-abortion , pro-gay marriage , pro-gun control liberal such as Giuliani than support the pro-life , pro-traditional marriage , pro-Second Amendment candidacy of Ron Paul .
Why is that ?
Furthermore , why are the entire major media and establishment Republican machine either ignoring or lampooning a distinguished Air Force veteran , medical doctor , and ten -term Congressman ?
What is it about Ron Paul that the elite are so afraid of ?
Here is something else : while Ron Paul 's contributions have exploded , Mike Huckabee is all but broke !
How can that be ?
How can a political " front - runner " be out of money , while a man who " does n't have a chance " is breaking fundraising records ?
So , who are these " kooks " who are sending Ron Paul so much money ?
And just why are they sending him so much money ?
I will tell you who they are , because I am one of them .
They are rank - and - file , tax - paying citizens who are sick and tired of out - of - control federal spending and deficits .
They have had it with an arrogant federal government that runs roughshod over both the Constitution and the liberties of the American people .
They are people who have had enough of the IRS , the BATFE , and a thousand other federal agencies that have " erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people , and eat out their substance . "
( Declaration of Independence )
They are people who see through the phony , disingenuous federal politicians who only want to fleece the American citizenry for the purpose of building their own personal fortunes .
They have had it with the Military - Industrial complex that desires to build international empires at the expense of the blood and sacrifice of the American people .
They have had it with David Rockefeller and his Council on Foreign Relations .
They have had it with the arrogance of George W. Bush and Nancy Pelosi .
They are sick and tired of paying outlandish taxes for a public education system that produces high school graduates who cannot read and write .
They are sick and tired of working for 30 years to pay off a mortgage , only then to be forced to pay extortion money ( a.k.a. property taxes ) for the rest of their lives to the feudal state .
They are sick and tired of the government telling them what they can and cannot do with their own property .
They are sick and tired of watching people with food stamps buy T - bone steaks and expensive Nike tennis shoes while they are forced to buy fatty hamburger and cheap sneakers .
They are sick and tired of watching their manufacturing jobs go to China and India .
They have had it with money - hungry businessmen who hire illegal Mexicans at slave labor wages .
They have had it with labor unions promoting politicians who support NAFTA , CAFTA , and the FTAA .
They are sick and tired of being bled dry at the gas pump .
They have had it with this phony " war on terrorism " that sends trillions of dollars to nations throughout the Middle East , but refuses to close our own borders to illegal immigration .
They have had it with the " war on drugs " and the " war on terror " being used as excuses to trample people 's freedoms .
They have it with Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon .
They have had it with Bush 's North American Union .
They have had it with Joel Osteen and Rick Warren .
In short , they have just had it !
They also know that a vote for any other Presidential candidate is a vote for more of the same .
Democrat or Republican : it is more of the same .
Ron Paul , and Ron Paul alone , will bring a revolution of freedom and independence to America .
Believe me , the Ron Paul revolution is bigger than Ron Paul .
This is the beginning of a movement .
No matter what ultimately happens to Ron Paul 's candidacy , the fight to return America to its roots of freedom and independence has started .
The fire is lit .
There is no putting it out .
There will be other Ron Pauls , other campaigns , other spokesmen , other fundraising .
The people supporting Ron Paul will not be silenced ; they will not be ignored ; they will not be intimidated .
In truth , Ron Paul 's campaign may just be the beginning of the end of the elitist , globalist , stranglehold over America .
As one who is also fed up with the globalist goons that dominate the two major parties , I join the Ron Paul revolution and vow to fight for the rest of my life for the freedom and independence of these United States .
This means I will never again support a business - as - usual , millionaires - club , globalist toady from either party ever again !
I will only support candidates who are fully committed to restoring constitutional government .
If that makes me a kook , so be it .

Mr. Snauwaert said it was up to local communities to make it clear what roads were not appropriate for trucks , and to install signs saying so .
The relevant information , including things like height , width and weight constraints , could then eventually be integrated into the databases used for G.P.S. devices , he said .
It may take months , if not years , to make the next step : manufacturing G.P.S. devices for trucks — or lorries , as they call them here — that take into account the more sophisticated information .
But local governments are working to compile the data .

“ If we can get the right information , then we can start re-routing the lorries , ” said Richard Matthews , the senior transport planner for Somerset County Council , which is taking the lead in pushing for a countrywide approach .
In a survey of local governments , Somerset found that 82 percent of communities had experienced G.P.S. - related traffic problems .
“ I ’ve just come from a community today where a lorry had literally lifted the roof off a house as it tried to get past , ” Mr. Matthews said .
Some communities have begun putting up signs warning drivers to ignore their G.P.S. devices on rural roads .
But signs seem to be less and less effective as people increasingly rely more on G.P.S. systems and less on maps , common sense or their own eyes .
“ We ’ve heard some very hilarious stories where people just blindly follow the sat nav instructions , ” said Vince Yearley , a spokesman for the Institute of Advanced Motorists , using British shorthand for “ satellite navigation . ”
“ Like if the sat nav says , ‘ Drive into this muddy field , ’ they think , ‘ That ’s weird , ’ but they do it anyway . ”
LOS ANGELES , June 19 — Hyped in Cuba , unveiled in Cannes , pirated on YouTube , and rallied around last week in Sacramento , Calif. , by nurses chanting for the health insurance system ’s demise , Michael Moore ’s documentary “ Sicko ” is finally ready to meet its American audience — or at least some of it — a week ahead of schedule .
Executives of the Weinstein Company , which provided backing for the film , a documentary indictment of America ’s health care system , said “ Sicko ” would open Friday on a single screen at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square theater in New York .
Lionsgate , the movie ’s distributor , will otherwise proceed with a planned opening in about 250 theaters around the country the following Friday .
But it is offering “ sneak previews ” this week in 27 markets where Mr. Moore ’s politically tinged documentaries have played well in the past , including San Francisco , Los Angeles , Boston , and Philadelphia , the Weinstein executives said .
“ This gets it started , ” said Gary Faber , Weinstein ’s executive vice president in charge of marketing , who said the early opening was intended to feed growing demand for the film and was not related to the movie showing up on the Internet .

Acid 2 screenshots
This is a series of screenshots of current major browsers ( or browsers that pass ) , rendering the Acid 2 test .
Each can be compared with the screenshots of Internet Explorer 's current releases - currently the most popular browser , and also the one with the poorest support for Internet standards .
Congratulations to everyone who passes ; Safari , Prince , Opera , iCab , Konqueror , ( future ) Mozilla / Firefox , Obigo , Tkhtml , and finally Internet Explorer .
You help to make the Web a more reliable place for Web developers .
iCab and Konqueror almost passed ( and claimed to pass ) before Opera , but they both failed to apply one of the styles required by the test , and as a result they displayed a scrollbar even though they should n't .
This was fixed in later releases , after the release of Opera .
For more information , see my notes about the scrollbar below .
Notes about the test :
The forehead is a fixed position element .
It will stay still when you scroll .
That is correct behaviour .
The test only works when it is at the default position after clicking the link .
That is the correct response .
The test may not pass if you make your minimum font size too big , or if you zoom , etc .
The test itself is intentionally designed to only work assuming a ' normal ' setup , so this is expected behaviour .
Complain to the authors if you do not like it :)
Some of the CSS used in the test is invalid .
This is deliberate .
CSS has very strict error handling rules , and part of the test checks if the browser follows these rules correctly .
Resizing the window may cause text at the top to wrap , and scroll the page a little , so you will need to click the link again - see note 2 .
Making the window very narrow will make parts of the test become too narrow ( such as the chin ) - this is because they use the table layout algorithm , and again , this is expected behaviour .
When the test was written , no browser passed .
The test was intentionally written to ensure that it picked up on bugs in all browsers .
The nose is 1 px smaller in Safari and Konqueror than it is in the reference rendering , and is 1 px offset in Firefox 3 compared with the reference rendering ( which itself was prepared in Firefox with lots of hacks for Firefox 's bugs , just so you know ) .
According to the author of the test , this does not constitute a failure , since this behaviour relating to border intersection is undefined , and either response is correct .
Anyone who claims that browsers should all pass already because it is easy to implement CSS ; when you have written your own engine that passes the test , and still manages to render the majority of Web pages correctly , then you try claiming it was easy ;)
Until then , just accept that it certainly is not easy to pass this test .
Opera
Opera is produced by Opera Software , and is their main browser release .
Opera 9 passes the Acid 2 test , making it the second browser to do so , and the first browser for Windows or Linux / UNIX to pass .
It was the first browser available for download for all of Windows , Linux / UNIX and Mac , that passes Acid 2 .
Although it is the second browser to pass , Opera is the third application to pass , as Prince - an application for converting XML / HTML+CSS into PDF - was second , after Safari .
The biggest jumps were clearly 3 to 3.6 ( when CSS support was introduced ) , and 6 to 7 ( when the new Presto engine was used ) .
It is somewhat worrying that IE 6 renders Acid 2 very similarly to Opera 3.6 , and the hyped IE 7 renders it about as well as Opera 4 in terms of number of mistakes ( which was released in 2000 , 6 years before the release date of IE 7 ) .
Notes :
The screenshots are taken with the mouse hovering rows 6 - 9 , to show if the : hover selector is recognised , so yes , the nose will be blue as required by the test .
It will be black if the mouse is not hovering those rows .
Try using Opera yourself if you need clarification .
The test will not work if you enable small screen rendering or Fit To Width ( with a narrow window ) .
That is intentional behaviour .
Rendering the Acid 2 test on mobiles is more difficult .
The Acid 2 test itself is too big to fit on most mobile screens ( meaning the chin gets broken ) , and scrolling to see it all ( correctly ) breaks the forehead .
You will either need a high resolution device ( and disable ' fit to screen ' reformatting ) , such as the one shown here , or you will need to : Use Opera 's zoom feature to zoom out ( preferably to a convenient number such as 50 % to prevent rounding errors ) .
Disable Opera 's small screen or ' fit to screen ' reformatting ( since the test itself does not have any CSS specifically targetting handheld media )
You might also have to use fullscreen mode , if it is available .
Activate the ' Take The Acid2 Test ' link only after you have done these other things .
The test itself was published in early April 2005 , just a week before the release of Opera 8 .
For what it 's worth , Opera 4 was the first version to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published around the same time as Opera 3 , in 1997 .
As far as I can tell , it was the third browser to pass that test .

KHTML / WebKit Konqueror and Safari
These browsers have a somewhat mixed lineage .
Originally it started out as Konqueror - a file manager of the Linux / UNIX KDE desktop environment , which also included a browser .
At version 3.3 , Apple made their own port for use on Mac .
The two are now developed independently , but are sometimes able to share code or algorithms .
Safari generally is further ahead than Konqueror , but is tied very heavily into the OS functionality .
Both can be used by other browsers on the same platforms , but this is not done very often ( OmniWeb being one of the few adopters ) .
Safari passed Acid 2 before Konqueror , and in fact , before any other browser .
It was also the first public final release to pass , at version 2.0.2 .
Konqueror 3.5 claimed to pass third , but although it got the Acid 2 face correct , it failed to hide the viewport scrollbar , meaning that it failed the test ( although that went unnoticed for a while , until after the original publication of this article ) .
Konqueror 3.5.2 ( public final ) passes the test , making it the fourth browser to pass , after Safari , Opera , and iCab .
Konqueror 3 was the first KHTML browser to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published 3 years before the first Konqueror browser was released .
Acid 2 was published while Konqueror was at version 3.4 , at about the same time as the Safari 1.3 release .
OmniWeb 4.2 - a completely different rendering engine to the others ( included only for the sake of interest ) , and it is easy to see why it was abandoned in favour of the Safari engine in OmniWeb 4.5

OmniWeb 4.5 , using the same engine version as Safari 1.0 Safari 1.3
Safari 1.3 Safari 2.0.2
Safari 2.0.2 Konqueror 3.5.2
Supposedly the Series 60 browser development builds should also pass the Acid 2 test , making it the third mobile browser to do so , but I have been unable to compile it to prove this for myself .
Several other browsers use the same rendering engine , and as such they will pass when they update their engines to the passing version ( such as Shiira , OmniWeb , and RapidWeaver ) .
I will not list them individually , since they all reuse each other 's work , instead of passing the test for themselves .
They are all treated as a single program .
Prince
Prince is special , since it is the first ( and currently only ) non-browser to pass the Acid 2 test .
It is an application that converts CSS styled XML or HTML into PDF .
It presents some unique problems with the test itself , since it does not have a scrolling canvas .
As a result , it is hard to see how the fixed position element is rendered ( perhaps it is drawn on all target pages ) , or how the correct offset is obtained to ensure it lines up correctly ( this may be by pure chance , based on the position of the page breaks ) .
At least it does not have a problem with a scrollbar , since paper - the target medium - does not have such an interface .
The target medium also does not have an interactive pointing device , so the hover effect on the nose does not work , but the test is supported to the maximum extent of the target medium .
This allowed Prince 5.1 to be the second program to pass the Acid 2 test , after Safari and ahead of Opera .
( It was the fourth program to claim to pass , after Safari , iCab and Konqueror - see the Konqueror and iCab sections for more details ) .
Prince 5.1 is also the first version to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published before Prince even existed .
It fails to render the radio inputs , but that is a limitation of the target medium ( radio inputs are not available in PDF or on paper ) .
Earlier versions may have been capable of passing the CSS part of the Acid 1 test , but they could only parse XML , not the HTML used by the Acid 1 and 2 tests .
As well as the limitations of the target medium , Prince also is unique in that it does not actually display the test itself .
It converts it into another file format .
The test then has to be rendered by a printer , or a PDF viewer or plugin .
This means that although its own conversion of the test itself is correct , how it appears is at the mercy of the application being used to display or print the PDF .
In reality , Prince helps to show the rendering problems of PDF viewers .
None of the many applications I tried were capable of rendering the PDF correctly .
Most apply ugly antialiasing that breaks the image , some leave narrow gaps over parts of the image , some do not apply the image transparency , some do not align the image layers correctly , some make parts of the image too large , and some make the image too small at 100 % scale ( some failed to display anything at all ) .
In other words , it was not possible to obtain a perfect screenshot .
The best rendering was provided by Acrobat 5 at 132.5 % scale .
See the Prince Acid 2 FAQ for more information .
The final screenshot was taken by combining unbroken parts of several renderings , with careful zooming and scaling to make viewers provide the least broken version of the output .

iCab
iCab is an independent browser written by only two developers ; Alexander Clauss ( everything except the JavaScript engine ) and Thomas Much ( the JavaScript engine ) .
The browser itself is relatively unknown , and has spent its life in perpetual beta stage .
Despite the development being a little less steady than other browsers ( the gap between 2 and 3 was exceptionally long ) , the overall increase in standards support makes up for the delays , and the jump between 2 and 3 is quite staggering , clearly far more than any of the other browsers .
It passed the Acid 2 test earlier than several of the more popular browsers .
In part this was due to lack of pressurised release schedules , and a very small user base , but also was because unlike those browsers , it did not have to worry about regressions ( where a page that used to work stops working ) , as very few pages worked properly in it before version 3 anyway .
iCab was the second browser to claim to pass Acid 2 , but although it got the Acid 2 face correct , it failed to hide the viewport scrollbar , meaning that it failed the test ( although that went unnoticed for a while , until after the original publication of this article ) .
iCab 3.0.2b400 now has a preference that can be used to allow the test to hide the scrollbar , making it the third browser to pass the test , after Safari and Opera .
iCab 3 is also the first version to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published before iCab existed on Mac - at that time it was the Atari CAB browser .
Acid 2 was published while iCab was at version 2.9 .
Note that for some users , upgrading from iCab 2 to iCab 3 may cause the test to fail , because their default font sizes in iCab 2 were too large to allow the test to pass .
If this affects you , use iCab - Preferences - Fonts & Language - Factory Settings , then reload the test .
iCab 2 - this rendering is based loosely on CSS 1 with many mistakes - very artistic ; to me , looks either like a hand reaching out of a red sea , or a badly drawn character from Henry 's Cat

Although iCab 3 passed the test independently , iCab 4 has switched to using Safari 's engine .
Mozilla / Firefox / Netscape
The Mozilla browsers are fairly well known , mainly due to the fact that the Mozilla project is derived from the original Netscape browser ( although the engine was rewritten ) .
Once the great innovator of the Web , Netscape failed badly with Netscape 4 , and the Mozilla project started instead .
The long and slow release cycles allowed Internet Explorer to storm into the lead , become the most commonly used browser , then to forget about keeping up to date , and yet still remain the most used , despite now being behind the others .
The main Mozilla browser is now Firefox , but the Mozilla suite , Netscape , and countless other interfaces are also available .
Firefox 1.5 is slightly ahead of the Mozilla suite 1.8 .
Originally planned to have the 1.6 engine branch in version 2.0 , this was abandoned as it would delay the release , meaning that Firefox 2 has the same engine as 1.5 .
The Reflow branch has been developed further than the original 1.6 branch , and passes the Acid 2 test , making it the fifth browser to do so .
This branch is in all Firefox 3 builds after alpha 1 .
The screenshot was prepared in the first reflow branch builds that passed , compiled from the CVS source , it was certainly nowhere near ready for public use yet ( images failed to appear on many pages , several form inputs did not work , layout did not cope with resizing , parts of the page or interface randomly appeared and disappeared , and fixed position elements jumped and jittered when the page was scrolled ) .
The released version 3 passes the test without breaking the existing functionality .
Mozilla 1 was the first version ( and as far as I can tell , the first browser ) that passed the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published about the same time as Netscape 4.0 ( over a year before the version shown here ) .
Acid 2 was published while Firefox was at version 1 .

Several other browsers use the same rendering engine , and as such they will pass when they update their engines to the passing version ( such as Camino ) .
I will not list them individually , since they all reuse each other 's work , instead of passing the test for themselves .
They are all treated as a single program .
Obigo
Obigo is a relatively unknown mobile browser .
Teleca recently announced that internal versions pass Acid 2 , making it the sixth browser to do so after Safari , Opera , iCab , Konqueror , and Firefox .
It is the second mobile browser to pass , after Opera Mobile .
It is the seventh program to pass ( Prince was second ) .
They have a small flash movie demonstrating that they pass , and claim it to be flawless .
I cannot verify if it is flawless , as their movie is very poor resolution , and seems to have been taken with a hand mounted camera , instead of a proper screenshot , so a mistake of a few pixels would not be distinguishable .
For now , I will take them at their word , and assume they pass .
Note , however , that users have reported - with screenshots - that subsequent releases clearly fail the test .
Without knowing the version number that is expected to pass , it is not possible to know if the version that fails is one of the versions that Telca claimed should pass .
It must be noted , however , that the released version fails due to only one remaining bug , and it is unlikely that it would be a build created from a branch just before the last bug was fixed in order to allow it to pass .
It is probably a subsequent release that was supposed to pass , but in actual fact has regressed to a point where it now fails .
Thus it could be safely assumed that Obigo does not , in fact , pass the Acid 2 test , and only briefly passed in an internal build that was never publically released .
This could ( depending on your definition ) constitute an overall fail .
Note that I cannot produce screenshots of any versions , as there is no freely available SDK that I could find .
No version numbers are given .
Obigo internal build
Obigo internal build Obigo public released build clearly failing the test , caused by the object fallback not being correctly triggered by the 404 error page .
( The chin is also too narrow , but this does not constitute a failure , as it relates to the narrow window of the mobile device and the automatic table layout algorithm - see the notes about the test above . )
Tkhtml Html Viewer
Tkhtml is a rendering engine designed to be used by Tcl applications .
The Html Viewer ( misnomer ) is the demonstration browser using that engine .
Tkhtml2 was a part of the ActiveTcl distribution .
Tkhtml3 is a new engine designed to bring Tkhtml up to date .
Currently , the engine is incapable of running complex JavaScript ( so many Web pages are unusable ) , but its CSS is surprisingly good .
Version 3 passes the Acid 2 test , making it the seventh browser to do so , after Safari , Opera , iCab , Konqueror , Firefox , and Obigo .
It is the eighth program to pass ( Prince was second ) .
It is also the first version that passes the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published before Tkhtml existed .
Acid 2 was published while Tkhtml was at version 2 .
The first version to pass Acid 2 had several problems with the parts of CSS 2 that Acid 2 is designed to test , such as that it 's generated content support is very problematic , it sometimes fails to apply selectors that it normally understands , it cannot combine certain selectors , it cannot use overflow correctly , it fails with many table styles , as well as font and text spacing settings , the advanced box model ( for replaced elements ) , layering of positioned elements and text , and even borders .
It is amazing that it passed Acid 2 at all , but it seems that the bare minimum was implemented to allow it to pass , before working on the other applications of the styles the test uses .
As a result , many pages work very well , but many look very bad ( most pages on this site show several problems with that version of the Tkhtml engine ) .
A few of these problems have since been fixed ( escape characters in CSS strings , ignoring unknown media blocks , and combining selectors ) , so that most - but not all - of this site now works , but it still has trouble with non-visible overflow , with text incorrectly layered on top of positoned elements , and cannot work with images or counters in generated content .

Internet Explorer on Windows
The only major browser not to pass the test in a public final release .
Not only does it not pass , but it fails quite spectacularly .
Early on , IE was one of the great innovators .
It was the first browser to support CSS and DOM , but since Microsoft stopped updating it in IE 6 , it has watched the other browsers fly past it , becoming much more accomplished at Internet standards .
The few changes in IE 7 , released in late 2006 , do not bring it much closer to passing .
The CSS 2 selectors and max / minWidth / Height seem to make a slight curve at the top , but still a long way off .
IE is showing its age , and it has a lot of catching up to do .
Sadly it is taking much longer than the other browsers , and IE will continue to drag the Web down , for as long as it remains so common .
Internet Explorer 8 passes the Acid 2 test , making it the eighth browser to do so , after Safari , Opera , iCab , Konqueror , Firefox , Obigo , and Tkhtml .
It is the ninth program to pass ( Prince was second ) .
However , IE 8 beta 1 has a bug that cause it to fail when the test is hosted on other sites - specifically the object fallback fails when it references a file on an external site .
This counts as a pass in my book , since it passes on the original site .
However , it could be considered a fail , depending on your viewpoint .
It is clearly less than ideal , but at least they are finally taking the test seriously , and it passes on any site in beta 2 .
IE 6 was the first version to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which was published about the same time as IE 4 .
Acid 2 was published while IE was at version 6 , and was written as a direct challenge to all browsers , but especially IE ( since it had fallen far behind the others , but was the most popular ) .

( Internet ) Explorer on Mac
The Mac version of Internet Explorer that has been discontinued , and is no longer a major browser , having been replaced by Safari .
It is a different engine to the Windows version , and has a very different response to the Acid tests .
Originally reasonably good at CSS , it quickly became outdated and problematic , and it was a welcome change when Safari was announced , and IE Mac was discontinued .
In version 5 , it was ( as far as I can tell ) the second browser to pass the original ( CSS1 ) Acid test , which itself was published while Mac IE was at version 3 .
Acid 2 was published a few years after Mac IE was discontinued , at version 5.2 .

Notes about the scrollbar
Are browsers allowed to show a scrollbar on the test
Part of the Acid 2 test is the style that hides the scrollbar on the viewport ( that is the browser window to you and me ) .
The Acid 2 guide neglects to mention this style , and it is not in the reference rendering provided by the guide , as it concentrates only on the face , but the guide is only ( as its name suggests ) a guide , and is not the official test .
There can be absolutely no doubt that the scrollbar is a part of the test , since it is mentioned inside a comment in the source code of the test itself :
html { ... overflow : hidden ; /* hides scrollbars on viewport , see 11.1.1:3 */ ... }
( In case you are wondering , the spec paragraph referenced by the comment only refers to how overflow propagates to the viewport , it does not say what the actual effect of that should be . )
Some people have suggested that a browser does not have to support this to pass the test .
The reasons being that :
The CSS 2.1 spec says that with hidden overflow , no scrolling user interface should be provided .
. The CSS 2.1 spec says that The key word [.. ] [...]
" SHOULD " [...] in this document [ is ] to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [... ] .
However , for readability , [ this ] word [ ..] do[es ] not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification .
. RFC 2119 states that SHOULD : This word , or the adjective " RECOMMENDED " , mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item , but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course .
.
Theoretically , if a browser vendor thought long and hard about it , and decided that it causes accessibility problems by allowing the scrollbar to be removed ( leaving the user with a potentially confusing interface ) , they could show a scrollbar , and still be considered CSS 2.1 conformant .
However , the test is not about finding loopholes .
It is about trying to get a reliable response across browsers , so that authors can use a style or technology , and know exactly how it will work .
It is not ( just ) about CSS 2.1 .
Should a browser that fails to support PNG transparency , still be allowed to claim to pass , since that is not in the CSS spec ?
Should a browser that fails to support data URIs still be allowed to claim to pass , since they are not in the CSS spec either ?
No , of course not , because whether or not they are in the spec is irrelevant .
They are still part of the test .
Here is a simple example ; I have prepared a simple test , that uses styles from CSS 1 ( and requires HTML and image support ) .
The ethical question you have to ask yourself is ; does Internet Explorer 6 pass the test ?
It 's simple enough .
By all means read the source , and check the relevant part of the CSS 1 spec , which states UAs may treat ' fixed ' as ' scroll ' .
However , it is recommended they interpret ' fixed ' correctly , at least on the HTML and BODY elements .
In my very strong opinion , no , it does not pass , because the question was " does Internet Explorer 6 pass the test " , not " does it conform with the relevant parts of the CSS 1 specification " .
It did not meet the pass criteria for the test .
The test tests what it wants to test .
The test is not the spec .
If you do n't like it , ask the authors of the Acid 2 test to change the test .
Note , if you disagree , please do not email me saying you disagree .
The question is one for you to solve for yourself .
I have already stated my opinion , and you are unlikely to change it .
In the case of the Acid 2 test scrollbar , it is actually useful to be able to hide it , since you can then render the body separately from the HTML element , and display a scrollbar on that instead , which is a useful ability .
There was also the suggestion that a browser 's claim to pass should not be discounted because they failed to apply one style .
Well , this sample shows just one style error ( incorrect float and inline layering , in Opera 9 Preview 2 ) , and this sample also shows just one style error ( a failed margin collapse ) .
Neither of those would be considered a pass either .
This is not a school exam where 60 % is a pass grade .
It is 100 % or nothing .
Almost passing is not passing .
Some people also suggested that since the WaSP ( hosts of the test ) said the browser passed , that browser passed .
In most cases , the WaSP took the browser vendors at their words ( the vendors believed they passed , after all , so that is what they told the WaSP ) .
However , in the case of Konqueror , there was a screenshot showing a scrollbar .
As a simple response ; the WaSP are humans too , and like the vendors , some of them missed the style requiring the scrollbar to be hidden .
And in case you were wondering , the person who announced that iCab and Konqueror had passed on the WaSP blog was not the author of the test .
They make mistakes .
Get over it .
How can they scroll without scrolling interface
That 's right , the test requires the page to scroll when you click on the link , even though no scrollbar should be provided .
I have spoken with the test author about this , and generally , it is included because that is what many browsers did .
It is not specified explicitly anywhere .
However , the CSS 2.1 specification says no scrolling user interface should be provided .
It never said that the browser could not scroll without an interface .
HTML 4.01 says that By activating these links [... ] , users may visit these resources , meaning that the browser needs to scroll the page to allow the user to visit that resource .
OK , it is not very well specified in the specs , but nonetheless , it is in the test , and it is what is in the test that is important when you are trying to pass the test .
The official guide to the test goes on to say that the page may also be scrolled ( implying that this can be done manually by the user , even though they have no scrollbar ) :
If the Acid2 page is scrolled , the scalp will stay fixed in place , becoming unstuck from the rest of the face , which will scroll .
What is a scrolling mechanism
CSS 2.1 is not very explicit as to what constitutes a scrolling mechanism .
It is mentioned in section 11.1.1 as a scrolling mechanism that is visible on the screen ( such as a scroll bar or a panner ) [...]
In the case of a scrollbar being placed on an edge of the element 's box , it should be inserted between the inner border edge and the outer padding edge .
Any space taken up by the scrollbars should be subtracted from the computed width / height , thus preserving the inner border edge . .
However , the browsers ( Safari , Opera , iCab , Konqueror , Firefox , and Tkhtml [ and Internet Explorer ] - Obigo not tested ) still allow panning and / or scrolling with the arrow keys or mousewheel .
So how can they pass ?
Well , for a start , the CSS 2.1 spec neglects to say what exactly should be hidden .
It mentions that no scrolling user interface should be provided .
Different wording .
Interface vs Mechanism .
Like many , I was confused by this , so I asked an author of the spec ( who happens to be the main author of the test ) .
It was apparently intended to refer to an initially visible mechanism , such as a scrollbar .
Panners are not initially visible , and key scrolling does not have any visible indicator .
It needs some better wording I think , but welcome to reality .
But even if it is changed to say that these ways to scroll are not allowed ( meaning that the browsers would be slightly violating the CSS 2.1 spec ) , that would not matter to the passing of the Acid 2 test .
Why ?
Because the test explicitly asks for them to " hide [ ..] scrollbars on viewport " .
They do that correctly .
Meaning they pass .
* Phew * .
Of course , if you disagree , you are free to contact the authors of the test , and ask them to change the wording in the test .
However , note that right now , we have a fairly consistent cross browser response , which is helpful to everyone , and users can scroll if they need to , which is also helpful , especially if things reshuffle when the window is resized .
In addition , they comply with the intention of the relevant part of the spec .
Rogers Communications , the Canadian cable and telcoms giant , has slapped the Yahoo ! name onto the Google home page .
And Google is n't too happy about it .
As first revealed by Lauren Weinstein , co-founder of the People For Internet Responsibility ( PFIR ) , Rogers is testing a new technology on its high - speed internet service that inserts Rogers - centric messages onto third - party web sites .
This alone is enough to annoy the likes of Google .
But it so happens that these messages carry the name of Rogers ' high - speed internet service - which is the unfortunate result of a co-branding deal with Yahoo !.
On his blog , Weinstein posted a screenshot showing how Rogers had bastardized Google with a Yahoo ! - happy message notifying some poor schmuck that he was quickly approaching his monthly data limit .
The message was inserted directly into the page , and the Yahoo ! names turns up twice .
Google Rogers Yahoo !
home page
Speaking to The Toronto Star , Rogers confirmed that this was going on .
It wholeheartedly defended the practice , arguing that it's a lot like a wireless provider sending messages to a customer 's cell phone .
" We 've done customer research on the technology and the feedback was good .
So now we 're trialling it , " Rogers spokesperson Taanta Gupta told The Star .
Gupta did not respond to our request for comment .
Meanwhile , Google is peeved .
" We are concerned about these reports .
As a general principle , we believe that maintaining the Internet as a neutral platform means that carriers should n't be able to interfere with web content without users ' permission , " a company spokeswoman told us .
" We are in the process of contacting the relevant parties to bring this to a quick resolution . "
So the world 's largest search engine is arguing that Rogers has violated net neutrality .
And we agree .
But we'd also like to point out that Rogers slapping messages onto the Google home page reminds us of Google slapping messages into our Gmail page after indexing our private email messages .
OK , it 's a bit different .
But still . ®

New York Times praises Bush nominee for attorney general , Michael Mukasey
By Joe Kay
22 September 2007
The New York Times published an article on Thursday that typifies the way in which the liberal media and political establishment has lined up behind Bush ’s selection for attorney general , Michael Mukasey .
In “ Big Terror Trial Shaped Views of Justice Pick , ” Times ’ national legal correspondent , Adam Liptak , begins with a reverent description of Mukasey ’s handling of the trial of Omar Abdel Rahman , who was found guilty of planning to blow up New York city landmarks .
“ On Jan. 17 , 1996 , after a nine - month terrorism trial and a rambling 100 - minute lecture from a blind sheik found guilty of conspiring to wage war against the United States , Judge Michael B. Mukasey had had enough , ” Liptak writes .
Mukasey responded with “ a few terse stern and prescient remarks ” and sentenced Abdel Rahman to life in prison .
Liptak then gives the moral of the trial : “ Long before most Americans had given deep consideration to the terrorist threat from radical Islam or to whether the criminal justice system is the right forum for trying people accused of terrorism , Judge Mukasey received an intensive education on those topics . ”
In other words , Mukasey saw farther than the rest of the country , anticipating the danger posed by terrorists and grasping the need to fundamentally curtail democratic rights .
Who is the individual who receives such fulsome praise from the New York Times ?
Mukasey is a deeply reactionary “ law and order ” judge , who in his tenure on the US District Court for the Southern District of New York demonstrated scant regard for democratic procedures and the rights of the accused .
In one of his most significant recent decisions , Mukasey ruled in 2002 that Jose Padilla , a US citizen captured on US soil , could be held indefinitely under military custody as an “ enemy combatant . ”
He is a strong supporter of using the “ war on terror ” as a justification for severely curtailing civil liberties and creating an entirely new legal structure under which those accused of terrorism can be denied due process of law .
In a Wall Street Journal editorial published last month , Mukasey supported a proposal — advanced by Andrew McCarthy , who was the lead prosecutor in the Abdel Rahman case — that would create a separate “ national security court ” operating independently of the regular court system .
He also supported a proposal by former deputy attorney general George Terwilliger — a leader of Bush ’s legal team during the 2000 election dispute — to establish a form of “ civil commitment ” to detain “ national security ” suspects without trial .
Mukasey has no fundamental differences with the Bush administration over its handling of the “ war on terror . ”
To the extent that he has voiced criticisms of the government ’s position at times — as in his ruling that Padilla must have access to a lawyer while in military confinement — it has been from the standpoint that the curtailment of democratic rights should be formally institutionalized and that the aim should be to make the judicial system suitably repressive , rather than to circumvent it .
This is a position with which the New York Times essentially agrees , along with the sections of the well - heeled liberal establishment and Democratic Party that the newspaper represents .
It is worth recalling the response of the Times tothe guilty verdict in the trial of Jose Padilla .
The civilian trial was held only after Padilla spent three - and - a - half years in solitary confinement in a military brig , where he was tortured .
The trial was based on minimal evidence , with the government case built largely on the attempt to associate Padilla with Osama bin Laden in the minds of the jury .
The Times wrote , in an editorial published on August 17 of this year , “ It is hard to disagree with the jury ’s guilty verdict against Jose Padilla . ”
The newspaper only bemoaned the fact that Padilla ’s mistreatment made it impossible to try him on the original charges brought by the Bush administration , and also made possible an appeal of the conviction .
The Times portrait of Mukasey is that of a pioneer , someone who , in the words of Liptak , came to the conclusion that “ the urgency of the threat requires tilting toward protecting national security even at some cost to civil liberties . ”
He is someone who , after the trial of Abdel Rahman , became “ deeply skeptical about the ability of civilian courts to try people accused of terrorism without compromising national security . ”
The attempt by the Times to present the trial of Abdel Rahman as a turning point in Mukasey ’s thinking is less than convincing .
Mukasey has been a long - time supporter of strengthening the hand of the state and curtailing the rights of defendants .
A Washington Post article from September 18 notes that Mukasey came to the defense of friend and associate Rudolf Giuliani when , in 1985 , then - US attorney Giuliani was criticized for playing fast and loose with democratic procedures in the prosecution of mafia figures .
“ The Mafia exists , ” Mukasey wrote in a New York Times editorial .
“ It is not the creation of novelists and journalists .
It has exacted a toll of misery that would shame the Inquisition and a toll in treasure that would embarrass the Pentagon . ”
In another case , reported in an article in the Post published on Friday , Mukasey sought repeatedly to throw out a lawsuit brought by a former New York City Police officer , Karen Sorlucco , who said that the police department fired her after she accused a senior officer of rape .
Mukasey first dismissed the case before it went to trial , but a higher court overruled this decision .
After the jury found in favor of Sorlucco , Mukasey attempted to overturn the verdict .
A higher court again had to overrule him .
From this incident , which indicates Mukasey ’s close ties to the New York City police , ties shared by Giuliani , the Post concludes sympathetically that it “ showed a judge insistent on doing what he felt the law compelled , even when a jury and higher court disagreed . ”
The media has seized on the line , promoted by Mukasey supporters in the Democratic Party , including New York Senator Charles Schumer , that the judge is “ independent ” and “ intelligent . ”
A more accurate picture is given by Ronald L. Kuby , a defense lawyer in the case of Sheik Abdel Rahman , who noted to the Times , “ [ Mukasey ] was violating the rights of Arabs before it was popular . ”
Speaking of the Abdel Rahman case , Kuby noted , “ It was very much like trying a case with two prosecutors , one of whom was wearing a black robe and was considerably more intelligent than the one hired for the job . ”
The Times article by Liptak notes that Kuby was removed from the case by Mukasey on conflict of interest grounds , while “ other defense lawyers generally praised Judge Mukasey ’s handling of the case . ”
In fact , the removal of Kuby on dubious grounds was itself an example of Mukasey ’s attitude to the democratic rights of the accused .
A Times article published on August 26 , 1994 noted that with Mukasey ’s decision , “ lawyers who have been most in demand by various defendants , and who have been the most visible public advocates of those accused , have now been entirely squeezed out of the case in what has to be seen as a major victory for the Government . ”
The Times article , and the almost certain Senate confirmation of Mukasey with the overwhelming support of the Democratic Party , is one more indication of the essential unanimity within the American ruling elite on the evisceration of democratic rights .

There has been an explosion in recent ...
A lucky coincidence of economics is responsible for routing much of the world 's internet and telephone traffic through switching points in the United States , where , under legislation introduced this week , the U.S. National Security Agency will be free to continue tapping it .
Leading House Democrats introduced the so - called RESTORE Act ( .pdf ) Tuesday that allows the nation 's spies to maintain permanent eavesdropping stations inside United States switching centers .
Telecom and internet experts interviewed by Wired News say the bill will give the NSA legal access to a torrent of foreign phone calls and internet traffic that travels through American soil on its way someplace else .
But contrary to recent assertions by Bush administration officials , the proportion of international traffic entering the United States is dropping , not increasing , experts say .
International phone and internet traffic flows through the United States largely because of pricing models established more than 100 years ago in the International Telecommunication Union to handle international phone calls .
Under those ITU tariffs , smaller and developing countries charge higher fees to accept calls than the U.S. - based carriers do , which can make it cheaper to route phone calls through the United States than directly to a neighboring country .
" Carriers shop around for the best price for termination , " says Stephan Beckert , the research director at Telegeography , a communications - traffic research firm .
The United States , where the internet was invented , was also home to the first internet backbone .
Combine that architectural advantage with the pricing disparity inherited from the phone networks , and the United States quickly became the center of cyberspace as the internet gained international penetration in the 1990s .
In those early days , internet traffic from one Asian country often bounced through the first West Coast internet - exchange point , the San Jose - based MAE West , says Bill Woodcock , the research director for Packet Clearing House , which helps create packet - exchange points around the world .
While nobody outside the intelligence community knows the exact volume of international telephone and internet traffic that crosses U.S. borders , experts agree that it bounces off a handful of key telephone switches and perhaps a dozen IXPs in coastal cities near undersea fiber - optic cable landings , particularly Miami , Los Angeles , New York and the San Francisco Bay Area .
Miami sees most of the internet traffic between South America and the rest of the world , including traffic passing from one South American country to another , says Bill Manning , the managing partner of ep.net .
" Basically they backhaul to the United States , do the switch and haul it back down since ( it's ) cheaper than crossing their international borders . "
And some internet traffic traveling from Asia to Europe still crosses the entire breadth of the United States , entering in Los Angeles and exiting in New York , says Woodcock .
For voice traffic , the NSA could scoop up an astounding amount of telephone calls by simply choosing the right facilities , according to Beckert , though he says NSA officials " make a big deal out of naming them . "
" There are about three or four buildings you need to tap , " Beckert says .
" In L.A. there is 1 Wilshire ; in New York , 60 Hudson , and in Miami , the NAP of the Americas . "
The United States ' role as an international communications hub came at a convenient time for the National Security Agency , which in the 1990s began confronting a world moving away from easily - intercepted microwave and satellite communications , and toward fiber optics , which are difficult and expensive to tap .
Press leaks in recent months have revealed that the NSA began tapping the U.S. communications hubs for purely international traffic shortly after 9/11 , at the same time that it began monitoring communications between U.S. citizens and foreigners as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
After the Democrats took over Congress in 2007 , the administration put the NSA surveillance programs under the supervision of a secretive spying court , which ruled shortly thereafter that wiretapping U.S. - based facilities without a warrant was illegal , even for the purpose of harvesting foreign communications .
In August , Congress granted the NSA " emergency " temporary powers to continue the surveillance , which are set to expire in February .
The RESTORE Act ( the Responsible Electronic Surveillance That is Overseen Reviewed and Effective Act of 2007 ) is the Democrat 's effort to extend that power indefinitely , while including some safeguards against abuse .
It would legalize both the foreign - to - foreign intercepts , and the domestic - to - foreign surveillance associated with the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
The bill enjoys wide support in the House , but on Wednesday President Bush vowed to veto any surveillance legislation that does n't extend retroactive legal immunity to telephone companies who cooperated in the NSA 's domestic surveillance before it was legalized – a provision absent from the RESTORE Act .
AT&T , which is facing a class - action lawsuit for allegedly wiretapping the internet on behalf of the NSA , is reportedly among the companies lobbying hard for immunity .
Experts say that , even with a stamp of approval from Congress , the growth of international communications networks will eventually rob the NSA of its home - field advantage in inspecting foreign communications .
" The creation of alternative paths are starting to challenge the dominant position the U.S. has , " Manning says , adding that the changes will not be welcomed by U.S. intelligence services .
Exchanges in Hong Kong and London are emerging as local hubs for Asian and European traffic , while new fiber cables running north and south from Japan around to Europe will divert traffic from the trans - America route .
Meanwhile , more countries are building their own internal internet exchanges .
" Because the decisions are made by the private sector , you 're always going to go the direction where you have the cheapest fiber , " Woodcock says .
" That 's likely to be through the U.S. for a while yet , ( but ) that 's changing as more and more fiber gets installed around South Asia . "
Manning points to South Africa as an example of how countries are creating their own internet exchanges .
" In South Africa for a long time , ISPs did n't talk to each other and would backhaul traffic to the U.S. or Europe , " Manning said .
" What they have done in last 10 years , they have built local exchange points and fixed regulatory conditions to allow cross exchange of traffic . "
The trend may leave U.S. spooks longing for a simpler time ; like 1992 , when the first – and at the time , only – internet exchange point , called MAE - East , was erected in Washington D.C .
" All the traffic in the world went through Washington , " Woodcock says .
" But it was coincidence that it was Washington , more or less , and it was private - sector .
And it probably was n't tapped for at least a couple of years . "
Pamela Druckerman does n't look like the world 's leading authority on infidelity .
She looks like the primary - school teacher all the dads fancy ; or one of those second - generation yummy mummies , the kind who sets up a stall in a farmers ' market selling fashionable cupcakes .
She sits in the window of a patisserie in North London ; a super - pretty , soft , smiley blonde , with a latte and a laptop .
She 's involuntarily fixating on passing Bugaboos .
' My husband said he might walk by with our daughter , ' she says .
She 's American , and even though her husband is British , and they have spent the past four years living in Paris , her accent endures .
' I can't help checking out all the prams .
It 's a reflex . '
She smiles .
I expected something a lot less wholesome from someone who 's spent the past three years immersed in the world of international adultery .
Pamela Druckerman has written the definitive guide on it .
Lust In Translation : The Rules Of Infidelity from Tokyo to Tennessee is the result of a long study of the world 's philanderers .
Druckerman has crunched numbers , collated evidence , and acquainted herself with the lexicon of adultery in two dozen cities in 10 different countries across the world .
She has interviewed adulterers ( one - off ; serial ; recovering ; flagrant ; and tortured ) and cuckolds ( or ' men who wear green hats ' according to the Chinese ) in Moscow , Kazakhstan , London , New York , Paris , Indonesia , South America and beyond ...
She discovered that the Japanese do n't count it as infidelity if they 've paid for it , and that the best thing that can happen to them in one of their famous sex clubs is ' oral sex without showering first ' .
She discovered that 40 per cent of Russians surveyed think affairs are ' not at all wrong ' or ' not always wrong ' , and that upper - class Muscovites think affairs conducted at beach clubs do not compromise wedding vows one iota .
She discovered that Indonesian women in extremely traditional Islamic marriages ' have affairs , and the reasons they give for them are exactly the same as the reasons my girlfriends in New York City gave : my husband does n't listen to me , I need someone who'll make me feel smart and pretty again ; my husband does n't do that , but my boyfriend does ...'
She discovered that on average the British cheat more than the Americans - and the French .
The book - which has yet to be published in Britain - has set the US on fire .
Druckerman has been hauled over the coals on assorted American radio call - in shows on a twice - daily basis ever since .
Days before we meet , she did a 20 - minute live feed from Paris for Al Jazeera : ' So I prepared all this serious research into infidelity in Muslim countries ; and all they wanted to know was : how do the Japanese do it ?
What do those guys like ?'
But how much adultery can one person take ?
Is n't it getting a bit repetitive ?
' No way ! ' she says , with absolute glee .
' It is endlessly fascinating . '
Oh , but is n't it ?
Increasingly , infidelity seems to be the single greatest fascination of our age .
We 're all at it , are n't we ?
In some way or another ?
Eight months ago , I interviewed a psychologist called Esther Perel , who had written a book on the absence of sex in marriages and long - term relationships .
When I attempted to get anecdotal evidence from people on the subject , they routinely responded : ' People in long - term relationships have lots of sex ; just not with each other . '
Hard stats on cheating are thin on the ground , and those that exist tend to be flawed .
Furthermore , individual definitions on what qualifies as cheating vary dramatically .
In the course of her world tour of extramarital sex , Druckerman stopped off in the UK , where she met Edwina Currie and interviewed her about the affair she had with John Major ; she also met a high - earning , very married investment banker who is working his way through a spreadsheet of sexual goals .
Still , her statistics suggest that Britons do n't cheat all that much - some 9.3 per cent of men aged 16 - 44 and 5.1 per cent of women admitted to sleeping with someone other than their regular partner within the last year .
According to psychotherapist Brett Kahr , however , who collaborated with polling organisation YouGov on the biggest - ever survey of British sexual habits , and published his findings in February , there 's a lot more of it about than that .
' According to conservative estimates , 11 million Britons will have indulged in an extramarital kiss at some point ...
Britons do seem to become more unfaithful as time progresses ... of those aged between 18 and 29 , 12 per cent will have had oral sex outside a steady relationship .
For those aged between 30 and 50 , that figure rises to 20 per cent ... and among the over - 50s , 30 per cent have had vaginal sex with someone other than his or her regular partner ...'
Even if we 're not committing adultery , or being cheated on by a spouse , we 're wrapped up in it somehow .
We 're caught up in a friend or a family member 's affair ; covering for them when they 're on illicit dates , or picking up the pieces when they 're discovered .
Or we 're obsessing over the public infidelities committed by our celebrities and politicians .
From the Sarkozys to the ( alleged ) Beckhams , John Prescott to the ( alleged ) Brangelina - Aniston love triangle ... a public relationship without an infidelity seems two - dimensional to us .
' A happily married celebrity couple - who cares , right ? ' asks Pamela Druckerman .
Infidelity 's got sex , glamour , excitement , romance , lies , potential heartbreak and high risk .
That 's why it 's a recurring motif in films and songs .
It 's one of the few bits of filmic life that we could transpose into our own , generally prosaic lives , if we dared .
Best of all - adultery 's really , really bad .
Oh , how we disapprove of infidelity !
How guilty we are about our own , and how censorious about other people 's ...
No wonder we 're hooked .
Druckerman began thinking about adultery in international terms when her day job - as a financial journalist - required her to relocate to South America .
Once there , she says , she found that married men routinely propositioned her .
She was shocked ; she also began realising ' how very American I am about this ' .
She lived and worked in four very different cities ( São Paulo , Buenos Aires , Jerusalem and New York ) , during her twenties , ' when I was dating , right ? ' and was increasingly intrigued by fluctuating attitudes towards infidelity .
In her late twenties and early thirties , her friends started getting married , and 'everyone was asking themselves that same question : can I realistically sleep with only this person for the rest of my life ? '
Druckerman began researching international attitudes to infidelity in earnest .
Lust In Translation is an excellent book .
It 's funny , it 's compulsive , it 's surprising , it 's the million soap operas that make up other people 's love lives .
But it also raises an important issue .
At the core of the book is a possibility : does fidelity matter that much ?
If we 're all cheating , or thinking about cheating ; if other countries and cultures have completely different attitudes towards it , if some of them honestly do n't associate infidelity with guilt ( ' I 'd ask them if they felt guilty about their affairs , and they actually could n't understand the question ! ' ) , then why has it become so taboo in the UK , and are we doing ourselves a massive disservice in making it taboo ?
Druckerman 's book is written from the perspective of an American - and America is famously high - minded about infidelity .
A 2006 Gallup poll discovered that Americans are more comfortable with polygamy and human cloning than they are infidelity ; the whole Clinton - Lewinsky furore hinged on the idea that Bill Clinton had cheated on his wife , and that this automatically meant he was capable of all manner of depravities , and thus unfit to be president .
But Druckerman thinks the UK increasingly embraces the American ideal on infidelity by buying into what she identifies as ' the American script ' .
The ' script ' is our communal idea of affairs , and of how an affair and the aftermath of an affair should be played out ; a blueprint , almost .
It dictates our behaviour in an affair situation to a terrifying degree , even when it 's contrary to how we actually want to act .
The key points of the American script resonate so strongly , it 's almost tedious .
For example - the first rule of infidelity in the US and the UK is that it becomes understandable , borderline - permissible even , if the prospective cheat says they 're unhappy in their marriage .
' And of course , ' says Druckerman , 'everyone has flaws in their marriages , things that are n't quite perfect ... but here and the US , you start complaining about your marriage , and that way , you 're not some lousy guy who cheats on his wife because he wants sex , you 're a puppy dog who 's looking for love . '
Which might sound so trite that it hardly merits comment - until you consider the Japanese script , in which a cheating man praises his wife to his girlfriend , to demonstrate that he 's a good husband .
' The French , for example , are much more comfortable with the idea that their affair partner is just that - an affair partner , ' Druckerman says .
' In America or the UK , because people are so uncomfortable having an affair , what they do is start thinking about marrying their affair partner , and then they start talking in those terms to their affair partner , even though actually things at home are OK and their affair partner is not someone they 'd consider marrying if they were single .
The American and the British are the worst at communicating that they want to keep it " clean " ; and anyway , they 've already complained about their marriage in order to legitimise the affair in the first place .
So what do they then say to the woman who expects that she 's going to become the new wife ?
They can't say : " actually , I love my current wife . " '
For the aftermath of an affair , the American script goes into overdrive .
' Well , there 's the one - strike - and - you 're - out rule : an affair , even a one - night stand , means a marriage is over .
That 's a very American and British idea .
I spoke to women who , on discovering that their husbands had cheated , immediately packed a bag and left , because that 's " what you do " .
Not because that 's what they wanted to do - they just thought that was the rule .
They did n't even seem to realise there were other options .
And then - all those people who discover an affair , and then say : " It 's not the cheating , it 's the lies I can't stand ! "
I mean , really , like they 're reading from a script !'
The coda to the American script - and , increasingly , in the UK - is the inevitable recourse to therapy .
' This idea that the only way to mend the relationship post - affair is through therapy , is unique to the American script , ' says Druckerman .
Druckerman talks about the ' entrepreneurs ' who build a business on the aftermath of infidelity - the therapists and couples counsellors .
She points out that there 's an entire industry with a serious financial stake in upholding the idea that cheating is desperately serious , a symptom of a deeply flawed marriage , of two people who need to be cured .
Does Druckerman think that couples therapy is an exploitative , harmful waste of money ?
' I 'm not totally cynical about it .
I know a lot of people who have been helped by it .
But I do think at the heart of it there 's an idea that the only way to heal is with total transparency , by revealing exactly what was involved in the affair , blow job by blow job , and I 've seen no evidence that this openness helps anyone .
And I mean , this can go on and on and on - 80 - year - old women who have the moral high ground on their marriage , because of a one - night stand their husband had 40 years earlier ...'
Druckerman insists that Lust In Translation is not a self - help volume ; rather , that she 's just making a series of observations .
However , it 's hard not to read some level of criticism into her perspective on the American and British attitude towards cheating .
Druckerman has lived in Paris for four years , and while she says that received wisdom on the French and affairs is wildly exaggerated , they do nevertheless ' consider affairs to be part of the fairytale of a marriage , and not , as we do , a complete rupture in it .
They have n't mastered infidelity by any means , but I do think their approach might be healthier ' .
Maybe , Druckerman thinks , if we acknowledged from the beginning that infidelities can and do happen , we'd be better equipped to repair a relationship afterwards .
' Because we often do recover in the end .
We may start out the door at first , but we come back . '
Druckerman also thinks the French approach to infidelity is superior , because it encourages the adulterer to at least try to enjoy the affair a little .
' I mean , ' she says , 'if you 're going to do it anyway , at least enjoy the sex .
Have you seen that Kate Winslet film , Little Children , where she 's having an affair and , while she 's actually having sex with this guy , he starts crying out : " What am I doing ?
What am I doing ? " '
Druckerman laughs .
I tell her I have heard of comparable real - life incidents .
' Oh right - people who get naked with their affair partners , but wo n't have sex because they 're too guilty ?
I mean , talk about ruining it !'
Halfway through writing Lust In Translation , Pamela Druckerman got married .
' I was juggling adultery stats and florists ' numbers , ' she says .
The book did n't put her off ?
' It changed the way I went into marriage .
A lot of Americans I know would assume that they and their partners were going to be perfectly faithful .
I still meet people who say : " We 're so solid , it 's not even an issue for us . "
And that makes it all the more devastating when it happens .
Part of the trauma is thinking that it never will happen , and so when it does , all your assumptions about the world are turned upside - down .
' So while I still very much aspire toward fidelity , for me and my husband - ha ! if one can [ aspire ] for someone else ?
- if one of us cheated , it would be less of a shock .
Although probably not less of a devastation .
And I hope that having lived in France for four years , my assumptions would be more French .
I would n't assume that the marriage was automatically over , or that I had to pay someone to usher us through the pain . '
Ultimately , Druckerman does think that infidelity is a big deal .
She says that , wherever she went , whatever the local script on infidelity dictated , the one recurring motif was heartbreak , if the infidelity was uncovered .
' It always hurts , ' she says .
' People might expect it , they might not be surprised , they might not leave the relationship because , hey , the next guy 's gonna do it too , right ?
... but they will still be hurt . '
She is , however , unconvinced that it's as big a deal as received wisdom in the US and UK would have us believe .
Ultimately , Druckerman invokes Hillary Clinton , who reveals in her new autobiography that , although she considered leaving her husband on hearing about his affair with Monica Lewinsky , she realised that ' worse things happen in a marriage ' .
Druckerman thinks this attitude might permeate the American script on infidelity , in the fullness of time .
' I hope it will , ' she says .
For her part , she 's going to keep researching .
She does n't have a choice .
Druckerman says she can't go to a dinner party without someone tracking her down .
' They 'll say : " you remember what happened when I saw you last time ? " ... and I 'll be thinking , now , are you the one who 's considering running off with her gynaecologist , or was that someone else ...?
Because of course , for lots of us , affairs are the biggest , most exciting thing that ever happens to us ...'
And that is why we 'll keep having them .

Many of the Iraqi dancers are in their early teens
It 's here that men come from far and wide - car number plates are not just from Syria but Iraq and Saudi Arabia - to watch young women dancing .
Most of the dancers are teenagers and many of them are Iraqi refugees .
They dance for the cash which gets tossed onto the stage .
The dancers are surrounded by bodyguards , to stop them being touched by the men .
But the guards also arrange for their charges to be paid for sex with members of the audience .
A woman came to my mother , who agreed to send me to these places .
We needed the money
Rafif
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees have moved to Syria and Jordan during the past four years , escaping the violence and instability that followed the US - led toppling of Saddam Hussein .
Women supporting families face the greatest challenge .
The Syrian authorities and aid agencies do not know the exact numbers , but many of the women say they have little choice but to work in places like Maraba .
Lost innocence
Rafif is an innocent - looking 14 - year - old , her long hair tied in a pony tail .
She seems barely to understand the enormity of the crisis she is living .
" I have three sisters who are married and four brothers .
They are all in Baghdad .
I am here with my mother and young brother only .
None of my family know what I do here . "
Banned from doing regular work in Syria , she says their money ran out and her mother started looking for other means to survive .
She says she makes about $ 30 a night at the clubs , but when men take her to private villas she makes $ 100 .
She wo n't say what she must do to earn this money .
" A woman came and spoke to my mother , who agreed to send me to these places .
We needed the money .
" I have already been arrested for prostitution and sent back to Iraq , but I came back with a false passport . "
Not all sex workers went into the industry by choice .
Nada , 16 , says was dumped by her father at the Iraq - Syria border after her cousin " took away my virginity " .
Five Iraqi men took her from the border to Damascus , where they raped her and sold her to a woman who forced her to work in nightclubs and private villas .
She is now waiting at a government protection centre to be deported back to Iraq .
Exploitation
The government says police have arrested Iraqi girls as young as 12 working as prostitutes in the nightclubs .
Maraba 's nightclubs advertise services seldom on show in Syria
" Intimidation and shame means the numbers of trafficking victims and sex industry workers in Syria may never be known by government or aid agencies . "
Women picked up by the police are sent to protection centres , which they frequently escape from , or are sent to prison .
" Immediately after we get to them , or sometimes before , they are bailed out of prison , often by the same people who probably forced them into prostitution , " says Mr Jolles .
Many of the young women who leave Iraq hoping for an easier , safer existence find what is in some ways an even tougher life in Syria .
At an age when life should just be beginning , Iraqi teenagers like Nada feel they have reached a dead end .
" Now they will send me back to Iraq , I have no - one there and in any case I am afraid for my life .
I have no hope leaving here .
I have told the government I do n't want to go back .
My family has abandoned me . "
Chinese paleontologists have discovered the fossil of an extraordinary , previously unknown four - winged dinosaur , throwing fresh kindling on a smouldering century - old debate about the origin of birds .
The discovery represents a remarkable posthumous vindication for the legendary American naturalist William Beebe , who in 1915 proposed that today 's flying birds evolved through a stage of gliding dinosaurs with feathers on all four limbs .
More than 40 years after Beebe 's death , that is exactly what the Chinese team has unearthed in Liaoning , north - east of Beijing .
" It looks as if it could have glided straight out of the pages of Beebe 's notebooks , " said Richard Prum , a biologist from Kansas , in Nature , where the latest find was published .
The vivid remains of the dinosaur , like a snapshot of the instant of its death in flight , were found by a team led by Xing Xu of Beijing 's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology .
They named the new species Microraptor gui .
Some 125 m years ago , Xu and colleagues propose , it would have been gliding between the treetops by an ancient lake shore , using all four feathered limbs and a long , resplendently feathered tail for flight .
For the past century an argument has raged as to how birds ' power of flight evolved ; was it from tree - dwelling gliders , or from ground dwellers who used early wings to help them move forward more quickly ?
Xu and his team are promoting Microraptor gui as strong evidence for gliding , feathered dinosaurs as the ancestors of today 's birds .
" What 's really , really cool about it is it has feathers on its hindlimbs as well as its forelimbs , " said Gareth Dyke , a bird evolution specialist at University College Dublin .
" It seems to have been able to use both for aerodynamic function , which suggest gliding . "
Angela Milner , a dinosaur specialist at the Natural History Museum in London , where previous Chinese dino - bird fossils are featuring in an exhibition , said : " It adds weight to the theory that flight may have arisen in small tree - climbing dinosaurs through a gliding stage . "
Saudi women are subject to strict sex segregation laws
The " Qatif girl " case caused an international outcry with widespread criticism of the Saudi justice system .
The male and female victims were in a car together when they were abducted and raped by seven attackers , who were given jail sentences up to nine years .
Press reports say King Abdullah 's move did not mean the sentence was wrong .
Quoted by the Jazirah newspaper , Justice Minister Abdullah al - Sheikh said the king had the right to issue pardons if it served the public interest .
Women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to mix with men who are not close family members .
The custodial sentence plus 200 lashes was imposed after the woman , who has not been named , appealed against an earlier sentence of 90 lashes .
' Astonishing ' case
The Saudi king frequently pardons criminals at the Eid al - Adha festival which takes place this week , but correspondents say that is usually announced by the official press agency .
The BBC's Heba Saleh says the king 's decision to pardon the woman victim is already arousing controversy with some contributors to conservative websites , who say he has breached the rules of religion in order to appease critics in the West .
The US had called the punishment " astonishing " , although it refused to condemn the Saudi justice system .
Human rights groups had been calling on King Abdullah , who has a reputation as a pro-Western reformer , to change it .
The justice ministry recently rejected what it saw as " foreign interference " in the case and insisted the ruling was legal and that the woman had confessed to having an affair with her fellow rape victim .
Earlier , the woman - who is a Shia Muslim from the Qatif area - had reportedly said she met the man in order to retrieve a photograph of them together , having herself recently got married .
She says two other men then entered the car and took them to a secluded area where others were waiting , and both she and her male companion were raped .
The woman 's companion was sentenced to 90 lashes .
It is not known if his sentence was also lifted .
The service I received was prompt , extremely efficient and very professional and all staff members involved in my care ...
It seemed like such a shame .
NASA built Deep Impact to see what happens when you smash a refrigerator - sized object into a comet .
Mission accomplished , science gathered .
But what about the flyby part of the spacecraft ?
It captured images of the collision with Comet Tempel 1 , and then flew on without a target .
Well , NASA announced this week that it has a new target : Comet Hartley 2 .
Oh , and we do n’t call it Deep Impact any more .
That was so 2005 .
Now it ’s called EPOXI .
And if that sounds like an acronym , you ’re right .
Here ’s the full designation : Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation .
EPOXI was originally supposed to meet up with Comet Boethin , but NASA astronomers lost sight of the comet .
They lost a comet ?
Actually , they think it might have broken up into smaller pieces , which are now too small for detection .
Unfortunately , this loss pushed back its next cometary encounter by two years .
So the spacecraft is now heading for Comet Hartley 2 .
If all goes well , it ’ll reach the object on October 11 , 2010 , passing within 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) of the nucleus .
As a target for scientific observation , Comet Hartley 2 will do the job nicely .
Just like Boethin , it has a small , bright nucleus .
While it ’s making this journey , the spacecraft will point the larger of its two telescopes at nearby extrasolar planetary systems , and help gather additional data .
It ’ll be looking to study the physical properties of giant planets , search for rings and moons and planets as small as three Earth masses .
One intriguing mission will have EPOXI observe the Earth as if it ’s an extrasolar planet , to help refine the techniques and data necessary to characterize future terrestrial planet discoveries .
EPOXI made a three - minute rocket burn on November 1st , 2007 , putting it on course to reach Hartley 2 .
Before this encounter , it ’ll make three Earth flybys , gathering the additional velocity it needs to reach its meetup with Hartley 2 in 2010 .

Notes On The PhD Degree
Last week at the department colloquium coffee hour , several students engaged the faculty in a discussion about our Ph.D. program .
It became clear that many of the students did not understand the basics ; they were surprised at some of the questions and confused by some of the answers .
These notes provide basic information about the purpose of a Ph.D. program in an attempt to help students decide whether to pursue a Ph.D. degree .
The Basics
A Doctor of Philosophy degree , abbreviated Ph.D. , is the highest academic degree anyone can earn .
Because earning a Ph.D. requires extended study and intense intellectual effort , less than one percent of the population attains the degree .
Society shows respect for a person who holds a Ph.D. by addressing them with the title ``Doctor ' ' .
To earn a Ph.D. , one must accomplish two things .
First , one must master a specific subject completely .
Second , one must extend the body of knowledge about that subject .
Mastering A Subject
Each university establishes general guidelines that a student must follow to earn a Ph.D. degree , and each college or department within a university sets specific standards by which it measures mastery of a subject .
Usually , in preparing for Ph.D. work in a given field , a student must earn both a Bachelor 's and Master 's degree ( or their equivalent ) in that field or in a closely related field .
To demonstrate complete mastery of the subject , a student may be required to complete additional graduate - level courses , maintain a high grade average , or take a battery of special examinations .
In many institutions , students must do all three .
Because examinations given as part of a Ph.D. curriculum assess expert knowledge , they are created and evaluated by a committee of experts , each of whom holds a Ph.D. degree .
Extending Knowledge
In scientific disciplines , research often implies experimentation , but research is more than mere experiments -- it means interpretation and deep understanding .
For Computer Scientists , research means searching to uncover the principles that underlie digital computation and communication .
A researcher must discover new techniques that aid in building or using computational mechanisms .
Researchers look for new abstractions , new approaches , new algorithms , new principles , or new mechanisms .
To complete a Ph.D. , each student must present results from their research to the faculty in a lengthy , formal document called a dissertation ( more popularly referred to as a thesis ) .
The student must then submit their dissertation to the faculty and defend their work in an oral examination .
Relationship To Products
Research Activities
A Few Questions To Ask
1 . Do you want a research career ?
2 . Do you want an academic position ?
3 . Do you have what it takes ?
Intelligence :
In your college and graduate courses , were you closer to the top of your class or the bottom ?
How well did you do on the GRE or other standardized tests ?
Time :
Are you prepared to tackle a project larger than any you have undertaken before ?
You must commit to multiple years of hard work .
Are you willing to reduce or forego other activities ?
Creativity : Research discoveries often arise when one looks at old facts in a new way .
Do you shine when solving problems ?
Do you like ``brain teasers '' and similar puzzles ?
Are you good at solving them ?
In school , did you find advanced mathematics enjoyable or difficult ?
Intense curiosity : Have you always been compelled to understand the world around you and to find out how things work ?
A natural curiosity makes research easier .
Did you fulfill minimum requirements or explore further on your own ?
Adaptability : Most students are unprepared for Ph.D. study .
They find it unexpectedly different than course work .
Suddenly thrust into a world in which no one knows the answers , students sometimes flounder .
Can you adapt to new ways of thinking ?
Can you tolerate searching for answers even when no one knows the precise questions ?
Self - motivation :
By the time a student finishes an undergraduate education , they have become accustomed to receiving grades for each course each semester .
In a Ph.D. program , work is not divided neatly into separate courses , professors do not partition tasks into little assignments , and the student does not receive a grade for each small step .
Are you self - motivated enough to keep working toward a goal without day - to - day encouragement ?
Competitiveness :
If you choose to enroll in a Ph.D. program , you will compete with others at the top .
More important , once you graduate , your peers will include some of the brightest people in the world .
You will be measured and judged in comparison to them .
Are you willing to compete at the Ph.D. level ?
Maturity : Compared to coursework , which is carefully planned by a teacher , Ph.D. study has less structure .
You will have more freedom to set your own goals , determine your daily schedule , and follow interesting ideas .
Are you prepared to accept the responsibility that accompanies the additional freedoms ?
Your success or failure in Ph.D. research depends on it .
A few warnings :
Prestigious in itself Almost everyone who has obtained a Ph.D. is proud of their efforts and the result .
However , you should understand that once you graduate , you will work among a group of scientists who each hold a Ph.D. degree .
( One faculty member used to chide arrogant graduate students by saying , ``I do n't see why you think it 's such a great accomplishment -- all my friends have a Ph.D. !'' ) .
A guarantee of respect for all your opinions
Many students believe that once they earn a Ph.D. people will automatically respect all their opinions .
You will learn , however , that few people assume a Ph.D. in one subject automatically makes you an authority on others .
It is especially true in the science community ; respect must be earned .
A goal in itself A Ph.D. degree prepares you for research .
If all you want is a diploma to hang on the wall , there are much easier ways to obtain one .
After you graduate , you will have occasion to compare your record of accomplishment to those of other scientists .
You will realize that what counts is the research work accumulated after a scientist finishes their formal education .
A job guarantee When an economy slows , everyone can suffer .
In fact , some companies reduce research before they reduce production , making Ph.D.s especially vulnerable .
Furthermore , once a person earns a Ph.D. , many companies will not hire that person for a non-research position .
As in most professions , continued employment depends on continued performance .
A practical way to impress your family or friends
Your mother may be proud and excited when you enroll in a Ph.D. program .
After all , she imagines that she will soon be able to brag about her child , ``the doctor . ''
However , a desire to impress others is insufficient motivation for the effort required .
Something you can ``try '' to find out how smart you are Sorry , but it just does n't work that way .
Unless you make a total commitment , you will fail .
You will need to work long hours , face many disappointments , stretch your mental capabilities , and learn to find order among apparently chaotic facts .
Unless you have adopted the long - range goal of becoming a researcher , the day - to - day demands will wear you down .
Standards will seem unnecessary high ; rigor will seem unwarranted .
If you only consider it a test , you will eventually walk away .
The only research topic you will ever pursue Many students make the mistake of viewing their Ph.D. topic as a research area for life .
They assume each researcher only works in one area , always pursues the same topic within that area , and always uses the same tools and approaches .
Experienced researchers know that new questions arise constantly , and that old questions can become less interesting as time passes or new facts are discovered .
The best people change topics and areas .
It keeps them fresh and stimulates thinking .
Plan to move on ; prepare for change .
Easier than entering the work force
You will find that the path to successful completion of a Ph.D. becomes much steeper after you begin .
The faculty impose constraints on your study , and do not permit unproductive students to remain in the program .
Better than the alternatives
For many students , a Ph.D. can be a curse .
They must choose between being at the top among people who hold a Masters degree or being a mediocre researcher .
The faculty sometimes advise students that they must choose between being ``captain of the B team '' or a ``benchwarmer '' on the A team .
Everyone must decide what they want , and which profession will stimulate them most .
But students should be realistic about their capabilities .
If you really cannot determine where you stand , ask faculty members .
A way to make more money
While we have n't heard any statistics for the past couple of years , graduate students used to estimate the ``payoff '' using the starting salaries of Ph.D. and M.S. positions , the average time required to obtain a Ph.D. , the value of stock options , and current return on investments .
For a period of at least five years that we know , the payoff was clearly negative .
Suffice it to say that one must choose research because one loves it ; a Ph.D. is not the optimum road to wealth .
The good news :
The joy of research :

That nowast quite enough to feed her four young children and her elderly mother , so every few months González caught a bus to Managua , the capital , and slaved for a week washing and ironing clothes .
The pay was three times better , about £ 2.60 a day , and by staying with two aunts she cut her costs .
She would return to her hamlet with a little nest - egg in her purse .
She bought herself one treat - a pair of red shoes - but she would leave them with her family in Managua , as they were no good on the mountain trails she had to go up to get home .
During a visit to Managua in February she felt unwell and visited a hospital .
The news was devastating .
She was pregnant - and it was ectopic , meaning the foetus was growing outside the womb and not viable .
The longer González remained pregnant , the greater the risk of rupture , haemorrhaging and death .
What González did next was - when you understand what life in Nicaragua is like these days - utterly rational .
She walked out of the hospital , past the obstetrics and gynaecological ward , past the clinics and pharmacies lining the avenues , packed her bag , kissed her aunts goodbye , and caught a bus back to her village .
She summoned two neighbouring women - traditional healers - and requested that they terminate the pregnancy in her shack .
Without anaesthetic or proper instruments it was more akin to mutilation than surgery , but González insisted .
The haemhorraging was intense , and the agony can only be imagined .
It was in vain .
Maria died .
" We heard there was a lot of blood , a lot of pain , " says Esperanza Zeledon , 52 , one of the Managua aunts .
González was not stupid and did not want to die .
She knew her chance of surviving the butchery was small .
But being a practical woman , she recognised it was her only chance , and took it .
The story of why it was her only chance is an unfolding drama of religion , politics and power that has made Nicaragua a crucible in the global battle over abortion rights .
This central American country has become the third country in the world , after Chile and El Salvador , to criminalise all abortions .
It is a blanket ban .
There are no exceptions for rape , incest , or life - or health - threatening pregnancies .
González was told at the hospital that any doctor who terminated her pregnancy would face two to three years in jail and she , for consenting , would face one to two years .
" Nicaraguan doctors are now afraid of going to trial or jail and losing their licence , " says Leonel Arguello , president of the Nicaraguan Society of General Medicine .
" Many are thinking that instead of taking the risk , it is better to let a woman die . "
For the Nicaraguan rich , a problematic pregnancy need not be a death sentence .
You can fly to Miami or bribe a discreet private clinic in Managua .
But in this wretchedly poor country most young women do not have money .
Their choice is to go through with a pregnancy that may kill them , or attempt a DIY termination that may kill them .
As a result of the blanket ban enacted last November at least 82 women have died , according to advocacy groups .
" This new law intentionally denies women access to health services essential to saving their lives , and is thus inconsistent with Nicaragua 's obligations under international human rights law , " says Human Rights Watch .
Nicaragua is famous for its misfortunes : the Somoza dictatorship , the civil war , the impoverishment , the natural disasters .
Pro-choice groups say article 143 of the new penal code should be added to that list since it bucks the international trend towards greater abortion access and drags women back to the dark ages .
The anti-abortion camp , in contrast , is euphoric .
The new law , it says , is a beacon in the fight to protect the unborn .
It is time to celebrate .
" Now it is all penalised .
And Catholics agree that is should be this way , " says Roberto González , 50 , a Franciscan priest in Managua .
" The population sees the church as behind the law - behind the pressure that succeeded in getting the government to change the law . "
Abortion has long been illegal in Nicaragua but there had been exceptions for " therapeutic " reasons if three doctors agreed there was a risk to the woman 's life .
Those exceptions were no longer necessary , said the Nicaraguan Pro-Life Association , because medical advances obviated the need to terminate pregnancies .
" The conditions that justified therapeutic abortion now have medical solutions , " says a spokesman .
Pope Benedict XVI welcomed the ban but added that women should not suffer or die as a result .
" In this regard , it is essential to increase the assistance of the state and of society itself to women who have serious problems during pregnancy . "
Nicaragua provides no answer to the debate about when , between conception and birth , life begins .
But in the case of González it is clear when it ended : at 28 years .
According to Zeledon , the doctors left González with few illusions .
" When she came back from the hospital she was very upset .
They said they could n't help her .
She knew what this meant : I think she knew she was going to die . "
Her children have been taken into care and her mother now lives alone .
The only mementos of González 's visits to her aunts in Managua are some clothes and the red shoes .
No one knows how many other women have died , or are going to die , as a result of the law .
The Pope seemed to acknowledge an increased risk to women 's health but Nicaragua 's government has made no formal study of the law 's impact .
Women 's rights organisations say their 82 documented deaths are the tip of the iceberg .
The Pan -American Health Organisation estimates one woman per day suffers from an ectopic pregnancy , and that every two days a woman suffers a miscarriage from a molar pregnancy .
That adds up to hundreds of obstetric emergencies per year .
Human Rights Watch , in a recent report titled Over Their Dead Bodies , cited one woman who urgently needed medical help , but was left untreated at a public hospital for two days because the foetus was still alive and so a therapeutic abortion would be illegal .
Eventually she expelled the foetus on her own .
" By then she was already in septic shock and died five days later , " said the doctor .
Another woman , named Mariana , said she obtained a clandestine abortion because her pregnancy aggravated a permanent health condition .
" I was very afraid .
It was very traumatic not to be able to talk about it , because it is a crime .
The abortion saved both me and the two children I already have . "
The report said the potentially most harmful impact was that girls and women were afraid of seeking treatment for pregnancy - related complications , especially haemorrhaging , in case they were accused of having induced an abortion .
Doctors say they have been put in an impossible position .
" We face extremely grave ethical conflicts , all because of politics , " says Carla Serrato , a gynaecologist from Nicaragua 's state - run Alemán Nicaragüense Hospital .
Ligia Altamirano Gómez , an obstetrician , says they fear being overruled by the law .
" We are pushed toward illegality . "
In an attempt to clarify matters , the health ministry issued protocols last December that said doctors should respond to most obstetric emergencies , including ectopic pregnancies and post- abortion care .
To terminate an ectopic pregnancy is legal , it turns out , because since the foetus is not in the womb the procedure would not be an abortion .
But such is the climate of fear and confusion that the protocols are widely ignored and misunderstood .
The doctors who turned González away from the hospital in Managua thought it was illegal , as did medical staff the Guardian interviewed in Ocotal , González 's home town .
" The ban has people frightened .
You could lose everything - that 's the first thing on your mind , " says Dr Arguello , a leading critic of the ban .
So far there have been no prosecutions but many doctors are unwilling to take the risk on behalf of women who are often poor , uneducated and from a lower social class .
It is a grim irony that this is happening under a Sandinista government - a movement whose ranks once included advocates for feminism and abortion rights .
That was in the 1980s , when the Sandinistas were secular marxists , wore combat fatigues and fought a bloody civil war against US - backed Contra rebels .
Things changed .
The war ended and the Sandinista leader , Daniel Ortega , lost the presidency in a 1990 election .
Church and state were supposedly separate but clerics wielded political clout , none more so than Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo .
His hostility sank Ortega 's attempted comebacks in 1996 and 2001 elections .
In the run-up to last November 's election , the cardinal spearheaded a campaign for a blanket abortion ban .
Ortega , desperate to regain power , mobilised the Sandinistas behind the cardinal 's campaign and helped get the ban enacted just days before the poll .
The former revolutionary , now reinvented as a devout Catholic , was rewarded with the presidency .
Ortega , who did not respond to interview requests for this article , has stayed pious in power .
Last month he whipped Sandinista assembly deputies into voting with rightwing parties 66 - 3 to uphold the ban .
Many former officials are disgusted with a leader and party they no longer recognise .
" It 's cynical and it 's sad , especially when you consider our high rate of sexual violence and very young mothers , " says Moisés Arana , a former mayor of Bluefields .
" Here there is a lot of religiosity but only a little Christianity . "
The Sandinistas may have changed but Nicaragua 's revolutionary heritage has left it with some of Central America 's most outspoken feminists .
That their former comrades - in - arms are the agents of conservative oppression , as they see it , has them breathing fire .
" This is wrong , all wrong .
And we are going to fight it all the way , " says Ana María Pizarro , a doctor and leading activist .
Earlier this month feminists interrupted mass in Managua 's metropolitan cathedral to protest against the ban .
The legal strategy is to ask the supreme court to declare the law unconstitutional - while fully expecting to lose since it is stacked with government supporters - to clear the way for a campaign involving the UN and international courts of human rights .
They expect to get a sympathetic hearing in Europe , not least at an abortion conference in London later this month organised by Marie Stopes .
There are likely to be calls for donor countries such as Britain , Spain and Denmark to threaten to cut aid to Nicaragua .
So far there has been so sign of that .
The campaign 's problem is that at home it is politically outgunned and unpopular .
Lobbying for abortion rights , however limited , is a hard sell to a population largely deferential to the pulpit .
The taboo is especially strong in rural areas .
Edith Morales , an extrovert mother of two in Sahsa on the Miskito coast , is loud and proud when discussing indigenous rights and her impoverished community 's needs .
But when discussing the termination of an ectopic pregnancy she had 15 years ago , an act that probably saved her life , she lowers her voice , as if it was something shameful .
" People here are very conservative , " she explains .
Asked if she supports the ban on therapeutic abortions , she shakes her head , and murmurs no .
At the other end of the country , in Bluefields , Inspector Martylee Ingram has the same , almost apologetic tone .
She is discussing the harrowing case of an 11 - year - old girl , Vera , who has been raped and is now 27 weeks pregnant .
Asked if Vera should have the baby , she hesitates .
The law says yes and her job is to enforce the law .
The inspector shakes her head .
" But me , as a woman and policewoman , I 'd say no .
I feel like she should n't have it .
It 's a baby having a baby .
She might not survive . "
Last month an assembly vote on whether to uphold the law was an emotional and boisterous affair with dozens of girls and women in the public gallery chanting in protest .
Separated by just a sheet of glass , the two sides were a study in contrasts .
One comprised mostly elderly men in suits , some of whom opened their speeches by saying " I am a Catholic " .
The other comprised mostly young women in jeans and T - shirts .
" Shame , shame , shame on you all , " shouted one teenager .
" Daniel Ortega is a rapist , " shouted another , a reference to allegations the politican raped his stepdaughter .
( He was acquitted of all charges . )
Among the police officers keeping an eye on the protesters was a twentysomething woman with a slight bump beneath her blue uniform .
She was four months pregnant and anxious , it turned out , because she had been diagnosed with toxoplasmosis , a bacterium that enters the bloodstream during pregnancy and can gravely damage the foetus .
She watched the votes stack up in favour of the blanket ban and shook her head , but said nothing .
A crime in one country , a right in another : the different laws on abortion around the world
Women who become pregnant after being raped , or whose lives are endangered by their pregnancy , are banned from having abortions in just three countries around the world : Nicaragua , Chile and El Salvador .
These countries refuse to take into account a woman's age or her ability to care for a child and will prosecute any woman who has an abortion .
In 2006 , a UN committee report stated that one of the main causes of maternal mortality in Chile was women turning to illegal abortions and asked the government to stop imprisoning women who sought them .
According to the US - based Centre for Reproductive Rights , currently 26 % of the world 's population live in the 69 countries that ban abortion .
However , 34 of these countries , including Ireland and the United Arab Emirates , make exceptions when a mother 's life would be at risk , and 32 countries allow their laws to be interpreted to mean abortion is allowed in these circumstances , including Iran .
Countries such as Rwanda and Morocco allow a woman to end her pregnancy if her physical health is threatened , with some of the 34 countries in this category saying the threat could be serious or permanent .
Malaysia and New Zealand , along with 21 other countries , specifically allow abortion to protect a woman 's mental health , and this can be interpreted to include the psychological distress suffered by a woman who is raped or the strain of economic circumstances .
Women can cite socio-economic reasons for an abortion in the UK , India and Luxemburg as well as 13 other countries , while in the 56 countries that are home to 39.3 % of the population of the world , there are no restrictions on the reasons given to terminate a pregnancy .

In the article above we referred to toxic plasmosis .
That should have been toxoplasmosis - the bacterium that enters the bloodstream .

Has the kilogram gone on a diet ?
Maybe .
For some reason , the official kilo — a 118 - year - old lump of metal stored in a vault at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures outside Paris — has slimmed down by as much as 50 micrograms in the past century .
The solution ?
Build a better kilogram .
Researchers at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization are cutting , grinding , and polishing a boule — a big crystal — of ultrapure silicon 28 into two baseball - sized spheres ( one is for double - checking ) .
Materials scientists are able to measure precisely how many atoms of that silicon isotope are in any given hunk ( the completed orb should contain 215 x 1023 atoms ) .
Creating " the roundest object in the world , " says CSIRO engineer Katie Green , means technicians have to worry about only one dimension : diameter .
Once finished , it will weigh a perfect kilogram .
Give or take an atom .
Higher Standards
Except for the kilogram , every scientific unit administered by the International System of Units is based on an immutable property of the universe .

破壊のメカニズム研究から生れた「 ミウラ折り 」
──地図を折る時などに使われている「ミウラ折り」というのは、世界的にも大変有名で、対角線部分を持って左右に引っ張ると、ワンタッチで展開・収納ができる不思議な折り方です。
しかし、それを考案なさった方が、まさか宇宙構造物の大権威であったとは知りませんでした。
三浦 いまや 「ミウラ折り」は私の名刺代りになっています。本当の専門は違うのにと困惑することもありますが、「折り紙の数理」のＰＲには良いかなと納得しています。
4個の平行四辺形の繰り返しで構成されている「二重波形可展面」。この形の折り方に、British Origami Society（英国折紙協会）が「ミウラ折り」と名付けた〈写真提供：三浦公亮氏〉
──先生の本来のご専門は？
三浦 40年程前までは 、ＮＡＳＡでロケットや飛行機などの構造物の「強度」について研究していました。壊れてはいけないものを壊さないようにするために、「壊れる」メカニズムを研究していたのです。
飛行機の機体などのような円筒状のものを縦に潰すと、菱形が規則正しく並んだ模様ができ上がります。その模様が幾何学的で面白かったので、夢中になって研究していたんです。
──それは私も子どもの頃にやったことがあります。鉛筆に紙を巻き付けて、その紙を上から手で押し潰すと、きれいな菱形の模様ができますよね。
三浦 まさにその模様です。その研究を続けていくうちに、これは潰れてしまった形ではあるものの、強度は増しているということに気付いたのです。「潰れている」ということが、意外にも構造物の補強になっていた。
このパターンを数学的に研究して、「ミウラ折り」の発想につながったのです。
── 「キリンチューハイ氷結」のパッケージも「ミウラ折り」の仲間だそうですね。
東洋製罐�蠅竜蚕兌圓�、三浦先生の論文を元につくった「ダイヤカット缶」。「キリンチュ−ハイ氷結」のパッケージとして使われている〈写真提供：キリンビール�蝓�
はい、まさにこの 「潰れて強度が増した形」を活かしてつくられたものです。この缶は、開けた途端に収縮が起こり、ダイヤモンド型のパターンがはっきりして、同時に強度も上がります。「開けると変形する面白い缶」として、親しまれているようですね。
Despite the multitudinous derisive references to the supposed quote that continue to be proffered even today , former U.S. vice president Al Gore never claimed that he “ invented ” the Internet , nor did he say anything that could reasonably be interpreted that way .
The legend arose from critics and pundits who plucked a relatively credible statement Gore made during the course of an interview , altered its wording , and stripped it of context to make it seem a ridiculously self - serving falsehood .
The “ Al Gore claimed he ‘ invented ’ the Internet ” put - downs were misleading distortions that originated with a campaign interview conducted by Wolf Blitzer on CNN ’s Late Edition program on 9 March 1999 .
( Gore , then the sitting Vice President , was seeking the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination . )
When asked to describe what distinguished him from his challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination , Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey , Gore replied ( in part ) : “ During my service in the United States Congress , I took the initiative in creating the Internet .
I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country ’s economic growth and environmental protection , improvements in our educational system . ”
In context , Gore ’s response ( which employed the word “ created , ” not “ invented ” ) was clear in meaning : the vice president was not claiming that he “ invented ” the Internet in the sense of having thought up , designed , or implemented it , but rather asserting that he was one of the visionaries responsible for helping to bring it into being by fostering its development in an economic and legislative sense .
The claim that Gore was actually trying to take credit for the “ invention ” of the Internet was plainly just derisive political posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign .
If , for example , Dwight Eisenhower had said in the mid-1960s that he , while president , “ took the initiative in creating the Interstate Highway System , ” he would not have been the subject of dozens and dozens of editorials lampooning him for claiming he “ invented ” the concept of highways or implying that he personally went out and dug ditches across the country to help build the roadway .
Everyone would have understood that Eisenhower meant he was a driving force behind the legislation that created the highway system , and this was the very same concept Al Gore was expressing about himself with interview remarks about the Internet .
How justified Gore ’s statement that he “ took the initiative in creating the Internet ” might be can be a subject of debate , as statements about the “ creation ” or “ beginning ” of the Internet are difficult to evaluate because the Internet is not a homogeneous entity ( rather , it ’s a collection of computers , networks , protocols , standards , and application programs ) , nor did it spring into being all at once .
( The components that comprise the Internet were developed in various places at different times and are continually being modified , improved , and expanded . )
But a spirited defense of Gore ’s statement penned by Internet pioneers Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf ( the latter often referred to as the “ father of the Internet ” ) in 2000 noted that “ Al Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance of the Internet and to promote and support its development ” and that “ No other elected official , to our knowledge , has made a greater contribution [ to the Internet ] over a longer period of time ” :
Al Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance of the Internet and to promote and support its development .
No one person or even small group of persons exclusively “ invented ” the Internet .
It is the result of many years of ongoing collaboration among people in government and the university community .
But as the two people who designed the basic architecture and the core protocols that make the Internet work , we would like to acknowledge VP Gore ’s contributions as a Congressman , Senator and as Vice President .
No other elected official , to our knowledge , has made a greater contribution over a longer period of time .
Last year the Vice President made a straightforward statement on his role .
He said : “ During my service in the United States Congress I took the initiative in creating the Internet . ”
We do n’t think , as some people have argued , that Gore intended to claim he “ invented ” the Internet .
Moreover , there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator , Gore ’s initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still - evolving Internet .
The fact of the matter is that Gore was talking about and promoting the Internet long before most people were listening .
We feel it is timely to offer our perspective .
As far back as the 1970s Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of our educational system .
He was the first elected official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and scholarship .
Though easily forgotten , now , at the time this was an unproven and controversial concept .
Our work on the Internet started in 1973 and was based on even earlier work that took place in the mid-late 1960s .
But the Internet , as we know it today , was not deployed until 1983 .
When the Internet was still in the early stages of its deployment , Congressman Gore provided intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the potential benefits of high speed computing and communication .
As an example , he sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to natural disasters and other crises .
As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and unconnected networks into an “ Interagency Network . ”
Working in a bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George Bush ’s administrations , Gore secured the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991 .
This “ Gore Act ” supported the National Research and Education Network ( NREN ) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science .
As Vice President Gore promoted building the Internet both up and out , as well as releasing the Internet from the control of the government agencies that spawned it .
He served as the major administration proponent for continued investment in advanced computing and networking and private sector initiatives such as Net Day .
He was and is a strong proponent of extending access to the network to schools and libraries .
Today , approximately 95 % of our nation ’s schools are on the Internet .
Gore provided much - needed political support for the speedy privatization of the Internet when the time arrived for it to become a commercially - driven operation .
There are many factors that have contributed to the Internet ’s rapid growth since the later 1980s , not the least of which has been political support for its privatization and continued support for research in advanced networking technology .
No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President .
Gore has been a clear champion of this effort , both in the councils of government and with the public at large .
The Vice President deserves credit for his early recognition of the value of high speed computing and communication and for his long - term and consistent articulation of the potential value of the Internet to American citizens and industry and , indeed , to the rest of the world .
It is certainly true that Gore was popularizing the term “ information superhighway ” in the early 1990s ( although he did not , as is often claimed by others , coin the phrase himself ) when few people outside academia or the computer and defense industries had heard of the Internet , and he sponsored legislation that included efforts to establish a national computing plan , to help link universities and libraries via a shared network , and to open the Internet to commercial traffic .
In May 2005 , the organizers of the Webby Awards for online achievements honored Al Gore with a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet .
“ He is indeed due some thanks and consideration for his early contributions , ” said Vint Cerf .
DES MOINES , Iowa ( CNN ) -- GOP presidential hopeful Ron Paul is raking in millions of dollars even as he remains one of the candidates with the least face time in mainstream media .
Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul 's campaign says it plans to beef up staff in Florida and other states .
His campaign said it raised $ 6 million - plus in 24 hours earlier this week -- one of the largest single - day fundraising totals in U.S. election history -- but he remains low in the polls .
Paul says those polls might be mistaken and insists he has a wide following .
Much of Paul 's money comes from individuals contributing smaller amounts , according to his campaign and records dating back to September filed with the Federal Election Commission .
Paul said Monday that his source of funding distinguished himself from other Republican presidential candidates because his cash did not come from " powerful special interests . "
Watch Paul describe his fundraising prowess »
" In our case , it came from individuals who were concerned about what was happening , " Paul said , " and I have offered an alternative both economically speaking , monetarily , as well as in foreign policy .
" I believe this is the reason they have come and joined the campaign . "
As of last quarter , the Paul campaign received more than $ 8 million in contributions from individuals .
About half of that came from donations of $ 200 or less , according to reports filed with the FEC .
See where the money is coming from »
Percentage - wise , Paul 's fund - raising depends on these smaller donations far more than the other Republican candidates do .
As of last quarter 's filings , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani reported about $ 3.77 million in donations of less than $ 200 , with individual contributions totaling $ 44.3 million .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee reported about $ 585,000 in donations of less $ 200 , with individual contributions totaling $ 2.3 million .
And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney reported about $ 6 million in donations of less $ 200 , with individual contributions totaling $ 43.7 million .
Campaign officials for Paul now say they have raised $ 18 million for their man , but the figures wo n't be independently confirmed until FEC reports are filed at the end of the year .
" It 's nice to know that we are comfortable and can pay the bills , " said Paul , a Texas congressman , at a press conference Monday , a day after the campaign said it raked in more than $ 6 million in an Internet - based drive in 24 hours .
The average donation during the drive was $ 102 , according to the campaign .
Sunday 's totals , raised by supporters acting independently of Paul 's campaign , follow a similar November effort that the campaign said brought in $ 4.3 million .
" Toward the end it was difficult to keep up with all the accounting , " Paul said .
Although so much money was raised on the Internet , the campaign said it knows " good old - fashioned politics " such as knocking on doors in New Hampshire is needed to get votes , according to a campaign spokesman .
And votes are crucial for Paul , who shows up in the low single digits in national polls of the GOP field .
But a CNN / WMUR poll in New Hampshire , released last week , found Paul drawing 7 percent support among Republicans in that first primary state -- and he broke double digits with 11 percent in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll in South Carolina , home of another early contest .
The New Hampshire poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points , and the margin of error for the South Carolina survey is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
Paul has a strong Internet campaign , as evidenced by his successful online drives .
" We appeal to a lot of independent voters and disgruntled Republicans ... who might not have voted in the last go - around , so they 're not being polled .
We also attract a lot of young people who have not voted before , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
Paul said the money raised Sunday -- the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party -- was " a pleasant surprise for me and a shocker for some other people . "
Paul 's supporters staged a re-enactment Sunday of the 1773 Colonial protest against British tea taxes as part of their fundraising efforts .
But he said he was disappointed that his fundraising efforts -- not his policies -- had gained so much attention .
" It looks to me like money talks , and I like to say ideas talk ... [ and that it 's ] my position on foreign policy and the monetary system that should have gotten the attention of the media , " he said .
Paul 's campaign plans to beef up staff in Florida and other states voting in February 5's " Super Tuesday " contests , when more than 20 states will hold primaries or caucuses , a spokesman for the Paul camp said .
The campaign also will spend money on airtime in the early - voting states of Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and Nevada .
Paul , who ran for president as a Libertarian in 1988 , is the sole Republican candidate to call for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq .
Earlier this year , Romney 's presidential exploratory committee said it had pulled in around $ 6.5 million in a 24 - hour period , though that haul included both donations and pledges for future donations .
The current record belongs to Democrat John Kerry , whose presidential campaign received $ 5.7 million in a single day during the 2004 race .

Barry Bonds , who holds two of baseball ’s most cherished records , was indicted in San Francisco today on four counts of perjury in connection with his testimony about his use of performance - enhancing drugs .
He was also indicted on one count of obstruction of justice .
The charges stem from his testimony to a federal grand jury in December 2003 when he denied knowingly taking steroids .
Whispers about Mr. Bonds ’s record - setting performances — becoming the career home - run leader with 762 and the single - season record - holder with 73 home runs in 2001 — grew louder because of his links with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative .
The lab , also known as Balco , has been the subject of a federal investigation on illegal steroid use .
Other athletes , including the former track star Marion Jones , have pleaded guilty in connection with the case .
Ms. Jones recently returned the five medals she had won in the 2000 Summer Olympic Games .
But Mr. Bonds ’s lawyer , Mike Rains , said : “ I am utterly confident that this case will absolutely dissipate when the misconduct of the government comes to the forefront in this case .
Barry is innocent of the charges , this is ridiculous . ”

A former New York Yankees strength trainer says information he provided to the George Mitchell investigation regarding supplying Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte with steroids is included in the Mitchell report scheduled to be released later today , a source close to the trainer told ESPN The Magazine 's Shaun Assael .
Brian McNamee , who worked for the Yankees and as a personal trainer for Clemens and Pettitte , also told investigators that on at least one occasion , Clemens was in possession of steroids from another supplier , the source said .
The source , who was read portions of the report , said McNamee told investigators he supplied Clemens , a seven - time Cy Young Award winner , with steroids while Clemens was with the Yankees , and prior to Clemens joining the team .
" After we read the report , we will have something to say , "
said Randy Hendricks , the agent for Clemens and Pettitte .
The Bergen ( N.J. ) Record , citing a baseball industry official , says " several " prominent Yankees will be named in the Mitchell report .
The paper said the source spoke to a third party who had seen the final report .
" It 's going to be a rough day in the Bronx , " the paper quoted the source as saying .
Mitchell plans to release his report at 2 p.m. ET at a news conference in New York City .
Baseball commissioner Bud Selig will hold his own news conference 2 ½ hours later .
AT ANY given summit on climate change , it is never long before some politician declares how “ urgent ” or “ vital ” or “ imperative ” it is to stop the planet from overheating .
And yet few governments are willing to tackle the problem by themselves .
In practice , what these impassioned speakers usually mean is that it is urgent — no , vital !— no , imperative ! — for all countries but their own to get to grips with climate change .
That is natural enough .
After all , all countries will enjoy the benefits of a stable climate whether they have helped to bring it about or not .
So a government that can persuade others to cut their greenhouse - gas emissions without doing so itself gets the best of both worlds : it avoids all the expense and self - denial involved , and yet still escapes catastrophe .
The most obvious free - riders of this sort are America and Australia , the only rich countries that refuse to put a limit on their emissions .
But they are far from being the only offenders : most poor countries , too , are keen to palm the responsibility for curbing global warming off on rich ones , and to continue to grow and pollute as much as they like .
The problem , of course , is that if everyone is counting on others to act , no one will , and the consequences could be much worse than if everyone had simply done their bit to begin with .
Game theorists call a simplified version of this scenario the “ prisoner 's dilemma ” .
In it , two prisoners accused of the same crime find themselves in separate cells , unable to communicate .
Their jailers try to persuade them to implicate one another .
If neither goes along with the guards , they will both receive a sentence of just one year .
If one accepts the deal and the other keeps quiet , then the turncoat goes free while the patsy gets ten years .
And if they both denounce one another , they both get five years .
If the first prisoner is planning to keep quiet , then the second has an incentive to denounce him , and so get off scot - free rather than spend a year in prison .
If the first prisoner were planning to betray the second , then the second would still be better off pointing the finger , and so receive a five - year sentence instead of a ten - year one .
In other words , a rational , self - interested person would always betray his fellow prisoner .
Yet that leaves them both mouldering in jail for five years , when they could have cut their sentences to a year if they had both kept quiet .
Pessimistic souls assume that the international response to climate change will go the way of the prisoner 's dilemma .
Rational leaders will always neglect the problem , on the grounds that others will either solve it , allowing their country to become a free - rider , or let it fester , making it a doomed cause anyway .
So the world is condemned to a slow roasting , even though global warming could be averted if everyone co-operated .
Yet in a recent paper , Michael Liebreich , of New Energy Finance , a research firm , draws on game theory to reach the opposite conclusion .
The dynamics of the prisoner 's dilemma , he points out , change dramatically if participants know that they will be playing the game more than once .
In that case , they have an incentive to co-operate , in order to avoid being punished for their misconduct by their opponent in subsequent rounds .
The paper cites a study on the subject by an American academic , Robert Axelrod , which argues that the most successful strategy when the game is repeated has three elements : first , players should start out by co-operating ; second , they should deter betrayals by punishing the transgressor in the next round ; and third , they should not bear grudges but instead should start co-operating with treacherous players again after meting out the appropriate punishment .
The result of this strategy can be sustained co-operation rather than a cycle of recrimination .
Mr Liebreich believes that all this holds lessons for the world 's climate negotiators .
Treaties on climate change , after all , are not one - offs .
Indeed , the United Nations is even now trying to get its members to negotiate a successor to its existing treaty , the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
Many fear that the effort will collapse unless the laggards can be persuaded to join in .
But the paper argues that rational countries will not be deterred by free - riders .
They will continue to curb their emissions , while devising sanctions for those who do not .
Under lock and Kyoto
The Kyoto Protocol already embodies some of these elements .
Countries that do not meet their commitments , for example , are supposed to be punished with a requirement to cut their emissions more sharply the next time around .
But Mr Liebreich argues that there should also be sanctions for rich countries that refuse to participate , and stronger incentives for poor countries ( which are exempted from any mandatory cuts ) to join in .
Rather than trying to craft an agreement that is agreeable to all , the more enthusiastic countries should simply press on with a system to which recalcitrant ones could later accede .
The global regime on climate change , Mr Liebreich believes , should also be revised more frequently , to allow the game to play itself out more quickly .
So instead of stipulating big reductions in emissions , to be implemented over five years , as in Kyoto , negotiators might consider adopting annual targets .
That way , co-operative governments know that they cannot be taken advantage of for long , whereas free - riders can be punished and penitents brought back into the fold more quickly .
There are flaws in the analogy , of course .
In the real world , governments can communicate and form alliances , which makes the dynamics of the game much more complicated .
And governments may not act consistently or rationally .
Most observers , for example , assume that America 's policy on global warming will change in 2008 , along with its president .
And most countries ' willingness to act is presumably linked to the severity of global warming 's ill effects .
If things get bad enough , then with any luck everyone will play the game .
ITHACA , N.Y . --
When preschool children were asked weekly about whether afictitious event had ever happened to them , more than half the 3 - and4 - year - old children by the tenth week reported that it had and providedcogent details , according to a Cornell University study .
Even more surprising , however , is that more than one - quarter of thechildren could not be convinced the event never occurred when theresearchers and their parents explained that the events never occurred .
Furthermore , professionals who specialize in interviewing children couldnot distinguish between children telling false or true accounts when theywere shown videotapes of the children 's " recollections . "
" When young children , ages 3 and 4 , are questioned by neutral interviewers , they do very well .
They recall events with 90 percent accuracy , " saidStephen J. Ceci , Ph.D. , the Helen L. Carr Professor of Psychology inCornell 's College of Human Ecology who led the study .
" However , when children are repeatedly interviewed over the course of weeksand months with misleading suggestions -- which sometimes occurs inforensic cases -- many come to remember the false events as true andprovide detailed and coherent narratives about these false events , " saidCeci , whose interviewers asked children , for example : " Think real hard .
Did you ever get your hand caught in a mousetrap and go to the hospital toget it off ? "
" So compelling did the children 's narratives appear that we suspected thatsome of the children had come to truly believe they had experienced thefictitious events .
Neither parents nor researchers were able to convince 27 percent of the children that the events never happened , " said Ceci , awell - known research developmental psychologist who has been studying thesuggestibility of children 's memories for more than a decade .
With Cornell colleague Mary LynCrotteau Huffman , Ph.D. , Ceci reported hisfindings on how suggestible the memories of preschool children are in theJuly issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and AdolescentPsychiatry ( 36:7 , July 1997 ) .
" These false beliefs or false memories appear to arise when children forgetthe basis of an event 's familiarity , " said Ceci , co-author of the book , Jeopardy in the Courtroom : A Scientific Analysis of Children 's Testimony ( American Psychological Association , 1996 ) .
" Young children are especiallyprone to what we call ' source amnesia . ' "
Ceci suggests that when children are asked to think periodically about afictitious event , they imagine a fictitious scenario , initially rejectingits authenticity because it is unfamiliar .
Weeks later , when asked aboutit again , however , they may falsely accept the event 's validity because itis now familiar as a result of having imagined the scenario earlier .
" Consequently , it is exceedingly , devilishly difficult for professionals totell fact from fiction when a child has been repeatedly suggestivelyinterviewed over a long period of time , " Ceci said .
" These childrenfrequently display none of the indicators of lying or tricking ; they lookand act the way children do when they are trying to be accurate and honest . "
These findings have important implications for cases involving youngchildren , including those related to child abuse and sexual child abusebecause in some of these trials children are interviewed many times overthe course of weeks , months , or even years .
In fact , the average child inthe courtroom is interviewed formally 3.5 to 11 times before a courtappearance and many more times informally .
" When suggestive interviewing techniques are used , as in these studies andin real cases , they lead to high levels of correct disclosure when thechild actually experienced the event in question , " Ceci pointed out .
" However , the problem is that they also lead to high levels of false assentwhen the event was not experienced . "
The studies were supported , in part , by a grant from the National ScienceFoundation .
IN THE cause of equal rights , feminists have had much to complain about .
But one striking piece of inequality has been conveniently overlooked : lifespan .
In this area , women have the upper hand .
All round the world , they live longer than men .
Why they should do so is not immediately obvious .
But the same is true in many other species .
From lions to antelope and from sea lions to deer , males , for some reason , simply can't go the distance .
One theory is that males must compete for female attention .
That means evolution is busy selecting for antlers , aggression and alloy wheels in males , at the expense of longevity .
Females are not subject to such pressures .
If this theory is correct , the effect will be especially noticeable in those species where males compete for the attention of lots of females .
Conversely , it will be reduced or absent where they do not .
To test that idea , Tim Clutton - Brock of Cambridge University and Kavita Isvaran of the Indian Institute of Science in Bengalooru decided to compare monogamous and polygynous species ( in the latter , a male monopolises a number of females ) .
They wanted to find out whether polygynous males had lower survival rates and aged faster than those of monogamous species .
To do so , they collected the relevant data for 35 species of long - lived birds and mammals .
As they report this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , the pattern was much as they expected .
In 16 of the 19 polygynous species in their sample , males of all ages were much more likely to die during any given period than were females .
Furthermore , the older they got , the bigger the mortality gap became .
In other words , they aged faster .
Males from monogamous species did not show these patterns .
The point about polygyny , according to Dr Clutton - Brock , is that if one male has exclusive access to , say , ten females , another nine males will be waiting to topple the harem master as soon as he shows the first sign of weakness .
The intense competitive pressure means that individuals who succeed put all their efforts into one or two breeding seasons .
That obviously takes its toll directly .
But a more subtle effect may also be at work .
Most students of ageing agree that an animal 's maximum lifespan is set by how long it can reasonably expect to escape predation , disease , accident and damaging aggression by others of its kind .
If it will be killed quickly anyway , there is not much reason for evolution to divert scarce resources into keeping the machine in tip - top condition .
Those resources should , instead , be devoted to reproduction .
And the more threatening the outside world is , the shorter the maximum lifespan should be .
There is no reason why that logic should not work between the sexes as well as between species .
And this is what Dr Clutton - Brock and Dr Isvaran seem to have found .
The test is to identify a species that has made its environment so safe that most of its members die of old age , and see if the difference continues to exist .
Fortunately , there is such a species : man .
Dr Clutton - Brock reckons that the sex difference in both human rates of ageing and in the usual age of death is an indicator that polygyny was the rule in humanity 's evolutionary past — as it still is , in some places .
That may not please some feminists , but it could be the price women have paid for outliving their menfolk .

I fought Hitler and all I got was eternal damnation ??
If anybody out there in reality - based reality was searching for more proof that right - wingers use some pretty tortured logic , search no more .
This is an except from a comment that was left a few days ago .
“ I ’m reading about what they [ by “ they ” he means the Republican / socialist side in the Spanish Civil War ] did in Spain when the commies attacked the state it is scary .
Especially when you read the stories vs hearing that they killed 10 % of the population of madrid .
Killing 10 % sounds tame you hear that every woman between the ages of 10 - 50 had been raped and how they killed all the nuns is more a cult of satan . ”
That ’s right folks , you read that first part correctly .
Despite the fact that there were two sides in the Spanish Civil War — the Republicans who supported the national , democratically - elected socialist government versus the anti-democratic insurgent Nationalists who were supported by Hitler and Mussolini and led by future dictator Francisco Franco — it was the side which supported the government which attacked the government .
Then , did you know that every woman between the ages of 10 and 50 was raped ?
I know , I was surprised to learn that too .
But I suppose we ’re not supposed to think rationally about how plausible that is , we ’re just supposed to have faith that it ’s really true .
Now , I ’ve skipped over the whole “ 10 % dead ” figure used — because I guess , considering the absurdity of the other claims in that paragraph , it ’s comparably reasonable to assume that 100 % of the dead in the Spanish Civil War were attributable to to Republicans and that the openly fascist Nationalist side , I presume , must have used flowers and daisies and marijuana to overcome the Republicans .
I also figure we ’re just supposed to use faith and assume that since Spain , at that time , had a population of 23.7 million and since 500,000 were killed , that somehow that equals 10 % of the population and not the 2 % that our fancy reality - based mathematics tells us it should be ( source : here and here ) .
But really , it ’s the last phrase there that makes this guy ’s comment truly art .
The Republicans — the people in the conflict who were fighting Hitler , Mussolini and the future dictator Francisco Franco , the people who were defending the democratically - elected republic against a fascist dictatorship - in - waiting — were more like a “ cult of Satan ” than the side supported by Hitler .
Who ever said right - wingers ca n’t be ‘ creative ’ with logic when it suits their purposes ?

Leahy asks for internal Justice Department investigation of Gonzales Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 16 , 2007
Print This Email This
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , frustrated by his own battles with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , has asked the Justice Department 's top investigator to examine Gonzales 's " potential misleading , evasive or dishonest testimony . "
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) on Thursday asked Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine for the investigation .
" I have identified numerous instances in which the Attorney General appears to have contradicted his own previous testimony or the statements or testimony of other senior officials , or where he appears to have engaged in efforts to mislead , " Leahy wrote .
" I have given him an opportunity to clarify and revise his testimony , but he has not meaningfully addressed our significant concerns . "
Leahy asked the investigation not be limited just to " criminal violations " the Attorney General may have committed .
( Last month , four members of the Judiciary Committee requested a special independent prosecutor be appointed to investigate allegations of perjury on Gonzales 's part . )
" I ask that you look into whether the Attorney General , in the course of his testimony , engaged in any misconduct , engaged in conduct inappropriate for a cabinet officer and the nations chief law enforcement officer , " Leahy wrote .
" Or violated any duty ... to avoid any conduct which gives the appearance of a violation of law or of ethical standard , regardless of whether there is an actual violation of law . "
The letter listed four specific instances where Gonzales is believed to have misled the Judiciary Committee in testimony .
Gonzales has been called before the committee several times recently to explain his roles in the firing of nine US Attorneys , which many Democrats argue was done purely for political reasons .
Gonzales 's testimony also has touched on his role in pushing for the approval of President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Leahy 's letter is reproduced below : # Honorable Glenn A. Fine Inspector General The Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW Washington , D.C. 20530-0001 Dear Inspector General Fine : I am writing to ask that you investigate and evaluate potential misleading , evasive , or dishonest testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24 , 2007 , and in previous hearings before this and other congressional Committees .
I have identified numerous instances in which the Attorney General appears to have contradicted his own previous testimony or the statements or testimony of other senior officials , or where he appears to have engaged in efforts to mislead .
I have given him an opportunity to clarify and revise his testimony , but he has not meaningfully addressed our significant concerns .
I ask that you review the Attorney Generals testimony and compare it with other testimony and evidence to determine whether his testimony was in any instances intentionally false , misleading , or inappropriate .
Consistent with your jurisdiction , please do not limit your inquiry to whether or not the Attorney General has committed any criminal violations .
Rather , I ask that you look into whether the Attorney General , in the course of his testimony , engaged in any misconduct , engaged in conduct inappropriate for a cabinet officer and the nations chief law enforcement officer , or violated any duty  including the duty set out in federal regulations for government officials to avoid any conduct which gives the appearance of a violation of law or of ethical standard , regardless of whether there is an actual violation of law .
Potential misleading statements that you may wish to examine include , but are not limited to the following instances : Attorney General Gonzales testified on July 24 , 2007 , that the  Gang of Eight ,  consisting of members of Congress , told him that despite the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General ,  who as Acting Attorney General had found a warrantless surveillance program to be without legal basis , the government should go forward with these very important intelligence activities . 
According to press accounts , at least three members of Congress who were present for the described meeting dispute the testimony that they recommended proceeding with the program over the Acting Attorney Generals objections .
Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 6 , 2006 , that neither former Deputy Attorney General James Comey nor other officials had concerns about the Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) that was confirmed by the President .
In a June 5 , 2007 , press conference , Attorney General Gonzales stated that a dispute with Mr. Comey concerned this very program , though he later retracted that statement .
At his July 24 hearing , Attorney General Gonzales said that there was no dissent about the TSP , and that the disagreement concerned other intelligence activities .
Numerous officials , including members of the  Gang of Eight and FBI Director Robert Mueller have indicated that the disputes did concern the TSP , and that there was only one program .
Attorney General Gonzales in an August 1 , 2007 , letter to me set out a legalistic explanation stating that the disputed activities and the TSP were separate components of a single program .
Attorney General Gonzales said in April 27 , 2005 , testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to National Security Letters ( NSLs ) and other information - gathering techniques that statutory civil liberties safeguards had been effective and that [t ] here has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . 
Similarly , his responses to written questions following his April 19 , 2007 , Senate Judiciary Committee hearing indicated that he had not learned of problems with NSLs prior to your March 2007 report on the issue .
Documents obtained in a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit indicated that the Attorney General had in fact received numerous reports in 2005 and 2006 of violations in connection with NSLs and other surveillance tools .
The Attorney General in his July 24 testimony suggested that his prior testimony and answers were premised on the fact that he was not aware of any intentional violations .
The Washington Post has reported that at least one intentional violation was reported in the relevant time period .
In March press appearances , Attorney General Gonzales said that he had not been involved in deliberations as to which United States Attorneys should be fired .
Documents and testimony obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that the Attorney General attended a November 27 , 2006 , meeting at which the firings were approved .
In subsequent testimony , Attorney General Gonzales has taken responsibility for the firings and said that he attended this meeting , but he has maintained that he does not know who was responsible for selecting the names of U.S. Attorneys to be fired and does not remember what was said at the November 27 meeting .
He has at times placed primary responsibility for which U.S. Attorneys were selected to be fired on his former Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson and former Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty , each of whom denies making the determinations .
In his April 19 , 2007 , testimony , Attorney General Gonzales said ,  I havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that I havent wanted to interfere with this investigation .
In May 23 , 2007 , testimony to the House Judiciary Committee , former White House liaison Monica Goodling testified that the Attorney General had a discussion with her that made her uncomfortable  in which he set out his version of events regarding the process of firing U.S. Attorneys and asked for her reaction .
In his July 24 testimony , Attorney General Gonzales said he had a conversation with Goodling to console and reassure an emotionally distraught woman and to reassure her that as far as I knew , no one had done anything intentionally wrong here .
These and other examples suggest a possible pattern of misleading answers and an effort to avoid disclosing the full truth .
I look forward to your review and report as to the propriety of the Attorney Generals testimony .
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter .
Sincerely , PATRICK LEAHY
Chairman
A review of Dreaming in Code , by Scott Rosenberg .
Eyes work using a page fault mechanism .
They ’re so good at it that you do n’t even notice .
You can only see at a high - resolution in a fairly small area , and even that has a big fat blind spot right exactly in the middle , but you still walk around thinking you have a ultra - high resolution panoramic view of everything .
Why ?
Because your eyes move really fast , and , under ordinary circumstances , they are happy to jump instantly to wherever you need them to jump to .
And your mind provides this really complete abstraction , providing you with the illusion of complete vision when all you really have is a very small area of high res vision , a large area of extremely low - res vision , and the ability to page - fault - in anything you want to see — so quickly that you walk around all day thinking you have the whole picture projected internally in a little theatre in your brain .
This is really , really useful , and lots of other things work this way , too .
Your ears are good at tuning in important parts of conversations .
Your fingers reach around and touch anything they need to , whether it ’s a fine merino wool sweater or the inside of your nose , giving you a full picture of what everything feels like .
When you dream , your mind asks all kinds of questions that it ’s used to asking the senses ( what ’s that ?
Look over there !) but your senses are temporarily turned off ( you are , after all , asleep ) , so they get back sort - of random answers , which you combine into a funny story in your brain called a dream .
And then when you try to recount the dream to your boyfriend in the morning , even though it seemed totally , completely realistic , you suddenly realize that you do n’t know what happened , actually , so you have to make shit up .
If you had stayed asleep for another minute or two your brain would have asked your senses what kind of mammal was swimming with you in the rose bush , and gotten back some retarded , random answer ( a platypus ! ) , but you woke up , so until you tried to tell the story , you did n’t even realize that you needed to know what was in the rose bushes with you to make the story coherent to your partner .
Which it never is .
So please do n’t tell me about your dreams .
One of the unfortunate side effects is that your mind gets into a bad habit of overestimating how clearly it understands things .
It always thinks it has The Big Picture even when it does n’t .
This is a particularly dangerous trap when it comes to software development .
You get some big picture idea in your head for what you want to do , and it all seems so crystal clear that it does n’t even seem like you need to design anything .
You can just dive in and start implementing your vision .
Say , for example , that your vision is to rebuild an old DOS personal information manager , which was really really great but totally unappreciated .
It seems easy .
Everything about how the whole thing works seems so obvious , you do n’t even try to design the thing … you just hire a bunch of programmers and start banging out code .
Now you ’ve made two mistakes .
Number one , you fell for that old overconfidence trick of your mind .
“ Oh , yeah , we totally know how to do this !
It ’s all totally clear to us .
No need to spec it out .
Just write the code . ”
Number two , you hired programmers before you designed the thing .
Because the only thing harder than trying to design software is trying to design software as a team .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I ’ve been in a meeting with even one or two other programmers , trying to figure out how something should work , and we ’re just not getting anywhere .
So I go off in my office and take out a piece of paper and figure it out .
The very act of interacting with a second person was keeping me from concentrating enough to design the dang feature .
What kills me is the teams who get into the bad habit of holding meetings every time they need to figure out how something is going to work .
Did you ever try to write poetry in a committee meeting ?
It ’s like a bunch of fat construction guys trying to write an opera while sitting on the couch watching Baywatch .
The more fat construction guys you add to the couch , the less likely you are to get opera out of it .
At least turn off the TV !
Now , it would be shockingly presumptuous of me to try to guess what happened on the Chandler team , and why it ’s taken them millions of dollars and several years to get to where they are now , which is , they have a pretty buggy and incomplete calendar application that ’s not very impressive compared to the 58 me - too Web 2.0 calendars that came out last year , each of which was developed by two college kids in their spare time , one of whom really mostly just drew mascots .
Chandler does n’t even have a mascot !
Like I say , I ca n’t presume to know what went wrong .
Maybe nothing .
Maybe they feel like they ’re right on track .
Scott Rosenberg ’s excellent new book , which was supposed to be a Soul of a New Machine for the hottest open source startup of the decade , ends up , in frustration , with Scott cutting the story short because Chandler 1.0 was just not going to happen any time soon ( and presumably Rosenberg could n’t run the risk that we would n’t be using books at all by the time it shipped , opting instead to absorb knowledge by taking a pill ) .
Still , it ’s a great look at one particular type of software project : the kind that ends up spinning and spinning its wheels without really going anywhere because the vision was too grand and the details were a little short .
Near as I can tell , Chandler ’s original vision was pretty much just to be “ revolutionary . ”
Well , I do n’t know about you , but I ca n’t code “ revolutionary . ”
I need more details to write code .
Whenever the spec describes the product in terms of adjectives ( “ it will be extremely cool ” ) rather than specifics ( “ it will have brushed - aluminum title bars and all the icons will be reflected a little bit , as if placed on a grand piano ” ) you know you ’re in trouble .
The only concrete design ideas , as far as I could tell from Rosenberg ’s book , were “ peer - to - peer , ” “ no silos , ” and “ natural language date interpretation . ”
This may be the a limitation of the book , but the initial design sure seemed to be extremely vague .
“ Peer - to - peer ” was the raison - d’être of Chandler … why should you have to buy Microsoft Exchange Server to coordinate schedules ?
It turned out that peer - to - peer synchronization was too hard , or something , and this feature was cut .
Now there ’s a server called Cosmo .
“ No Silos ” was supposed to mean that instead of having your email in one silo , and your calendar in another silo , and your reminder notes in a third , there would just be a single unified silo holding everything .
As soon as you start asking questions about “ No Silos , ” you realize it ’s not going to work .
Do you put your email on the calendar ?
Where ?
On the day when it arrived ?
So now I have 200 Viagra ads on Friday obscuring the one really important shareholder meeting ?
Eventually “ No Silos ” got designed into this idea of stamps , so , for example , you could “ stamp ” any document or note or calendar item with an email stamp and suddenly that item could be mailed to anyone .
Guess what ?
That feature has been in Microsoft Office for the last decade or so .
They finally took it out in Office 2007 because nobody cared .
There are too many easy ways to email people things .
Indeed , I think the idea of “ No Silos ” is most appealing to architecture astronauts , the people who look at subclasses and see abstract base classes , and who love to move functionality from the subclass into the base class for no good reason other than architectural aesthetics .
This is usually a terrible user interface design technique .
The way you make users understand your program model is with metaphors .
When you make things look , feel , and most importantly , behave like things in the real world , users are more likely to figure out how to use the program , and the app will be easier to use .
When you try to combine two very dramatically different real - world items ( email and appointments ) into the same kind of thing in the user interface , usability suffers because there ’s no longer a real - world metaphor that applies .
The other cool thing that Kapor kept telling everyone who would listen is that Agenda would let you type things like “ Next Tuesday ” and magically you ’d get an appointment for next Tuesday .
This is slicker than heck , but every half - decent calendar program for the last decade has done this .
Not revolutionary .
The Chandler team also overestimated how much help they would get from volunteers .
Open source does n’t quite work like that .
It ’s really good at implementing copycat features , because there ’s a spec to work from : the implementation you ’re copying .
It ’s really good at Itch Scratching features .
I need a command line argument for EBCDIC , so I ’ll add it and send in the code .
But when you have an app that does n’t do anything yet , nobody finds it itchy .
They ’re not using it .
So you do n’t get volunteers .
Almost everyone on the Chandler dev team got paid .
Again I must forcefully apologize to the Chandler team if Rosenberg missed the point somehow , or if he gave a completely incorrect impression of what was really holding up progress , and my bias — to blame these kinds of debacles on a failure to design — is showing .
All that said , one good thing did come out of the project : a fascinating book in the style of Soul of a New Machine or Showstopper about a software development project that failed to converge .
Highly recommended .
Dès sa diffusion sur BBC , Bodyguard s’est tout de suite imposé comme la nouvelle série la plus regardée en Grande - Bretagne en 2018 .
Plusieurs ingrédients permettent de composer cette œuvre filmographique , depuis la construction scénique jusqu ’au choix des acteurs .
Tout ce qu’il faut pour que les milliers de téléspectateurs se sentent concernés , en plus du fait que la réalisation ait été faite de main de maitre .
Elle est désormais disponible sur Netflix .
Pensez donc à prendre un abonnement plutôt qu’un Netflix gratuit .
Homeland à la sauce britannique
Ce fabuleux thriller est né de la plume de Jed Mercurio , qui propose un scénario empreint d’un réalisme hallucinant .
L’un de ceux qui mettent en scène la vie chaotique d’un ex-combattant , revenu détruit par une guerre qu’il haït par - dessus tout ; une guerre qui lui a pris sa vie , sa personnalité et même son couple et ne lui a laissé qu’une affreuse maladie : le SSPT .
Pour incarner ce rôle , c’est Richard Madden qui a été choisi .
Le visage de l’acteur écossais avait déjà fait le tour du monde grâce à son apparition dans Game of Thrones , une série dans laquelle il incarnait Robb Stark .
Si cette apparition a été pour le moins remarqué , l’acteur se dévoile complètement dans ce rôle principal .
Il passe aisément du vétéran de guerre malade au héros national antiterroriste pour finalement se murer dans le rôle d’un garde du corps anti conformiste .
Alors même qu’il doit faire fi de ses convictions les plus profondes pour être le garde du corps d’une femme qui ne les partage pas , il est pris dans une sulfureuse romance interdite .
Un détail qui nous rappelle furtivement des relents du film américain du même nom , sorti en 1992 et mettant en scène .
Tous les ingrédients sont présents dans cette série pour en faire un véritable Homeland à la sauce britannique .
Une série à succès
Diffusée depuis le 26 août sur BBC , la série remporte un franc succès .
En moins de deux semaines de diffusion , Bodygard conquiert une audience spectaculaire de 6,8 millions de téléspectateurs .
Le moins qu’on puisse dire , c’est qu’aussi bien le casting que la réalisation ont été réussis , rendant les scènes incroyablement réalistes .
Les deux premiers épisodes riches en rebondissements ont été assez convaincants pour qu’en quelques jours , elle rassemble les foules .
20 minutes , c’est tout ce qu’il a fallu au premier épisode de cette série pour faire des accros lors de sa diffusion sur la chaine britannique BBC .
Si la série remporte autant de succès , c’est certainement parce qu’elle met à nu des réalités de la société actuelle , entre guerre au Moyen - Orient et exportation de la violence à travers une fronde terroriste .
Si jusque - là , seul le public britannique a eu la chance de suivre Bodyguard , avec un Netflix gratuit ou mieux , un abonnement , il est désormais possible de visionner les 6 épisodes de la saison 1 grâce à l’accord de distribution conclu par le site de streaming pour une diffusion en dehors de l ’Irlande et du Royaume - Uni .

Science is rapidly increasing our knowledge about the planet .
To affect change however , we must become equally knowledgeable about ourselves .
The time has come to integrate ecological science with insight about human behavior derived from new findings in anthropology , hunter gatherer studies , evolutionary psychology and the neurosciences .
Below the fold is an overview on human discount rates , their evolutionary origins , and their relevance to the mitigation and adaptation to climate change and peak oil .
The debate on the realities of both climate change and Peak Oil has moved from ' are they real ? ' to questions concerning timing , magnitude and impact .
At the same time , expanding research inin economics ( calledin psychology ) , is shedding light on how steeply we value the present over the future , a trait that has ancient origins .
Knowing this tendency , how can we expect factual updates on peak oil and climate change to behaviorally compete with Starbucks , sex , slot machines , and ski trips ?
INTRODUCTION
Much analysis and effort is being made in environmental science , ecological economics , energy analysis , and grassroots blogging ( including and especially on theoildrum.com ) to improve and refine data on our natural resource problem .
But is " education " enough ?
Can reading Khebab's and Euan 's posts about the upcoming peaking in world oil production push us to make forward thinking policy choices while we are still buying $ 2 gasoline ?
Would a report raising the value of the Amazon basins ecosystem services from $ 1 trillion to $ 10 trillion make a difference to those who read it ?
Why or why not ?
The understanding and application of behavioral economics and evolutionary psychology will play an integral role in the battle with the two - headed monster Peak Oil / Climate Change .
This first of several ' demand related ' posts will highlight our innate bias to place more weight on the present than the future via steep discount rates .
Before some definitions , lets start with an example .
AN INTERVIEW
Following the release of the initial segments of the recent IPCC report , I called a good friend to get his reaction .
( After I told him I would post his responses , he requested anonymity – lets just call him Thomas )
Nate :
What do you think about the IPCC report that came out today stating by the year 2100 global temperatures will rise between 3 - 7 degrees ?
And sea levels will rise by between 17 - 34 inches ?
Thomas : I read " State of Fear " by Crichton – most of those scientists are just playing with models – they really have no idea how its all going to play out .
Plus we are in a general warming trend anyways .
Nate : I disagree with that , but let 's assume the scientists are right , even conservative , would you change your behaviours or view of the world .
Thomas :
Dude that 's 100 years from now .
I 'll be dead .
My kids will be dead .
Its someone else 's problem .
Nate :
Ok – what if instead of 17 inches , there would be a 17 foot sea rise by 2100 ?
Thomas :
Well , I 'll still be dead and it will still be someone else 's problem .
Though I imagine the world would be a wild place were that to happen .
That 's alot of water .
Nate :
Ok – what if instead of 2100 , the 17 foot sea level rise would happen by 2050 , maybe not in your lifetime but definitely in your childrens ?
And what about their children ?
Thomas :
It depends if it happened all at once or was gradual .
If it was all at once , I 'd either be prepared or deal with the consequences .
I 'd certainly tell my boys to buy land inland Oregon and California around 2045 though .
Still - a long way off for me to worry about it .
Nate :
Ok – imagine that it happened in 2015 – a 21 foot sea level rise .
Thomas : Dude – you do realize that Dennis Quaid movie was fiction right ?
Nate : I know – just hypothetically Thomas :
Well , I 'd probably move pretty soon from New York somewhere to the Rockies .
I 'd start moving my retirement assets out of stocks and into bonds because 17 feet is going to cause a hell of a recession , not to mention global upheaval .
I would n't change my job or anything but probably would prepare my children a little better to face a chaotic world .
Would everyone know it was going to happen or just me ?
Nate :
Ok what if the Greenland ice sheet melted this summer and there was a 17 feet sea level rise this August ?
Thomas :
Well now youre getting plain nutty .
But if that happened , I 'd liquidate all of my investments , take my wife and kids on some expensive trips to Africa and other places that might be changed forever , then hunker down .
Probably get stocked up Y2 K like , just in case , and just enjoy life as best I could - what can I do anyways ?
These things all have a momentum of their own – nothing me or my family could do would make much of a difference .
I like eating meat and I like my SUV .
Nate you should work for Greenpeace or something .
Though the above conversation is of course only a sample size of one , it effectively highlights two prevalent evolutionary concepts that are related to climate change and oil depletion .
The first is the biological concept of inclusive fitness popularized by Richard Dawkins in " The Selfish Gene " and related to ecology in the famous " Tragedy of The Commons " by Garret Hardin .
This concept of individual selection over group selection in a world of declining resources and sink capacity will be covered in my next post .
The interview also highlights how distant events seem not to intrude on ones daily thought process , until they become close enough in time to affect our normal routines .
I assure you my friend Thomas is not losing sleep over Peak Oil or global warming .
THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN BRAIN
" In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches .
Psychology will be based on a new foundation , that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation . "
-- Charles Darwin , The Origin of Species , 1859
Just a decade ago , an observant generalist could see cracks in the foundation of the standard social science model ( SSSM ) ( and for that matter standard neoclassical economics ) .
It is now apparent these models have fatal flaws and that we are in the liminal space defining what will supercede them .
The SSSM posits that we are born a blank slate and during our lives culture infuses us with our language , instincts and behaviours .
We now know that we have been shaped through millions and millions of years of mutation , migration , genetic drift and natural selection and that we are not born a blank slate but a creature optimized for activities leading to resource acquisition and reproduction .
Culture is very important , but it is the mortar , not the bricks .
Nature and nurture are inseparable , and both play a role .
But we unequivocally posess genetic leashes - some are long ( what do I want to eat for lunch ? ) and some are short ( if Jennifer Garner kisses me , I will . ) .
This post will attempt to go beyond economics and psychology and first look atwe so strongly value the present , an answer found in biology , Darwinian ecology and evolutionary psychology
In " The Adapted Mind " , Leda Cosmides lays out 5 core principles of Evolutionary Psychology :
1 . The brain is a physical system .
It functions as a computer .
Its circuits are designed to generate behavior that is appropriate to the environmental circumstances .
2 . Our neural circuits were designed by natural selection to solve problems that our ancestors faced during our evolutionary history .
3 . Consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg ; most of what goes on in your mind is hidden from you .
As a result your conscious mind can mislead you into thinking that our circuitry is simpler than it really is .
Most problems that you experience as easy to solve are actually very difficult to solve - they require very complicated neural circuitry .
4 . Different neural circuits are designed for solving different adaptive problems .
5 . ( and the famous one ) Our modern skulls house a stone age mind .
Though the revolution started with Darwin , the last decade has put the finishing touches on explaining who and what we are as humans .
There are still some periods with missing links , but from the small mammals that survived the Chicxulub meteor 65 million years ago , through Proconsul 20 million years ago , to the chimp / human split over 5 million years ago , the compounding of slight changes that improved mating , reproduction , and survival of offspring success have honed us into the most successful species on the planet ( by some measures in any case ) .
I 'm not sure what is more amazing , the fact that we evolved from common ancestors of tarsiers , or that we have managed to figure out we evolved from common ancestors of tarsiers .
The ancient civilizations of our history books are only 5000 years old , a time period of 1/5th of 1 % of the time since our ancestors first sharpened stones ( 2.5 million years ago ) .
Genetic data suggest that our species was once as endangered as the mountain gorilla today ( Stringer / Mckee ) .
At that bottleneck and others , what stood between human extinction and the 6.5 billion of us today ?
What behaviours were selected for and selected against ?
Everyone reading this post today is descended from the survivors of that and subsequent periods .
The relentless progress of brain and behaviour
We actually have 3 ' brains ' within one ( termed the Triune brain , shown below ) .
About 1,000,000,000 years ago , multicellular life started to form on the planet .
Simple ' brains ' that responded by moving towards or away from stimuli gradually evolved into more and more complex forms until they reached the stage of reptiles and amphibians , about 600 million years ago .
Since the brain never sleeps , each subsequent mutation or new species added layers ( through the 4 mechanisms of natural selection ) on top of what existed before it .
The ' reptilian ' or primitive brain controls basic instinctual survival behaviour and thinking .
It is here that our ' board of directors ' reacts to fight or flight stimuli , without us consciously being aware of it .
( Indeed , research by Benjamin Libet has shown that our decisions are made 500 milliseconds ( 1/2 second ) before we are consciously aware of them .
" Culture " presumably has the remaining 400 milliseconds to veto the decision since we need 1/10 of a second to process the behaviour ) .
With the eventual arrival of what we now call mammals 200 million years ago , new structures had been ' added on ' to brains - the amygdyla , the hippocampus and hypothalumus .
With the emergence of this mammalian brain ( also called the limbic system ) organisms showed emotion , memory and feelings that led to associated behavioral response patterns .
Finally , in the higher mammals , apes and humans , the neo ( or new ) cortex developed .
This is where ' rational ' thought is processed .
This brain region controls higher order functions like reason , speech and Hubbert Linearization .
But human emotional response patterns depend on the neural pathways that link the right hemisphere of the neo-cortex to the mammalian brain which in turn links to the reptilian brain .
The Triune Brain ( Mclean 1959 )
THE MECHANISM
The mechanism between brain and behaviour is the pursuit of a similar mixture of neurotransmitters that allowed our ancestors reproductive success in periods of privation .
Dopamine , a core neurotransmitter plays an integral role in our short term desires .
If you 've ever bought a pair of shoes you 'd been wanting for 6 months or hit three 7s on a slot machine , or been the first customer at a Starbucks when they opened , you know what dopamine activation feels like .
A relevant medical story has been in the news of late .
Parkinsons disease results from not enough dopamine in certain areas of the brain - a drug Mirapex is given to Parkinsons patients that increases dopaminergic activity .
In the last few years however , dozens of Mirapex patients have checked in to Mayo Clinic with bizarre symptoms - church pastors were having extramarital affairs , normallly conservative people became compulsive gamblers - one person lost $ 100,000 gambling in a very short time .
Apparently , it is not easy to find the right dosage of Mirapex and many of these patients were now receiving too much dopamine .
Functional MRI showing dopamine activation in normal patient vs Parkinsons patient
This is concerning , considering Dr. Peter Whybrow , one of my thesis advisors , and the author of American Mania , suggests Americans , due partially to a genetic bottleneck favoring ambitious migrants , and leveraged by our frenetic culture are becoming ' dopamaniacs ' .
The dopaminergic system is clearly is one of the drivers of our short term behavior .
In short , more dopamine craving means less concern about Peak Oil and climate change .
MALADAPTATION ?
Our culture presents a smorgasbord of options that allow us to ' feel ' like our ancestors did when they were successful .
Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky likens the physiology of two grand master chess players to a marathon runner - the body is experiencing the same neurotransmitters ( presumably , they did not have chess back on the Pleistoscene ) .
Many of the options available to us that engage our neurotransmitters are maladaptive .
Pornography , fast food , arcade games , lottery tickets , etc. all give us feelings identical to those our ancestors were good at pursuing .
But now they often trick our brains into thinking they too will lead to evolutionary success .
Cultural Options - Maladaptation ?
SO WHAT IS A DISCOUNT RATE ?
Everyone is familiar with the ' discount rate ' in the financial markets .
It 's the rate that the Federal Reserve charges its member banks .
Its also the rate that a stock analyst might use to discount a companies future earnings stream back to the present .
Imagine a company whose entire business plan is to sell a product in 10 years – say at the Olympics – they make no money until then but a lot of money in that one year , say $ 100 million .
How much would investors pay for this company ?
Certainly something less than $ 100 mil , as that money wont come for 10 years .
They would determine what the risk was of actually getting that $ 100 mil 10 years hence , then determine what an appropriate rate of return would be , say 15 % per year .
Discounted at 15 % per year , $ 100 mil is $ 24.75 mil- that is what they should be willing to pay .
So in this example , the discount RATE is 15 % and the discount FACTOR is 24.75 % , or how much something in the future is worth today .
The higher a discount rate the lower the discount factor will be .
A discount rate approaching 1 , means things in the future have no value at all in the present moment .
A discount rate of zero means that $ 1 dollar in 2050 is worth $ 1 today .
The Human Hyperbolic Discount Rate
The original neoclassical assumption was that the discount rate curve was exponential , meaning that we discounted the same from period to period .
Actual economic experiments however show that the shape of the discount curve is hyperbolic , or as Harvard economist David Laibson prefers quasi- hyperbolic .
This means that the early periods have much steeper discount rates than later periods .
Laibsons research indicates that peoples discount rates are 12 % during days 0 - 5 but drop to 4 % in days 20 - 25 .
We REALLY prefer the present .
Animals ( and humans ) have their own internal discount rates exogenous from the market on how they choose between the short term and longer term options offered them in life .
Since many animals have short lifespans , they have been shaped through evolution to gather resources and reproduce quickly before they die ( this is not a conscious motive – they innately pursue behaviours that were historically successful ) .
Different species have different discount rates , though all are steep , much steeper than our financial systems rates .
If you leave for the weekend and give your goldfish 3 days of food at once , you will probably return to a dead bloated goldfish - they have discount factors close to zero and discount rates close to one .
One reason humans discount rates arent quite as steep is probably due to our sunk costs .
If we did n't have mortgage payments and college funds for our kids , our discount rates might even be steeper .
Its quite logical – animals that deferred opportunities to eat , might come back and their food was stolen , or they might have been eaten themselves in the interim – the long arm of selection would have favored organisms that valued immediacy over those who preferred to wait .
Humans care more about Peak Oil than rats or pigeons
Researchers on animals and humans measure discount rates using the following technique .
They offer a small short term reward ( SS ) as well as a larger long term reward ( LL ) with differing time delays depending on the experiment .
To calculate the discount rate they repeat the experiment until the subject is indifferent between the 2 choices – based on how large the future reward must be , they can compute a discount rate and discount factor , similar to the business example above .
With animals , the discount rate tests are almost always food , while with humans they are often money or drugs ( e.g cocaine addicts ) .
A recent study on two different monkey species suggests an ecological basis for differing discount rates .
Two monkey species , similar genetically and in habitat but differing in diet were studied using food rewards .
One species was a gummivore - it scratched on trees and waited for the sap to ooze out which was its main food source .
The other species was an opportunistic insectivore , grabbing whatever insect it would see and could catch .
As hypothesized , the monkey whose feeding behaviour had evolved to require patience had lower discount rates than the other species in laboratory tests .
How cool is that ?
NEURO -ECONOMICS
Neuro - economics is a rapidly expanding field that combines traditional economics experiments with fMRI or PET scans .
Economist David Laibson has made an amazing observation .
During economic games , subjects who choose the LL ( larger long term reward ) had their prefrontal cortex activated .
Those who chose the smaller short term rewards showed neural activity in the limbic system , or emotional mammalian brain .
The relentless progress of brain and behaviour
This graph shows that humans in effect have 2 discount rates .
The blue line shows our ' thinking ' discount rate whereas the steeper red line shows our emotional discount rate .
This is clearly suggestive that we make decisions in different parts of our brain .
It also proves ( not that we needed proof ) that emotions have the ability to trump reason .
DISCOUNT RATE STUDIES
Some people balk at evolutionary psychology because they feel it is deterministic and does n't apply in all situations .
I agree .
However it does give an accurate general template for how people interact with eachother and the world .
If I say that ' men are taller than women ' , that doesnt mean that ALL men are taller than ALL women , just that on average this is the case .
( Not the case on TOD staff , fyi ) .
I have shown that our evolutionary origins tilt us towards valuing the present more than the future .
Not as much as lower animals , but much more than purely ' rational ' beings .
The table below shows some research results suggesting certain members of society have even steeper discount rates than others .
Specifically , those who smoke , do heroine or cocaine , gamble , are mentally ill , consume alcohol , or are young .
Of import is studies on cocaine addicts show that not only do they discount cocaine steeply versus the future - but they discount other things as well .
In other words , if you have are addicted to something , you tend to value the present more than the future in other areas of life too .
Not on the table is a study by anthropologists Wilson and Daly showing that when shown a pretty female face versus an average one ( activating the limbic system ) men 's discount rates increase and they subsequently make irrational monetary decisions .
Women , by contrast , made equally rational decisions whether they had been shown pictures of handsome men or those of average attractiveness .
( 7 ) Somehow I believe this study .
DISCOUNT RATE STUDIES ( 2 )
Increasing research in the side fields of economics is painting a clearer picture of our tendency to value the present .
The above graph is suggestive of different sub - groups of society that exhibit higher discount rates than average .
Anecdotally , I originally promised Professor Goose I 'd write this piece a month ago , but perhaps since I 'm single , male , drink wine and coffee , play poker on the internet , and have been called ' crazy ' by some of my friends , I wrote the entire post in the last 24 hours .
Its a good thing I do n't smoke or do cocaine or it would never have gotten written .
However , since I am aware of my own steep discount rates ( also called procrastination in favor of other more fun and intersting things ) , I devised a solution .
I decided to consciously email the entire TOD staff and alert them this post was in the queue this week .
In effect I made a social contract and would have suffered embarrassment that I let the team down if I blew it off .
More research in this area is necessary - social contracts may provide solutions for a society driving towards a cliff but addicted to driving .
THE FUTURE EATERS
Australian biologist Tim Flannery has called the human species " The Future Eaters " .
Indeed , paleo - anthropology suggests many historical societies collapsed due to resource depletion even though they must have been aware of it .
The example made famous by Jared Diamond is ' what was that Easter Islander thinking that chopped down the last tree ' ?
The best documented recent mass extinctions of flightless birds and other large mammals from New Zealand and Madagascar show that humans were to blame .
Though Neandertals and early Homo Sapiens did hunt game without hunting it out , upper Paleolithic hunters were more numerous and better equipped for mass slaughter - 100,000 horses killed at one site , a thousand mammoths at another .
Given the millions of years of shaping of our neural circuitry , it is hard to imagine that our mental structure has changed that much in the last few thousand years .
Indeed , for those who are not high on the oil subsidy banquet and need food stamps to survive , scientists have shown a 10 - 15 % decline in caloric intake during the month , implying a steep discount rate exists when food is the primary concern .

WHAT THE HECK DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND PEAK OIL ?
If you 're still with me , Im impressed , as the above diagrams and verbage are quite disparate .
Yet so is our situation .
Environmental icon Gus Speth , in " Red Sky at Morning " laments that the single biggest failing of his generation of environmentalists was that they just ' talked ' .
We have tens of thousands of well intentioned environmentally minded scientists and activists in this country and others .
I pose no answers in this post , because I do n't have them .
But I am certain that a fusion of the brain sciences and evolutionary biology into the environmental and energy discussions will be a large step forward .
Ultimately we are after impact .
If we spend 99 % of our efforts on educating people on the facts of peak oil , yet nothing happens , it would be better to spend 50 % of our efforts on education and 50 % by example .
For example , researchers attempted to persuade young students not to litter either by teaching them about ecology and pollution or by telling them they were neat and tidy compared to other students - only the latter had a positive effect .
( 4) E.O Wilson suggests " A stiffer dose of biological realism is in order ..
The only way to make a conservation ethic work is to ground it in ultimately selfish reasoning .
An essential component of this formula is the principle that people will conserve land and species fiercely if they forsee a material gain for themselves their kin or their tribe . "
All of our past environmental successes ( DDT , Ozone depletion , unleaded gasoline , etc. ) had some sort of smoking gun - an emotional trigger .
The problem with climate change / peak oil , is when we do get the emotional trigger , it may be a gatling gun on full bore .
After preparing this ( what I thought was novel ) post , tonight I found that Larry Karp at Cal - Berkeley has written a paper on the same topic , titled " Global Warming and Hyperbolic Discounting "
Here is the abstract :
ABSTRACT : The use of a constant discount rate to study long - lived environmental problems such as global warming has two disadvantages : the prescribed policy is sensitive to the discount rate , and with moderate discount rates , large future damages have almost no effect on current decisions .
Time - consistent quasi - hyperbolic discounting alleviates both of these modeling problems , and is a plausible description of how people think about the future .
We analyze the time - consistent Markov Perfect equilibrium in a general model with a stock pollutant .
The solution to the linear - quadratic specialization illustrates the role of hyperbolic discounting in a model of global warming .
THE BOTTOM LINE
1. Education about oil depletion and climate change is not enough .
We need to incorporate how people react to information .
If companies like Daimler Chrysler are using neuromarketing to sell more cars , an equal effort needs to be made on the environmental and energy front .
2 . Two of the planets largest problems , climate change and peak oil , are in the future .
As such , our evolutionary derived penchant to focus on the present lacks the discipline to think and act ahead .
Either accelerating the expected ' bad news ' or making the expected bad news ' worse ' are both ways to increase the weight we place on these events .
3 . We can't easily reduce our discount rates .
But having a team of middle aged female monks running the climate change team may not be a bad idea ( I 'm only half kidding ) .
4 . There are so many scientific disciplines running parallel courses .
Somehow we need to integrate them into a logical framework that makes sense and is practical .
I do n't expect President Bush will soon appoint a Secretary of Darwinian Ecology but the time is now to combine the sciences .
5 . Though it 's difficult , we can learn from our mistakes .
Those on Easter Island , Rome and the Mayas and Aztecs were neurally not dissimilar from us .
To recognize they valued the present even when they could forsee the future ( cutting down the last tree ) means we have to acknowledge ahead of time that our intelligence will be trumped by our emotion , and plan accordingly .
5b . In writing this post , it dawned on me that much of the work we do in raising peak oil awareness is received by readers as kind of an interesting horror movie .
Yes - tell me more scary facts and I will sit at my computer and read them .
But its the rational brain that is receiving this information .
And its not budging behavior much .
5 c. Understanding that stress increases peoples discount rates suggests to me that the events surrounding peak oil ( and perhaps climate change ) will reach an inflection point .
We need to hit the emotional triggers well ahead of peak oil .
Once people are stressed and things become difficult , accessing peoples rational minds will be all the harder .
Plus , greater awareness of resource depletion might trigger increased consumption , as people try to get their share .
6 . I think steep discount rate is another term for addiction .
Humans are addicted to what modern life offers .
Some more than others .
P.S. Lets do lunch !... ;)

I guess using the historical example of American chattel slavery as an example is rhetorically extreme , in that none of us Americans are working under conditions of bondage , but did you ever think about what it means that your testimony as a foreigner , in case you have to defend yourself legally , is essentially meaningless against a Korean's ?
You should know :
--
The police regularly ignore the testimony of foriegners as invalid .
A cop in my recent case even said that it was " meaningless " to accept the story of my American friend , and that it was " a good thing you had a Korean with you " since hers was the only testimony that could help me , despite the obvious fact that she was in my party .
I guess her imagined impartiality as a pureblood Korean outweighs her likely partiality to me personally .
Lovely .
-- Another foreigner told me of having been sued for libel and when asked to testify , a translator was not allowed to hear his statement in court .
Meaning , it was rendered effectively meaningless .
-- I 'm told by those involved in legal cases here that this is the case .
-- I 've seen with my own eyes a Korean hooker who attacked a group of girls whom she did n't like , then claim she was attacked first .
Against a crowd of Korean onlookers who had n't even been there when I saw the attack start , my testimony was completely ignored .
In fact , I was made to wait outside the police station and had to DEMAND that they accept my written statement , which they did only after they marveled , " You can write in Korean ? "
Indeed , as King Sejong said about learning Korean , " a wise man " could allegedly learn it in a day , and even " a fool " could in " a fortnight . "
I guess if I 'm speaking fluent Korean and the KKK ( Korean Keystone Kops ) are marveling that I can write what the Korean government always refers to as " the world 's most scientific alphabet " and claims is the " easiest to learn , " that would make me a drooling idiot .
So , if it 's true that a drunk man with no job , no cellphone , who lives in a boarding house , can randomly say I kicked him and drag me into this legal morass to the point that I have to prove that I DID NOT hit him ( whereas the real burden of proof legally should fall on him to actively PROVE THAT I DID ) , basically , because he 's Korean , and my testimony is worthless against his in this his - word - against - mine case , I'm GUILTY UNTIL I CAN PROVE OTHERWISE .
And since it's my status as a foreigner that has placed me in this precarious legal position , and I 'm told that the foreigner witnesses , no matter how many , invariably do n't count against even one Korean , I am inevitably reminded of the American Slave Codes , circa the 1850's : “
It is an inflexible and universal rule of slave law , founded in one or two States upon usage , in others sanctioned by express legislation , THAT THE TESTIMONY OF A COLORED PERSON , WHETHER BOND OR FREE , CANNOT BE RECEIVED AGAINST A WHITE PERSON . " ( citation )
Am I being extreme in asking whether this sentiment would describe the inner thoughts of many in this society , and the legal chances of most foreigners in a Korean court of law ?
Foreigners are " beings of an inferior order , and altogether unfit to associate with the Korean race , either in social or political relations , and so far inferior that they had no rights which the Korean is bound to respect . "
Anyone know where that adapted quote finds its origins ?

The problem of dog overpopulation is a real one .
However , the noble goal of preventing unwanted dog pregnancy does not justify the means being used .
Millions of brutal forced castrations and female genital mutilations take place every year in America .
We need to put a stop to these atrocities and give every living creature the respect it deserves .
Just as forced sterilization is n't the answer for human population control , it 's not the solution for dogs .
Instead , we should respect dogs ' rights as living beings by honoring their instincts and sexuality and provide them with safe , effective birth control .
Facts :
Over 46 million dogs have suffered genital mutilation in the US
4 - 8 millions healthy " unwanted " dogs are slaughtered each year Solution :
( Prototype Packaging ) What Sizes and Scents Do They Come In ?
Dog condoms come in three sizes to fit small , medium , and large breeds .
Almost every dog will find a comfortable , well - proportioned condom to meet their needs .
The condoms also come in lubricated and meat scented varieties to enhance pleasure for both dog partners .
How Effective Are They ?
Clinical studies are still underway , but we expect them to be about as effective , if used correctly , as human condoms .
Can I Train My Dog To Put It On Himself ?
No , the dog will require human intervention each time he wishes to put on or take off a condom .
What About Female Condoms for Bitches ?
We recognize that birth control is the responsibility of both partners , and we are currently working on a prototype of a condom for female dogs .
However , we do n't expect it to reach the market until 2007 .
What About Loss of Sensation ?
Just like with human condoms , the dog may experience a slight loss of sensation .
However , the condoms are made of a very thin latex which should transmit heat well , a key factor in creating a lifelike feel .
We are also experimenting with new scents , which work like a " doggy Viagra " , providing further sensory stimulation .
When and Where Can I Buy Them ?
We are planning a roll - out for spring 2007 with wide availability at major pet stores and convenience markets by the beginning of 2008 .
Second , America ’s fundamental economic strength is rooted in the most stable of assets — its values .
The U.S. is still an astonishing assimilation machine .
It has successfully absorbed more than 20 million legal immigrants over the past quarter - century , an extraordinary influx of human capital .
Americans are remarkably fertile .
Birthrates are relatively high , meaning that in 2050 , the average American will be under 40 , while the average European , Chinese and Japanese will be more than a decade older .
The American economy benefits from low levels of corruption .
American culture still transmits some ineffable spirit of adventure .
American students can’t compete with , say , Singaporean students on standardized tests , but they are innovative and creative throughout their lives .
The U.S. standard of living first surpassed the rest of the world ’s in about 1740 , and despite dozens of cycles of declinist foreboding , the country has resolutely refused to decay .
Third , not every economic dislocation has been caused by trade and the Chinese .
Between 1991 and 2007 , the U.S. trade deficit exploded to $ 818 billion from $ 31 billion .
Yet as Robert Samuelson has pointed out , during that time the U.S. created 28 million jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.6 percent from 6.8 percent .
That ’s because , as Robert Lawrence of Harvard and Martin Baily of McKinsey have calculated , 90 percent of manufacturing job losses are due to domestic forces .
As companies become more technologically advanced , they shed workers ( the Chinese shed 25 million manufacturing jobs between 1994 and 2004 ) .
Meanwhile , the number of jobs actually lost to outsourcing is small , and recent reports suggest the outsourcing trend is slowing down .
They are swamped by the general churn of creative destruction .
Every quarter the U.S. loses somewhere around seven million jobs , and creates a bit more than seven million more .
That double - edged process is the essence of a dynamic economy .
I ’m writing this column from Beijing .
I can look out the window and see the explosive growth .
But as the Chinese will be the first to tell you , their dazzling prosperity is built on fragile foundations .
In the United States , the situation is the reverse .
We have obvious problems .
But the foundations of American prosperity are strong .
The U.S. still has much more to gain than to lose from openness , trade and globalization .
MIT researchers have identified a family of proteins key to the formation of the communication networks critical for normal brain function .
Their research could lead to new treatments for brain injury and disease .
The team , led by MIT biology professor Frank Gertler , found that a certain family of proteins is necessary to direct the formation of axons and dendrites , the cellular extensions that facilitate communication between neurons .
The work focuses on cellular outgrowths called neurites , which are the precursors to axons and dendrites .
Understanding how neurites form could eventually lead to therapies involving stimulation of neurite growth , said Gertler .
" You could use these insights to help repair injuries to the top of the spinal column , or treat brain injuries or neurodegenerative disorders , " he said .
The researchers developed the first model that allows for study of the effects of this protein family , known as the Ena / VASP proteins .
The team reported aspects of their work in the Nov. 11 issue of Neuron and the Nov. 18 online edition of Nature Cell Biology .
The majority of neurons in the cerebral cortex have a single axon -- a long , thin extension that relays information to other cells -- and many shorter dendrites , which receive messages from other cells .
The interconnection of these axons and dendrites is essential to create a functional neural circuit .
In their study , the researchers found that mice without the three Ena / VASP proteins did produce brain cells , but those neurons were unable to extend any axons or dendrites .
It was already known that Ena / VASP proteins are involved in axon navigation , but the researchers were surprised to find that they are also critical for neurite formation , Gertler said .
Ena /VASP proteins are located in the tips of a neurite 's filopodia , which are short extensions that receive environmental signals and translate them into instructions for the cell .
Those instructions tell the cell whether to continue extending the filopodia by lengthening actin protein filaments , or to stop growth .
Without the Ena / VASP proteins , neurites cannot form , and no connections are made between neurons .
The researchers believe that Ena / VASP proteins control the growth of filopodia by regulating actin filaments ' interactions with microtubules in the cell ( which form part of the cell skeleton ) .
One theory is that the microtubules might be delivering materials or sending signals to the filopodia through the actin filaments , Gertler said .
Lead authors of the Neuron paper are Adam Kwiatkowski , an MIT Ph.D. recipient , and graduate student Douglas Rubinson .
Lead author of the Nature Cell Biology paper is former MIT postdoctoral fellow Erik Dent .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard .

Novell has succeeded in getting a court to lift SCO 's Chapter 11 immunity from legal action , meaning the firm 's IP spat can go to trial .
Normally Chapter 11 means that companies cannot take legal action against you - it is designed to protect a firm from creditors while it reorganises .
SCO filed for protection in September .
Novell 's case was heard in Delaware .
The court agreed that Novell 's motion be granted because the case was ready for trial , SCO has separate lawyers for the case and the court in Utah had already spent several years getting to grips with the legal and technical arguments .
Novell 's lawyers have already filed notice of Delaware 's decision to the court in Utah .
Just a week after seeking bankruptcy protection in September , SCO told the Securities and Exchange Commission that " there is substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern " .
At the end of October SCO got an offer for its Unix business .
There 's more from Groklaw here .
SCO started legal action against IBM over alleged violations of its intellectual property and quickly became mired in countersuits . ®
The 1.4kg Mallomys giant rat is one of two species of mammal thought to be new to science documented on an expedition to an area described as a " lost world " .
Conservationists also found a pygmy possum - one of the world 's smallest marsupials - on the trip to the remote north of Papua province , Indonesia .
Both are currently being studied to establish whether they are new species .
Scientists on the trip , organised by Conservation International ( CI ) , also recorded the mating displays of several rare birds for the first time .
" It 's comforting to know that there is a place on Earth so isolated that it remains the absolute realm of wild nature , " said Bruce Beehler , who led the expedition .
Old friends
The trip was the second time that CI had visited the Foja Mountains , part of the Mamberamo Basin , the largest pristine tropical forest in the Asia Pacific region .
Scientists are studying the possum to confirm if it is new to science
In 2005 , the area was dubbed a " lost world " after scientists discovered dozens of new plants and animals in the dense jungle .
During the most recent trip , in June of this year , scientists accompanied by a film crew managed to capture courtship displays of the golden - fronted bowerbird ( Amblyornis flavifrons ) and of the black sicklebill bird of paradise ( Epimachus fastuosus ) .
They also recorded the wattled smoky honeyeater ( Melipotes carolae ) , documented for the first time on the 2005 expedition and known only from the Foja Mountains .
The bird , with a bright orange patch on its face , was then the first new bird species to be sighted on the island of New Guinea in more than 60 years .
The team also captured an old friend on film - the " lost " Berlepsch 's six - wired bird of paradise ( Parotia berlepschi ) .
The iridescent gold - breasted bird was " rediscovered " in 2005 by CI experts after 20 years without a confirmed sighting by a western scientist .
However , the most surprising finds of the trip were the two new species of mammal - the Cercarteus pygmy possum and Mallomys giant rat .
" The giant rat is about five times the size of a typical city rat , " said Kristofer Helgen , a scientist with the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C .
" With no fear of humans , it apparently came into the camp several times during the trip . "

The capitalistic motto that perpetuates the Anglo - American Military Industrial Complex ( MIC ) is “ create ogres then slay them for profits . ”
While the US government is allegedly escalating rhetoric against Iran , and tightening economic sanctions against that country , the MIC was selling this year the Iranians through publicly available channels F - 14 aircraft parts .
According to Jane ’s Intelligence report , the US Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) reported on August 1 , 2007 that more than 1,400 parts that are unique to the US Navy ’s ( USN’s ) Grumman F - 14 Tomcat fighter aircraft were sold to Iran through publicly available channels in February 2007 .
These sales occurred despite a January 2007 announcement by the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) that all such sales would be suspended until DoDs Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA ) had made improvements to its security procedures .
( Jane ’s Intelligence Report , 2007 ) .
The Tomcat was a strike fighter with a high price tag of $ 38 million per plane that the United States sold to Iran in the 1970s , when the Shah of Iran gave the US and Britain full access for oil exploration and exploitation .
The Pentagon retired its F - 14 last fall and hired contractors for hundred of millions of dollars to allegedly dismantle the planes and to ensure that the parts are destroyed and not sold to countries that are considered hostile to the United Stated by the Bush administration .
This type of duplicitous policy is a standard operating procedure on the stage of international politics , where drama , fear , and wars are choreographed by the the financial masters of the world .
Meanwhile , everyone awaits the occurrence of an artificial trigger operation that will terrify the public and will justify the invasion of Iran , which in turn will secure the complete control of the straits of Hormuz , and with it , the oil supplies of the world .
That in turn would force the west - dependent Chinese and Russians into compliance with the new world order guidelines .
That would also deter the Chinese from dumping more dollars , which in turn would delay the death of the greenbacks that will eventually vanish with the North American Union when the time is right , and as Mexico ’s internal conflicts worsen .
Then , the dollar will be replaced with another spurious fiat currency as the new reserve currency of the world .
Creating pseudo - monsters and destroying them is an essential element for profiteers , because conflict makes profits and promotes population control .
Conflict and wars are a necessary angel that the elites have employed for centuries to advance their political agenda , and to gain full control of the world .
When you ca n’t conquer financially , you subjugate militarily .
The neocons ’ allegedly creative destruction strategy is a key ingredient to devise and mold this new world order , in which they render the planet into a jail where everyone is microchipped , and as a reward they would run it by proxy for the invisible financial Oligarchy .
Unfortunately , if the plans go awry these neocons will become the neo-sacrificial lambs .
Humans are desperately compulsive and do not learn from history .
They will continue their erroneous march by repeating the same self - destructive patterns of behavior , until they eventually succeed in eradicating themselves and their planet .

Some put their faith in expensive face creams , while others go under the surgeon 's knife .
But , no matter which route they choose , they will never regain the dewy skin of their youth .
Now scientists may have found a way of turning back the hands of time , returning ageing skin to a more youthful state .
It raises the prospect of an elixir of youth being developed .
The breakthrough hinges around a gene that acts as a master - switch in the aging process .
Research showed that blocking its action in mice had a rapid and dramatic effect on their skin .
Within just two weeks , the skin of elderly mice had rejuvenated to such a degree that it was comparable to that of a newborn .
The US researchers said : ' We found a pretty striking reversal to that of the young skin .
' The implication is that the aging process is plastic and potentially amenable to intervention . '
The study , carried out Stanford University in California , showed , that as well as looking young , the skin also exhibited biological features of youthfulness , including being thicker and having more cells dividing inside it .
The researchers said that the gene , known as NF - kappa - B , is a master - switch in the ageing process in both humans and mice , switching on and off other age - related genes as we get older .
' Here we show that aging in mouse skin can be reversed by blocking a single gene , ' they said .
' These findings suggest that aging is not just a result of wear and tear but is also the consequence of a continually active genetic programme that might be blocked for improving human health . '
Developing a drug that shuts off the gene in people could have a dramatic effect on human skin .
However , fears that interfering with the gene could trigger cancer mean that such a drug would be unlikely to be used as a cosmetic .
Lead researcher Dr Howard Chang cautioned : ' You might get a longer lifespan but at the expense of something else . '
Instead , it would be more likely to be used as a short - term medical treatment , with possible applications speeding up wound healing in the elderly
The research , published in the journal Genes and Development , follows yesterday 's announcement that a drug said to hold back ageing and prevent diabetes is to undergo testing next year .
US firm Sirtris Pharmaceuticals believes its concentrated pill form of the red wine chemical resveratrol could help prevent a raft of ills , including cancer , heart disease and Alzheimer's .
President Bush heads into only the fourth veto of his presidency with most of America 's health establishment and nearly two - thirds of the Congress arrayed against him .
A 12 - year - old boy delivered the Democratic response to Mr. Bush 's radio address this weekend , and children pulling red wagons are expected to deliver 1 million petitions supporting renewal of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( S - CHIP ) to the White House on Monday .
Explaining a vote against healthcare for poor children is not the issue that Republicans wanted to take into the November 2008 elections .
Last week , 18 Republicans in the Senate and 45 in the House broke with Bush to support the pending S - CHIP bill , and Democrats say they need to flip only 15 more House Republicans to give the Congress a veto - proof majority .
But the White House and GOP leaders in both houses of Congress say this is a fight worth fighting on policy grounds – and that it may do them some good in spending battles to come and even in next fall 's elections .
" Health insurance for poor children is a tall hill for politicians to climb , " says Rep. Mike Pence ( R ) of Indiana , a leading House conservative .
" That will make all the other battles that much easier to fight . "
A presidential veto of the S - CHIP bill in its current form is " a sure thing , " says White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
Bush will risk the political fallout because the policy is wrong .
He adds , it " does n't focus on the core population that needs to be served , " that is , children in families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level .
( For a family of four , that 's an annual income of $ 41,300 or less . )
By stripping out a requirement that S - CHIP cover 95 percent of the neediest children before extending it to higher - income children , Congress is undermining a key intent of the program , Mr. Fratto says .
" We think this is a good program , and Congress should keep it focused on what it was intended to do . "
The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that some 794,000 children in these lowest - income families are eligible for S - CHIP and are not currently covered .
Moreover , the S - CHIP bill reaches so far into higher - income groups that it will " shift millions from private insurance to government - supported care , " Fratto adds .
Ten states and the District of Columbia now cover children from families with incomes up to three times the poverty level , or $ 61,950 a year for a family of four .
New Jersey has extended eligibility to families earning up to $ 72,275 .
Bush often cites the case of New York , which sought to extend coverage to families earning up to $ 82,600 , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level .
Democrats note that Washington rejected that extension , and therefore it 's not a valid concern .
But " the law is still on their books and [ would be ] more likely to be accepted " by the terms of the law that Congress is proposing , Fratto says .
For Democrats , the crucial statistic is the number of children to be covered under the new law .
" We hope the president will change his mind , " says Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" So far , we 're short of votes " for an override .
But if we come back with another bill , " there are some things we will not compromise , and that 's the number of kids : 10 million , " he adds .
Democrats and child advocacy groups say that Republicans who back the president in opposing an override of a veto on S - CHIP will face the wrath of voters in the next election .
They cite a recent poll by the Republican polling firm Fabrizio , McLaughlin & Associates that found that GOP voters support extending and strengthening the S - CHIP program by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
GOP voters also said , by a 4 - to - 3 margin , that they were less likely to vote to reelect members of Congress if they oppose the bill .
" Republican voters want Congress and the president to deliver a strong children 's health bill , and they are saying they will hold accountable politicians who stand in the way , " said Bruce Lesley , president of First Focus , a child - advocacy group in Washington , in a statement .
LAST week , the House and Senate passed a compromise version of the bill that increases funding for the S - CHIP program by $ 35 billion above existing levels , for a total of $ 60 billion over the next five years .
The bill passed the Senate by a veto - proof 67 - to - 29 vote .
It passed the House by a vote of 265 to 159 , short of the 290 needed to override a veto if all 435 House members are present and voting .
But Senate Democrats say they do not expect that Congress will need to compromise with the Bush administration over the level of funding or the terms of eligibility .
" It wo n't be necessary , because there are 25 votes in the House that are potentially getable , " says Sen. John Rockefeller ( D ) of West Virginia , who helped draft the first S - CHIP bill 10 years ago .
House GOP leaders say they are confident of the votes they need to defeat an override of a Bush veto .
Rep. Zack Wamp ( R ) of Tennessee , who has broken with Republican leaders and the White House on issues such as campaign finance in the past , says he 's been swamped with requests that he change his " no " vote on S - CHIP .
Both US senators from Tennessee supported the bill .
But Representative Wamp says he has no intention of switching his position .
" It 's a crummy bill that is n't honest as to how it 's paid for , " he says , citing a budget assumption in the pending legislation that demand for the S - CHIP program will drop sharply in 2013 .
" There 's a trend toward bigger government , and we have to hold the line , " he says .
" It 's going to be a tough vote , but we would not have walked the plank if we were n't sure the president would veto the bill . "
Republicans who back Bush are still looking for a concise answer to the issue raised by 12 - year - old Graeme Frost .
" I do n't know why President Bush wants to stop kids who really need help from getting CHIP , " Graeme said in the Democratic radio address Saturday .
He told listeners that S - CHIP funding helped him recover from a " really bad car accident . "

A Chinese campaign to clean up online pornography has reached college campuses with the Education Ministry lashing out at some school Web sites for making money from porn .
REUTERS / Stringer / Files
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese campaign to clean up online pornography has reached college campuses with the Education Ministry lashing out at some school Web sites for making money from porn .
“ We strongly condemn Web site hosts for making ‘ unlawful ’ money by distributing pornographic information , ” Vice - Minister of Education Li Weihong was quoted as saying .
“ Students are easily influenced and perverted by such information as they are still in their formative years and do not have a solid hold on their values . ”
Xinhua did not elaborate on how the college Web sites were run or what they contained .
The Ministry of Public Security and nine other government departments launched a six - month campaign in April to crack down on illegal online activities such as distributing pornographic materials and organizing cyber strip shows .
“ The campaign hopes to purge the web of sexually explicit images , stories and audio and video clips , ” Xinhua said .
By mid-May , Chinese police had cracked 244 cases and detained 270 suspects involved in online pornography .
The 51ft container is similar to those used to ferment beer and is believed to have fallen from a ship .
The container was found by a dog walker on Poll Na Crann beach near Griminish - known as Stinky Bay - west Benbecula .
Stornoway Coastguard said it resembled tanks used by the American brewer Coors .
The company said it was not aware of a missing container .
No -one at the German firm Ziemann , which makes the tanks , was available for comment .
A number of people contacted the BBC news website with theories about the origins of the container .
One reader thought the numbers " 5580 " written on the container could have meant it was used to hold chemicals in DTD 5580 , a three - part paint aircraft scheme .
Another writer thought it could have been a rocket stage launched from South Uist , from which meteorological rockets were fired in the 1960s and 70s .
Earth ( TGW ) - Plan to fight deforestation could be so successful ' it will create such large emissions reductions that carbon markets could collapse unless rich nations take on more stringent reductions targets . '
So warns an architect of the recent deforestation deal made at the Bali climate conference .
Destruction of forests accounts for about 20 % of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions .
The plan produced at the conference , though yet to be formally approved , would give carbon credits for planting trees to developing countries or to developed countries assisting developing countries .
But Kevin Conrad , executive director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations and Papua New Guinea 's climate change envoy , believes that the framework would flood the market with too many carbon credits .
" We are not going to flood the market and then drop prices for everybody and not be able to overcome any of the opportunity costs …
The only way that we are going to bring in new supplies is if there are deeper cuts ( for rich nations ) , " he said .

OTTAWA–The Department of Foreign Affairs quietly relies on a host of private security contractors to protect Canadian embassies and diplomats across the globe – a small army that needs more supervision , defence experts say .
The call for more oversight follows an incident last month involving the U.S. security firm Blackwater , in which 17 Iraqis died .
Canada has only employed the controversial security contractor to train members of the Canadian Forces and has not used Blackwater for embassy or dignitary protection .
However , 2006 federal public account records show a handful of other U.S. and British security firms working in Iraq have separate protection contracts with Canada for work in other countries .
Precisely what kind of service is provided by firms such as Britain 's ArmourGroup and subsidiaries of Wackenhut Security Systems , which ran afoul of U.S. lawmakers over private prisons , is n't clear .
There are also questions about a $ 456,000 contract Canada 's former ambassador to Kabul signed last year with Saladin Afghanistan Security Ltd.
Documents released under the Access to Information law show the deal , which ran from June 2006 until June 2007 , was to provide a quick reaction force to protect the embassy and the army 's Strategic Advisor Team – both based in the Afghan capital .
A foreign affairs spokesperson said Friday no one was available to answer questions about security .
Dave Perry , a defence researcher at the Dalhousie University 's Centre for Foreign Policy Studies , says the federal government should conduct a review , even though the firms working for Canada may not have gotten into any trouble .
" The issue is : who is providing security and what kind of mechanisms and safeguards are in place to ensure that there are n't any problems , " said Perry , who has written about the military 's increasing reliance on private companies for logistics support .

It 's not fish 2008-04- 29 09:43:20
For anyone who thinks sushi is gross because it 's raw fish , rest assured : sushi is actually just vinegared rice usually topped with something that may or may not be raw fish ( also known as sashimi ) .
It could also be cooked fish , vegetables , or a number of other things .
So raw fish may be gross , but sushi is tasty .

I LOVE SUSHI !!!

487 diggs natalie 2007-11-02 17:29:58
sushi is so disguisting ... i dont know how u crackheads eat it dang !
487 diggs 2007-11-08 13:18:11
Um , what people are eating is sashimi , not sushi .
Sushi in the literal sense is a rice or a rice - type product , probably literally " vegetable " in english .
Sashimi is excellent , by the way .
So is Saki .... yum .
483 diggs SayBlade 2007-11-02 17:35:11
I like sushi as long as they are vegetarian ( no animals , fish or shellfish ) .
Also , I gotta skip the wasabi .
It 's not just the heat , it 's the taste in general , like horseradish times ten and I can't stomach the stuff .
Lovely art creations with colourful food !

for those that say they do n't like it , you should try making it yourself with veggies or cooked meat that you like .
it 's very different when you 're putting in things that you actually know and like .
i can't imagine the time that goes into the ones that have pictures in the wraps !
so cool !
i'm guessing the 5th one down is a type of squash for the wrapper , sliced very thin .

SayBlade : most of the wasabi sold today is just horseraddish .
The real thing is too hard to grow and way too expensive :-)
BTW - Sushi has nothing to do with raw fish .
Sushi refers to the rice .
You can use raw fish , cooked fish , meat , vegetables , pretty much anything that comes to mind and you think taste good together with the rice .
The rice is seasoned with a ricewine vinegar mixed with sugar and a pinch of salt .
You could add a couple of more things , but those are the basics .
So for those that think sushi is not good , I have to ask :
What kind of sushi ?
I think the sushi in these pictures look real cool , but can be a bit hard to eat with chopsticks - way too big .
But they are nice as a show - off for the sushi chef .
Personally , I am more impressed with well done bite sized sushi .
Di you ever watch the technique these chefs have while making it ?
467 diggs yep 2007-11-02 16:31:14

Oh God , I 'm such a genius .
That 's not sushi ... that 's Boshiwa Goslsti .
You would n't know .. you can only get it 18 feet under the ground of Japan .
It 's expensive , and since you really do n't know who I am , I 'm going to take the liberty in saying I 'm rich and can definitely afford it .
Trust me ...
I know everything , and am more than willing to share that fact with everyone , all the time .
467 diggs seether 2008-01- 19 06:33:20

465 diggs Shari 2008-05-01 17:48:08
To all these people who are trying to convince others that sushi is n't raw fish , you have a point , but not a completely valid one .
There are many kinds of sushi and some use egg , vegetables , and even in relatively rare cases , meat ( though even more rarely cooked meat ) , most varieties of sushi are about the raw fish topping the ( seasoned ) rice .
Not everyone can get excited about eating cold rice mixed with vinegar , salt , etc. topped with whatever .
Seriously , how exciting is that ?
I do n't hate sushi , but I do n't love it .
From a culinary viewpoint , it 's just not all that interesting .
It 's something Japanese people like because they prefer subtle flavors and elegant preparation .
Sometimes I think all the sushi fanatics are just trying too hard to be hip .

To all " Armchair " sushi know - it - alls ..
the word sushi is a compound word " su " means VINEGAR , and " shi " means SKILL of HAND .
( I am not Japanese , nor a know - it- all ) LoL
427 diggs Sacrosanct 2008-05-14 22:28:49
These pictures reflect the skillful art of making sushi .
It is surely an acquired taste and not always prepared with raw fish ( a misnomer associated thereof )
Arguably one of the best contribution from the Japanese to the world of culinary delights .
It seems quite apparent that some of the crass comments stated above are from persons who are uninformed about Japanese culture and in particular sushi .

I normally skip straight past food blogs as I have over 20 in my RSS and dont even have enough time to read the ones that I have !
I am started out as a blogger myself and always tried to keep the design simple like yours as I think it is crucial , especially if you can back it up with some nice food pics like yours !

I love how " Ben Everywhere " came down off his cloud in richee land to come tell us commoners about something he made up cause he has no clue what it is either ...
Boshiwa Goslsti is completely made up unless Ben is the founder / inventor .
Regardless of how " rich " you are if what you say is true there would be evidence of it somewhere in the world .
But then again since you know " everything " and are so much more privileged than all of us , why dont u ACTUALLY say what it is other than some sensationalized story to make you feel important or like you have more than $ 20 in your wallet .
Apparently according to Ben its some strange substance of unknown form or makeup that is being harvested exactly 18 feet underground in Japan .
Yeah ..... OK BUDDY ....
And most likely Ben everywhere and Richard Branson sit down in the mornings and eat this delicacy while they blow each other being there the only two people rich enough to know about this , I mean yeah cause theres a picture of it above just taken in some standard restaurant ... must be so hard to find ben !

Students take these offbeat courses for a variety of reasons –hoping for an easy A , to try something fun , or to explore a new interest .
Underwater Basket Weaving 101 may be an urban legend , but these ten unusual courses are for real :
1 ) You can boldly go where no other philosophy student has gone before in Georgetown University ’s “ Philosophy and Star Trek “ course , where students discuss the nature of time travel , the ability of computers to think and feel , and other philosophical dilemmas facing the crew of the Starship Enterprise .
2 ) Discover how Brick really felt when Opal left him for his neighbor ’s best friend ’s sister in the University of Wisconsin ’s course entitled “ Daytime Serials : Family and Social Roles . ”
Students analyze the plots , themes , and characters of daytime soaps and discuss their impact on modern life .
3 ) If you ’ve been longing to research how hot dogs , theme parks , and the five - day workweek have impacted American leisure culture , check out the University of Iowa course “ The American Vacation . ”
This course pays particular attention to how American families ’ varying backgrounds shape their vacation experiences .
4 ) Bowdoin College students can delve into “ The Horror Film in Context ” in the school ’s English Department .
Students read Freud and Poe and watch Hitchcock and Craven , all while discussing the horror genre ’s treatment of gender , class , and family .
5 ) At Williams College , students can learn more about those in the cement shoe industry by enrolling in “ Comparative History of Organized Crime , ” which compares the work of goodfellas from the United States , Italy , Japan , and Russia .
6 ) If you ’ve got a romantic urge for adventure , check out Barnard College ’s course on “ The Road Movie , ” which studies Easy Rider and Thelma and Louise , while also discussing the genre ’s literary precursors , like On the Road and The Odyssey .
7 ) If hitting the road does n’t satisfy your rebellious streak , sign up for Brown University ’s course on “ American Degenerates , ” in which students discuss how early British - American writers embraced the grotesque , monstrous , “ not our kind ” status bestowed on them by the mother country and reflected their zeal for cultural and physical degeneracy in their literature .
8 ) Those artsy types at the Rhode Island School of Design can put down their paintbrushes and take “ The Art of Sin and the Sin of Art , ” which contemplates the relationship between sin and the art world .
The course catalog invites you to “ lust with the saints and burn with the sinners . ”
9 ) If talking about death several times a week in class sounds like a good time to you , try Purdue University ’s “ Death and the Nineteenth Century ” course .
Every poem and novel in the course deals with the 19th - century conception of mortality and the world beyond .
10 ) At Centre College in Danville , Kentucky , students can take “ Art of Walking , ” in which students not only read literature by noted perambulators like Kant and Nietzsche , but go for neighborhood strolls with their professor and his dog .

George McGovern may be nearly 85 years old , but he is n't sitting back and taking crap from Dick Cheney .
From today 's Los Angeles Times
Vice President Dick Cheney recently attacked my 1972 presidential platform and contended that today 's Democratic Party has reverted to the views I advocated in 1972 .
In a sense , this is a compliment , both to me and the Democratic Party .
Cheney intended no such compliment .
Instead , he twisted my views and those of my party beyond recognition .
The city where the vice president spoke , Chicago , is sometimes dubbed " the Windy City . "
Cheney converted the chilly wind of Chicago into hot air . [...]
He also said that the McGovern way is to surrender in Iraq and leave the U.S. exposed to new dangers .
The truth is that I oppose the Iraq war , just as I opposed the Vietnam War , because these two conflicts have weakened the U.S. and diminished our standing in the world and our national security .
In the war of my youth , World War II , I volunteered for military service at the age of 19 and flew 35 combat missions , winning the Distinguished Flying Cross as the pilot of a B - 24 bomber .
By contrast , in the war of his youth , the Vietnam War , Cheney got five deferments and has never seen a day of combat — a record matched by President Bush . [...]
On one point I do agree with Cheney : Today 's Democrats are taking positions on the Iraq war similar to the views I held toward the Vietnam War .
But that is all to the good . [...]
We , of course , already know that when Cheney endorses a war , he exempts himself from participation .
On second thought , maybe it's wise to keep Cheney off the battlefield — he might end up shooting his comrades rather than the enemy .
On a more serious note , instead of listening to the foolishness of the neoconservative ideologues , the Cheney - Bush team might better heed the words of a real conservative , Edmund Burke : " A conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood . "
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - The California attorney general and Los Angeles city attorney filed a lawsuit on Monday against 20 companies accusing them of manufacturing or selling toys with unlawfully high levels of lead .
A " Polly Pocket " doll sits on a shelf in a store in Arlington , Virginia , August 14 , 2007 .
The California attorney general and Los Angeles city attorney filed a lawsuit on Monday against 20 companies accusing them of manufacturing or selling toys with unlawfully high levels of lead .
REUTERS / Jim Young
The lawsuit , which names U.S. toy companies including Mattel Inc , and retailers , including Toys “ R ” Us Inc and Wal - Mart Stores Inc , says the companies knowingly exposed children and their parents to lead and did not provide sufficient warning about its risks .
“ Despite the lengthening global supply chain , every company that does business in this state must follow the law and protect consumers from lead and other toxic materials , ” California Attorney General Jerry Brown said in a statement .
The lawsuit follows a series of recalls this year that have led to millions of toys being taken off store shelves .
Many of the recalled toys were made in China .
Gareth Lacy , a spokesman in Brown ’s office , said the attorney general hoped the companies would settle the lawsuit by agreeing to increased inspection , testing and lower lead levels .
The state can require companies to put warning labels on products that contain hazardous materials and or require companies to adopt more rigorous inspection procedures .
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled millions of toys this year because they contained excessive amounts of lead .
Other toys have been recalled because they contained other toxic substances and small parts that could be swallowed .
Mattel , the world ’s largest toy maker , makes about 80 percent of its toys in China .
The company recalled some 21 million of its Chinese - made toys worldwide this year .
In October , one of its shareholders sued Mattel , accusing the company of failing to report serious defects in its toys .
Mattel said it was working with California ’s attorney general to improve toy safety .
“ The use of paint with impermissible levels of lead by certain subcontractors was a clear violation of the company ’s quality and safety standards , ” Mattel said in a statement .
Lacy said the companies named in the suit could be fined up to $ 2,500 per day per “ violation ” , that is every time a consumer or child is exposed to a contaminated toy , but it would be up to the court to decide what constitutes a “ violation ” .

The Spiral Data Tato is an origami CD or DVD case of the origata or tsutsumi ilk , that is , a complicated presentation model , intended as a gift for an honored recipient .
Tato is a Japanese word that means purse or wallet .
The Spiral Data Tato opens and closes , using a charming innovation we like to call The Origami Zipper .
It is available in American letter paper and in A4 versions and I have made some .DOC files ( editable in MS Word or in OO Writer ) , in case you want to make a mix CD or display the contents of the disk on the outside of the model .
This is not a quick and simple fold and is not intended to be .
There are several quick and simple origami CD holders out there , if that 's what you looking for -- I highly recommend Tom Hull 's American CD Case .
This model is for the discerning hunter of geek chic , the intrepid seeker of cheap thrills and complex beauty for its own sake .
It 's also for the little nerdy guy who thinks he can get that beautiful blonde in Calculus 102 to talk to him , if he could only get her to listen to his ultimate roadtrip mix CD ... yeah , buddy , this will do the trick .
But you better have some conversation prepared for when she does talk to you and not just stand there , babbling on and on the way you do .
All right ?
All right , let 's fold .
Traders and clerks in the Euro Dollar pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , March 28 , 2006 .
The dollar slid to a fresh record low against the euro and a basket of currencies on Friday , pressured by the growing view that a slowdown in the U.S. economy will force another cut in interest rates this month .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar fell a record low against a basket of major currencies on Friday after Dow Jones reported that a draft communique from the Group of Seven meeting this afternoon failed to mention the euro , yen , and the greenback .
There had been some speculation earlier that the G7 statement late on Friday could address the dollar ’s weakness and other currency imbalances .
But the omission of any such reference from the draft statement suggested that the dollar ’s weak trend will continue , analysts said .
“ It ’s not very surprising since no one was really expecting a big change , ” said a dealer at a New York bank .
Contrary to some expectations , the draft statement instead focused on the tightly - controlled Chinese yuan , as G7 officials urged for a faster rise in the currency .
It also repeated past statements , which called for currencies to reflect economic fundamentals .
The dollar index , a gauge of the greenback 's value against a basket of major currencies , fell to yet another record low at 77.396 .
DXY , down 0.2 percent on the day .
The dollar also dropped to 114.68 yen , still the lowest in three weeks after the Dow Jones story .
It last traded at 114.72 yen , still down 0.6 percent on the day .
It can be said that humans have a bit of a short term view of things .
We ’re concerned about the end of summer , the next school year , and maybe even retirement .
But these are just a blink of an eye in cosmic terms .
Let ’s really think big , stare forward in time , and think about what the future holds for the Universe .
Look forward millions , trillions , and even 10100 years into the future .
Let ’s consider the end of everything .
End of Humanity – 10,000 years
Modern humans originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago .
Since then , we ’ve gone on to inhabit every single corner of the globe .
But this is just temporary .
The vast majority of every species that has ever lived on Earth is now extinct .
To think that humans can avoid the fate of every other creature is arrogant .
Like all life on Earth , our time is limited .
How long will we last ?
There are many natural and man made disasters that could wipe us out .
From an asteroid strike to worldwide pandemic ; global warming to a nearby supernova detonation – there are many ways we could go .
Perhaps we ’ll wrap it up in a mass extinction event , such as the one that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , or “ the Great Dying ” , 251 million years ago that killed 70 % of land species and 96 % of all marine species .
Perhaps another species ( intelligent cockroaches , rats ) will evolve , and out compete with us in our niche .
Or maybe we ’ll engineer our robotic replacements .
But a species can last tens or even hundreds of millions of years .
So how can we predict when our number will be up ?
There ’s no way to know , but there ’s a calculation that can help .
It ’s called the Doomsday Argument , developed in 1983 by astrophysicist Brandon Carter .
According to Carter , if you assume that half of the humans who will ever live have already been born , you get approximately 60 billion people .
If you assume that another 60 billion are yet to be born , our high population levels only give us another 9,000 years or so .
Or more precisely , there ’s a 95 % chance that humanity will have ended by the year 11,000 .
There are other calculations , but they give similar amounts , ranging from a few thousand to a few million years .
That ’s a long time , but not long enough to appreciate the future the Universe has in store for itself .
End of Life – 500 million years – 5 billion years
We thank the Sun for giving us energy .
Without it , there ’d be no life on Earth .
It ’s ironic , then , that the Sun will eventually kill all life on Earth .
That ’s because the Sun is slowly heating up .
One of the most fascinating books about this topic is The Life and Death of Planet Earth by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee .
In their book , they chronicle how Sun ’s energy output is slowly increasing .
In as soon as 500 million years , temperatures on Earth will rise to the point that most of the world will be a desert .
The largest creatures wo n’t be able to survive anywhere but the relatively cooler poles .
Over the course of the next few billion years , evolution will seem to go reverse .
The largest organisms and least heat tolerant animals will die out , leaving hardy insects and bacteria .
Finally , it ’ll be so hot on the surface of the Earth that the oceans will boil away .
There ’ll be no place to hide from the terrible temperatures .
Only the organisms that live deep underground will survive , as they have already for billions of years .
End of the Earth – 7.5 billion years
As mentioned above , we exist because of the Sun ’s good graces .
But as our star nears the end of its lifetime , it ’ll take our planet out as it goes ; one way or another .
In approximately 5 billion years from now , the Sun will begin the final stage of its life , consuming the last of its hydrogen fuel supply .
At that point , gravity will force the Sun to collapse , and only a small amount of hydrogen will remain in a shell wrapped around the star ’s core .
It will then expand into a red giant star , consuming each of the inner planets : first Mercury , then Venus , and finally encompassing even the orbit of Earth .
There is a controversy about whether or not a red giant Sun will actually burn up the Earth .
In some scenarios , the change in the Sun ’s density as it expands causes the Earth to spiral out away from the Sun , keeping out of reach .
In another scenario , the Sun ’s outer envelope will enclose the Earth .
The additional friction will slow the Earth down , causing it to spiral down into the Sun .
Whatever the outcome , the Earth will be scorched to a cinder , and effectively destroyed , 5 billion years from now .
End of the Sun – 7.5 billion – 1 trillion years
When the Sun becomes a red giant , that ’s only the beginning of the end .
With the end of its hydrogen , the Sun will have switched to fusing helium , then carbon , and finally oxygen .
At that point , our Sun will lack the gravity to continue the fusion process .
It will shut down , and shed its outside layers to form a planetary nebula , such as the ring nebula we can see in the night sky .
It ’ll then settle down to live out the rest of its days as a white dwarf .
It will still retain most of its mass , but have a size no larger than the Earth ’s diameter .
Once yellow - hot with the heat of fusion , the Sun will slowly cool down over time .
Eventually , its temperature will match the background temperature of the Universe and it will become a cold black dwarf star – an inert chunk of matter floating in the darkness of space .
Even the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at several thousand degrees Kelvin , so the Universe has n’t been around long enough for black dwarfs to exist .. yet .
But give the Sun another 1 trillion years or so , and it should finally become a cold black dwarf .
End of the Solar System
Even though the Sun will have burned out billions of years from now , the planets that were n’t consumed will remain .
Perhaps even Earth will join that group .
Certainly Jupiter , Saturn , the rest of the outer planets and the Kuiper belt objects will remain orbiting for eons .
A recent discovery published in the journal Science , reported that astronomers had discovered a disk of rapidly rotating metallic material orbiting a white dwarf .
Researchers built a simulation where they put hypothetical planets in orbit around a dying star , and found that the star ’s death wreaked havoc on the stability of a star system .
Changes in the mass of a star causes planets to collide , and rearrange their orbits .
Some spiral into their star , while others are ejected into interstellar space .
Once all these new gravitational interactions are worked out , all that might remain of our solar system is the white dwarf remnant of our Sun and the rapidly rotating disk of planetary wreckage surrounding it .
Everything else will be lost to interstellar space .
End of Cosmology – 3 Trillion Years from Now
The Universe acts as a natural time machine .
Since light moves at the speed of , well , light , we can look at distant objects and see them how they looked in the past .
Look to the very ends of the visible Universe , and you see light that was emitted billions of years ago , shortly after the Big Bang .
It ’s handy , but there ’s a problem .
That mysterious dark energy force , which is accelerating the expansion of the Universe is making the most distant galaxies move faster and faster away from us .
Eventually , they will cross an event horizon and appear to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light .
At this point , any light emitted by the galaxy will cease to reach us .
Any galaxy that crosses this horizon will fade away from view , until its last photon reaches us .
All galaxies will disappear from view forever .
According to a new research paper by Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert J. Scherrer , future astronomers living 3 trillion years from now will only see our own galaxy when they look into the night sky .
This accelerating expansion has another consequence as well .
The cosmic microwave background radiation , which astronomers used to discover evidence of the Big Bang will have faded away too .
Not only that , but the abundance of chemicals , which precisely match the amounts theorized for the Big Bang will be hidden by subsequent generations of stars .
And so , 3 trillion years from now , there wo n’t be any trace of the Big Bang .
No clues for future cosmologists to recognize that the Universe we live in started from a single point , and has been expanding ever since .
The Universe will seem static and unchanging .
End of the Milky Way
Galaxies collide .
All you have to do is look out into space with a telescope and see the fate that awaits our galaxy .
In all directions we can see the interactions between the gravity of various galaxies .
At first the encounters are violent ; galaxies tear at each other , stripping off material , and generating huge swaths of star formation .
The dormant supermassive black holes at their centres spring to live and become active galactic nuclei , gobbling up the newly delivered material .
Our future merger partner is barreling towards us right now : Andromeda .
In approximately 2 billion years from now , our two galaxies will collide , and then pull apart .
Then they ’ll collide again and again until they settle down into a new , larger galaxy : Milkomedia .
The twin supermassive black holes will orbit one another , and eventually merge together into an even more massive black hole .
Our position in the galaxy will change ; we ’ll probably be pushed out to the outer reaches of the galaxy ’s halo – at least 100,000 light years from the centre .
Since the Sun will still have billions of years left , some future form of life on Earth might be around to watch these events unfold .
The merger process will be complete approximately 7 billion years from now .
That ’s not the end of the galaxy , though .
It will still be an island in space , with stars orbiting a central core .
Over a long period of time , though , estimated to be between 1019 1020 years .
The galaxy will erode , with all the stars escaping into intergalactic space .
End of Stars – 100 trillion years from now
We can look out into the Milky Way and see stars forming all around us .
There is still enough remaining gas and dust in the Milky Way to create whole new generations of stars .
But when we look at other galaxies , we can see older , elliptical galaxies which have already used up their free gas and dust .
Instead of the bright , hot stars we see in star forming regions , these aging red galaxies are cooling down .
One day there wo n’t be newly forming stars at all .
And then one day , the last star will use up the last of its hydrogen fuel , become a red giant and then fade away to a white dwarf .
Even the dimmest stars , the cool red dwarfs will use up their fuel – although , it might taken another 10 trillion years or so .
They too will turn into black dwarfs .
And so , in about 100 trillion years from now , every star in the Universe , large and small , will be a black dwarf .
An inert chunk of matter with the mass of a star , but at the background temperature of the Universe .
The End of Regular Matter – 1030 years
So now we have a Universe with no stars , only cold black dwarfs .
There will also be neutron stars and black holes left over from the time where there were stars in the Universe .
The Universe will be completely dark .
A future observer might notice the occasional flash , when some object interacts with a black hole .
Its matter will spread out into an accretion disk around the black hole .
And for a brief period , it will flare up , emitting radiation .
But then it too will be added to the mass of the black hole .
And everything will go dark again .
Chunks of matter and binary black dwarfs will merge together creating new black holes , and these black holes will be consumed by even larger black holes .
It might be that in the far future , all matter will exist in a few , truly massive black holes .
But even if matter escapes this fate , it ’s doomed eventually .
Some theories of physics predict that protons are unstable over long periods of time .
They just ca n’t last .
Any matter that was n’t consumed by a black hole will start to decay .
The protons will turn into radiation , leaving a fine mist of electrons , positrons , neutrinos and radiation to spread out into space .
Theorists anticipate that all protons in the Universe will decay over the course of 1030 years .
End of Black Holes – 10100 Years
Black holes were thought to be one - way streets .
Matter goes in , but it does n’t come out .
But famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking turned that concept on its head with his theory that black holes can evaporate .
It ’s not much , and it ’s not fast , but black holes release a tiny amount of radiation back into space .
As it releases this radiation , the black hole actually loses mass , finally evaporating away entirely .
The amount of radiation increases as the black hole loses mass .
It ’s actually possible that it could generate a final burst of X - rays and gamma rays as it disappears completely .
Future observers ( who survived their protons decaying ) might see the occasional flash in an otherwise dark universe .
And then in about 10100 years , the last black hole will be gone .
All that remains is the radiation emitted .
The End of Everything – 10100 years and beyond
When the last black hole evaporates , all that will remain in the Universe are photons of radiation , and elementary particles that escaped capture by black holes .
The temperature of the entire Universe will reach a final temperature just above absolute zero .
Dark energy may play some future role , continuing the expansion of the Universe , accelerating each of these elementary particles and photons away from each other until they ’re effectively cut off from one another .
No future gravity will bring them together again .
Perhaps there will be another Big Bang someday .
Perhaps the Universe is cyclical and the whole process will start up again .
Perhaps it wo n’t , and this bleak future of a cold , dead Universe is all that awaits us .
It ’s not happy , but it ’s awe inspiring to consider the long future ahead , and helps us appreciate the vibrant age we live in today .
Wow .
Republicans and their Culture of Death .
From Media Matters :
From the May 17 broadcast of The Glenn Beck Program :
BECK : ... I 'm thinking about killing Michael Moore , and I 'm wondering if I could kill him myself , or if I would need to hire somebody to do it .
No , I think I could .
I think he could be looking me in the eye , you know , and I could just be choking the life out -- is this wrong ?
I stopped wearing my What Would Jesus -- band --
Do , and I 've lost all sense of right and wrong now .
I used to be able to say , " Yeah , I 'd kill Michael Moore , " and then I 'd see the little band :
What Would Jesus Do ?
And then I 'd realize , " Oh , you would n't kill Michael Moore .
Or at least you would n't choke him to death . "
And you know , well , I 'm not sure .
Top Verizon executives , including CEO Ivan Seidenberg and President Dennis Strigl , wrote personal checks to Rockefeller totaling $ 23,500 in March , 2007 .
Prior to that apparently coordinated flurry of 29 donations , only one of those executives had ever donated to Rockefeller ( at least while working for Verizon ) .
In fact , prior to 2007 , contributions to Rockefeller from company executives at AT&T and Verizon were mostly non-existent .
But that changed around the same time that the companies began lobbying Congress to grant them retroactive immunity from lawsuits seeking billions for their alleged participation in secret , warrantless surveillance programs that targeted Americans .
The Spring '07 checks represent 86 percent of money donated to Rockefeller by Verizon employees since at least 2001 .
AT&T executives discovered a fondness for Rockefeller just a month after Verizon execs did and over a three - month span , collectively made donations totaling $ 19,350 .
AT&T Vice President Fred McCallum began the giving spree in May with a $ 500 donation .
22 other AT&T high fliers soon followed with their own checks .
There 's more at the link , including a list of all of the contributors to Rockefeller 's campaign .
And it 's almost unfair to single him out , although the brazen nature of the largesse coming RIGHT AT THE TIME when these telecom companies needed Rockefeller to immunize them from lawsuits is telling .
Turns out Harry Reid's on the take as well .
And look how friendly Senator Reid is with AT&T .
$ 22,000 ?
They may rank donor number 17 , but their contribution to the Majority Leader is far greater than what they give to their lackey mr .
Rockefeller !
Are things beginning to come together now ?
Is it beginning to make sense why the Senate can’t seem to stop this President ’s insanity ?
Why we ca n’t seem to get past this problem of warrantless surveilance ?
The Majority Leader , it seems , loves his contributors more than he loves the Constitution .
There are times when I really hate how perverted our political system has become .
As Glenn Greenwald notes today , this is but a drop in the bucket for the telecom industry , which consistently ranks among the top contributors to Congress .
Overall , at least $ 118 million dollars in telecom money has gone to members of Congress over the last several election cycles .
And people are somehow shocked when special laws are created to stop civil lawsuits against them .
We can see how this can bleed over into more than just illegal wiretapping , too .
Comcast is already violating net neutrality , because it's a " tradition " and not a full law currently , and anyway telecommunications companies do n't have to comply with the law anymore according to the US Senate .
NEW YORK - Comcast Corp. actively interferes with attempts by some of its high - speed Internet subscribers to share files online , a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally .
The interference , which The Associated Press confirmed through nationwide tests , is the most drastic example yet of data discrimination by a U.S. Internet service provider .
It involves company computers masquerading as those of its users .
Right now they 're just trying to block bandwidth hogs to relieve pressure on their system .
But that 's the whole point .
Telecoms have every incentive to make that pipe as narrow as possible .
That way , they can monetize it that much easier .
It 's a hop , skip and a jump from stopping file - sharing to restricting content .
Telecoms have an enormous about of money that they 're using to buy off politicians and force open a new revenue stream .
And like so many other industries , they 're trying real hard to buy off Democrats now at the expense of meaningful progressive legislation .
The corporations see which way the wind is blowing .
The endless amounts of money in politics is among the most corrosive aspects of our current political culture , but it 's nothing new , nothing that has n't been tried since virtually the beginnings of the American experiment .
What 's really troubling is how easy it is now to buy off these Congressmen , who are already predisposed to maintain an establishment status quo that is about pleasing elites and staying in the good graces of those who hold the cocktail parties .
Which is why we must embrace the real leadership we get from folks like Chris Dodd , public servants who actually have the public interest at heart .
Over the last 24 hours Dodd has received $ 150,000 in small - dollar donations .
I say we go for a million .
We must reward the good behavior of those who take the initiative to lead .
UPDATE : Given the questioning over why a Rockefeller would need a piddling 20 K ( although that 's just one company in a few months , and I consider it more like " building a relationship " ) , here 's more from the Wired blog from a West Virginian reader :
Rockefeller is believed to have a personal fortune over $ 100 million .
He spent $ 12 million of personal funds on his first Senate campaign .
( http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-3521561.html)
However " in recent campaigns , he has downplayed his personal wealth in one of the nation 's poorest states .
' I will not spend one single dime of any money that I have , ' he said in 2002 .
' So that I if I do n't raise money , I wo n't spend money .
I am on exactly the same playing field , so to speak , with anybody else who runs for office . ' "
AP
He 's up for election in 2008 .
The cost of Senate races has increased several times over the last two decades .
With a serious Republican challenger in WV , which Bush won twice , such as Rep. Shelley Moore Capito , he could be forced to raise tens of millions of dollars .
That , or break his promise not to use his personal fortune , which would n't play very well in one of the country 's poorest states .
So yes , even a Rockefeller has to raise money .
And in West Virginia , $ 50,000 is a lot of money .
It 's about 2 % of all the money he raised last year .
( But I 'll bet he 's slightly more worried about being red- baited for suppurtin ' terrists . )
I think there are a variety of factors , but money - both to you and away from your opponent - is certainly one of them .
There 's also the " protect the herd " mentality from our elites in the Senate that factors in as well .
For decades , school children have learned that human civilization emerged about 5000 years ago along the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia , along the Nile , and along the Indus River .
But archaeologists working in a broad arc from the Russian steppes through Iran and onto the Arabian Peninsula are finding evidence that a complex network of cities may have thrived across the region in roughly the same era , suggesting a dramatic new view of the emergence of human civilization .
In a feature in the 3 August issue of Science , news writer Andrew Lawler details the discoveries by teams of researchers and the emerging multinational effort to piece together the array of new evidence into a unified understanding .
Though their efforts are at an early stage , Lawler writes , many of the archaeologists say the finds are rewriting historical understanding of human civilization by offering " a far more complex picture in which dozens of urban centers thrived between Mesopotamia and the Indus , trading commodities and , possibly , adopting each other 's technologies , architectures , and ideas .
" While Mesopotamia is still the cradle of civilization in the sense that urban evolution began there , " Lawler added in an interview , " we now know that the area between Mesopotamia and India spawned a host of cities and cultures between 3000 B.C.E. and 2000 B.C.E . "
Evidence to support the new view was discussed and explored last month by scientists from more than a dozen countries — including Russia , Iran , Italy , France , and the United States — at a meeting of the International Association for the Study of Early Civilizations in the Middle Asian Intercultural Space in Ravenna , Italy .
Lawler was the only journalist present .

Archaeologists shared findings from dozens of urban centers of approximately the same age that existed between Mesopotamia and the Indus River valley in modern day India and Pakistan .
The " most dramatic evidence , " Lawler reports , comes from area in southeastern Iran , near the Halil River and south of the modern city of Jiroft , where a team led by Yousef Madjidzadeh has uncovered the remains of a large and wealthy city .
" The ancient city in the mid- to late 3rd millennium B.C.E. covered more than 2 square kilometers , dominated by a large citadel flanked by a massive stepped platform to the north , " the story says .
" A room excavated last year in the citadel includes a 2 - meter - high brick human torso , ochre paint still clinging to the surface .
The sculpture , says Madjidzadeh , is the largest of its kind from that era . "
Cemeteries in the area have been looted , but still , Lawler said , they demonstrate the affluence of the ancient residents .
" Madjidzadeh found one large tomb cut into limestone that appeared untouched since it was robbed in antiquity , " he wrote .
" A stairway leads down to a chamber containing eight burial areas ; scattered throughout were 600 carnelian beads and other precious materials . "
At a nearby dump left by looters , researchers " found 1200 small lapis and turquoise beads , pieces of 40 or more chlorite vessels , and 40 to 50 copper vessels — at least one with ornate embossing . "
In addition , the robbers ' holes at the site unearthed the remains of other pottery dating to 4000 B.C.E .
At a second site , northeast of Jiroft , researchers have found the remains of " a bustling metropolis between 2550 and 2400 B.C.E. , as large as 150 hectares and with at least 380 smaller sites in the surrounding region . "
Evidence suggests the as far back as 3000 B.C.E. , the city benefited from long - distance trade .
" Artifacts from that era include lapis from Afghanistan , shells from the Pakistan coast , vessels imported from the Indus , and game boards in the style of those found in Ur , " Lawler said .
The researchers see evidence of far - flung trade networks for merchandise and ideas : Copper from Oman has been found in Mesopotamia and perhaps in the Indus region ; Omani pots have been found in Central Asia .
At Gonur in Turkmenistan , the researchers have found seals from Mesopotamia and the Indus region , along with some Iranian goods .
And some evidence suggests that carts drawn by bullocks and camels may have been used to facilitate trade as early as the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE .
And from Mesopotamia east to the Indus , archaeologists have found massive ceremonial platforms with some common characteristics .
Article : " Middle Asia Takes Center Stage , " Science
Trend - spotters and futurologists have become the evangelists of the modern business world .
Spend more than 10 minutes listening to their breezy uplift about what is around the corner , however , and two questions begin to well up inside you - how come they know this stuff , and how does one go about separating the wheat from the chaff ?
Built into the discipline , after all , is a tendency to exaggerate the shock of the new : it helps to drum up business .
And by the time their prognostications have failed to materialise , it is safe to predict that most of them will have scarpered .
No matter .
The business of short - range futurology - that hybrid of science and intuition that reads the runes of business and consumer trends in an effort to predict what will whistle its way into the mainstream within the next 12 to 18 months - is now in high demand .
So what do the crystal - ball gazers reckon will be the top 10 trends of 2008 ?
The rise of N11
If 2007 was the year in which chatter about the possibilities posed by China and India ( bludgeoned into the portmanteau " Chindia " by one ambitious analyst ) reached a crescendo , 2008 may be the year in which N11 arrives on the lips of the cognoscenti .
The term N11 was coined in a recent report by Goldman Sachs , and refers to the up - and - coming " Next 11 " countries who are snapping at the heels of India , China , Russia and Brazil as investment opportunities - Bangladesh , Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , South Korea , Mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , the Philippines , Turkey and Vietnam .
Over the past three years , economic growth across Goldman Sachs 's N11 has averaged 5.9 % , the strongest in 15 years and more than double the 2.3 % average growth of Old Europe .
Marian Salzman , an energetic New York trend - spotter at the ad agency JWT , who was one of the first to talk up " Chindia " in 2007 , now says that she is " watching N11 with interest " .
And where the money goes , there is a good chance that cultural fascination will follow .
Peer - to - peer lending
Jeremy Gutsche , a Toronto - based trend - spotter who runs the website Trendhunter.com , is a good example of a new breed of trend - spotter who collects insights by cultivating an online community of trend - watchers around the world .
In keeping with the egalitarian ethos of the web , Gutsche argues that one of the key financial trends of 2008 will be the growth of person - to - person lending exchanges in which borrowers and lenders come together directly on the web and cut out the banks .
Some of these lending operations use an eBay - like auction in which the lender who is willing to provide the lowest interest rate gets the borrower 's loan ; others are for people who already know one another but who want someone to help formalise the loan arrangement .
A good example of the latter is CircleLending , an American firm in which Richard Branson 's Virgin USA recently acquired a majority stake .
Much the same model of " peer - to - peer " lending is slowly working its way into the charitable sector .
Outfits such as Kiva.org , for example , put potential " social investors " together with small businesses in the developing world , who promise to send back regular email updates on how the business is doing .
Social networking grows up
Next year will see online social networking cease to be the preserve of the young .
According to data recently released by the European Interactive Advertising Association , 18 % of European over - 55s now visit a social networking site at least once a month , not far behind the " digital generation " of 16 - to 34 - year - olds , where 28 % access such sites .
The past year has seen a 12 % jump in these so - called silver surfers , and new social networking forums such as MyChumsClub and Saga Zone are appearing to accommodate older users .
Online social networking is maturing in other ways , too .
Following concerns that office - bound staff were spending too much of their day on social networking sites such as Facebook - a recent survey concluded that office workers in the UK spend company time worth £ 130 m each day browsing online - many British firms are now mounting crackdowns against their use .
As people get used to juggling a multiplicity of new roles and new rules , says London - based trend - spotter Tamar Kasriel , the result will be to fuel confusion about how personal the personal computer is when it 's at work .
Twitchiness among employers , says Kasriel , is largely responsible for the latest internet abbreviation , NSFW , or " not suitable for work " , which bored office workers are increasingly using to preface any material they forward to their friends .
Reverse knowledge migration
Another solid basis for futurological speculation is to follow the flow of people .
Paul Saffo , a respected California - based forecaster , argues that the next few years will see the beginnings of a " reverse knowledge migration " in which , as well as bright and well - educated workers coming from the developing world to the west , people will start to move in the opposite direction .
This new global class of " cyber- gypsies " , says Saffo , will not only include American and European Asians returning " home " , but also highly educated , non-Asian Americans and Europeans going off to make their fortunes in places such as China .
The trend , he argues , will soon move from a source of sociological curiosity to a source of alarm for governments and businesses .
Companies , universities and thinktanks in Europe and America , he warns , who often smugly assumed that they would be a magnet for the world 's talent , are going to discover that this is no longer the case .
Handmade on the net
For some years now , one staple of futurological speculation has been the quest for authenticity in what seems like an anonymous and artificial world .
Witness , for example , the young fashionistas who self - consciously reclaim dreary leisure activities - everything from bingo to choir practice , from quiz nights to knitting - that would have bored even their parents rigid .
A new twist on all this , says Reinier Evers of the Amsterdam firm Trendwatching.com , is the sprouting of internet - based ventures that purvey handmade and highly traditional fare .
In Switzerland , for example , Netgranny ( netgranny.ch ) is a collective comprised of 15 cheerful - looking grannies who knit socks on demand and sell them online .
Customers can choose their favourite granny by picture , pick the colour of their socks , or opt for a granny " surprise " design .
It takes two weeks for a granny to knit a pair of socks ; at € 26 ( £ 19 ) apiece , including delivery , they make an excellent idea for a Christmas gift .
Something very similar is being touted by the Danish company Mormor.nu , which sells traditional handmade baby and children 's wear online .
Mormor.nu is Danish for " Grandma.now " .
All its products are handmade from pure wool , alpaca or cotton .
Old knitting and crochet techniques and patterns have been revived , while the colours and materials have been updated .
For a dash of extra authenticity , the company 's workers are as steeped in tradition as its products ; the youngest member of staff is 68 .
Likewise , Etsy ( etsy.com ) is an online marketplace for handmade goods that features more than 26,000 vendors from across the world and sells everything from scented soy candles to a tennis - ball chair .
It is only two years old , but so far more than 1 m items have been sold and 300,000 people have joined as members .
Clubbing together
If at first his or her predictions do n't come to pass , the seasoned futurologist can simply hunker down and wait .
Nearly a decade ago , for example , the American futurologist Jeremy Rifkin argued that we were all moving into " the age of access " - from an economy in which it was good to own stuff into one in which people would prefer to rent it .
Nothing much happened , and people quickly moved on , but just recently the idea is beginning to look more plausible .
For those who want to take out a time - share in a dog , for example , 2007 saw the launch in California of a " shared pet ownership " company , FlexPetz ; the firm is fast expanding , and is now opening a branch in London .
Meanwhile , a new Germany company called Lütte - Leihen is renting out baby clothes to parents of fast - growing young children ; several companies , such as Bag , Borrow or Steal in America and Be a Fashionista in the UK , are renting out designer handbags ; and the Dutch company Rent - a - Garden is leasing out sculptures and potted plants to those who want to give their back gardens a much needed summertime makeover .
Sharing the costs , Salzman points out , is becoming increasingly popular in many different retail sectors .
The inexorable rise of " fractional luxury " , for example , is giving not - quite - wealthy - enough people the opportunity to buy a time - share in anything from a racehorse to a jumbo jet .
Outfits such as PartialOwner.com and Fractionallife.com are extending the partial - ownership model to everything from homes to luxury cars and restaurants .
Art lovers , too , can now buy into syndicates to purchase artwork .
ARTvest in Glasgow , for example , was set up last year to enable people to pool their funds and get a foothold in the expensive market for contemporary art .
Sharing the costs can be fun , too .
Young women in Argentina and elsewhere , Salzman says , are holding clothes - swapping parties in order to share out the costs of getting hold of the latest fashion gear .
The new vicarious consumption
Ambitious futurologists need credible buzzwords , but good ones are in perilously short supply .
One option is to take an old trend off the peg , dust it down a bit and give it a whole new twist .
The idea of " vicarious consumption " was first coined 100 years ago by the economist Thorstein Veblen to describe the thrill rich people get when they buy their butler a lovely new uniform .
Nowadays , reckons Evers , it is making a comeback in a whole new form .
Just as book reviews have become a substitute among many of us for reading books , Evers says , our enthusiasm for endless product reviews is becoming a way through which we can vicariously experience almost anything through the eyes ( and sometimes ears ) of people who have already been there .
Sites dedicated to reading reviews on other people 's experiences , such as iliketotallyloveit.com and ballofdirt.com , offer a heady mixture of entertainment , voyeurism and exhibitionism , and are already quietly attracting millions on the web .
DIY education
The rise of blogging and self - broadcasting sites such as YouTube as an alternative to TV , says Gutsche , has brought with it a burgeoning demand among people to learn new skills , not from professional educators but from their peers .
A good example , he says , is the proliferation of virtual cooking classes on YouTube , in which people persuade each other to experiment with their favourite recipes .
Then there are the home videos that take people through the easiest way to unlock or otherwise manipulate their iPhones or other gadgets .
The " education " on offer at such sites does not have to be improving .
Willitblend.comb , for example , spoofs the growth of DIY education videos by showing viewers how to granulate their iPhones or iPods in a blender .
Then there is the popularity of bizarre videos demonstrating that if , for example , you shove a packet of Mentos mints into a bottle of Diet Coke , the whole thing explodes - the YouTube equivalent , it would appear , of the school chemistry experiment .
Digital housecleaning
One consequence of the matrix of social networking sites such as Facebook and Second Life that are colonising the web is that our private selves are soon going to be on display as never before .
In an age of " digital individualism " , in which many of us work so hard to create and customise our identities on the net , it is ironic that all this information ends up stored on an anonymous bank of computer servers , to be cooled by some bored warehouse caretaker .
While there is a much greater acceptance among young people of living life in the glare of the net , says Salzman , the lust for digital exhibitionism will soon wither when they come to start looking for a job .
With admissions offices and human resources departments increasingly using the web to vet prospective candidates - two - thirds of companies readily admit to keeping tabs on employees by checking social networking sites , according to the British recruitment agency Poolio - a good chunk of the incriminating material whirling around the cybersphere will somehow have to be expunged .
MySpace pages will be cleaned up and mass " Facebook suicides " will soon become the norm as young people try to agree a bond of forgetting by deactivating their profiles in unison .
Companies will spring up like Reputation Defender , an American firm that promises to search out and destroy all inaccurate , inappropriate , hurtful and slanderous information that exists on its clients .
Virtual identity managers
Another consequence of the public display of ourselves on the net is that many of us are going to end up hiring professional stand -ins .
By 2011 , reckon the researchers at technology advice firm Gartner , 80 % of internet users and major companies will have avatars , or digital replicas of themselves , for online work and play .
Kasriel predicts that this will give rise to a new cadre of independent advisers - what she calls " holistic identity managers " - whose job it will be to garden the internet profiles of business people and keep them on the straight and narrow .
Very soon , she believes , it will come as no surprise at all when we learn that high - ranking executives are not writing and updating their own profiles but paying someone else to do it for them .
Already , sites such as FakeWebcam.com allow paying people to pre-record videos of themselves and play them on a loop as if they were visible on their webcam .
The aesthetically challenged might even think about hiring more attractive stand - ins as well as scriptwriters .
For those who can afford it , smile - it 's not you on candid camera .

The producer of Silent Hill 5 says Western technological capabilities are leaving Japanese game developers behind .
QJ.net has reported on a Game Developer magazine interview with Akira Yamaoka , in which he said that Western development techniques are more advanced that those in Japan .
The comments came following his experience with California - based studio The Collective , which was responsible for the development of Silent Hill 5 .
" They 're very advanced , " Yamaoka said when asked about working with a non-Japanese team .
" There are of course advantages and disadvantages , but overall , I 'm really impressed with the American staff and their technology .
Their graphical and technical ability is amazing .
There 's a huge leap , actually . "
" I look at what American developers are doing and I think wow ...
Japan is in trouble , " he said .
Published by Konami , Silent Hill 5 is currently in development for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , and is scheduled for a 2008 release .

http://www.thebreastcancersite.com
Origins :
Over the last few years we ’ve seen many a purportedly altruistic appeal circulate on the Internet , each one claiming you could donate money to a worthy cause or right some terrible injustice — at no cost to you — merely by taking some simple action , such as forwarding an e-mail message .
( See our Jessica Mydek page for one example . )
All of these messages until very recently have been hoaxes , but Year 2000 has seen a few real ones spring
up .
At The Breast Cancer Site , you can “ donate ” clicks towards the provision of mammograms for underprivileged women in the U.S .
And it ’s no scam , even if it ’s not exactly as described in the e-mailed exhortation to become part of this .
Unlike the way things are explained in the e-mail , one click does not magically provide a
mammogram to a needy woman — it takes 45,000 clicks , not just one .
Averaging 58,000 clicks a day , The Breast Cancer Site provides funding for approximately 1.3 mammograms a day .
Visitors are also not prohibited from clicking more than once ; they just ca n’t do so more than once a day .
Sponsors become involved with this site ( and others like it ) as a form of advertising and public relations and thus are willing to pay for their messages to be viewed by consumers .
They pay CharityUSA.com , the parent entity of the site , on a per-click basis ; CharityUSA.com directs 75 % of the total ad revenue collected to the National Breast Cancer Foundation and keeps the remaining 25 % to run the site .
( The Breast Cancer Site is not a non-profit entity , so it should n’t be confused with a charity even though it does direct a significant portion of its revenues to those in need .
It exists to make a profit , and that it ’s still around proves it ’s succeeding at this . )
GreaterGood.com also allows visitors to initiate donations to several other causes via The Rainforest Site , The Animal Rescue Site , and The Child Health Site .

I see that Andrew already has the Youtube of Ron Paul ’s visit to Leno last night , which I saw live .
Andrew quips : “ Freedom : I wonder if today ’s GOP leaders have heard of the idea ? ”
There really is one thing I do not understand about Ron Paul - why do some unseemly types seem to be attracted to him ?
Every day we read about some nutter or another who has contributed to him ( which the GOP party apparatchiks , terrified of a Paul candidacy , quickly promote ) , but I have gone through his position on the issues , and the only thing I can see that would even remotely be attractive to the less seemly crowd is his position on immigration :
No amnesty .
Estimates suggest that 10 to 20 million people are in our country illegally .
That ’s a lot of people to reward for breaking our laws .
No welfare for illegal aliens .
Americans have welcomed immigrants who seek opportunity , work hard , and play by the rules .
But taxpayers should not pay for illegal immigrants who use hospitals , clinics , schools , roads , and social services .
End birthright citizenship .
As long as illegal immigrants know their children born here will be citizens , the incentive to enter the U.S. illegally will remain strong .
Surely Paul can not be the only Republican candidate who has that position on immigration , so why does it seem like the Stormfront crowds like Paul , and that a small minority of his supporters ( the most vocal ones , if you are to believe Red State ) are from less savory parts of the political sphere ?
Am I missing some dog whistles ?
I do know one thing , though , about Paul .
Of all the candidates on both sides of the aisle , Ron Paul is the one that my largely apolitical friends keep talking about .
I was talking to a co-worker yesterday on the walk to a workshop , and he had seen Paul on C - Span .
Now granted , this co-worker is to the left politically of the Democratic party , and is truly one of the folks out there who thinks the Democrats are just as corporatist ( and here is Jay Rockefeller shilling for Telecom amnesty , if you needed more evidence ) as the GOP , and as such , is largely disillusioned with the entire political process .
However , he had glowing things to say about Paul .
He does n’t agree with him on everything , but stated that many of his proposals and positions made sense and resonated .
Like I said , he is not the only one .
The ratings leader , Bill O'Reilly , averages about 2 million viewers a day .
The lowest rated network news program ( CBS ) pulls in over 6 million .
So graduating to the network opens millions of doors to a cablecaster .
Olbermann , not surprisingly , benefited from this .
The early results show him with 4.1 million viewers .
That only earned him a third place finish , behind " 60 Minutes " and " America 's Funniest Videos , " but it was good enough to quadruple his average MSNBC audience .
What 's more , ( and this has to hurt ) it is twice what Bill O'Reilly does on an average night .
And this despite having been preempted in some fairly significant markets ( i.e. Philadelphia , Baltimore ) which could adversely impact Countdown ’s numbers .
This is a significant performance , because success is not guaranteed just by changing your address .
Last month , Glenn Beck moved up to CNN from Headline News and barely scraped up the viewers he routinely got at his less - watched network .
And he underperformed Paula Zahn , for whom he was filling in , by a whopping 23 % .
The content of the show was not , in my opinion , representative of Olbermann 's best work .
It seemed to me that either he , or the network , was holding back a bit .
There were also extended humor segments that weighted the episode a little more to silliness than usual .
Nonetheless , it may turn out to be the wise approach if viewers are more comfortable getting their news with a spoonful of aspartame .
Still , I hope that if he gets another at bat , the network lets Olbermann be Olbermann .
The show is the fastest growing program on cable news for a reason .
I do n’t make these assertions so often or so vigorously anymore – I do n’t have to .
They are made daily by virtually everyone in the blogosphere .
My ‘ wild - eyed ’ hysteria is now common knowledge .
Reality has sunk in .
In fact , it ’s far worse than even I imagined .

From the mountains of gathered information , they sifted out the suicides of those Americans who had served in the armed forces .

And the part of the Clinton administration that worked best — the economy , stupid — was run by Robert Rubin .
Hillary did not show good judgment in her areas of influence — the legal fiefdom , health care and running oppo-campaigns against Bill ’s galpals .
She went on some first lady jaunts and made a good speech at a U.N. women ’s conference in Beijing .
But she was certainly not , as her top Iowa supporter , former governor Tom Vilsack claimed yesterday on MSNBC , “ the face of the administration in foreign affairs . ”
She was a top adviser who had a Nixonian bent for secrecy and a knack for hard - core politicking .
But if running a great war room qualified you for president , Carville and Stephanopoulos would be leading the pack .
Obama ’s one - liner evoked something that rubs some people the wrong way about Hillary .
Getting ahead through connections is common in life .

The IPCC says more heat waves are very likely in the future United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has challenged governments to act on the findings of a major new report on climate change .
Launching the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , he said real and affordable ways to deal with the problem existed .
The IPCC states that climate change is " unequivocal " and may bring " abrupt and irreversible " impacts .
Mr Ban urged politicians to respond at a UN climate change conference in Bali .
" Today the world 's scientists have spoken clearly and with one voice , " he said .
" In Bali I expect the world 's policymakers to do the same . "
We are all in this together - we must work together
Ban Ki-moon Fossil fuel juggernaut Humans blamed for change Climate ' can be tackled '
Ban Ki-moon Mr Ban arrived at the IPCC meeting in Valencia from a fact - finding trip to Antarctica and South America .
" I come to you humbled after seeing some of the most precious treasures of our planet threatened by humanity 's own hand , " he said .
" All humanity must assume responsibility for these treasures . "
Unavoidable effects
The IPCC report synthesises the three aspects of climate change that it has already pronounced on earlier in the year , on the science , the likely impacts , and options for dealing with the problem .
Among the top - line conclusions are that climate change is " unequivocal " , that humankind 's emissions of greenhouse gases are more than 90 % likely to be the main cause , and that impacts can be reduced at reasonable cost .
READ THE FINDINGS
IPCC draft report [ 9.3MB ]

One declaration that reportedly caused heated discussion during the week - long talks here states that climate change may bring " abrupt and irreversible " impacts .
Such impacts could include the fast melting of glaciers and species extinctions .
" Approximately 20 - 30 % of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5 - 2.5C ( relative to the 1980 - 1999 average ) , " the summary concludes .
Other potential impacts highlighted in the text include : between 75 m and 250 m people are projected to have scarcer fresh water supplies than at present
yields from rain - fed agriculture could be halved
food security is likely to be further compromised in Africa
there will be widespread impacts on coral reefs
The panel 's chairman , Rajendra Pachauri , highlighted the need to deal with impacts which are coming whether or not global emissions are curbed .
Even if levels of CO2 in the atmosphere stayed where they are now , he said , research showed sea levels would rise by between 0.4 and 1.4 metres simply because sea water would continue warming up , which makes it expand .
" This is a very important finding , likely to bring major changes to coastlines and inundating low - lying areas , with a great effect in river deltas and low - lying islands , " he said .
" If you add to this the melting of some of the ice bodies on Earth , this gives a picture of the kinds of issue we are likely to face . "
Worse case IPCC PROJECTIONS
Probable temperature rise between 1.8C and 4C Possible temperature rise between 1.1C and 6.4C Sea level most likely to rise by 28 - 43 cm Arctic summer sea ice disappears in second half of century Increase in heat waves very likely Increase in tropical storm intensity likely
Who are the IPCC ?
Climate change :
The evidence Send us your comments
This is the IPCC 's fourth major assessment of global climate change since its formation nearly 20 years ago .
During the course of its existence , it has become more certain that modern - day climate change is real and principally due to human activities ; it has also become firmer about the scale of the impacts .
" If you look at the overall picture of impacts , both those occurring now and those projected for the future , they appear to be both larger and appearing earlier than we thought [ in our 2001 report ] , " Martin Parry , co-chair of the impacts working group , told BBC News .
" Some of the changes that we previously projected for around 2020 or 2030 are occurring now , such as the Arctic melt and shifts in the locations of various species . "
There are indications that projected increases in droughts are also happening earlier than expected , he said , though that was less certain .
The IPCC considered about 29,000 pieces of real - world evidence in compiling this report , as well as the projections of computer models .
These include observations showing that dry areas of the world such as the Sahel and southern Africa are receiving less rainfall , while it has increased in northern Europe and parts of the Americas .
The panel suggests societies need to adapt to future impacts , as well as curbing emissions .
Without extra measures , carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise ; they are already growing faster than a decade ago , partly because of increasing use of coal .
The IPCC 's economic analyses say that trend can be reversed at reasonable cost .
Indeed , it says , there is " much evidence that mitigation actions can result in near - term co-benefits ( e.g. improved health due to reduced air pollution ) " that may offset costs .
The panel 's scientists say the reversal needs to come within a decade or so if the worst effects of global warming are to be avoided .
The findings will feed into the Bali talks on the UN climate convention and the Kyoto Protocol which open on 3 December .

Patriotism dwindling , Army turns to cash in search of recruits Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday December 3 , 2007

For enterprising young people hoping to pay down their mortgages or start up a business , they can talk to their banks -- or they can try their local Army recruiter .
Starting in January , five US cities will serve as test markets for the Army Advantage Program , a new recruitment incentive package which will dole out $ 40,000 to enlistees willing to fulfill a five - year commitment in the service , reports the Cleveland Plain Dealer 's Patrick O'Donnell .
The money must be applied to mortgages or used to benefit a registered business .
Lower - dollar amounts will be offered for shorter stints .
" The old patriotic reasons are n't quite pulling in recruits for the Army as well as they used to .
So the Army is adding a new financial incentive to the college tuition benefits and bonuses it already offers , " writes O'Donnell .
Cleveland joins Albany , NY ; Montgomery , Ala ; Seattle and San Antonio as the first to offer the incentive .
" The money is available to soldiers after they finish their enlistment and they show proof to the Army that they are trying to buy a house or have registered a business with their state , " O'Donnell reports .
" If the house purchase or business start - up does not go through , they may keep the money . "
A spokeswoman for the Army told the paper that the new program would give the Army tools to compete with private sector opportunities available to potential recruits .
" This is a very difficult time to recruit for an all - volunteer army , " she said .
" We have to compete with the other options that are out there in the civilian world .
This is a way of competing . "
O'Donnell reports that one former local Army recruiter , David Hack , was surprised by the new bonus -- but said he did n't think it would be the deciding factor in whether young people decided to sign up .
" This is just icing on the cake , " Hack told the paper .
" The main selling point for a young man or woman is duty ... You can't pay a person to put the uniform on .
You can't pay him to run up the hill and charge live ammo . "
The program is just the latest in an array of Army efforts to boost surging recruitment requirements .
In August , the Army instituted a " quick ship " bonus that offered $ 20,000 in cash to recruits willing to begin their training within weeks of sign - up .
According to the Plain Dealer , such bonuses cannot be added to the mortgage / business payout if a recruit is already receiving the $ 40,000 maximum amount .
In addition to bonuses and incentives , the Army has also recently lowered their recruitment standards in a push to meet goals .
As reported last week by the Boston Globe , the Army has " accepted a growing percentage of recruits who do not meet its own minimum fitness standards .
The October statistics show that at least 1 of every 5 recruits required a waiver to join the service , leading military analysts to conclude that the Army is lowering standards more than it has in decades . "
WACO , Texas --
During the last eight years , Karl Rove has been lionized and vilified , heralded as making the unlikely election victories of President Bush possible , and impugned as reaching too high from an unusually powerful White House perch .
In the eyes of his many detractors , he has helped to send the Bush presidency off track in the process .
But in an interview at an IHOP restaurant here , days after he announced his resignation as Bush 's top political adviser , Rove defiantly dismissed the rash of fresh critiques that have come his way in the last several days , blaming Democrats for the divisive tone that has dominated Bush 's tenure and for which he has frequently taken the blame .
He said he had no regrets over what even some allies have called his greatest missteps , like his trying and failing to pass a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system at the start of Bush 's second term , and the degree to which he seemed to meld partisan politics and official White House policy in his dual duties as a deputy chief of staff and Bush 's top political strategist .
He strenuously argued with the dominant characterization of him as the wizard of Oz -- or , with Vice President Dick Cheney , the co-wizard -- behind the curtain of Bush 's White House and presidency , declaring , " I'm the facilitator , " merely helping Bush as he has sought to shape his own views .
Rove at the same time described himself as an aggressive and studious inside player at the White House who is still one of the four or five officials forming Bush 's tight - knit inner circle , but has had to work hard for the position .
He dismissed what he called " the idea that I am somehow this all - powerful figure inside the White House . "
" What I 've learned is that if I want my voice to be heard around the table , " Rove said , " it ca n't simply be , ' Well , he 's the long - term associate of Bush from Texas ' -- I 've got to dig in . "
And even as he prepares to leave his job , Rove showed that he is still very much the political maestro trying to corral his party , taking a call from Senator Mel Martinez of Florida , the Republican National Committee chairman , while waiting for a table .
He noted afterward that Martinez had recently been quoted criticizing fellow Republicans on immigration -- questioning the approaches of Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani .
Rove said he reminded Martinez that the blame should be focused on a Democrat , namely Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , for what Rove characterized as failing to shepherd a comprehensive immigration plan the president supported .
( Reid has placed the blame on the White House , saying it failed to forge the political consensus needed to pass the plan . )
There was one stark sign that Rove was truly leaving .
He expressed what no White House aide would express publicly , though many very senior officials have shared the sentiment privately : that is , distaste for the president 's beloved Scottish terrier , Barney , who is seen by some as aloof and entitled .
" Barney 's a lump , " he joked .
Rove granted the interview as part of a farewell media tour as his detractors -- including many Democrats but also some conservatives -- stepped forward to dispute his legacy .
As Rove left the IHOP for his hotel here in Waco -- some 20 miles from the president 's vacation ranch -- it was evident the degree to which he had become a public figure .
He was twice stopped by well - wishers who said they admired him .
Later , Rove sent a note : " I did n't plant the guy at the IHOP or the woman at the hotel , but it would be the subtle personal touch that the Evil Genius would do to throw you off the scent , do n't you think ? "

Ever wonder what happens to all the stuff confiscated at airports ?
Turns out they sell it – for cheap !
In some states , scissors and corkscrews are available for 25 cents each and swiss army knives cost $ 10 – per pound !
Here 's a list of .gov 's that offer " Leftover Loot " in Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Kentucky , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Texas and Washington .
The TSA took 13 million items from travelers in 2006 alone .
No word on how much stuff ’s been acquired this year , but surely quality goods abound , including my very own Wired - branded swiss army knife , which was commandeered at SFO last spring ( totally forgot it was in my bag , swear ! ) .
Bonus points for whoever finds it and sells it back to me at a reasonable rate .

Many solutions are offered for rising medical costs .
Almost all of them involve more government intervention and less consumer choice .
No one seems to talk about the root cause of rising costs — the extraordinary power of the American Medical Association ( AMA ) to control the supply of doctors .
Last week I had an appointment with my dermatologist .
He has had a distinguished career .
Last year he gave up his practice to devote full time to training dermatology residents at a major teaching hospital .
He sees former patients one day a week .
He told me that although he is willing to essentially give away his former practice , in over a year , he has not found an interested physician .
This was puzzling and disturbing to him .
He had a very large practice in a fast - growing suburb that he had built over many years .
I did n’t ask him what his annual income was from that practice , but I imagine it was substantial .
But apparently it is not substantial enough to attract a physician willing to take it over .
He explained to me that in his current crop of dermatology residents , not one was interested in beginning a general dermatology practice .
They were more interested in more lucrative forms of practice , such as cosmetic surgery .
As an economist , the facts that there are no takers at all for his practice and apparently little interest in general dermatology among new physicians tell me one of two things .
Either there is no longer a demand from patients for general dermatology or there is a shortage of doctors .
Since the former is not true , the latter must be .
There are simply too few dermatologists to fill the comparably lowly financial slots of general dermatology .
An economic principle is that when there is a shortage , prices go up .
Ordinarily — in a free - market — when there is more demand than supply , new entry by suppliers occurs .
However , the supply of physicians is strictly controlled .
How did this shortage of doctors come about ?
In 1910 the AMA , with the backing of the Carnegie Foundation , commissioned Abraham Flexner , himself not a physician , scientist , or medical educator , to inspect medical schools .
Although some inspections took only an afternoon , the Flexner report convinced state legislatures that only graduates of AMA approved medical schools should be licensed to practice medicine .
By exercising its power to certify schools , the AMA reduced the number of medical schools in this country from 160 to 76 .
Suppose there was an American Grocers Association that was granted power to regulate how many supermarkets opened up in each town and city .
What do you think would happen ?
That Association would argue that in order to ensure high quality , the number of supermarkets should be reduced .
They would mount a vigorous campaign to convince the public that the reduction in the number of stores was to protect the public .
But we know what would happen !
If the supply of supermarkets was reduced and entry to open a new supermarket was made difficult , prices would go up , and quality would go down .
Consumers would have to drive farther to get to a supermarket , there would be fewer 24/7 supermarkets open , product selection would be reduced , and innovation would occur at a much slower rate .
And so it is with medical care .
No political party wants to tackle the unbridled power of the AMA — they are just too powerful a lobby .
Until this power of the AMA is tackled , there will be no solution to rising medical costs .
And as a consequence , the movement towards further socialization of medicine , which will hurt the consumer even more , will accelerate .

New high - res shots of race action added to gallery belowclick above image to view high - res pics of the hybrid on race day Toyota Team SARD 's specially - prepared Supra HV - R hybrid GT racer has won the Tokachi 24 - hour endurance race in Japan .
The converted Super GT - spec racing car did so convincingly , too .
As the only GT - class car in the field , the Denso SARD Supra HV - R maintained a steady lead of several laps throughout the course of the race , and in the later hours , it essentially dialed things up a notch and ran away from the rest of the field .
After starting from the pole position , the Supra completed 616 laps in the ensuing 24 hours -- 19 more than the second - place finisher .
The victory marks the first of its type for a hybrid - powered vehicle .
The Supra HV - R began life as a retired 480 - horsepower Super GT racing car , which then had regenerative braking technology and a trio of hybrid motors added to it for this event .
What bearing , if any , the success of the Supra HV-R has on Toyota 's plans for production sports hybrid vehicles is unknown .
With reports that the FT - HS concept is on its way to production , however , we 'll likely be seeing how well a production - spec hybrid sports car fares soon enough .

Why Are Some People So Ignorant About Money ?
Some people are good with money and others make downright horrible financial decisions .
What ’s the difference between the two groups ?
Why are some people so bad with money ?
My wife was watching Suze Orman give people advice on credit card debt and home loan issues last night on Oprah and I was amazed at how clueless some of the guests seemed when explaining their problem or asking questions .
I imagine the majority of them have access to an abundance of personal finance materials such as online content , books , or magazines so why do n’t they know more about money ?
I came up with several money ignorance factors :
Upbringing Factor
They were raised in settings that gave no thought to money management and may have demonstrated unhealthy financial habits .
People affected by this factor just never knew any better and it ’s hard to break old habits .
Friends Factor
In addition to family , another huge influence on most people ’s lives are their friends .
If none of their friends show any interest in money or ability to manage it well a person is less likely to be financially informed or make healthy financial decisions .
Time Factor
Life is busy .
People get involved in their families , jobs , health , communities , hobbies , etc and just do n’t make time to learn about money .
The unfortunate part is that finances can have a big impact on all the parts of life I just mentioned so if people ignore money long enough , it will eventually affect other parts of their life .
Intimidation Factor
Personal finance involves a lot of numbers and concepts that can be intimidating .
If they do n’t have friends or family they can ask financial questions of , they may not feel comfortable learning about money on their own .
As they try and slog through all the details of confusing financial topics they become overwhelmed and just decide to make an uninformed decision .
Denial Factor
There are a lot of hard working people that do n’t get paid well , do n’t have good benefits , and just have bad luck .
I can imagine if I was faced with dire financial circumstances it would be discouraging to think about money .
Rather than dwell on a negative part of their life , people choose to ignore it completely and hope the details will work themselves out .
What Can Be Done ?
These factors do n’t stand alone ; a person could be affected by some or all of them so it ’s easy to see why some people are so clueless about their persona finances .
Unfortunately the reasons behind why someone can’t manage their money wo n’t help them when the bills are due .
Debtors do n’t want to hear “ excuses ” ; they just want to be paid .
I guess the billion dollar question is how can our society help address these different factors so more people are knowledgeable about money and fewer people run into the sad stories we hear about on Oprah .
Thou Shalt Have One Exit Point Per Subroutine -- A Monkey Cage Conundrum
August 29 , 2007
Back when I was a wee lad in Engineerin ' school , fussin ' with alloc and malloc and all of that hurty stuff , a particular lesson was drilled into us :
Thou Shalt Have One Exit Point Per Subroutine
This was given as gospel and we learnt it as such .
It was such a fundamental principle of the coding style they drummed into us that the reasons for it were glossed over quickly -- " it make 's maintenance easier " .
I stuck to that principle for years -- until finally I thought about the underlying reasons , the trade - offs involved , and realised that the benefits were redundant now .
The rule had become , mostly , bunk .
Yet , every time I write a subroutine that has more than one exit point , I find that other monkeys in my monkey cage jump up and down and screech and throw excrement and chatter excitedly .
The psychological aspect of their behaviour was opaque to me until recently when Phill Haack pointed out a particular monkey cage experiment .
So go and read about that monkey cage experiment now .
I 'll be here .
Grinning demonically .
Then we 'll continue .
So why was that commandment so important once ?
And why is it no longer of such importance ?
The big reason used to be around memory management .
You wanted to make sure that any allocated memory was cleaned up at the end of a routine , regardless of what other logical decisions were made during that routine .
Failure to clean up memory properly was terrible -- not just because it caused catastrophic failure .
The real problem was that it caused symptoms that were very far removed from the cause itself .
When you have a memory leak in a program , you can't simply read a stack trace that tells you where to go to debug the problem .
You often end up having to crawl meticulously over the entire program .
In such cases you curse bitterly at any methods that have more than one exit point , because you can't check them quickly -- you instead have to analyse every last piece of logic .
We 're Finally Using the Right Tools
In this age of managed - memory , that sort of memory leak is not an issue ( yes , there are still ways to leak managed - memory ) .
And better still , we have two programming constructs ( in C# and others ) that give the exact kind of flow control we want -- without getting in the way of the program 's intent .
So if you 've got objects to clean up -- use ' using ' or ' finally '.
Well , the surface lesson is simple .
The context of a ' Best Practice ' changes over time , so a best practice should n't be considered in absence of its context .
And every practice must be revisited every once in a while , to see if the context still applies .
The deeper lesson is that monkeys can't be separated from the tortures they 've undergone in the past .
Maybe it 's futile to try and teach old monkeys new coding paradigms .
It 's certainly likely to get you pelted with symian scat .
I do n't like preaching -- so i'm going to stop right there .
But if you 're unconvinced , read up on guard clauses , and question your own beliefs a little .
It 's a deep deep vortex , the inner mind of the inner code monkey .
To finish that topic , here 's a comment from Phil Haack that sums up my feelings well :
Get all the failure conditions out of the way at the top of the method so the body can focus on the real meat .
Ah -- one last detour ...
I found a java thread on the same topic , wherein the discussion veered onto people doing things because ' that 's the way they 've always been ' .
This lead to a discussion of driving on the right side of the road ( the dominant paradigm on earth ) and JosAH claimed this had deep roots in times long past :
Riding a horse on the right side of the road in the dark ages made it nearly impossible for right handed sword fighters to combat each other when they were passing each other .
It 's the ' peaceful ' side .
to which George123 replied :
And having the steering wheel on the left side makes it easier to hit the kids in the back seat .
Just thought I 'll clear that up .
I am enlightened .
I am at one .

Humanity ’s home is far from factory - fresh these days .
Frankly , the Earth has received its share of scratches and dents , including large asteroid impacts , megavolcanoes , earthquakes , ice ages , and heat waves .
It ’s to be expected .
There are over four billion years on the clock , after all .
Though it has long been clear that Earth 1.0 is in need of an upgrade , it was not until a few years ago that someone began to take the notion seriously .
In 2004 , at a respected international design exhibition called the Venice Architecture Biennale , a young artist and architect named Christian Waldvogel displayed his plans for total global annihilation and the creation of Earth 2.0 .
According to Waldvogel , a brave new world could be built from the remains of our current one .
The circumference of this construction⁠ — dubbed Globus Cassus , or ‘ hollow sphere ’ in Latin⁠ — would be comparable to the giant planet Saturn .
During the multi-million year assembly period , massive hoses would worm deep into the Earth ’s fiery bowels and suck liquid metal and magma into orbit through four space elevators sited at equal distances around the equator .
This material would be squirted out and transformed into a lattice framework to support the rest of the edifice .
As the Earth gradually shrivels and shrinks under this onslaught , its gravity would weaken .
Over generations , the skies would darken with the relentless encroachment of the enormous structure above .
Of course it would be easy to dismiss the idea as ridiculous fantasy , one belonging only on the pages of the very pulpiest science fiction .
Yet the Globus Cassus concept is outlined in all seriousness , with the same level of detail as befits any other entry in an eminent international architectural exposition .
While there is much that is quibble - worthy about the plan⁠ — both in engineering terms and in its underlying rationale⁠ —
Waldvogel makes a good case for the idea as an intellectual and philosophical exercise .
He presents his scheme as both an architectural design , and as a thought experiment that could turn the way we think about our current planet⁠ — and human society ⁠— inside out .
Globus Cassus under construction
Waldwogel ’s suggestion involves the redistribution of the Earth ’s material from its present clumpy solid - ball form to that of a 150 km ( 93 mi ) thick hollow shell – one with a diameter of 85,000 km ( 52,817 mi ) , around seven times that of our current planet .
People , plants and animals would live on the inside surface , with rotation of the giant habitat providing a centrifugal gravity - effect to hold everything in place .
The habitable surface area would be approximately ten times that of the Earth’s .
The geometrical construction would take the form of a rounded twenty - faced icosahedron , with air , sea and lands of plenty located on the equatorial regions , and continent - scale silica glass windows allowing sunlight into the interior .
The design appears commendably thorough .
Dimensions are calculated carefully with an architect ’s attention to detail .
The symmetrical construction processes , materials used , and function of the space elevator ‘ scaffolding ’ are described exhaustively .
Even the issue of temporary accommodation for the future occupants is addressed : it ’s proposed that while construction takes place , humans , plants and animals wait patiently ⁠— through countless successive generations ⁠ — in holding areas or archival nodes in the space elevators .
Nor is the provision of basic amenities like air and water overlooked .
When the excavated Earth shrivels to a size where gravity can no longer retain its atmosphere and hydrosphere , the envisaged migration of gas and liquid onto the equatorial regions of the newly - built structure is described poetically as the “ Great Rains ” .
Waldvogel uses detailed computer graphics to illustrate his ideas , and has even published a glossy coffee - table book with colourful pictures depicting the construction of his idealized new world , and the irreversible destruction of our current one .
Yet curiously there are numerous objections to the concept .
Perhaps the most fundamental relates to the construction material .
Our current understanding of physics dictates that no molecular bonds in any conceivable material could ever be sufficiently strong to hold the structure together : certainly Waldvogel ’s proposed ferrous - nickel framework would be hopelessly inadequate .
Globus Cassus would simply come apart from the internal stresses of its rotation and tidal forces from the Moon and the Sun.
Carbon nanotubes form one of the strongest currently - known molecular structures , and are frequently proposed as a construction material for futuristic engineering projects ⁠ — but even their great tensile strength would be insufficient to keep the hollow habitat in one piece .
Stanford Torus
Then there ’s the problem of the prolonged construction time , and a related objection to one of the principal stated reasons for the project : the provision of extra living space for the ever - growing human population .
The proposed temporary accommodation in the ‘ archival nodes ’ provides insufficient gravity at geostationary altitudes for long - term human occupancy .
Yet if humans can be made to live in the nodes long - term , why the need for Globus Cassus in the first place ?
In fact there are numerous alternative proposals for large - scale habitats which could be built more easily : hollowed - out asteroids , giant rotating space stations such as the proposed Stanford torus or Bernal sphere , or even the terraforming of planets such as Mars or Venus .
Waldvogel is far from the first to propose the construction of giant hollow worlds in space .
Visionary physicist Freeman Dyson gave his name to the concept of a ‘ Dyson Sphere ’– a colossal structure totally enclosing a star , capable of capturing all its energy for use by a power - hungry civilization .
The dimensions of such a structure would be vastly greater than that of Globus Cassus , and rotating versions would have the same ‘ artificial gravity ’ acting on the equatorial regions of the inner surface , providing mind - bogglingly huge tracts of habitable land .
Of course many of the same objections to Globus Cassus apply to the Dyson Sphere , and the time , energy , and technological difficulties would be correspondingly magnified .
Dyson never seriously proposed one of his enormous namesake spheres for our own solar system , but he did see the idea as being theoretically feasible – suggesting a possible way to detect mega- engineering civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy .
The ‘ energy exhaust ’ from such a construction would be predominantly in the longer wavelengths of infrared , and this tell - tale electromagnetic signature could be detected from Earth .
Although a few SETI searches have been carried out with this in mind , no such signature has yet been detected .
Practical objections aside , there are more basic questions to ask of Waldvogel , Dyson , and other would - be mega - engineers .
Precisely why a terrestrial or extraterrestrial civilization would want to build such structures may be beyond the grasp of our puny 21st century minds , but it ’s hard to accept Waldvogel ’s ‘ extra living space ’ justification .
Apart from the aforementioned easier expansion options , it ’s not explained why our near - omnipotent descendants – capable of transmogrifying simple Earth rock into impossibly strong wonder - material and fashioning it into an outlandish , outsized , inside - out living space over the course of millions of years – would still not have mastered basic birth control .
Maybe advanced civilizations would build these structures simply to test their technological prowess , or to provide enclosed habitable areas within which they can observe the evolution of life and intelligence on a far grander scale than that which mere lumps of rock can provide .
Perhaps aware of these unanswered questions , Waldvogel provides an intriguing alternative rationale for his hollow global proposal .
He asks us to view the Globus Cassus concept as more than just a simple mega-architectural exercise , and suggests that much of its importance lies in its underlying philosophical foundations .
With a scheme that explicitly requires the complete destruction of Earth and its rebuilding inside - out , it follows that human society might also end up with a radical re-design .
The precise nature of the proposed ‘ Cassian ’ society is left vague and open to discussion , but it ’s suggested that its values would in some way reflect the shape of the New World .
Looking upward , the vision - enhanced citizens of the Globus Cassus would see , instead of blue sky , their neighbours eighty - five thousand kilometres away on the opposite side of the sphere looking back down on them .
Waldwogel ’s hope is that such a situation might change their perspective : with people forced to face each other in this way , maybe they would be , well , nicer .
In such a large , well - resourced environment , more open social structures might have the freedom to evolve compared to the rigid hierarchies of the tired old rock - ball we now call home .
Waldwogel ’s website invites us to consider his proposal in these utopian terms , as a social and metaphorical ‘ antipode ’⁠ — or opposite⁠ — to our current Earth , as well as a physical one .
The idea ’s resemblance to science fiction does n’t deprive it of philosophical value .
At a time when we are increasingly encouraged to see the Earth as something threatened , fragile and in need of ‘ saving ’ , it ’s intriguing to contemplate its complete destruction in a positive light .
Perhaps in the future , crowds of conservation - minded conservatives will protest on the streets , waving placards reading “ Stop Global Hollowing NOW ! ” and “ Halt Earth Change . ”
As the ground starts to thrum and quiver with the work of fearsome engines , it ’s easy to imagine idealistic social reformers cackling manically at their command consoles in the space elevators towering overhead , as they celebrate the dawn of Earth ’s final metamorphosis .
The reported " loss " of six nuclear - armed stealthy advance cruise missiles ( ACMs ) flown on the wing pylons of a B - 52 from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana on August 30 would represent a complete and unprecedented breakdown in the command and control of nuclear weapons in the United States .
For that reason , there is a belief among many seasoned military experts that there is much more to this reported story than meets the eye .
The Defense Department is merely describing the nuclear missile flight as an " incident , " because it is standard Pentagon policy to not comment on its nuclear weapons .
However , the " incident " was serious enough that President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates were both immediately informed of the so - called " mistake " in flying the weapons across several Midwestern states .
Missouri Representative Ike Skelton , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , called the incident " deeply disturbing . "
The incident was first reported by three military officers , who remained anonymous , to Military Times , a newspaper that maintains good contacts within the military services .
The ACMs were armed with six W80 - Mod 1 nuclear weapons , which pack a punch of between 5 and 150 kilotons each .
There is informed speculation that the movement of the nuclear weapons to Barksdale was leaked because the air force base is a staging area for deployment to the Middle East .
The Pentagon recently drew up plans to hit 1200 targets inside Iran in a massive bombardment campaign aimed at destroying its military and overthrowing its government .
The movement of the nuclear weapons may have been an alert to the public by disgruntled members of the military that such plans would include the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons .
The report that the weapons were transferred to Barksdale for " decommissioning " appears to be a cover story concocted by Pentagon spinmeisters , since any movement of nuclear weapons is treated as highly - classified information .
The B - 52 sat on a runway at Barksdale for a full 10 hours with the Air Force trying to have the public believe that no one noticed the nuclear missiles on board .
The flight from Minot was three and a half hours .
The only casualty : the munitions officer at Minot was relieved of his duties pending the outcome of an investigation .
There is also speculation that the war hawks in the administration may have flown the nuclear cruise missiles to Louisiana to send a message to Iran .
The Defense Department remains a beehive of neocon activity even with Gates in charge .
Three other recent incidents indicate the neocons are still employing their perception management campaigns .
Cells of so - called " Al Qaeda " terrorists have been arrested in Denmark and Germany .
Both countries have neocons embedded in their governments .
While it is well understood that the evolution of new genes leads to adaptations that help species survive , gene loss may also afford a selective advantage .
A group of scientists at the University of California , Santa Cruz led by biomolecular engineering professor David Haussler has investigated this less - studied idea , carrying out the first systematic computational analysis to identify long - established genes that have been lost across millions of years of evolution leading to the human species .
Their findings appear in the December 14 issue of PLoS Computational Biology .
Haussler and five others in his group — postdoc Jingchun Zhu , graduate students Zack Sanborn and Craig Lowe , technical projects manager Mark Diekhans , and evolutionary biologist Tom Pringle — are co-authors on the paper .
“ The idea that gene losses might contribute to adaptation has been kicked around , but not well studied , ” said Zhu , who is first author of the paper .
“ We found three examples in the literature , and all of them could have medical implications . ”
To find gene losses , Zhu employed a software program called TransMap that Diekhans had developed .
The program compared the mouse and human genomes , searching for genes having changes significant enough to render them nonfunctional somewhere during the 75 million years since the divergence of the mouse and the human .
“ This is the first study designed to search the entire genome for recent loss of genes that do not have any near - duplicate copies elsewhere in the genome , ” said Haussler .
“ These are likely to be the more important gene losses . ”
Genes can be lost in many ways .
This study focused on losses caused by mutations that disrupt the open reading frame ( ORF - disrupting mutations ) .
These are either point mutations , where events such as the insertion or substitution of a DNA base alter the instructions delivered by the DNA , or changes that occur when a large portion of a gene is deleted altogether or moves to a new place on the genome .
“ We used the dog genome as an out - group to filter out false positives , ” Sanborn explained , because the dog diverged from our ancient common ancestor earlier than the mouse .
“ If a gene is still living in both dog and mouse but not in human , it was probably living in the common ancestor and then lost in the human lineage . ”
Using this process , they identified 26 losses of long - established genes , including 16 that were not previously known .
The gene loss candidates found in this study do not represent a complete list of gene losses of long - established genes in the human lineage , because the analysis was designed to produce more false negatives than false positives .
Next they compared the identified genes in the complete genomes of the human , chimpanzee , rhesus monkey , mouse , rat , dog , and opossum to estimate the amount of time the gene was functional before it was lost .
This refined the timing of the gene loss and also served as a benchmark for whether the gene in question was long - established , and therefore probably functional , or merely a loss of a redundant gene copy .
Through this process , they found 6 genes that were lost only in the human .
One previously unknown loss , the gene for acyltransferase - 3 ( ACYL3 ) , particularly caught their attention .
“ This is an ancient protein that exists throughout the whole tree of life , ” said Zhu .
Multiple copies of the ACYL3 gene are encoded in the fly and worm genomes .
“ In the mammalian clade there is only one copy left , and somewhere along primate evolution , that copy was lost . ”
“ In our analysis , we found that this gene contains a nonsense mutation in human and chimp , and it appears to still look functional in rhesus , ” said Sanborn .
Further , they found that the mutation is not present in the orangutan , so the gene is probably still functional in that species .
“ On the evolutionary tree leading to human , on the branch between chimp and orangutan sits gorilla , ” explained Sanborn .
Knowing if the gene was still active in gorilla would narrow down the timing of the loss .
Sanborn took to the wet laboratory to sequence the corresponding region in a DNA sample from a gorilla .
The gorilla DNA sequence showed the gene intact , without the mutation , so the loss likely occurred between the speciation of gorilla and chimpanzee .
“ Acyltransferase - 3 was not the only lost gene that does n’t have any close functional homologues in the human genome .
A highlight of our research was that we were able to find a list of these ‘ orphan losses , ’ ” said Zhu .
“ Some of them have been functional for more than 300 million years , and they were the last copies left in the human genome . ”
While the copies of these genes remaining in the human genome appear to be nonfunctional , functional copies of all of them exist in the mouse genome .
“ These orphan genes may be interesting candidates for experimental biologists to explore , ” said Zhu .
“ It would be interesting to find out what was the biological effect of these losses .
Once their function is well characterized in species that still have active copies , we could maybe speculate about their effects on human evolution . ”

I would also like to correct Apple and add that my Samsung SGH i600 ( Black Jack ) has wifi too !
Here ’s what the real chart should have looked like :
It ’s really funny when companies highlight their very best features and hide the ones they lack .
So , who comes out as the winner ?
I ’m also curious why they did n’t include the Nokia E61i on the chart .

Pc Tizer is said to be a valuable member of the team
Tizer was adopted by British Transport Police ( BTP ) from the Cats Protection charity in September and inducted into the force as an honorary constable .
In his role as the Chief Mouser Pc Tizer walks around King 's Cross rail station to keep it rodent - free .
An " essential member " of the team , he has unfettered access to all areas and shares an office with a senior officer .
' Playing fetch '
Insp Roy Sloane , who enlisted the tabby , said : " Pc Tizer is already an essential member of the team .
" Since we got him we have n't seen any mice in the building at all ...
Prior to his arrival we were spending a fortune on pest control and it was n't really working . "
Insp Sloane said he visited the charity 's adoption centre in north London with the aim of finding a cat to clean up the station 's rodent problem .
He met Tizer , who arrived at the centre in August after his owner died .
Insp Sloane , who shares his office with Pc Tizer , added that his feline colleague helps other officers " de - stress " and has given a boost to the force 's morale .
" Everyone is always asking after him , and he is probably the most popular member of staff , " he said .
Cats Protection Adoption Centre acting deputy manager Alex Davies said : " He loves being around people , and likes nothing more than playing fetch with his toy spider . "
There are four million DNA samples on the database
The present database in England and Wales holds details of 4 m people who are guilty or cleared of a crime .
Lord Justice Sedley said this was indefensible and biased against ethnic minorities , and it would be fairer to include everyone , guilty or innocent .
Ministers said DNA helped tackle crime , but there were no plans for a voluntary national or compulsory UK database .
A spokesman for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said to expand the database would create " huge logistical and bureaucratic issues " and civil liberty concerns .
' Largest in the world '
Shadow home secretary David Davis called for a Parliamentary debate and described the system for adding people to the database as arbitrary and erratic .
Nick Clegg , Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said there was " no earthly reason " why someone who has committed no crime should be on the database - " yet the government is shoving thousands of innocent people 's DNA details on to the database every month " .
The DNA database - which is 12 years old - grows by 30,000 samples a month taken from suspects or recovered from crime scenes .
There has already been criticism of the database - the largest in the world - because people who are found innocent usually cannot get their details removed .
It also means that a great many people who are walking the streets and whose DNA would show them guilty of crimes , go free
Sir Stephen Sedley
DNA database : A step too far ?
Reaction to database call
In one case , Dyfed - Powys Police stored the DNA of Jeffrey Orchard , 72 , from Pembrokeshire , after he was wrongly arrested for criminal damage - and refused to remove it .
But Home Office Minister Tony McNulty said the database had helped police solve as many as 20,000 crimes a year .
Since 2004 , the data of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England and Wales - all but the most minor offences - has remained on the system regardless of their age , the seriousness of their alleged offence , and whether or not they were prosecuted .
It includes some 24,000 samples from young people between 10 and 17 years old , who were arrested but never convicted .
WHO'S ON THE DATABASE ?
5.2 % of UK population Nearly 40 % of black men 13 % of Asian men 9 % of white men Source : Home Office and Census
Should we all be on it ?
In Scotland , DNA samples taken when people are arrested must be destroyed if the individual is not charged or convicted .
Lord Justice Sedley , who is one of England 's most experienced appeal court judges , said : " We have a situation where if you happen to have been in the hands of the police then your DNA is on permanent record .
If you have n't , it is n't .
" It means where there is ethnic profiling going on disproportionate numbers of ethnic minorities get onto the database .
" It also means that a great many people who are walking the streets and whose DNA would show them guilty of crimes , go free . "
DNA PROFILING Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) is found in virtually all cells
Only a tiny sample of saliva , blood , semen , etc , is needed for testing
At the molecule 's core is a long sequence of chemical units , which is checked for a gender and 10 other ' markers '
Probability of a chance match is less than one in one billion A match may be with a specific individual or hint at a relative Profiles can provide indications of ethnic origin
They do not point to genetic disorders or susceptibilities
He said the only option was to expand the database to cover the whole population and all those who visited the UK , even for a weekend .
" Going forwards has very serious but manageable implications , " he insisted .
It means that everybody , guilty or innocent , should expect their DNA to be on file for the absolutely rigorously restricted purpose of crime detection and prevention . "
Figures compiled from Home Office statistics and census data show almost 40 % of black men have their DNA profile on the database .
That compares with 13 % of Asian men and 9 % of white men .
Keith Jarrett , president of the Black Police Association , said the current system was " untenable " and backed the call for a universal database .
" You can't have a system where so many black youths who have done nothing wrong are perhaps going to the police station for elimination from a crime and find that their DNA is on the database , " he said .
But Professor Stephen Bain , a member of the national DNA database strategy board , warned expansion would be expensive and make mistakes more likely .
" The DNA genie can't be put back in the bottle , " he said .
" If the information about you is exposed due to illegal or perhaps even legalised use of the database , in a way that is not currently anticipated , then it's a very difficult situation . "
' Ripe for abuse '
Mr McNulty said there were no plans to introduce DNA profiling for everyone in the UK , but " no - one ever says never " .
He said Lord Justice Sedley 's idea " has logic to it - but I think he 's underestimating the practical issues , logistics , civil and ethical issues that surround it . "
Mr McNulty denied the current database was unfair but accepted there was room for debate on the workings of the present system , including time limits on the storing of information .
He said any imbalance in the number of black and white youths whose DNA was stored reflected disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System rather than an inherent problem with the database .
But he added that he was glad a debate had begun and a review of how DNA samples were kept and used would be published next February .
Tony Lake , chief constable of Lincolnshire Police and chairman of the DNA board , said the DNA of people convicted or arrested for violent or sex offences should remain on the database for life , but that need not be the case for minor offences .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights organisation Liberty , said a database for every man , woman and child in the country was " a chilling proposal , ripe for indignity , error and abuse " .
Ban Ki-moon , Secretary General of the United Nations , stated in an October 15 , 2007 address , " Climate change is a defining issue of our time .
The science is clear .
. . .
We know what we have to do .
We have affordable measures and technologies to do it . "
What we do n’t have is the money – at least , we do n’t have it under the current system of bank - created credit .
We also do n’t have time .
Ban Ki-moon went on :
" Traveling in Chad recently , I saw first - hand the humanitarian toll of climate change .
An estimated 20 million people depend on a lake and river system that has shrunk to a tenth of its original size over the past 30 years .
In Africa right now , the worst rains in memory are washing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes .
These are signs of what is to come .
The problems our generation faces will be worse for our children , particularly if we do not act .
. . .
We must engage the private sector , stimulate economic activity , use new financing and market - based approaches , develop and transfer know - how , and create jobs . "
The United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) is currently seeking ideas for a debate to be held in Bali in December 2007 , involving innovative ways to fund the costs of adapting to climate change in the developing world .
Here is my submission :
FUNDING PUBLIC PROJECTS WITH PUBLICLY -ISSUED MONEY
Governments have the sovereign right to create and lend money .
The United Nations could assume that right as well , just as the International Monetary Fund has assumed the right to issue credit in the form of " Special Drawing Rights " that are convertible into national currencies .
As will be shown here , government - issued or U.N. - issued money could be used for sustainable energy projects without causing inflation , and this could be profitably done even by impoverished governments with weak legal structures and immature government accountability mechanisms .
Credit created by governments or the United Nations would have the advantage that it could be issued interest - free .
Eliminating the cost of interest could cut production costs dramatically .
Interest composes as much as 77 % of the cost of capital - intensive goods and services such as public housing .
The average is brought down by labor - intensive services such as garbage collection , for which interest makes up only about 12 % of the cost ; but the overall average cost of interest has been estimated at about half of everything we buy .
1
If money for alternative energy projects were issued interest - free , projects that have been considered unsustainable because of the burden of interest could become not only self - sustaining but highly profitable for the funding governments .
In The Modern Universal Paradigm ( 2007 ) , Rodney Shakespeare gives the example of the Humber Bridge , which was built in the UK at a cost of 98 million .
Every year since the bridge opened in 1981 , it has turned an operating profit ; that is , its running costs ( basically repair , maintenance and staff salaries ) have been exceeded by the fees it receives from travelers crossing the river Humber .
But by the time the bridge opened in 1981 , interest charges had driven its cost up to 151 million ; and by 1992 , only 10 years later , the debt had shot up to a breath - taking 439 million .
The UK government was forced to intervene with sizeable grants and writeoffs to save the local residents from bearing the brunt of these costs .
If the bridge had been financed with interest - free , government - issued money , these costs could have been avoided and the bridge could have funded itself .
2
The Inflation Objection
The argument against governments issuing and lending money for development projects is that it would be inflationary , but this need not be the case .
Price inflation results when " demand " ( money ) increases faster than " supply " ( goods and services ) .
As economist John Maynard Keynes pointed out , when the national currency is expanded to fund productive projects , supply goes up along with demand , leaving consumer prices unaffected .
3
Moreover , private banks themselves create the money they lend .
Many authorities have confirmed this fact , including the Federal Reserve itself .
The Chicago Federal Reserve exposed the mechanics of money creation in a publication called Modern Money Mechanics , in which it said :
" Of course , they [ commercial banks ] do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits .
If they did this , no additional money would be created .
What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits to the borrowers ’ transaction accounts .
4 "
See also Money Facts , published in 1964 by Congressman Wright Patman , Chairman of the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the Banking and Currency Committee .
Responding to the question " Do private banks issue money today ? " , he wrote :
" Yes .
Although banks no longer have the right to issue bank notes , they can create money in the form of bank deposits when they lend money to businesses , or buy securities .
. . .
The important thing to remember is that when banks lend money they do n’t necessarily take it from anyone else to lend .
Thus they " create " it . "
5
During the recent bank credit crisis in August 2007 , the central banks of the United States , Europe , Canada , Australia and Japan collectively extended a $ 315 billion credit line to commercial banks .
This credit was created out of nothing ( something central banks assume the right to do as " lenders of last resort " ) , and the sums advanced were huge .
6
For comparative purposes , a mere $ 188 billion would have been enough to repair all of the 74,000 U.S. bridges known to be defective , preventing another disaster like that in Minnesota in July 2007 .
The Carbon Trust , a well - known UK company dedicated to cutting carbon emissions , is responsible for reducing emissions by nearly 2 million tons per year on a 2007 budget of only £ 115.9 million ( about $ 60 million U.S. ) .
If central banks can create hundreds of billions of dollars to save floundering private banks , governments can create comparable credits to adapt to climate change , an even more pressing problem .
The sovereign right to issue money actually belongs to governments , not to private banks ; but few governments exercise that right today .
The only money the U.S. government issues are coins , which compose only about one one - thousandth of the U.S. money supply ( M3 ) .
All of the rest is created by private banking institutions when they make loans .
This includes the privately - owned Federal Reserve , which creates Federal Reserve Notes ( dollar bills ) and lends them to the government and to commercial banks .

Google 's core business is Internet search but that is n't keeping the company from exploring some other very different areas .
On Tuesday , Google announced an ambitious plan to develop electricity from renewable energy sources that will be cheaper than electricity produced from coal .
The newly created initiative , known as RE < C , will focus initially on advanced solar thermal power , wind power technologies , enhanced geothermal systems and what Google referred to as " other potential breakthrough technologies . "
As part of its capital planning process , Google said it anticipates investing hundreds of millions of dollars in breakthrough renewable energy projects which generate positive returns .
Near term , Google said it plans to spend tens of millions of dollars next year on research and development and related investments in renewable energy .
" We have gained expertise in designing and building large - scale , energy - intensive facilities by building efficient data centers , " said Larry Page , Google 's co-founder and president of products , in a statement .
" We want to apply the same creativity and innovation to the challenge of generating renewable electricity at globally significant scale , and produce it cheaper than from coal . "
While there was no timetable released on when the first fruits of Google 's renewable energy efforts might see the light of day , it has at least one specific target .
" Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal .
We are optimistic this can be done in years , not decades , " said Page .
( One gigawatt can power a city the size of San Francisco . )
Page said there are several promising " green " technologies that will benefit from further investment and research into making them more cost competitive .
Solar thermal technology was one example he cited that " provides a very plausible path to providing renewable energy cheaper than coal . "
Google.org , the search giant 's philanthropic arm , is also going to be investing in companies that show the potential to produce energy at an unsubsidized cost lower than coal - fired plants .
Makani Power and eSolar , were mentioned as companies Google.org is " working with . "
A spokesman for eSolar said the company is not commenting yet on whether it 's received an investment from Google.org .
Pasadena , CA - based eSolar specializes in solar thermal power , which replaces the fuel in a traditional power plant with heat produced from solar energy .
eSolar is headed by serial entrepreneur Bill Gross , who also runs technology incubator Idealab .
Idealab recently moved into the renewable energy market with Energy Innovations , a sister company to eSolar that focuses on the retail rooftop solar market .
Gross was unavailable for comment on Google 's announcement , but at a recent technology conference , he told InternetNews.com it was important to diversify into alternative energy " for the good of the country . "
Makani Power , based in Alameda , CA , is developing high - altitude wind energy extraction technologies .
According to the company , high - altitude wind energy has the potential to satisfy a significant portion of current global electricity needs .
Google said it's on track to meet an internal goal it set last spring to be carbon neutral in 2007 and beyond .
The company has extensive solar panel installations at its Mountain View , Calif . campus .
But last year rival Microsoft announced it had installed the largest solar electric system in Silicon Valley at its facility , also in Mountain View .
Google said RE < C signifies the effort to create renewable energy at a cost less than energy from coal , thus , R( enewable ) E( nergy ) < C( oal ) .
The Ron-Paul - Is - A - Closet - Nazi meme continues .
It seems to me that there are a lot of reasons to oppose Ron Paul .
Jamie Kirchick 's vision of US foreign policy is one of them .
But to say that a single $ 500 contribution from a neo - Nazi crackpot is somehow " keeping company " with fascists is absurd .
Michael Goldfarb asks :
Andrew , are you not troubled at all by the creeps who 've signed on to the Paul campaign , or the fact that he is so completely unperturbed by their support that he has yet to distance himself in any way from it ?
Maybe not -- Sullivan's " simple message " to Ron Paul supporters : " You 're welcome here . "
That includes the Nazis , or no ?
There are plenty of reasons to be perturbed when loons and hate - mongers support a candidacy .
But this game of guilt - by - association can be played endlessly .
I tend to place greater emphasis on loons and hate - mongers that candidates actively seek out .
Pat Robertson is a loon and an anti-Semite and a vicious homophobe who blamed Americans for 9/11 .
Giuliani did n't receive some unsolicited money from him ; he actually stood on a platform and embraced him .
Why one standard for Paul and another for Giuliani ?
If Obama embraced Louis Farrakhan as a supporter , you think Goldfarb and Kirchick would be silent ?
They'd have a cow because it 's unthinkable .
But naked bigotry is more than thinkable in today 's GOP : it 's integral to it .
What 's the difference between Farrakhan and Robertson ?
I can't see any .
Maybe Goldfarb and Kirchick can spell it out .
Giuliani also promoted and endorsed a seriously mobbed up man to be head of the DHS ; he fully embraces and employs a priest credibly accused of sex abuse of a minor ( and refuses to distance himself from him ) ; and actively endorses torture as a foreign policy weapon .
Jamie Kirchick actually supports Giuliani for president - but is hyper - ventilating about a $ 500 check that Paul has n't even decided what to do with !
There you have the massive double - standards on the neocon right .
Here 's an idea : when Giuliani disowns his abusing priest , his mafia - consigliere and his anti-Semitic nutcase , Ron Paul should send back the $ 500 .
Deal ?

The head of AT&T has promised that a version of Apple ’s iPhone capable of connecting to 3G wireless networks will be released next year , bringing noticeably faster web access and email downloads to this line of smartphones .
A faster connection to the Internet is probably the most requested feature in the iPhone , and many have passed on buying the current version of this smartphone because it only offers the 2.5G standard EDGE .
AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson — whose company is the exclusive provider of the iPhone in the U.S. — did not give any details on on when the new version will be released , though doubtless many are expecting an announcement at the MacWorld tradeshow in January .
Apple announced the original at this same venue this year .
Apple ’s Steve Jobs has said that 3G was left out of the current model because it would put such a drain on the battery that the time between recharges would be unacceptably short .
It ’s not clear if the next version will have a higher capacity battery , if Apple engineers have found ways to make the device more power efficient , or if the company is simply giving in to customer pressure and will release a model with a shorter battery life than the current one .
As for the price of the 3G iPhone , Stephenson said that would be determined by Steve Jobs .

Trusted Computing has been a controversial addition to PCs since it was first announced as Palladium in 2002 .
Recently , a group at Dartmouth implemented an attack first described by Bernhard Kauer earlier this year .
The attack is very simple , using only a 3 - inch piece of wire .
As with the Sharpie DRM hack , people are wondering how a system designed by a major industry group over such a long period could be so easily bypassed .
The PC implementation of version 1.1 of the Trusted Computing architecture works as follows .
The boot ROM and then BIOS are the first software to run on the CPU .
The BIOS stores a hash of the boot loader in the TPM ’s PCR before executing it .
A TPM - aware boot loader hashes the kernel , appends that value to the PCR , and executes the kernel .
This continues on down the chain until the kernel is hashing individual applications .
How does software know it can trust this data ?
In addition to reading the SHA - 1 hash from the PCR , it can ask the TPM to sign the response plus a challenge value using an RSA private key .
This allows the software to be certain it ’s talking to the actual TPM and no man - in - the - middle is lying about the PCR values .
If it does n’t verify this signature , it ’s vulnerable to this MITM attack .
As an aside , the boot loader attack announced by Kumar et al is n’t really an attack on the TPM .
They apparently patched the boot loader ( a la eEye ’s BootRoot ) and then leveraged that vantage point to patch the Vista kernel .
They got around Vista ’s signature check routines by patching them to lie and always say “ everything ’s ok . ”
This is the realm of standard software protection and is not relevant to discussion about the TPM .
How does the software know that another component did n’t just overwrite the PCRs with spoofed but valid hashes ?
PCRs are “ extend - only , ” meaning they only add new values to the hash chain , they do n’t allow overwriting old values .
So why could n’t an attacker just reset the TPM and start over ?
It ’s possible a software attack could cause such a reset if a particular TPM was buggy , but it ’s easier to attack the hardware .
The TPM is attached to a very simple bus known as LPC ( Low Pin Count ) .
This is the same bus used for Xbox1 modchips .
This bus has a 4 - bit address / data bus , 33 MHz clock , frame , and reset lines .
It ’s designed to host low - speed peripherals like serial / parallel ports and keyboard / mouse .
The Dartmouth researchers simply grounded the LPC reset line with a short wire while the system was running .
From the video , you can see that the fan control and other components on the bus were also reset along with the TPM but the system keeps running .
At this point , the PCRs are clear , just like at boot .
Now any software component could store known - good hashes in the TPM , subverting any auditing .
This particular attack was known before the 1.1 spec was released and was addressed in version 1.2 of the specifications .
Why did it go unpatched for so long ?
Because it required non-trivial changes in the chipset and CPU that still are n’t fully deployed .
Next time , we ’ll discuss a simple hardware attack that works against version 1.2 TPMs .
CORONA , Calif ( Reuters ) - Bhaviesh and Varsha Shah bought their dream home in a new development east of Los Angeles two years ago , planted flowers around an emerald lawn and picked out wicker furniture for sitting outside on cool afternoons .
Two houses display ' For Sale ' signs side by side on Mulan Street in Corona , California , in this May 2 , 2007 file photo .
REUTERS / Mark Avery / Files
Today the view from their porch is a street pocked with boarded windows and dead lawns -- homes now repossessed after buyers failed to make mounting mortgage payments .
The Shahs live on a street with 10 large homes of 3,000 square feet or more , four of them now in foreclosure .
Although they are surviving the mortgage meltdown , their dream development -- like many in this arid corner of Southern California known as the Inland Empire -- is an early casualty .
“ We ’re not surprised .
We had a feeling it was coming , ” said Varsha Shah .
They found out which way the wind was blowing about a year ago when several families moved into some of the homes and never bothered to water the grass or pick up beer cans .
Unlike the Shahs , they did n’t seem to be in Towne Square and its 49 Spanish - style and 1920s - inspired Craftsman homes for the long haul .
The Inland Empire , 50 miles east of Los Angeles , was a latecomer to the housing boom in California as buyers squeezed out of high - price coastal Los Angeles and Orange counties found large homes going up on the region ’s vast supply of vacant land .
And it has been one of the most hard hit by foreclosures .
The Inland Empire ’s combined Riverside and San Bernardino counties reported the fourth highest number of foreclosure filings of any of the nation ’s 229 largest metro areas in July , behind Atlanta , Los Angeles and Detroit , according to market tracker RealtyTrac .
OWNERS GO ‘UPSIDE DOWN ’
Survivors of Towne Square find themselves not only with unsightly , empty properties next door , but also with home values plummeting amid the fire sales on foreclosed homes .
So selling and moving to a better neighborhood is not much of an option because many owe more on their mortgage than they would get for the sale -- what the industry calls “ upside down . ”
And real estate agents note that California ’s market is likely to rebound as it has in the past , underpinned by high population growth .
“ Everything goes in cycles .
I think we ’ll be OK if people do n’t panic , ” said Patricia Patton , who has been a real estate agent in the area for over 14 years .
Joe and Mary Gordon do n’t feel much like sticking around , but have little choice .
They bought an approximately 4,000 square - foot ( 371 sq meter ) home on the street behind the Shahs for $ 741,000 , thinking it would be their last home after moving from Orange County , just west of the Inland Empire .
Two homes on the Gordon ’s street are going through foreclosure and one of them , comparable in size to theirs , is being offered by the bank for $ 550,000 .
The Gordons fear they will lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity .
“ We have no recourse .
We ’ll have to live here eight to ten years before we get our equity back , ” said Joe .
Bob Taylor , president of the development ’s homeowners association , said his family thought about moving , but with the installation of a pool and landscaping , they did n’t think they would break even after the market turned south .
The frustrated families stuck in Towne Square are critical of the developer Centex Corp. for failing to exclude investors and scammers who bought 14 to 17 of the 49 homes in what was billed as a “ family centered executive development . ”
“ Centex has discouraged speculative investments in our primary - home neighborhoods , ” Eric Bruner , Centex ’s director of public relations , told Reuters in response to homeowners ’ complaints .
CHARLES MANSON
The families believe the investors were not just people flipping houses for a quick profit , but also a group of scammers taking advantage of lax lending rules that permitted 100 percent financing with no money down and minimal documentation .
For the Gordons and Taylors , these are the people who ruined the neighborhood by using their homes like revolving night clubs , cramming cars into the cul de sacs and threatening neighbors who complained .
The Corona Police Department said it was called about neighborhood disturbances on Towne Square ’s Summerset St. , where the Shahs live , 35 times in 2006 .
The street that runs parallel , Springfield Circle received 28 complaints .
“ How did we feel ?
Sick ! ” Joe Gordon yelled , throwing up his hands .
“ We ’d go to work , then just come in the house and hide .
You never knew what was going to happen . ”
Now , many of the investors have disappeared and their homes have gone into foreclosure .
Despite the bad days spent in Towne Square , Bob Taylor said his family of six is here to stay and even optimistic that nice , responsible neighbors will eventually move into the foreclosed homes .
“ After what we ’ve been through for the past two years -- short of Charlie Manson moving in -- it ca n’t be any worse , ” he said , referring to the famous American murderer .

Some demonstrators called Gere 's embrace of Shetty " vulgar "
Demonstrators in Mumbai ( Bombay ) set light to effigies of the Hollywood star , while protesters in other cities shouted " death to Shilpa Shetty " .
The protesters said Gere insulted Indian culture by kissing the hand and face of the Bollywood actress .
Public displays of affection and sex are still largely taboo in India .
Shetty downplayed the incident , saying " it was not so obscene " .
" This was not such a big thing for people to over - react in such a manner , " the actress told the Press Trust of India news agency .
" I understand people 's sentiments , but I do n't want a foreigner to take bad memories from here .
I understand this is his culture , not ours , " she added .
Swooped
Anjali Gopolan , head of Indian Aids prevention group the Naz Foundation , said : " I think he responded as an actor .
He was playing to the gallery .
I do n't see anything bad . "
The kissing scenes were regularly played on Indian TV , with some viewers commenting on Gere 's actions , while Indian newspapers carried the picture on their front pages .
Indian star Shilpa Shetty won the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother
The Aids awareness rally focused on India 's truck driving community , with Gere leading proceedings by shouting " no condom , no sex " in Hindi .
The crowd whooped with delight and whistled as the 58 - year - old clasped Shetty and kissed her on the face several times .
After the actress recovered her balance , Gere offered her a gallant bow .
Protesters said his embrace of one of the country 's leading ladies had been " vulgar " and demanded an apology from the film star .

“ While Members of Congress are passionate about their views what Congressman Stark said during the debate was inappropriate . "
Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , ( D - Ca )
“ But this -- we got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel .
So I 've told people that if you 're interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have ( sic ) the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
George Bush , War Criminal
I cheered inside my head when I heard , Rep .
Stark unbelievably utter his words condemning the murderous acts of BushCo on the House floor and I was impressed with his candor , compassion and what I consider an appropriate amount of rage and honesty .
How many of us were not thinking the same thing about the S - CHIP votes ?
I knew , however , that it would not be long until Pete Stark had to apologize and it happened today .
I believe that Speaker Pelosi ’s comments about Rep. Stark were utterly inappropriate and out of line .
I believe that when she said that impeachment was “ off the table , ” her remarks were not only inappropriate but also antithetical to our Constitution and directly in opposition to why the people of this country put Democrats back in power .
We may remind the Speaker of some of the things George has said :
He told us that Saddam was able to reach the Eastern part of the US with drones that contained either chemical or biological weapons ; that the smoking gun might come in the form of a “ mushroom cloud ” and that Saddam was also seeking significant amounts of “ yellow cake uranium . ”
George and his co-criminals also told us over and over again the 9 - 11 was the justification for an attack on Iraq because Saddam had something to do with 9 - 11 .
It is imperative that Ms. Pelosi be a true leader and lead the charge to impeach the liars , or at least get the hell out of the way so they can be impeached .
I buried my son for no logical , moral or truthful reason for God ’s sake , and she has neither the integrity or fortitude to finally say that BushCo has to be stopped before George is the instigator for Armageddon . ,
are killing innocent Iraqis .
IT IS A WAR !
What do these morally bankrupt Chickenhawks think occurs in war ?
It would be better for everyone if “ the troops ” went over to play pinochle with the Iraqis , but occupied peoples have an inherent hatred of their occupiers and want them to leave their country : dead or alive .
Congress wants to hide behind “ the troops ” by giving BushCo billions of more dollars to wage the occupation so their lobbyist buddies and campaign contributors can become richer off of the flesh and blood of those same troops that they claim to support .
BushCo has over 14 more months to sew their demented seeds of destruction all over the planet and we must all join Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - Oh ) in his call to remove them from office not only for their past , but for their future , illegal wars of aggression , possibly even doing the unthinkable : using a nuclear weapon .
The terrorists that wear Brooks Brothers and Armani and live and work in the big white house on Pennsylvania Avenue are more dangerous to our way of life and safety than any others .
I wish Congressman Stark had not caved to the establishment elitists .
George is the one that needs to apologize to each and every one of us for killing just about everything that we hold dear : our treasury , our Constitution , our standing in the international community , our ecology , our children , and for murdering our hopes and dreams for the future .
When I replace Nancy Pelosi as the Representative from California ’s 8th district , I will fight for the lives , security and prosperity of , not only my constituents , but for all the human beings in the world .
If BushCo is still in office , God forbid , when I am sworn in , I will do everything in my power to hold them accountable for their crimes against humanity and I will never , ever apologize for telling the truth .

As noted below , passage of the Webb dwell time amendment hinges on a handful of key Republican votes .
Senators Voinovich ( R - OH ) , Mukowski ( R - AK ) and Dole ( R - NC ) all indicated yesterday that they are seriously considering voting for the measure that would servicemembers at least much time at home as they have spent deployed in Iraq .
Senator Warner ( R - VA ) , as KagroX explainedyesterday , is having a little trouble maintaining a moral course .
As Senator Webb points out , this is a " very simple , common sense amendment . "
But the GOP has never been about common sense , or decency , or rationality for that matter .
And thus , we have the GOP pushing hard against passage of the Webb Amendment :
Senate Republican leaders are leaning hard on their conference to vote against the Webb amendment , and Republican Party General Chairman Mel Martinez of Florida predicted the measure could lose Republican support this time around .
At a closed - door luncheon meeting Tuesday , Senate Republicans discussed drafting an alternative , non-binding " Sense of the Senate " resolution stating that the Senate recognizes that the burden is very heavy on troops but supporting the troop rotations set by the Pentagon , senators said .
Republicans hope floating that proposal would prevent defections by allowing their conference to go on record recognizing the challenges facing troops in Iraq .
Oh , now the GOP is embracing " Sense of the Senate " resolutions on Iraq ( after calling similar non-binding resolutions on Iraq " meaningless " and " political stunts " ) ?
Of course they are .
Because this proposed non-binding Sense of the Senate is not meaningless to them .
After all , it means all the world to the GOP to ignore the reality of a near - broken military and to cling instead to their failed Commander - in - Chief .
Party over people .
It 's the GOP way .
And so , this proposal , this repulsive mix of apathy and political calculation , is being force - fed to the aforementioned wavering Republicans .
The Senate GOP believes it is a tempting treat for them - - a way to express their " concern " for the troops stranded in the quicksands of the President 's Iraq policy without actually having to do anything to help those troops .
But for those wavering Senators , this faux sensitivity , this feigning of compassion should not be enough .
Because with 175 dead from Senator Specter 's Pennsylvania , with 106 dead from Senator Warner 's Virginia , with 90 dead constituents in the Land of Liddy Dole , with 63 heroes buried in the soil of McConnell 's Kentucky , with 15 perished patriots in Murkowski's Alaska , and with 159 caskets carried back home to Voinovich 's Ohio , and with literally thousands more injured or dead in every state in this nation , it is clear that Webb 's binding bill is the only way to truly support the troops .
Three thousand seven hundred and eighty nine dead are no " small price " .
Almost 30,000 wounded troops are worth more than a non-binding bill of meaningless sympathy .
And the families of nearly 170,000 deserve more than cardboard " Flat Daddies " and they deserve more than the pitiful , inconsequential expressions of " support . "
They deserve action , and respect .
They deserve the Webb amendment .
Push back against the GOP 's efforts .
Call these wavering Senators , and tell them to give more than lip service to supporting our troops .

To celebrate Darwin ’s 211th birthday we are launching For the Curious , a series of simple interactives that explore different areas of Darwin ’s life , work and legacy through his letters .
We start with ‘ Darwin working from home ’ , in which you can explore objects from Darwin ’s study and garden at Down House to learn how he worked and what he had to say about it .
Not all his work days were successful , here are some letters about Darwin 's bad days .
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas today refused to authorize a Medicaid payment for an abortion for a 15 - year - old girl whose stepfather has been charged with incest , despite a Federal judge 's order that such payments were required by Federal law .
Through a spokesman , Mr. Huckabee said his first obligation was to obey the Arkansas State Constitution , rather than Federal law .
The State Constitution includes an amendment banning the use of public money for abortion except when a mother 's life is endangered ; the Federal statute requires that Medicaid pay for abortions that are performed on poor women in cases of rape or incest or a threat to the mother 's life .
Aides to Mr. Huckabee , a Southern Baptist minister , emphasized that his refusal to authorize the payment of the $ 430 claim did not reflect his well - known opposition to abortion but was a carefully considered strategy to protect the state 's position in a pending lawsuit in a state court .
In that action , an anti-abortion advocate is seeking an order compelling Arkansas 's withdrawal from the Medicaid program because of the state constitutional provision .
A part of the state 's position has been that the case is moot because no one in Arkansas has sought Medicaid reimbursement for an abortion before .
But Carolyn Izard , the supervisor of the clinic that performed the abortion on the young patient last week , called Mr. Huckabee 's position '' nonsense . ' '
Personal Statement of David Perino
My name is David Perino , and I was a teacher in Prince William County , Virginia for 17 years .
I had worked with hundreds of different students and never once had a complaint made against me by a student , parent , or administrator .
In 2003 , accusations were made against me by a former special education student that I had attempted to sexually assault her .
Articles regarding my situation are attached below .
When I was first accused , I was at a complete loss as to what I should do .
I believed that the student would come forward and tell the truth but , that never occurred .
I then was questioned by the police and realized that I needed to seek legal help .
Finding a good attorney is something I had never had to do , and I had no idea of how to go about doing it .
I looked in the phone book , talked to friends , and finally just called and set up free consultations to explain my situation and see which one I felt the most comfortable with defending me .
The Prince William County Police had asked me to take a polygraph test , and I had told them from the very beginning that I had been falsely accused and that I did not feel that it was necessary to have a machine tell them that I did not do anything illegal .
The detective in my case stated , " If you do n't take one , you must know that we are going to believe that you did do something . "
I consulted one attorney in Fredericksburg , VA who stated to me , " If you do not have anything to hide , then I suggest that you probably should go ahead and take the polygraph . "
So , I agreed to take it .
At the time I was a mess mentally .
It was as if my life had been taken from me .
I could barely wake up and take care of myself , let alone my family .
I lost all contact with the students I had worked with each day and the staff whom I had worked with for ten years .
I decided that I would take the polygraph because I had nothing to hide and felt that it would convince the police that I was falsely accused .
During the polygraph , I was asked many questions about my sexuality , marriage , and contact with the student who made the accusations against me .
Following the polygraph , I was told that it was determined that I was deceptive in my answers to the question of whether I had attempted to sexually assault the alleged victim .
I continued to reiterate to the detective that I was falsely accused and that I was not going to tell them that I did something that I did not do !
I was then subjected to an interrogation for approximately one hour .
I continued to declare my innocence .
The prosecutor 's office made the unfortunate decision to present charges to a grand jury , and I was indicted , jailed , and then bonded out .
I then really needed a good attorney .
Prior to being jailed , a friend recommended an attorney that he knew .
I went and talked with him and explained my situation .
He had some experience dealing with felony cases , and he was young and seemed aggressive .
I retained him as counsel .
I really did not know what I should do .
The first thing that my attorney did was to try and work a deal with the prosecutor .
They wanted me to plead guilty to several felony charges and serve 3 - 5 years .
Well , needless to say , I was not interested in any plea agreement .
After many pretrial motion hearings , I then went to trial and my attorney 's opening statement to the jury lasted 2 - 3 minutes and was unprepared .
I should have known at that point that I was in trouble , but I continued to believe that my attorney would do his best .
After a 4 - day trial , my attorney recommended that I not testify .
The jury deliberated for about 6 hours the first day .
My attorney was in a panic and predicted that they were going to find me guilty on one of the three charges that I faced .
He then wanted to see if prior to the jury returning a guilty verdict and me facing up to 30 years in prison , they would offer a better plea bargain .
They again came back with an offer requiring that I plead guilty to one felony , spend 6 months in prison and 3 years probation , be subjected to random polygraph testing , and resign my position with the school system .
I would also have become a registered felony sexual offender .
My attorney felt it was a great deal , and I guess it was , given that I faced up to 30 years behind bars .
I only considered the thought of accepting a plea bargain due to my children .
At the time , I had one daughter who was 3 and another who was 8 years old .
I had a difficult time facing the thought that I could possibly spend their entire childhood without them being able to have a dad .
It almost worked , but I declined the plea offer and put my faith in God and the jury that they would see the truth .
The second day , the jury continued deliberations , and I heard many times from my attorney how I might be going to jail and that I should have taken the plea bargain .
Well , after 14 hours , despite the judge 's instructions to the jury to continue and attempt to reach a verdict , they were deadlocked .
A mistrial was declared on all of the charges .
The prosecutor again decided to pursue my case , and I was tried again several months later .
With the assistance of a new attorney , the trial lasted 3 days .
The jury deliberated just over an hour , and I was acquitted on all charges .
What I want people to know is that they should never agree to submit to a polygraph test .
If you are involved in any police matter involving felony charges , I would recommend that you invoke your Miranda rights the first question they ask you .
Anything you say to the police can only be used against you in court .
Never speak until you have good legal counsel .
They had the alleged victim call my home and try to talk to me , and I know for a fact they were on the line taping everything that was said with the hope that I would say something that would incriminate me .
This happened to another teacher in my county who did do something illegal .
The police are allowed to lie to you and be deceptive in anyway they can to get you to say something that they can use against you in court .
As far as attorneys are concerned , find a good one .
Remember that it is not the " justice " system , as many people would want you to think : it is the legal system .
Taking a polygraph test was the biggest mistake that I ever made .
After I took it , it was somehow conveyed by the detective or the school system 's risk management investigator -- who was present during the interrogation following the polygraph -- to a person who was a staff member at my school ( and who also testified afterwards against me in court ) that I had " failed it . "
I do n't know if it was illegal for the polygraph results to be shared with others .
A friend who was also a staff member called me on the phone the day that she heard that I had failed the polygraph from the other staff member .
A lot of people unfortunately do believe that polygraphs are the real deal , and if you " failed it , " then you must be guilty .
Dr. Phil , Court TV , and the agencies and people who administer them continue to convey the message that the polygraph is fool - proof , accurate , and without error .
Well , any person who reads what is on the AntiPolygraph.org web site , or independent research that has been conducted , will have to come to the educated conclusion that polygraphs are a joke .
In the words of Albert Einstein , " Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods . "
I know that history has taught us many lessons .
Why the polygraph is even a part of our legal system is beyond understanding .
We might just as well have fortune tellers , Ouija boards , and tarot card readers doing the detective work .
The hard part is that the public perception of law enforcement is that they are the good guys , and if they say that it is true , then it must be .
They are the ones that are out there catching the bad guys and stopping the bad people from doing harm in society .
So , if they are utilizing the polygraph to help them find the bad guys , then it must be right .
A lot of people believe in things that they do n't understand or know enough about .
They just put their faith in the belief that whatever it is must be right .
I have tried to explain to those who know me how polygraphs themselves are deceptive and not accurate , and so on .
But you still wonder whether they may not believe that you are actually telling the truth , thinking in the back of their minds that you must have done something wrong for the police to have charged you with what you were accused of and tried for in court .
The polygraph that I " failed " was utilized against me by the school system in a hearing to determine if they were going to fire me from my teaching position , and I was .
I have lost almost everything in my life : my career , my home , and my reputation .
I have tried to move on , but even finding a decent job has been an impossible task .
I am very grateful that I do have my freedom , am able to see my children , and am not labeled a felon or sexual offender because the legal system was right in my case , and the 12 people who served on my jury were able to hear all of the evidence and come to the conclusion that I was not guilty .
I hope that my story will be read and that through my experience , people will know that a person should never ever agree to take a polygraph .
Maybe someday history will teach us that all that what was really being tested using the polygraph was how deceptive the legal system can be toward the innocent .

Mr Musharraf insisted January general elections would go ahead
President Musharraf
He was addressing the nation after leaving the army and being sworn in for a new term as a civilian head of state .
He urged all parties to take part in January 's elections .
One rival , Benazir Bhutto , said she would , but Nawaz Sharif said he would boycott the vote .
On Wednesday , President Musharraf stepped down as army chief amid heavy domestic and international pressure .
Observers say there will be more stiff challenges to his rule in the weeks ahead .
Ms Bhutto said her opposition Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) would take part in the 8 January general elections to try to keep them free and fair .
" The dice is stacked against the opposition , but we feel that if we boycott , then the regime wo n't need to rig , and the world will turn around and say the election was fair , " she told the BBC shortly after the presidential address .
" So it 's important for us to mobilise the support we have , and fight in the field , and ... if we do that , they will be forced to rig to stop the PPP , or they will be forced to take the measures necessary to make the elections more credible , " Ms Bhutto said .
But Mr Sharif said he and his allies would take no part in the polls unless judges sacked under emergency rule were reinstated , which correspondents say is unlikely to happen .
" We will try to convince other political parties so that this boycott is effective , " he told reporters in Lahore .
Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto are now expected to hold talks to decide what to do next .
The two former prime ministers have already filed papers to contest the elections .
They can formally withdraw their nominations by 15 December at the latest .
' Conspiracy '
For Thursday 's ceremony and TV address , Pervez Musharraf wore a black traditional suit ( sherwani ) instead of a military uniform .

Send us your comments
He was elected to a second term as president by the country 's parliament and provincial assemblies in October .
The legitimacy of the vote has been hotly contested .
Mr Musharraf told the nation he had declared emergency rule on 3 November because " the very existence of our nation was in danger " .
" I was elected with 57 % votes and there was a conspiracy to abort that , " he said , in an apparent reference to the Supreme Court which was hearing legal challenges to his re-election .
One of President Musharraf 's first moves under emergency rule was to sack the judges .
A reshaped court later dismissed all the legal challenges he had faced .
Mr Musharraf also said on Thursday that there had been an " explosion of terrorism " , which emergency rule had helped deal with .
" I think now things have improved , the administration is now on the right track and terrorism has been brought under control , " he said .
" Now , I 'm fully determined that the emergency will be lifted on 16 December . "
' Reconciliation '
Earlier in the day , Mr Musharraf , who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , took the oath for a second term as president , this time as a civilian head of state .

Afterwards , he welcomed the return of Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif to Pakistan , saying it would be " good for the political reconciliation " .
Mr Musharraf also insisted that the general elections would be held on schedule " come hell or high water " .
He promised the polls would be free and fair and open for monitoring by international observers .
As he was being sworn in , about 200 lawyers opposed to his rule clashed violently with police in Lahore .
A day earlier , Mr Musharraf had quit as army chief , handing the title over to Gen Ashfaq Pervez Kayani .
Ms Bhutto welcomed that move but said her party was " not in a hurry " to accept Mr Musharraf as a civilian president .
US President George W Bush called the Pakistani leader " an absolute reliable partner " but repeated US demands that the emergency end before elections .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says the civilian investiture does not mean an end to Mr Musharraf 's difficulties .
The state of emergency has alienated much of the secular middle class , while an Islamist insurgency has also gained strength under his rule , she says .
If his opponents join forces against him , he could be in real trouble , our correspondent says .
If not , he might be able to play them off against each other .
Either way , the president will continue to struggle with the political crisis .
Here in the Milky Way , new stars are formed at a rate of roughly 4 per year ; that ’s considered pretty normal for spiral galaxy like ours .
But researchers have found a galaxy that ’s absolutely bursting with new star formation .
Instead of our leisurely 4 stars per year , this distant galaxy is generating more than 4,000 new stars a year .
The galaxy , known at GOODS 850 - 5 , is located about 12 billion light - years from Earth .
This means that astronomers are seeing the light coming from it at a point when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old .
All of the star formation in this galaxy was obscured by thick layers of dust , emitted by all the stellar nurseries .
This means they ’re hidden by visible - light telescopes .
By using the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ’s Submillimeter Array ( SMA ) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii , the researchers were able to peer right through the obscuring dust to calculate the rate of star formation .
The irony is that the dust from all that star formation was obscuring the , uh , star formation .
Here ’s Wei-Hao Wang , one of the astronomers who worked on the research :
“ This evidence for prolific star formation is hidden by the dust from visible - light telescopes , ” Wang explained .
The dust , in turn , was formed from heavy elements that had to be built up in the cores of earlier stars .
This indicates , Wang said , that significant numbers of stars already had formed , then spewed those heavy elements into interstellar space through supernova explosions and stellar winds .
This discovery has come as a bit of a surprise , since astronomers used to think that the most actively star forming galaxies would be smaller and less obscured .
Now they ’re starting to realize that it ’s actually the big dusty galaxies that form the most stars .
We just could n’t see it .
For a galaxy to be experiencing this much star formation , it must have gone through many rounds of mergers with other galaxies .
And this is also surprising , considering it ’s only 1.5 billion years old in the image .

The Rampant Coyote asks :
What makes a ( computer ) RPG great ?
This is a favorite subject of mine .
I started to write a response last night , and it quickly turned into a long , rambling post that was all over the place .
I ’ve never been particularly into the whole brevity thing , but this post was quickly becoming an egregious wall of text so I had to abandon it .
I was trying to talk about character development , gameplay mechanics , presentation , immersion , and about a dozen other factors all at once .
I do n’t even know if I can give a sensible answer in a single post .
Looking back , I think the big problem is that the term “ RPG ” is so hopelessly broad that it means almost nothing .
Diablo , Jade Empire , Nethack , and Oblivion are all RPGs .
How is Jade Empire an RPG but not Bully or GTA : San Andreas ?
How can Diablo be an RPG , when you do n’t actually do any roleplaying ?
More importantly , how does one talk about what makes these games great , since they do n’t really have anything meaningful in common ?
It might be easier to come at this from the other direction and list the ways you can hinder or ruin an RPG .
I ’m going to go back to the drawing board with that abandoned post , but in the meantime I ’ll just sort of throw this out there for the less obsessive types to tackle :
What makes “ an RPG ” great ?
LATER : Do n’t miss this excellent response over at Augury .

This project will help you change a cheap wireless router into a wireless receiver for your Xbox 360 .
The total cost of this project can be as low as twenty or thirty dollars , compared to the one hundred dollars Microsoft wants for their little wireless dongle .
Also , please note that if you are NOT a technical person , you are better off getting Microsoft ’s official wireless adapter .
The cheapest place where you can get it is at Amazon.com .
* This tutorial assumes you already have a wireless router to send out wireless access to the Xbox 360 .
Parts Needed :
Xbox 360 , any version
Three Feet or more of Cat 5e Cable ( Ethernet Cable )
Wireless Router
DD - WRT firmware
With the Nintendo Wii and the PlayStation 3 having built in wireless access , it has always been shameful to tell others I know that the old version of the Xbox 360 does n’t have the same feature .
If the inexpensive Nintendo Wii can have it built in , why ca n’t the Xbox 360 ?
Well with a change of the firmware on a vast variety of wireless routers , we can enable a feature that much more expensive wireless routers have by default : becoming a wireless receiver .
Before we begin , an explanation of the DD - WRT firmware is needed .
From the DD - WRT Wiki :
DD - WRT is a third party developed firmware released under the terms of the GPL for many 802.11g wireless routers based on a Broadcom chip reference design .
In the most basic of terms , DD - WRT replaces the router ’s administration software , and allows access to a variety of different advanced features .
Purchasing the Proper Wireless Router
So first we will need to acquire a wireless router that allows use of this software .
You can pick one up from eBay for around twenty or thirty dollars .
Even better , you can purchase routers that already have the DD - WRT firmware installed , so if you are not into going the more advanced route , it is all set for you .
These routers sometimes cost a little more as they sometimes come with a 1GB SD memory card inside , allowing you to use the router almost like a mini-server .
That is overkill for what we need , but if you check out the router compatibility list for DD - WRT , you can surely find a router that will suit your needs .
Please note that the WRT54G , which is one of the cheapest and most famous linksys router around , works perfectly for this and can usually be found on Amazon.com for around $ 45 ( or even less in the “ used products ” section ) .
I suggest purchasing a router of the same brand you are already using to send out your Internet signal , but if that is n’t possible , you might come across issues in getting the two wireless routers to talk to each other later on .
I have used a variety of different brands and have yet to have any issues .
Installing DD -WRT
Once you have the router , we can begin the next step .
Download DD - WRT from their website .
Make sure you are using the right version for your wireless router , as stated in the DD - WRT version required list on the supported devices page .
The next step can look incredibly complicated and confusing , but if you spend a little bit of time reading the DD - WRT wiki , they have organized the information rather well .
A word of warning though .
If you have never updated the firmware on a device before , you may not want to proceed with this project .
Incorrect flashing procedure can cause your newly purchased router to no longer function .
I wo n’t go over all the installation instructions here , as it can be quite different depending on which router you have purchased .
Check out the installation instructions on the DD - WRT wiki .
They also give you tips on what you can do if the installation goes wrong .
Thankfully , the installation is usually quite easy , as most wireless routers have a system built in for upgrading the firmware , and this system can be used to install DD - WRT .
Setting the Router as a Receiver
Using your Ethernet cable , connect your computer to the router that is using the DD - WRT software .
Browse to 192.168.1.1 using a web browser .
It will ask for a user name and password .
The user name will be root and the password will be admin .
If you are using an older version of the DD - WRT software , you may not need to enter a user name .
Once you are in the DD - WRT administration panel , you will be able to change settings .
What we need to do is change the router into what is known as client mode wireless .
This will allow the router to receive Internet signal from whatever other wireless router you are using and share it out through the Ethernet ports on the back .
Again , this can be quite a lengthy list of instructions , and is totally dependent on your current network configuration , but the DD - WRT wiki to the rescue again , with a great list of tips , tricks , and numbered instructions on how to get it all to work .
The basic idea though is to get the DD - WRT router to get an IP address from your other wireless router connected to the Internet and then bridge that connection over to the devices we want to connect to the Internet .
Once you have gone through all the steps , your computer should be able to get Internet from the DD - WRT router .
If you have not been able to get Internet access , DD - WRT has a great forum filled with knowledgeable people that are willing to help you out .
Connecting to the Xbox 360
If you have access to the Internet on your computer , then it is time to plug the connection into your Xbox 360 .
Move the DD - WRT router next to your Xbox 360 , connect the Ethernet cable from the router to your Xbox 360 ’s Ethernet port .
Turn on your Xbox 360 , and it should receive a connection .
If you have made it to this stage then pat yourself on the back .
You now have hopefully saved yourself enough to buy a few games from the Xbox 360 Marketplace , and have the ability to connect to the service and download them .
This same trick can be used to enable other devices to have a wireless connection , including a second computer somewhere in the house that you ca n’t easily put a wire to .
I know this post will require a fair bit of reading on your part , but once it is complete , it is a great feeling .
I spent less than forty dollars on the project , a savings of around sixty dollars plus tax , which I was then able to put into getting Zuma and a few other games for myself and the wife .
But as we said before , if tinkering and modding is n’t your thing , Microsoft ’s official wireless adapter can now be had for pretty cheap on Amazon.com .

This week , delegations from 50 countries descended on the historic waterfront town of Annapolis , Maryland , for the belated resumption of U.S. - led Middle East peace talks .
The conference was touted as a landmark occasion — the beginning of the end of the Israel - Palestine conflict .
But for at least two parties , it was n’t the feel - good event of the year .
Both Iran and the Office of the Vice President were most likely left feeling isolated .
Iran , not present for the talks , must have felt stung that among those assembled at the U.S. Naval Academy was Syria .
Tehran ’s erstwhile ally in supporting Hezbollah and Hamas joined a broad alliance of countries — including Israel and a host of Sunni Arab nations — that Washington has been trying to cobble together to constrain the Iranian regime .
Cheney ’s office was no doubt displeased , since the peace talks are just the latest signal that in the twilight months of the Bush administration , national security policy now increasingly seems in the more pragmatic grip of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Speaking for hardliners opposed to the prospect of Israeli - Palestinian negotiations , Frank Gaffney Jr. , president of the hawkish Center for Security Policy , wrote in the Washington Times that “ despite official efforts to lowball its significance , Miss Rice ’s conclave is shaping up to be a gang - rape of a nation on a scale not seen since Munich in 1938 .
This time , the intended victim is Israel .
As with the effort to appease the Nazis and Fascists nearly 70 years ago , however , the damage will not be confined to the rapee .
The interests of the Free World in general and the United States in particular will suffer from what the Saudis and most of the other attendees have in mind for the Jewish State — namely , its dismemberment and ultimate destruction . ”
At a luncheon hosted by the Israel Project the week before the Annapolis conference kicked off , David Wurmser , until recently a senior Middle East advisor to Cheney , complained that “ the secretary of state is wearing a hole out [ of the atmosphere ] traveling to Israel and to the neighbors to promote the Arab - Israeli peace track .
And yet you do n’t see signs of such frequent travel by an American official [ at that level ] to Beijing , Japan , and Seoul to deal with [ the ] North Korea [ threat ] , or to Baghdad to ensure that goes right , and so we can confront Iran there , and regionally . ”
Focusing on the Israel - Palestine issue at this point fuels “ an inattentiveness to the major issues , ” Wurmser continued , identifying current national security challenges that are “ reaching the near acute stage ” as North Korea , Iran , Syria , and Venezuela .
But Wurmser , Gaffney , and other hawks are increasingly isolated , even among some of the activists opposed to the Iranian regime .
“ Annapolis is very important , ” says Shahriar Ahy , an Iranian - born political analyst who has worked as an advisor to the Iranian Shah ’s son , Reza Pahlavi .
“ It isolated Iran with an anti-Iran front .
It brought [ in ]
Syria and demonstrates the reality that the Saudis think that the obstacle to Middle East peace , rather than Israel , is Iran . ”
“ I think it was great , ” says former Shah - era Iranian education minister Manouchehr Ganji , now a Washington , D.C. - based human rights activist , “ to get Syria to attend the conference , to have the Syrian deputy foreign minister come and try to bring Syria into peace accords and isolate Iran . ”
Days before the conference , foreign affairs reporter Aluf Benn wrote in the Israeli daily Ha’aretz that “ in return for strengthening the pro-American axis in the Middle East , Israel is being asked to declare its willingness to withdraw from the territories and back up its words with some steps on the ground .
That is a worthwhile and even cheap price for international support . ”
Though the conference was larger on symbol than on substance , it showed that the Middle East conflict occurs on shifting sands .
Saudi ambassador Adel Al - Jubeir was asked why his country ’s foreign minister had indicated the day before that he would not shake hands with Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert , or recognize the Jewish state .
“ This is a serious effort ; we are not here for theatrics , ” he replied , according to the Associated Press .
“ The time for handshakes will come when there is a peace agreement . ”
The official - speak was for show , an Israeli journalist indicated to me , noting press reports that longtime former Saudi ambassador to Washington Prince Bandar and Olmert had held secret meetings in Jordan .
The journalist intertwined two fingers to illustrate how close the Israel - Saudi alliance is on issues such as Lebanon .
But earlier in the week Wurmser disputed whether Iran would really be more frightened of a broad international front , such as the one assembled in Annapolis , than of signs that the United States was prepared to act unilaterally .
“ Does Iran care about isolation ? ” he asked .
“ I think Iran cares more about American unilateralism .
It takes comfort in multilateralism . ”
Of course , Annapolis was only indirectly about Iran .
Its primary purpose was to serve as the kick - off of a process to pursue a two - state solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict .
Annapolis is the “ launching pad for serious efforts between the two to negotiate the establishment of a Palestinian state , ” says a State Department official .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice later added , “ The Palestinian people have waited a long time for the dignity that will come with an independent state .
The Israeli people have waited a long time for a peaceful neighbor that can help to provide real security . ”
Those who have argued that Washington should reengage in the peace process said the conference was too little too late .
Former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy noted recently in the Guardian that “ the Bush administration continues to view the Israeli - Palestinian conflict through the lens of a global war on terrorism and as part of the momentous struggle of good against evil .
The great irony of the Annapolis conference is that the framing narrative of its convener is the one thing that most undermines its chances of success .
The Israeli -Palestinian conflict is grievance - driven and its resolution is all about ending the occupation .
Israel needs and deserves security and peace but those things do n’t coexist cozily with occupation . ”
For the Bush White House , was Annapolis about the Israelis and the Palestinians — or other foreign policy or political goals ?
“ At the core , this administration understands it will be judged by success or failure in Iraq , ” says Wurmser .
“ Bush does what he thinks he should do . ”
Rulings seal high court 's shift to right

As ideological shifts go , the U.S. Supreme Court 's rightward tilt during the just - completed 2006 - 07 term was not a large swing .
But it was decisive .
The replacement of moderately conservative Justice Sandra Day O'Connor by staunchly conservative Justice Samuel Alito did not send legal precedents toppling .
Roe vs. Wade , which legalized abortion , remains in place , and so do recent liberal victories on gay rights , presidential power , the death penalty and the environment .
A 2003 ruling allowing limited consideration of race in public college admissions was battered but survived .
But this was the term in which Chief Justice John Roberts , with crucial support from Alito , a fellow appointee of President Bush , took firm control of the court , its agenda and , with few exceptions , its legal doctrines .
Thursday 's ruling that severely restricted race - conscious school integration programs was the last in a series of bare - majority decisions that steered the law in a conservative direction .
The most important abortion ruling in more than a decade upheld a federal ban on a rare midterm procedure and opened the door to further restrictions .
A campaign finance ruling gutted congressional limits on broadcast ads funded by corporations and unions in the final weeks before an election , a law the court had upheld in 2003 .
The justices narrowed free speech by students , barred taxpayer suits against Bush 's promotion of federal funding for religious groups , tightened restrictions on punitive damages , and prohibited suits over sex and race discrimination in pay if they were filed more than 180 days after the wage disparity began .
In each case , the majority consisted of Roberts , Alito and Justices Anthony Kennedy , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
In most of the cases , O'Connor 's record suggested she would have voted differently than Alito , changing the result .
There was one significant liberal victory , a 5 - 4 decision authorizing the government to regulate vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming .
Its effect has been muted by Bush 's continued opposition to mandatory controls , and by federal regulators ' slow pace in reviewing California 's request to enforce its own emissions law .
" This was the year the conservatives finally got their court , " said Erwin Chemerinsky , a liberal Duke University law professor .
" Roberts and Alito have been everything conservatives could have hoped for and everything liberals could have feared . "
Pepperdine University law Professor Douglas Kmiec agreed that he and fellow conservatives have been looking for a court like the current one .
The justices have " delivered to ( Roberts ) a working majority that has largely allowed his perspectives on the law to prevail , " said Kmiec , who served with Roberts in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan .
Those perspectives , he said , include strict enforcement of rules limiting lawsuits and appeals , and a " reduced role of the court in the political life of the nation , " with correspondingly greater leeway for the president and Congress .
The court 's unbending view of legal rules was illustrated by the pay discrimination case -- precluding suits by numerous women who learn they 're being paid less than men long after the 180 - day deadline has expired -- and by the case of Keith Bowles , a convicted murderer from Ohio who appealed his conviction in federal court .
After losing an initial ruling , his lawyer was told by the judge that he had 17 days to appeal .
He filed a day early , only to learn that the deadline under federal law was actually 14 days .
A 5 - 4 ruling , written by Thomas , declared that federal courts had no power to review Bowles ' appeal , prompting Justice David Souter to denounce the majority for " condoning this bait - and - switch . "
Stanford law Professor Pamela Karlan offered a curt summary of the term Thursday at a Supreme Court panel discussion sponsored by the liberal American Constitution Society : " If this is the birth of a new constitutional era , all I can say is , what an ugly baby . "
It is an era in which Kennedy is playing a pivotal role .
The Sacramento native , the most moderate member of the conservative bloc , has taken over the role of the court 's " swing " voter , formerly held by O'Connor .
He played it to perfection in the past term :
Of 24 cases decided by a single vote , one - third of the court 's docket , Kennedy was in the majority every time .
But his record was more conservative than in other recent terms , when he voted with the moderate - to - liberal bloc in rulings on gay rights , the rights of foreign captives , the death penalty and water pollution .
Apart from the global warming case , in which he joined a majority for federal regulation , he sided with Roberts and Alito in each major decision .
He was also the author of the 5 - 4 ruling April 18 that upheld the first federal ban on a specific abortion procedure , in which the fetus is partially removed intact .
Some of Kennedy 's language -- references to Congress ' " ethical and moral concerns , " terminology such as " baby " and " infant life , " and his assertion that the ban would discourage some women from having abortions that they might later regret -- was unprecedented and seemed to invite more measures to regulate or deter abortion .
" Kennedy has n't been the swing justice this term , " Chemerinsky said .
" He has n't swung back and forth .
He 's swung to one side . "
Kmiec credited Roberts , who has said he wants the court to speak with greater consensus , with persuading Kennedy to join others ' opinions and create well - defined majorities rather than writing separately , as he sometimes did in the past .
Kennedy 's separate opinion in Thursday 's integration case , declaring his own standard for considering race in admissions while leaving four justices on either side of him , was the only time this term that he distanced himself from a majority bloc .
The result , Kmiec said , has been greater clarity .
But another practice this term has arguably made rulings murkier -- Roberts ' treatment of past decisions with which he disagrees .
Rather than overturning precedents , he narrows or reinterprets them , leaving them watered down but still on the books .
In Monday 's campaign advertising case , for example , Roberts left in place the 2003 ruling upholding a ban on corporate - funded ads aimed at candidates just before an election , but construed it to apply only in rare cases .
On the same day , he reinterpreted a 1969 ruling on students ' free speech to exclude statements that might promote drug use .
Alito , in another ruling that day that Roberts joined , said a 1968 precedent allowing taxpayers to challenge federal funding of religion applied only to congressional and not presidential funding .
Scalia , who frequently advocates discarding precedents that he regards as wrong - headed , wrote an opinion in the political ad case accusing Roberts of " faux judicial restraint . "
San Francisco attorney Vincent Chhabria , a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer , said the court is muddying the waters .
" Decisions that appear to contradict earlier decisions without overruling them only create more confusion , " Chhabria said .
When the justices return to work in October , the most prominent cases will be the two they accepted for review on Friday , appeals by two foreign captives at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , challenging their indefinite confinement .
The court has rebuffed Bush twice before on similar issues , most recently a year ago , when it ruled that military tribunals established for war - crimes trials at Guantanamo violated federal law and an international treaty .
Congress then authorized the tribunals and limited the rights of prisoners classified by military panels as enemy combatants to get courts to review their status .
Those cases could be joined by a Bush administration appeal of a recent appellate court decision prohibiting the government from holding U.S. civilians as enemy combatants , and by two cases now in federal appeals courts challenging the administration 's wiretapping of terror suspects without prior judicial approval .
Another case already on the docket will test judges ' authority to reduce the differences in federal sentences for crack and powder cocaine .
With presidential authority shaping up as a major issue in the 2007 - 08 term , it 's possible the Bush administration wo n't fare as well as it did this term .
But the records of Roberts and Alito lead most commentators to agree that the court will be an important part of Bush 's legacy , even if he makes no more appointments .
Cass Sunstein , a University of Chicago law professor and Supreme Court scholar , cited conservatives ' dismay at the unexpectedly liberal leanings of Souter and moderate views of O'Connor after their appointments by Republican presidents .
" It seems fair to say , " Sunstein said , " that President Bush would not feel the ( same ) kind of disappointment . "
Court 's major rulings
Major rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2006 - 07 term :
Integration : Overturned school integration plans in Seattle and Louisville , Ky. , that used students ' race as a factor in enrollment .
Said integration remains a legitimate goal of school districts but the race of individual students can be considered only in extraordinary circumstances .
Abortion : Upheld the Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 , which prohibited procedures in which the fetus is removed from the womb partially intact before being aborted .
Campaigns : Declared unconstitutional a portion of a 2002 campaign finance law that banned radio and television ads by corporations or unions that mentioned a candidate 's name in the final weeks before a federal election .
The court said the ban was valid only for ads that expressly advocated election or defeat of a candidate , and not for ads that discussed the candidate 's position on an issue .
Emissions : Ruled that the federal government has authority over vehicle emissions that contribute to global warming , and must regulate them unless it has scientific evidence showing regulation is not justified .
Discrimination : Barred suits for pay discrimination based on sex or race unless the plaintiff discovered the disparity and sued within 180 days .
Students : Ruled that public school students could be punished for speech that a school administrator could reasonably interpret as promoting illegal drug use .

Acting on the advice of the License Approval Chair , the OSI Board today approved the Microsoft Public License ( Ms- PL ) and the Microsoft Reciprocal License ( Ms- RL ) .
The decision to approve was informed by the overwhelming ( though not unanimous ) consensus from the open source community that these licenses satisfied the 10 criteria of the Open Source definition , and should therefore be approved .
The formal evaluation of these licenses began in August and the discussion of these licenses was vigourous and thorough .
The community raised questions that Microsoft ( and others ) answered ; they raised issues that , when germane to the licenses in question , Microsoft addressed .
Microsoft came to the OSI and submitted their licenses according to the published policies and procedures that dozens of other parties have followed over the years .
Microsoft did n't ask for special treatment , and did n't receive any .
In spite of recent negative interactions between Microsoft and the open source community , the spirit of the dialog was constructive and we hope that carries forward to a constructive outcome as well .
The Open Source Initiative is best known as the steward of the Open Source Definition and for its license review process .
But , an open source license is just the starting point .
Open source depends upon code ( which can be made better ) , community ( which can be made larger ) , and ultimately a commitment to the idea that the more free the market is for innovation , the more innovation the market can deliver .
Every approval that OSI issues represents our community 's demand for more open - source code , a larger and more vital open - source community , and all the benefits open source brings to innovation in a free market .
The new Ms - PL and Ms - RL are no exceptions .
I just returned home from the anti-Islamization demonstration in Brussels .
The Belgian police beat up the peaceful demonstrators in what even the Belgian public television call " an extremely violent fashion . "
Here are some video images .
The grey - haired man whom we see being attacked by the police first is Luk Van Nieuwenhuysen , the Vice - President of the Flemish Parliament .
Shortly afterwards we see the police maltreating Frank Vanhecke , a member of the European Parliament and the party leader of the Vlaams Belang .
We see how he is handcuffed and pushed into a police bus .
Afterwards we also see the police " taking care " of Filip Dewinter , the VB group leader in the Flemish Parliament .
We see how his arm gets caught between the closing doors of the bus .
An Italian MEP and a French MEP were also arrested .
The demonstrators were kept in cells for seven hours and released this evening .
One of our readers who wants to stay anonymous sent us this personal impression of the SIOE demonstration :
A Day in Brussels , A Fifty Yard View
Around 10:45 , driving around the Luxembourg and Berlaymont areas in Brussels it became obvious the demonstration was en route to become “ a whole lot ado ‘ bout nothin ’ ” .
It ’s hard to say whether there were 12 or 15 dozen demonstrators near the Europarliament Buildings , come noon , how many there were at the Luxemburg plaza or in between , I ca n’t say , but what was abundantly clear , was that these particular Brussels areas were under siege .
However much the Belgian media portray the SIOE demo as an anti-islam ralley , I wanted to be there because I ’ve started reading the Koran about three years ago .
I challenge any or other rational opponent of the demonstration to do the same and not be concerned .
I happened to be in Brussels , since it matters to me personally , apart from the fact that 9/11 left a profound impression , and to this day still does , that is ...
I wanted to see for myself how the authorities would react .
Seeing is believing .
As soon as I saw the might of the police and recognised the efforts the authorities had taken throughout the neighbouring communes , it was pretty clear most of those unorganised individuals who would have wanted to attend simply decided to do a 180 and got the hell out of Dodge .
Police outnumbered demonstrators by some 300 % ( guesswork ) .
Impressive it was , and although throughout the surrounding area police forces kept to themselves , acting as inconspicuous as pink elephants near the north - pole , the cordon policiaire that had been thrown in front of the demonstrators , ( keeping to the stairs of the roundabout opposite the Berlaymont - building ) , the flashing policecars , the horses , the dogs , and the riot - police stood their ground ; in the side - streets numerous riot - cars went to all lengths to be overtly and utterly visible .
Police in combat gear stood within shouting distance .
No crowds in their tens of thousands , not all too many banners or cards , some flags here and there , and most of the time the demonstrators were hidden behind the press - camera ’s clicking away at God knows what .
They did n’t wear combat boots , they did n’t carry any sticks , there were no baseball - bats , they did n’t wear face - masks , and they did n’t rip open the pavement , no window - panes shattered , no refuse - cans were lit , the café was open and sold cofffee and sandwiches , business as usual .
The demonstrators probably just voiced grievances , although I can’t tell since I did n’t hear any of it .
They may not have shaven their heads , they did n’t wear orange , or off - white sarongs , they did n’t fold their hands in front of them , and they did n’t seek any of their heads to forcefully meet with truncheons , yet …
Yet yes , the demo had been banned , and yes there ’s probably laws against unlawfull manifestations , and yes , all those in the midst probably knew what to expect , if push came to shove .
However , … For some or other reason police made a dash towards selected demonstrators and singled out those , who for all intents and purposes did n’t in any way seem ‘ aggressive ’ from my 50 yard away - off - to - the - side view .
All those that were brutally manhandled suffered the hyper - adrenaline anger of some eager roughshot - riding police , and although they put up with the assault , they did n’t as such retaliate .
Although they did not quite “ resist ” the person in authority , one was hard put to tell whether the struggles that ensued , were not caused by the ‘ brute way ’ in which they were thrown to the ground , or it jus may be they simply wanted to prevent their three - piece suits from being torn .
And when they voiced their disagreement with the way they were manacled , they protested the fact that they were manhandled .
Some protesters even involuntarily ran in to 2 - foot truncheons , that happened to be in the way .
It need n’t have come to that .
There was simply no momentum .
This was unnecessary .
An overreaction to an out of control fenomenon .
If the police had n’t acted as they have , … they would have come out tops .
As is the case , and under orders , they ’re the losers , … Brussels lost face .
If one is treated the way these politicians today have been treated for peacefully protesting against a ban on being allowed to peacefully demonstrate , then there ’s something wrong .
Acutely and perversely wrong .
For , for example the United States as constitutional democracy , specifically allows for peaceful demonstrations to address social and / or political grievances and specifically allows the freedom of assembly to express these grievances .
In the ‘ New - Europe ’ Capital it is now abundantly clear one has no such rights .
Standing to the side and keeping an ear to the comments numerous french and english onlookers voiced , I happened to overhear a conversation between a tanned , rather curly haired , charismatic young woman and her friends .
Obviously foreign , probable Euro- civil servants .
( paraphrasing ) “ I might not agree to what they do and say , but this is no way to threat people , this is a disgrace ” .
This about wraps it all up as far as bystanders go .
Just another day in Brussels , … one to remember .
The demo as such was but a ripple in a pond , strategically however it could n’t have made a more significant point , mainly because of the way neutral bystanders next to me , reacted to the use of force only to become concerned , which is , above all , … no longer neutral or no longer unconcerned … at least .
I heard but one comment , but through the windows of the adjacent glass - sided buildings a European audience silently stood , … looking , looking .
A day in Brussels , … a fifty yard view
Turkey has begun preparations for a cross - border operation
Military build up
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said he was prepared to conduct " urgent talks " to defuse the crisis and said a diplomatic solution had to be found .
Iraq signed a counter - terrorism pact with Turkey last month , but opposes any military incursion into its territory .
The US has also warned Ankara against ordering any incursions into Iraq .
" We all have an interest in a stable Iraq and a desire to see the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) brought to justice , " White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" But we urge the Turks to continue their discussions with us and the Iraqis and to show restraint from any potentially destabilising actions . "
' Internal affairs '
Soon after the Turkish cabinet agreed to submit a motion to parliament seeking authorisation for military action , an Iraqi government spokesman called on Ankara to be " wise and patient " and not to enter Iraqi territory .
The Iraqi government calls on the Turkish government to pursue a diplomatic solution and not a military solution

Iraqi government spokesman
Profile : PKK rebel group
" The Iraqi government calls on the Turkish government to pursue a diplomatic solution and not a military solution to solve the [ problem ] of terrorist attacks which our dear neighbour Turkey has witnessed from the PKK , " Ali al - Dabbagh said .
Earlier , Mr Maliki said he was prepared to conduct urgent talks with the Turkish government to " discuss and solve all outstanding problems and give guarantees that will govern relations between the two neighbouring nations " .
" We are fully confident that our friends in the Turkish government are committed , just as it is our wish , to bolstering and developing our bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect , non-intervention in the other 's internal affairs and not allowing the harmful use of each other 's territory , " he said in a statement .
Ankara claims the PKK is a terrorist group that enjoys free movement in northern Iraq and blames it for the deaths of at least 15 Turkish soldiers in the past two weeks .
Cross - border raids
Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said the Turkish government hoped it would not be forced to resort to military action , even if its motion gained approval in parliament .
The PKK wants more autonomy in south - eastern Turkey
" We hope that there will be no reason to use the authorisation , we hope there will be no need for that , " he said at a news conference .
Mr Cecik said that if approved , the measures would be valid for a year and would allow multiple cross - border operations .
He also stressed that Turkey would only target the PKK and had no intention of occupying Iraqi territory .
" We have always respected the sovereignty of Iraq , which is a friendly and brotherly country , " he added .
The government plans to put the motion to a vote on Wednesday and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's AK Party , which has a majority , is expected to vote in favour .
A new US intelligence report sheds significant light on the Bush administration ’s duplicity regarding Iran ’s alleged nuclear threat .
Iran Halted Nuclear Bomb Program in 2003 , U.S. Spy Agencies Say
By Jeff Bliss and Ken Fireman Dec. 3 ( Bloomberg ) —
Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and probably had n’t restarted it as of mid-2007 , according to a new report from the U.S. intelligence community .
The Iranians halted the program “ primarily in response to international pressure , ” and this decision “ suggests Iran may be more vulnerable to influence on the issue than we judged previously , ” the intelligence agencies said .
If Iran were to restart its program , it probably could n’t enrich enough uranium for a nuclear weapon until late 2009 , and even then is “ very unlikely ” to produce a bomb until the next decade , according to the National Intelligence Estimate , which is the consensus view of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies .
( Story . )
Here are the important things to remember as this story begins unfolding .
1 : Bush has known about this report , one assumes , for the last four years .
2 : Despite this knowledge , he set his noise machine about the task of justifying yet another run-up to yet another unjustified war based on still more falsified information .
In the case of Iraq the Bushies have fought hard to convince us that they could n’t have known all that evidenced was fudged – no , I ’m not buying a word of it either – but here we seem to have caught the White House with its proverbial pants down .
That ’s not a pleasant image , I know , but right now we need some ugly pictures burned into our collective retinas .
3 : Bush could have claimed victory , pointing to these developments as proof that his “ doctrine ” in the Middle East was driving positive results .
But he did n’t .
He chose to bury the truth so he could clamor for more unwinnable war .
This tells us a lot about George Bush ’s real goals .
If he wanted what he ’s said he wanted ( and remember , prior to our invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein pretty much did everything he could possibly have done to prove he had no WMDs ) then the findings of this report would have sufficed .
What do we conclude from what he actually did , though ?
Right .
The real goal is war in the Middle East .
I ’ll leave you to speculate about what that means ultimately and whose interests are served .
One more thing , as an aside .
Check what the AP did with this story :
US : Iran Still Able to Develop Nukes
By PAMELA HESS | Associated Press Writer
1:43 PM EST , December 3 , 2007 WASHINGTON – Iran halted its nuclear weapons development program in the fall of 2003 under international pressure but is continuing to enrich uranium , which means it may still be able to develop a weapon between 2010 and 2015 , senior intelligence officials said Monday .
That headline tells us that either the AP is hiring monkeys ( and not the smart ones , either ) or they ’ve handed over editorial responsibilities to Karl Rove ’s towel boys .
Frankly , I ’m about as disgusted with the AP as I am the White House …
In 2007 , people began to circulate rumors that the Google corporation would introduce a smartphone to compete with Apple 's iPhone .
Speculation ran rampant -- would Google get into the hardware business ?
Would the company rely on established cell phone manufacturers for hardware ?
Would Google simply concentrate on building smartphone applications for other devices like the iPhone ?
Google executives claimed that the company was n't interested in building hardware .
But some Web journalists and bloggers remained unconvinced .
By early 2008 , it became clear that the Google executives had been straightforward all along -- Google was n't getting into the handset hardware game .
But they were getting into the handset software business with a mobile operating system ( OS ) called Android .

Unlike the Apple iPhone , which has its own OS exclusive to the iPhone 's hardware , Google 's approach was to create an OS that could work on phones built by different manufacturers .
Additionally , no single service provider would have exclusive rights to use the Android platform .
In that respect , Android joins other mobile device operating systems like Symbian and Windows Mobile .
The first Google phone was the G1 , a handset manufactured by a company based in Taiwan called the High Tech Computer Corporation ( HTC ) .
The first service provider to support Android in the United States was T - Mobile .
As the OS debuted in the United States , other handset manufacturers announced plans to develop their own Android phones .
In January 2010 , Google unveiled the Nexus One .
This Android phone was the first handset you could purchase directly from Google .
Like the G1 , HTC provided the hardware for the Nexus One .
Customers could choose to buy the phone for $ 179 if they signed up with T - Mobile for a two - year contract or $ 529 for an unsubsidized phone without a contract .
An important factor that sets Android apart from most other mobile operating systems is that it 's based on an open source platform .
That means Google allows anyone to look at and modify most of Android 's source code .
Ideally , this would mean that if a developer felt Android needed a specific feature or capability , he or she could build it and incorporate it into the OS .
The software would constantly evolve .
Initially , the Android platform did n't support many of the features of other smartphone operating systems .
For example , Android offered no Microsoft Exchange support upon release .
Many companies use Microsoft Exchange as a platform for e-mail and scheduling applications .
But because of the open source nature of Android and Google 's support for third - party developers , it did n't take long before a company offered an application that would sync Exchange functions with the phone .
The Android platform may have to play catch up with the other operating systems on the market , but it may have the ability to go even farther .
On the next page we 'll introduce you to the Nexus One Google phone .
Crysis , the poster child for modern PC gaming and DirectX 10 , will arrive shortly .
Crytek has tortured us for years with screenshots and short hands - on experiences showing off the game 's wide - open world , with picturesque tropical battlegrounds , perfect for sipping Mai Tais or peppering random bad guys with automatic rifle fire .
Crytek released the single - player demo late last week , and we set up a few test systems to see just how the game looks under Windows Vista compared to Windows XP .
We also took some in - game benchmarks to see how the frame rates compare in DirectX 9 and DirectX 10 .
It would n't be an exaggeration to claim that the environments in Crysis come mighty close to photo - realistic .
The beaches , sky , and rocks all have a gritty , real - earth feel to them .
Crytek took plant matter to a new realm - - a botanist would have a field day in Crysis .
The palm trees , shrubbery , and grass create the feeling of tropical jungle more so than any other game we 've come across .
The game officially limits in - game settings to " high quality " in Windows XP , while Windows Vista gets an additional " very high quality " graphics setting .
Crysis still looks good at high quality , but it 's a noticeable step down from the very high quality settings .
Some ingenious users managed to enable very high quality on the Crysis demo in Windows XP through a clever bit of configuration - file editing .
The second image in each set of comparison shots demonstrate what the hacked very high quality settings look like in Windows XP .
As far as we can tell , the difference between very high quality in Windows XP and Windows Vista is quite subtle .
We noticed some extra shadowing on the rocks in the Vista version , and while there are differences between the hacked XP shots and the Vista shots , we can't really say that one looks better .
Developers have gotten very good at working around hardware limitations to fake great graphics , so we would n't be surprised if the DX9 effects were good enough to simulate the results of a more " accurate " DX10 shader .

Crysis Demo Performance
Crysis will most definitely join our stable of benchmarks for a long time to come .
The very high quality settings in Windows Vista thrashed our GeForce 8800 GTX when we tried running it at high resolutions .
Frame rate performance kept doubling once we lowered the quality settings to high , medium , and low .
The Vista version performed slightly slower than Windows XP at the same settings , but the difference was within three to five percent at the high and medium settings .
The hacked very high quality settings under Windows XP were almost 20 percent faster than the Vista frame rates , but comparing frame rates between the two is pointless because it is n't an apples - to - apples comparison .
The image differences between the two versions indicate that they do n't have an identical workload .
The demo is n't a final release of the game , and as such might not represent all the features that Crysis has to offer .

The Northern Ireland Numeraire
More on the Lancet study �
Everyone knows that the standard unit of geography is " an area the size of Wales " ( except for military purposes , where for some reason it is " an area the size of France " ) .
Back in the dim days of history when the first Lancet survey came out , Marc Mulholland wrote something which got me to thinking that perhaps a similar standard unit for civil wars ought to be " the worst year in Northern Ireland " .
By the way , I 'm conscious that we 're talking about real deaths of people who had families and loved ones here .
There is , frankly no way of writing this post which is n't as sick and tasteless as hell , so I 'm just basically going to go for it .
All I can do is beg the forgiveness of my Northern Irish readers and hope that , at least , the fact that their civil war appears to be at an end makes it a bit more bearable .
Sorry in particular to Marc , who I must emphasise does n't bear any responsibility at all for the use I 've made of his numbers .
In the worst year in Northern Ireland , 1972 , 496 people were killed in acts of violence related to the Troubles .
If we scale that up for the difference in population between Iraq and Northern Ireland ( 27m/1.5 m = 18 x ) and for the time covered by the Lancet study ( 39 months / 12 m = 3.25 x ) , then we can say that , if the situation in Iraq since the invasion had been exactly as bad as the worst year in Northern Ireland , then there would have been 29,016 deaths by violence .
Almost certainly coincidentally , this is the lowball number that George Bush gave when initially trying to rubbish the Lancet study .
It does not , to be honest , seem very credible .
The IBC count of 43k - 48 k , would correspond to the worst twelve - month period in Northern Ireland , immediately following on from the introduction of direct rule ( which would in turn correspond to the average death rate attributable to Israeli security forces in Gaza between 2000 and 2005 ) .
To me , at least , this kind of points out how low this count really is .
The figure of 65 k which has been thrown around quite a lot and appears to be rather tenuously sourced from Iraqi government data , would correspond to Iraq since the invasion being about as bad as the worst single month in Northern Ireland , July 1972 when nearly a hundred people were killed .
So basically , all these lower figures would be consistent with the country of Iraq having been , on average , about as lawless and dangerous as the really bad times in Northern Ireland .
I do n't think that this is remotely plausible .
July 1972 was a horrible time from all I can read ( I was n't born at the time ) , but even then , it seems that there was at least a semblance of normal life going on in a sense that appears to be utterly absent from Iraq .
I 'd also note that British troop numbers scaled up from 17,000 to 29,000 during that period ; to maintain the same troops / population ratio in Iraq , there would need to be just under 400,000 coalition troops in Iraq , about three times as many as there actually are .
On the other hand , the central Lancet projection would suggest that on average over the three and a quarter year period covered , in terms of violent deaths alone , Iraq has been roughly twenty times as bad as 1972 in Northern Ireland .
Specifically , it was roughly ten times as bad for the period covered by the first Lancet study and is currently 36 times as bad .
Is this credible ?
To be frank , I do n't know ; I think that these numeraires break down when you have to multiply them by too many times .
But looking at these numbers makes me very confident indeed that the low numbers are completely incredible ; they 're not describing anything like the state of civil war that Iraq appears to be in .
The bottom line here is that , as I say , the Iraq war is n't just a terrible mess , like British policy in Northern Ireland during the Troubles .
It 's a massive disaster , well on its way to becoming a disaster of world - historic proportions like Vietnam .
The big and frightening headline numbers are just the logical numeric expression of that fact ; if someone is n't proposing to argue with me on the fact that it 's a total disaster then they can think what they like about the numbers .
Update : Jamaica had 1476 murders in 2005 , out of a population of 2.7 m .
Scaled up in the same way , this gives a number almost exactly equal to the Iraq Body Count " high " estimate .
Safe European Home = Rock the Casbah ?

With the almost constant statist apologetics we hear from many government and academic economists [ 1 ] it is hard to believe that the discipline of economics was once a thorn in the side of the state and its political elite .
So commonplace are fallacious economic arguments advocating state control that it sometimes seems that refutation of all of these arguments has become a case of cutting the heads off the Hydra — a tiring and fruitless endeavor .
But if economics is to become an instrument of freedom and prosperity instead of an instrument of statism , [ 2 ] then there are certain fundamental fallacies that must be continually challenged and discredited .
Chief among these is the persistent non sequitur from externality to coercion — that is , the bogus conclusion that coercion is a proper means to solve problems involving economic externalities .
One of the most blatant examples of this non sequitur occurs in discussions of the " free rider problem " and the alleged solution of government provision of so - called " public goods . " [ 3 ]
This is a particularly insidious economic theory that bears a great deal of the responsibility of derailing economics into the ditch of statism .
The " problem " of free riding
The " free rider problem " occurs in situations in which a person derives a " positive externality " from the actions of another — that is , a benefit that he did not pay for .
This occurs in situations where the beneficial effect of an action is " nonexcludable , " meaning that the benefits cannot be withheld from people who had nothing to do with the action .
For example , a beekeeper may keep bees solely as a means of producing honey .
However , an ancillary effect of this activity — an externality — is that the bees will pollinate flowers in surrounding properties , benefiting the owners of those properties at no cost to them . [ 4 ]
Nor is there any practical means by which the beekeeper can produce his honey without conferring this benefit on his neighbors .
Thus , the " good " provided to surrounding property owners is nonexcludable .
Observe that this situation involves no detriment to anyone , let alone any violation of rights .
The beekeeper chooses to buy the bees because he expects to be better off by virtue of this action .
Moreover , as an unintended consequence of his purchase , surrounding property owners also find themselves enjoying a benefit from the bees , at no cost to them .
This may seem like a fortuitous event — even something to be celebrated .
And yet , there is a " problem " — or , to be more precise , a free rider " problem . "
The problem is not that anyone has aggressed against anyone else .
It is not that anyone 's rights have been violated .
It is not even that anyone has suffered any detriment at all .
Rather , it is a " problem " only when compared to what might have been done instead — a problem of allegedly inefficient underproduction of the good in question .
In other words , the problem is that , if not for the nonexcludability of the good , things could potentially have been even better .
To illustrate how things might have been better , consider again our beekeeper and his neighbors .
If the beekeeper possessed some means to prevent surrounding property owners from benefiting from his bees , without detracting from his own enjoyment , then he would be able to negotiate with them to pay him for the benefit .
Since he would then derive an additional benefit from his bees — the payment — he would have an incentive to keep even more bees , benefiting both himself and his neighbors to an even greater extent .
Nor is this merely a zero -sum game .
Rather , under certain assumptions , [ 5 ] it turns out that there is some level of payment at which the surrounding property owners would be indifferent between the excludable and the nonexcludable situation , whereas the beekeeper would be demonstrably better off — i.e. , there would be a Pareto - efficient gain . [ 6 ]
This kind of analysis has led many economists to conclude that the ancillary benefit from the bees is a " public good " and that , therefore , the neighbors should be forced to contribute to the cost of this good .
This is supposed to be justified on the basis that the neighbor will enjoy a benefit that will , according to the economist , outweigh the cost .
And yet , regardless of the benefits that they enjoy , it cannot be said that the neighbors have in any way solicited this good or the forced arrangement advocated by the economist .
Thus , the essence of this proposal is that the neighbors be forced to pay for an unsolicited good . [ 7 ]
Moreover , this is not merely a special case .
Rather , the theory of " public goods " is a doctrine that advocates forced payment for unsolicited goods as a general economic ideal , applicable whenever a person obtains any benefit that is nonexcludable and which does not detract from the enjoyment of the good by others .
Finding a Pareto - efficient solution
In assessing arrangements to solve the " problem " of free riding , economists claim to be guided by the principle of Pareto efficiency .
That is , they claim to put forward arrangements that will make at least some people better off without any detriment to others , in terms of their own happiness .
If they are serious about this efficiency criterion then any proposed arrangement must surely accord with the preferences of the people involved , as revealed through their actual behavior .
It follows that the ultimate test of any allegedly Pareto - efficient arrangement must surely be to convince all of the parties affected that they are better off ( or at least , no worse off ) under the proposed arrangement .
Indeed , the consent and agreement of all parties must be regarded as the sine qua non of Pareto efficiency .
Unfortunately , this is not usually how economic analysis of these problems proceeds .
Rather , such analysis is frequently conducted on the basis that the economist knows more about the preferences of the people involved in the situation than those people do themselves .
In particular , dubious mathematical assumptions are often used to steamroll the implicitly revealed or even explicitly declared preferences of those actually taking the actions — to " prove , " on the basis of a mathematical model , that they are really happier under the economist 's desired arrangement , even if they may complain to the contrary .
" The consent and agreement of all parties must be regarded as the sine qua non of Pareto efficiency . "
In considering such analyses , it is important to note that theorems in mathematical economics that are used to demonstrate the potential for Pareto - efficient gains are often crucially dependent upon certain doubtful assumptions , such as low transaction costs , that may or may not be present in actual situations involving nonexcludable goods .
[ 8 ]
While mathematical models may be highly useful as an approximating tool for predicting , explaining , or even suggesting human action , these models must not be used to trump the revealed preferences of people taking the actions as a test of Pareto efficiency .
Perhaps , in our beekeeping situation , there is some arrangement that can be made between the beekeeper and his neighbors to make them all happier , and perhaps there is not .
A mathematical model may shed light on this question and may even be used to convince the beekeeper and his neighbors of the merits of a particular arrangement .
This would be an entrepreneurial solution , which does not involve coercion against any of the parties involved .
It is one thing to propose a voluntary arrangement on the basis of an idealized mathematical analysis , but it is entirely another to propose a coercive arrangement under which the utility curves concocted by the economist are allowed to trump the revealed preferences of the parties themselves .
It is dubious to suggest that an arrangement that could be undertaken voluntarily by the parties , but is not , will make them all better off .
And it is especially dubious to suggest that such an arrangement must be imposed on them by force rather than by their own agreement .
After all , if all parties genuinely stand to gain from some arrangement , according to their own preferences , then there is no reason why they should refuse to undertake such an arrangement voluntarily .
Or , to put it another way , the absence of any voluntary activity by the parties — especially when proposed arrangements are put to the parties and declined — is prima facie evidence that there is no potential for Pareto - efficient gains .
Even if we have no objection to coercion per se , [ 9 ] there are nonetheless sound economic reasons to reject coercive " solutions " to any alleged inefficiency problem due to free riding .
Since an entrepreneurial arrangement involves no coercion against any of the parties , it ensures that all of the parties will enjoy ex ante gains .
However , there is no such guarantee under a coercive arrangement , and it is nonsense to suppose that the government is able to determine arrangements for Pareto - efficient gains any better than those parties who actually stand to gain from such arrangements .
Indeed , arguments in public - choice theory , not to mention our actual experiences with government provision of goods and services , give us every reason to believe that at least someone will get screwed .
Thus , even if there were some arrangement that could be made between the parties to affect such an efficiency gain , it would by no means follow that this arrangement must involve government provision of goods or any other coercive measure . [ 10 ]
On the contrary , this is the opposite of what we should expect .
If all of the parties stand to gain , then there is no reason to expect that coercion will be required ; there is every reason to expect an entrepreneurial ( i.e. , noncoercive ) solution .
Indeed , there is a fundamental contradiction between the criterion of Pareto efficiency and the use of force against those who are to be made " better off . "
Those who advocate government provision of goods or other coercive measures as the solution to the " problem " of free riding frequently suffer from a lack of imagination in considering entrepreneurial solutions .
In fact , there are plenty of ways in which entrepreneurial activity may allow the parties to arrange their affairs to take advantage of Pareto - efficient gains .
Our beekeeper may enter into an assurance contract with his neighbors , whereby he agrees to purchase the bees — or purchase more bees — only if they will pay him some of the cost .
He may decide to buy out his free riding neighbors if he feels that the benefit he is about to provide to their property makes it a good deal .
Or he may think of some other idea for a voluntary agreement .
And of course , it may even be that there is no way to achieve a Pareto - efficient gain due to high transaction costs , or some other reason .
Thus , although the " problem " of free riding does indeed identify situations that involve the potential for further gains , it most certainly does not follow that government provision of goods or other coercive arrangements will improve the situation .
Those who advocate coercive arrangements to obtain Pareto efficiency gains are forced to ignore the revealed preferences of the people involved , and thereby commit a fundamental economic error .
By arguing for coercion as a means of solving the " problem " of positive externalities , they elevate the policy of forced payment for unsolicited goods to the status of an economic ideal .
This is surely one of the most conspicuously tyrannical arguments in modern economics .
Notes
[ 1 ]
With the notable exceptions of the Austrian School and , to a lesser extent , the Chicago School ( and of course , many other economists ) .
[ 2 ]
This should not be taken as a suggestion that economics should not be a value - free science .
Rather , it is a suggestion that economics should be correct , and that if it is , it will most certainly promote individual liberty at the expense of state coercion .
[ 3 ]
For a refutation of the fallacy of the economic theory of " public goods " see Hoppe , H.H. ( 1989 ) " Fallacies of the Public Goods Theory and the Production of Security . "
The Journal of Libertarian Studies 9 ( 1 ) .
Hoppe summarizes the situation as follows :
In spite of its many followers , the whole public goods theory is faulty , flashy reasoning , ridden with internal inconsistencies , non sequiturs , appealing to and playing on popular prejudices and assumed beliefs , but with no scientific merit whatsoever .
( p. 27 )
[ 4 ]
Similarly , surrounding property owners may plant more flowers in their garden solely for the aesthetic benefit they provide .
However , as an ancillary effect — another externality — the beekeeper will benefit from the greater supply of flowers for pollination by his bees .
[ 5 ]
Such as the absence of , or at least a low level of , transaction costs .
[ 6 ]
A Pareto - efficient gain is one in which at least one person is made better off and no other person is made worse off .
[ 7 ]
Hoppe presents a reductio ad absurdum of this principle :
You , gentle reader , have never hired me as an economic consultant .
You have not taken advantage of this marvelous opportunity open to you .
However , whether you know it or not , whether you realize it or not , whether you appreciate it or not , you actually benefit from my economic analysis .
You are thus a selfish , chiseling free - rider on these multifaceted benefits I have long provided for you , gratis .
But now it is time to stop you from exploiting me regarding these spillover gains you have long enjoyed for free .
It is time for you to pay your fair share !
Accordingly , I am hereby presenting you with this bill for $ 100,000 , a bargain at the price .
See Hoppe , H.H. ( 2003 ) The Myth of National Defense : Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production , p. 310 .
Of course , as is evident from legal prohibitions on demands for payment for unsolicited goods and service ( usually enacted under consumer - protection laws ) , governments will not allow such an absurd principle to prevail in private industry .
And hence , as is common in government action , absurdity is compounded by manifest hypocrisy .
[ 8 ]
This is not to say that mathematical economists are " incorrect " in formulating their models .
It is notoriously difficult to construct mathematical models of human behavior and some degree of idealization is almost invariably required .
The point is that these models are often used incorrectly as a basis to tell people what really makes them happy , despite their protestations to the contrary .
[ 9 ]
And of course , we should have an objection .
[ 10 ]
To those unfamiliar with arguments in political economy , the government provision of goods is coercive because it involves taxation , i.e. , the coercive acquisition of money by government .

Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Monday again denied creating a paramilitary group inthe early 1990s to murder suspected rebels .
At the start of his second week on trial here , Fujimori insisted that he had heard nothing of this from his two main subordinates -- Vladimiro Montesinos and Victor Malca , former chief of the National Intelligence Service and the nation 's then minister of defense respectively .
He also said he had never met Santiago Martin Rivas , an army major convicted of heading the paramilitaries , known as the Colina Group .
The prosecution is seeking to prove that links existed between Fujimori and the Colina group blamed for the deaths of 25 civilians in two massacres in 1991 and 1992 .
Fujimori was also charged with kidnapping journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer .
The court session ended in the afternoon and will begin again on Wednesday .
This trail , covering charges of murder , kidnapping and malicious wounding , is one of three which Fujimori is scheduled to face at the National Special Operations Directorate .
Fujimori was sentenced earlier this month to six years imprison for abuse of power .
Fujimori fled to Japan in 2000 to escape a corruption scandal involving alleged bribes to legislators and lived there for five years .
In 2005 , he flew to Chile , where he might have been preparing for a return to politics in Peru .
The former Peruvian leader was arrested in November 2005 in Chile and extradited to Peru in September .

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate this week for the first time in four years .
And it happens that I am working on a new economics data function for Mathematica — so I wanted to see what typically results after such a reduction in the federal funds rate .
The Fed makes much of its data available on the web through the FRED II database .
So , all I had to do was point Mathematica ’s powerful Import function to the site , and I instantly had the data in Mathematica for analysis .
It took one line of code .
A couple of short Mathematica evaluations later , and I had a list of all the previous occasions when this rate fell 0.5 % or more .
I immediately noticed that these large drops sometimes come in “ runs , ” and decided to focus on the large cuts in each such sequence .
I found 15 of these which go back to 1954 .
There are obvious natural periods in the data .
The pre-Volcker Fed , through 1979 , operated on Keynesian principles and focused on trying to control unemployment through rate cuts .
In the Volcker period , from 1979 to 1987 , the focus was instead on reducing persistent inflation .
The Fed did not directly target the funds rate but instead focused on the rate of growth in the money supply , and rates were high and volatile .
Since 1987 , the Greenspan ( and now Bernanke ) Fed has used a pragmatic mix , with a primary objective of keeping inflation low , but a willingness to cut aggressively when the risk of recession seems high .
Throughout the different eras , making a rate cut has not lead to deterministic behavior and there has always been a wide variance in what happens .
I decided to look at the behavior of several macroeconomic series in the months following an initial large reduction in the federal funds rate , with the option of breaking the cases down into these natural Fed policy periods .
I wanted to see how each series moved in the months after each initial cut , with all the past cases overlayed on the same plot .
I chose indicators frequently associated with Fed rate decisions or regarded as strongly driven by Fed rate policies .
Inflation , unemployment and real GDP are the indicators the Fed itself watches the most .
I included the federal funds rate itself to see if a large cut typically signals a whole series of cuts ahead .
For longer term rates I used two corporate bond series : highest grade and investment grade .
Investment - grade bonds may be more sensitive to changes in the real economy , due to their higher risk of default .
Of course , everyone is most interested in the effect of rate cuts on the stock market .
I looked at two series for this : the Dow Jones and the broader S&P 500 index .
These are readily available within Mathematica through the FinancialData function , so I did not need to get those from the Fed .
They were instantly compatible with the data from the Fed , in dates , formats , plotting , etc .
Finally , I included two exchange - rate series , as those are generally thought to be quite sensitive to changes in rates .
Higher rates are believed to strengthen a currency and lower ones to weaken it .
My two series are both trade - weighted indices , one against major “ hard ” currencies and the other including all US trading partners .
Once I decided what I wanted , getting this data and examining plots of it inside Mathematica took literally minutes .
I worked with Fred Meinberg here at Wolfram Research to make a nice Demonstration ( which you can download here ) to examine all the cases and to present the data interactively in graphical form .
By the end of the day — a day in which we both worked on other projects as well — we had this finished , and uploaded it to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project .
I think the turnaround time on this little project shows some of the strengths of Mathematica 6 .
Forms of analysis and user - interface elements that might be difficult in other software are easy , and the results can be made highly accessible — open to anyone with Mathematica or the free Mathematica Player .
Next we plan to make a lot of this data accessible right inside Mathematica within our load - on - demand data system .
That way , what one experienced user was able to do easily now , anyone with Mathematica will be able to do at least as easily in the future .
Thus airlines are increasingly cutting back services in coach or charging passengers for things that used to be free , like meals ( $ 5 for a snack box on United ) or drinks ( $ 2 for a 16 - fluid - ounce bottle of water on Spirit ) or , in the case of Delta , US Airways , Northwest and Continental , starting to use narrow - body planes more frequently on trans -Atlantic flights , making those long - haul flights more cost - effective , albeit at the expense of passenger comfort .
It ’s all simple economics .
In January , United removed half - ounce pretzel snack mixes from the economy section of flights that are less than two hours long , about 29 percent of its flights , to save what it says is about $ 650,000 a year .
( Cutting out pretzels has reportedly saved Northwest $ 2 million a year . )
Meanwhile , American has estimated that it would save $ 30 million a year by eliminating free meal service in coach .
Last September , in a move that extinguished any hope of hot meals returning to coach , the airline removed the rear galleys — including the oven — from its MD - 80 aircraft and replaced them with four seats .
That change , the airline told The Washington Post , will be worth an additional $ 34 million a year .
Overall , the amount of money the nine largest passenger carriers in the United States spend on food per passenger has been slashed to about $ 3.40 from $ 5.92 in 1992 , according to the Department of Transportation .
And wonder why it ’s almost impossible to get a pillow anymore ?
Again , it comes down to money .
American has said it saved $ 300,000 when it removed pillows from its MD - 80s in November 2004 .
In February 2005 it began removing pillows from 737s , 757s and Airbus 300s on nearly all flights within the continental United States , Canada , the Caribbean and Mexico , with the airline explaining that the change saved it $ 600,000 .
The story is much different in the front of the plane — and it ’s not just things like the four - course meal ( served on china , with real utensils , and with a choice of four wines ) that American now serves its business - class passengers on overseas flights and the fact that , yes , a pillow and a blanket still await you .
Passengers flying business class on United from Washington Dulles to Frankfurt , for example , are now offered “ 180 - degree lie - flat ” seats .
The upgraded seats , which are part of a multimillion - dollar makeover of its international premium cabins , transform into 6 - foot - 4 - inch beds and feature larger personal TV screens , iPod adapters and noise - canceling headphones .
Delta Air Lines and American are also upgrading their upper - class cabins on international flights with such features as wider , bedlike seats , improved in - flight entertainment , and new food options .
And Delta and United have turned to celebrity chefs — Michelle Bernstein for Delta and Charlie Trotter for United — to create menus for its business - and first - class customers .
Of course , the airlines insist they have not completely abandoned the economy segment of the market .
In fact , Delta and Continental are making their commitment to the average passenger the signature element of their new ad campaigns , with Delta adding individual television screens on all its coast - to - coast flights among other things and Continental rolling out video - on - demand systems on its trans -Atlantic flights .
“ We do a lot of work up front , but not at the expense of the back of the cabin , ” said Eric Kleiman , the director of product marketing for Continental .

And some low - cost carriers are flying newer planes with better amenities like sleek leather seats , satellite television for each passenger and even , as in the case of JetBlue , removing seats to add legroom in coach .
WASHINGTON – It 's a time - honored tradition for presidential hopefuls to claim credit for other people 's successes .
But Al Gore as the father of the Internet ?
That 's what the campaigner in chief told CNN's Wolf Blitzer during an interview Tuesday evening .
Blitzer asked Gore how he was different than other presumptive Democratic challengers , such as Bill Bradley .
" What do you have to bring to this that he does n't necessarily bring to this process ? "
Replied Gore : " I 'll be offering my vision when my campaign begins , and it'll be comprehensive and sweeping , and I hope that it 'll be compelling enough to draw people toward it ....
I 've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years . "
Then came the kicker : " During my service in the United States Congress , I took the initiative in creating the Internet . "
Huh ?
Preliminary discussions of how the ARPANET would be designed began in 1967 , and a request for proposals went out the following year .
In 1969 , the Defense Department commissioned the ARPANET .
Gore was 21 - years - old at the time .
He was n't even done with law school at Vanderbilt University .
It would be eight more years before Gore would be elected to the US House of Representatives as a freshman Democrat with scant experience in passing legislation , let alone ambitious proposals .
By that time , file copying – via the UUCP protocol – was beginning .
Email was flourishing .
The culture of the Internet was starting to develop through the Jargon File and the SF - Lovers mailing list .
Of course , politicians were n't completely unaware of the Internet .
According to one account , when Senator Ted Kennedy learned in 1968 that Massachusetts - based BBN had won the ARPA contract for an " interface message processor , " he sent a congratulatory telegram .
It thanked the upstanding folks at BBN for their ecumenical spirit in devising an " interfaith message processor . "
Blitzer , unfortunately , did n't appear to know any of that .
After Gore took credit for the Internet , Blitzer simply moved on talk about polls showing Texas governor George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole ahead of the vice president .
Turkish troops have been at the Iraq border since October
The country 's top general , Yasar Buyukanit , said the US opened northern Iraqi airspace for the operation .
Jets targeted the Kurdish rebel PKK in areas near the border .
The Turkish media said up to 50 planes were used .
Iraqi officials said the bombs hit 10 villages , leaving one woman dead , while the PKK reported seven deaths .
The Iraqi Foreign Minister , Hoshyar Zebari , told the BBC that his government had told the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad that the air strikes were " unacceptable " .
We hope it 's the last one , and will not be repeated , because this can lead to a galvanisation of the situation and the rise of tension and emotions in the region
Hoshyar Zebari
Iraqi Foreign Minister
" There has been previous understanding that any such action should be co-ordinated with the Iraqi government or with the multinational forces , " he told BBC's Newshour programme .
" From what we 've learned , they gave a very late notice for their operation , and those targeted villages ... were not PKK infrastructure . "
Mr Zebari said Iraq did not want to see any further Turkish air strikes on its territory because they might lead to a " galvanisation of the situation and the rise of tension and emotions in the region " .
But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed them a " success " .
Turkey has regularly targeted the PKK inside Iraq in recent months , but this is thought to be the first fighter jet raid outside its own territory .
' No refuge '
General Buyukanit said the US " gave intelligence " that aided the operation .
" But what is more important is that the United States last night opened northern Iraqi airspace to us .
By doing that , the United States approved the operation , " he said .
He said winter conditions in the mountainous region would be no obstacle for the Turkish military .

" The Turkish armed forces have given the message to the Turkish public and the world that whether it is winter or summer , we will find and hit them even if they live in caves , " he added .
Turkish planes hit the regions of Zap , Hakurk and Avasin as well as areas in the Kandil mountains in an operation lasting three hours , the Turkish military said .
Artillery barrages followed .
It said only " terrorist " targets , and not civilians , were hit .
Local officials in northern Iraq spoke of families fleeing their homes .
Pro-Kurdish media initially reported the death of one woman and the wounding of five other civilians in a village near the Kandil mountains .
The PKK itself reportedly announced on an internet site that five of its fighters and two civilians had been killed in the mountain area , with two fighters wounded .
" Many civilians , among them women and children " were also wounded , the group was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
There was no confirmation of the figures .
Troops massed
Ankara toughened its line against the PKK after a spate of rebel attacks inside Turkey that prompted widespread calls for action .
In October , Turkey 's parliament voted to allow the military to launch operations into Iraq to combat the PKK , which had stepped up attacks in Turkey .
Ankara has massed up to 100,000 troops near the mountainous border with northern Iraq , backed by tanks , artillery and warplanes .
But Iraq and the US have urged Turkey not to carry out its threat .
As many as 3,000 PKK members are believed to be based inside northern Iraq .
Turkey has accused the local Kurdish authorities of supporting them - which they deny .

Facebook VANCOUVER ( AP )  A Canadian man died Saturday , four days after police used a Taser stun - gun on him because he reportedly was acting erratically in a store , police said .
He was the third person to die in recent weeks in Canada after being shocked by the handheld weapon .
Robert Knipstrom , 36 , died in a hospital after two officers used pepper spray , a Taser and their batons to subdue the British Columbia resident .
Police earlier said Knipstrom was extremely agitated , aggressive and combative with the two officers who responded .
He was conscious and speaking when he was taken to the hospital .
The cause of death has yet to be determined .
Although a Taser was used against Knipstrom , it was not immediately clear what role , if any , it played in his death , said Inspector Brendan Fitzpatrick .
Investigations into Knipstrom 's death have been launched separately by the British Columbia Coroner 's Office and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , police said at a news conference Saturday .
The case comes as Canadian police face intense criticism over the death of Robert Dziekanski , a Polish immigrant who died at Vancouver airport last month after officers used a Taser and manhandled him .
A Nova Scotian man also died earlier this week , 30 hours after being shocked with the Taser at a jail where he was being held on assault charges .

Authorities have tried to play down the severity of the spill
Up to 70 people are being treated for the effects of toxic fumes released in the derailment of a train near the western city of Lviv .
Authorities say that the concentration of noxious gases in the affected region is above normal .
But a top minister said that food and water supplies in the area were safe .
About half of those seeking help , including 19 children , were taken to hospital , a spokesman for the emergency situations ministry said , but he added that their lives were not in danger .
The nature ministry said in a statement that the concentration of phosphorous residue in the air over two of the villages near the accident was 23 times above normal .
But Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk , who travelled to the area , said on television on Wednesday that tests showed it was safe to eat vegetables and drink well water .
Remembering Chernobyl
Mr Kuzmuk had said on Tuesday that the toxic cloud was a worrying development and compared the accident to the blast at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 .
We have resolved the situation by extinguishing those tankers .
Now we need to talk about dealing with the aftermath
Viktor Yanukovych , Ukraine PM
He later backtracked , while other officials were careful to play down any comparisons with Chernobyl and said they had minimised the risk to public health .
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych promised to punish those found responsible for the accident , but said the worst was over .
" I can say we have resolved the situation by extinguishing those tankers .
Now we need to talk about dealing with the aftermath of this breakdown " , Mr Yanukovych was quoted as saying by Ukrainian TV channel 5 Kanal .
Ukrainian authorities said there was no suggestion of sabotage or terrorism .
The freight train , which was en route from Kazakhstan to Poland , derailed near Lviv , a town not far from the Polish border in western Ukraine on Monday night .
Fifteen of the train 's 58 cars overturned , six of which then caught fire , officials said .
The toxic yellow cloud caused by the blaze covered an area of 90 sq km ( 34.7 sq miles ) above 14 villages before dispersing on Tuesday .
Firefighters wearing masks and protective clothing managed to extinguish the fire after several hours .
Dangerous transport
Phosphorus compounds are mainly used in fertilisers , but can also be used to produce pesticides , cleaning products and explosives .
A spokesman for Greenpeace International , Yannick Vicaire , told BBC News : " Phosphorous is a very aggressive and corrosive substance , it can affect the eyes , lungs and even the liver , if contaminated water or food is ingested . "
He said the accident underscored the dangers of chemical transports , which should be avoided whenever possible .

THE 2008 presidential race is being fought by a wide variety of candidates .
Mitt Romney , a Mormon , vies for the Republican presidential nomination against thrice - married Rudy Giuliani , among others .
Democratic voters might choose Barack Obama , a black man , or the first woman candidate , Hillary Clinton .
But is the public ready ?
A recent Gallup poll suggests people would more readily vote for a well - qualified nominee who also happened to be black than a well - qualified Mormon one .
And it may be some time before an atheist homosexual announces his candidacy .

As you can see from the chart above , Katie Couric ’s first nine months at CBS are n’t exactly going as planned – in fact , she ’s costing CBS an arm and a leg and a whole lot more for each viewer she hangs onto in her shrinking audience .
And last week the $ 15 million - a - year anchor got even more expensive .
When the ratings for “ The CBS Evening News ” dipped to 5.9 million for the week ended May 25 – an all - time low , and a smaller audience than former anchors Dan Rather and Bob Schieffer ever saw – it meant
CBS was paying $ 2.51 per viewer .
By comparison , ABC ’s Charlie Gibson - anchored “ World News Tonight , ” cost 89 cents per viewer ( 7.78 million tuned in ) , while NBC ’s “ Nightly News ” with Brian Williams was a relative bargain at about 55 cents per head .
Gibson reportedly pulls down about $ 7 million a year , and Williams is paid an estimated $ 4 million .
In happier days , CBS was paying interim anchor Schieffer 48 cents per viewer ( 7.2 million viewers , $ 3.5 million estimated salary ) while Rather ’s cost per head came in at about a buck – 7 million viewers , $ 7 million annually .
In fact , after attracting a surprising 13.6 million viewers for her debut telecast last September , Couric has lost more viewers than Rather usually attract -
Mozilla Corp. late Monday released the first beta of Firefox 3.0 , but continued to warn most users to stick with production Version 2.0 .
" We do not recommend that anyone other than developers and testers download the Firefox 3 Beta 1 milestone release , " Mike Beltzner , Mozilla 's interface designer , said in a note posted to the company 's development center .
" It is intended for testing purposes only . "
But while the official word was for users to stand clear , Beltzner 's personal recommendation was a lot less intimidating .
" It 's a preview release , so use with caution and do n't expect your add - ons to work without some magic ; but between you and me , I 've been running on this ' developer preview ' for at least three months , and have never looked back , " he said in a post to his own blog .
Beltzner also touted several of the improvements in Firefox 3.0 , including new security features and tools , a redesign of the bookmarking and browser history and numerous back - end platform enhancements , but he said they all require more testing and user feedback .
The company has posted a more complete list of new features in the release notes it added to its Web site Monday .
On the security side , Firefox 3.0 adds malware check , a phishing filter - like feature that warns users attempting to reach a URL blacklisted for suspected malicious code hosting ; one - click site information that displays site ownership ; fixes for vulnerabilities in plug - in updating ; and integration with antivirus software and Windows Vista 's parental control settings .
Mozilla also claimed that it has fixed more than 300 individual memory leaks and added a new cycle collector to eliminate other memory issues .
Firefox has a reputation for leaking memory consuming large quantities the longer it 's left running , and ultimate slowing down its host computer although some of its developers have contested the claims , and even pegged the problem as one of perception .
Most current Firefox plug-ins Mozilla calls them extensions will not work with Firefox 3.0 , a stumbling block for some who might otherwise want to test the preview .
" Users of the latest released version of Firefox should not expect their add - ons to work properly with this beta , " the beta 's release notes read .
Firefox 3.0 Beta 1 can be downloaded for Windows , Mac OS X and Linux in 21 language versions from Mozilla 's site .
Mozilla has not set a deadline for delivering the final edition , and apparently does not intend to .
" The final version of Firefox 3 will be released when we qualify the product as fully ready for our users , " its release notes said .
By the timeline it set for itself midyear , Mozilla is more than three months behind schedule , in part because it extended the alpha - testing stage to encompass eight versions .
This summer , Mozilla pegged Beta 1's release for late July with a second beta in September , both to precede a final release by the end of the year .
The company is now shooting to deliver a second beta before the end of the year , with more betas possible before producing one or more release candidates in a run-up to final code .

This is just a bit of fun after my rainy ride to work today .
The thing is that the bike wins for the entire time , meaning that for short and long distances the bike is always going to be your best friend , you should also realize that these people love cars , they LOVE THEM , they are not going to be fair to any other mode of transport but fossil fuel based transport .
Also who rides their bike like that guy ?
He is not having a good time , and not “ doing it ” right .
Seriously .

Remember this post I did when Lara blasted the right wingers and Laura Ingraham in particular who were saying the media was biased against the war and afraid to leave their hotel balconies to report all the wonderful stories in Iraq ?
Media Channel :
The segment in question – ” Battle for Haifa Street ” –is a piece of first - rate journalism but one that only appears on the CBS News website–and has never been broadcast .
It is a gritty , realistic look at life on the very mean streets of Baghdad , and includes interviews with civilians who complain that the US military presence is only making their lives worse and the situation more deadly .
“ They told us they would bring democracy , they promised life would be better than it was under Saddam , ” one told Logan .
“ But they brought us nothing but death and killing .
They brought mass destruction to Baghdad . ”
Logan asks for help in getting attention to what she calls “ a story that is largely being ignored even though this is takingplace every single [ sic ] day in Baghdad , two blocks from where our office is located . ”
Here 's the video ...
From : lara logan
Subject : help
The story below only appeared on our CBS website and was not aired on CBS .
It is a story that is largely being ignored , even though this istakingplace verysingle day in central Baghdad , two blocks from where our office is located .
Our crew had to be pulled out because we got a call saying they were about to be killed , and on their way out , a civilian man was shot dead in front of them as they ran .
I would be very grateful if any of you have a chance to watch this story and pass the link on to as many people you know as possible .
It should be seen .
And people should know about this .
If anyone has time to send a comment to CBS – about the story – not about my request , then that would help highlight that people are interested and this is not too gruesome to air , but rather too important to ignore .
Many , many thanks .

( Nicole : David Shuster on Countdown discussed Rudy 's complete lack of knowledge or understanding of the terror threats surrounding 9/11 and I 'm including the segment here as I think it brings even more to Steve Benen 's post . )
At a town - hall meeting in Iowa last night , Rudy Giuliani did his best impression of a crazy person .
After noting that Giuliani ally Michael Mukasey , the Attorney General nominee , " fudged " his answer on waterboarding , a local woman asked if a presudebt can order waterboarding , even though it 's torture .
Mr. Giuliani responded : “ Okay .
First of all , I do n’t believe the attorney general designate in any way was unclear on torture .
I think Democrats said that ; I do n’t think he was . ”
Ms. Gustitus said : “ He said he did n’t know if waterboarding is torture . ”
Mr. Giuliani said : “ Well , I ’m not sure it is either .
I ’m not sure it is either .
It depends on how it ’s done .
It depends on the circumstances .
It depends on who does it .
This is the guy who claims to be an expert on national security and counter - terrorism ?
Seriously ?
Propaganda is theft because it attempts to deprive people of the truth .
Our sister paper , the Guardian , ran a debate on liberty , rights and privacy and in it we saw two examples of government propaganda .
The first came from the Justice Minister Jack Straw , who held that New Labour had ' deepened and extended ' civil liberties - yes , and I am Scary Spice .
The second was from columnist Polly Toynbee , New Labour 's unblushing champion , who accused people like me - actually , especially me - of being right - wingers in liberal clothing and middle - class paranoids seeking victimhood .
Neither was successful because the authors do not understand the difference between refuting an argument and rebutting it .
Straw is an old fashioned statist who believes if you go on saying a lie people will eventually believe it .
Toynbee is something different .
One senses panic rising from the realisation that it is very hard to deny Labour 's programme against liberty when most of it is on the statute book .
So she scurries around wondering how she is going to hold the line .
Her first ploy was to muddy the waters by questioning what is a reasonable freedom .
For instance , she presents Labour 's campaign against free speech as merely anti-discrimination laws , which is nothing like the whole truth .
There is , she says , a clash between the right to free speech and the right not to be abused .
The point is abuse is the corollary of free speech .
I would prefer everyone to be well - mannered and respectful yet I believe gays have the right to be rude about the church and the church to be rude about gays , without either running to the law .
Next step is for her to practise this free speech by referring to what she calls my paranoia .
That 's fine by me but I 'd just point out that there is a difference between fear and paranoia , as there is between sounding the alarm and being alarmist .
And again , it 's not as if I , or any of the other contributors to the debate , are making this up .
It is irrefutably all there in Labour 's record .
The breathtaking dishonesty of her argument is to describe anyone who opposes Labour on these grounds as a being a right - winger .
In our democracy liberals exist in all parties - thank God - and it is eloquent of her desperation that she seeks to portray those who stand for liberty , rights and privacy as being individualists who are seeking the aura of victimhood , which of course decrypts as privileged middle - class dilettantes .
The allegation comes from the hard - line sectarian communists of my student days , and it is hardly surprising to find the same generation still at it in New Labour , yet now adding notes of vanity , self - righteousness and priggishness .
The striking thing is how few in the government and among its supporters really grasp the substance of our complaints about liberty over the last 10 years .
With dismal familiarity , we watch them move hastily from the matter in hand to rattle on about social justice .
The trick , you see , is to portray concerns about liberty as a luxury for the privileged classes when what really matters is poverty and inequality .
She must know that there can be no social justice without liberty , and vice versa .
Besides , as the gap between the rich and poor widens every day , New Labour and its cheerleaders are at risk of causing nationwide symptoms of motion sickness when they strike this particular pose .
We are all victims of Labour 's authoritarian laws but often the people whose interests New Labour claims to represent are especially penalised - for instance , the defendants who are pressurised in police stations to plead guilty by video link to crimes they have not committed because there is no adequate legal representation to hand .
Why does n't Toynbee write about the measures smuggled into the Domestic Violence , Crime and Victims Act which will combine with the Tribunals , Courts and Enforcement
Act to make it legal for bailiffs to enter someone 's home and seize property on a civil order ?
Jack Straw's Department of Justice is currently formulating the rules that will govern the force that may be offered to single mothers , old ladies , teenagers and young children who happen to be at home when the bailiffs come .
Will she be reminding us that Labour has buried 400 years of protection against this outrage ?
Jack Straw 's performance last week was wondrously lacking in self knowledge , or at least the elementary sense of the truth we must expect in our ministers .
But then Straw was Foreign Secretary when Britain went to war in Iraq and escaped all blame .
His time as Home Secretary has escaped all criticism .
He was speaking when Walter Wolfgang was hauled out from the Labour conference but did not intervene .
He skated from Blair to Brown and then proceeded to blame Blair 's people for cash for honours and the more recent illegal donations scandal .
At every opportunity it seems he disparages Blair , most recently over Blair 's refusal to condemn Israel 's attack on Hizbollah in Lebanon .
Why did n't he protest at the time ?
As doubts grow about Brown going the distance , I 'll give you any money there 's a message at the back of Straw 's mind which says : ' You might just get a crack at Number 10 , Jack .
Who else is there ? '
His approach to Labour 's programme against liberty is simply to deny that it ever existed - which is to say that water flows uphill .
This is not a matter of interpretation , but calculated propaganda , and the readers knew it .
In the hours following publication , he was taken apart on the Guardian 's Comment is Free blog about his failure to mention such things as ID cards , the restrictions on protest and the building of the database state .
The key sentences come from a feline passage in the middle of his article .
' We have " freedoms to " do things in a free society , ' he wrote , ' but " freedoms from " as well .
Freedoms from fear , crime and terrorism . '
It is this notion of ' freedoms from ' that has enabled the attack on liberty .
Because people 's fears are infinite it follows that Labour 's urge to legislate is inexhaustible .
The air is clearing now .
Each one of us is probably more certain where we stand in the ideological divide that is opening up .
Are we for the growth of state power at the expense of individual freedom , or do we believe that our democracy depends on individual freedom and an inviolate system of rights ?
If you agree with the following propositions you may just find yourself on the opposite side to Straw and Toynbee :
That government exists to serve and respect the people and can only do so by trusting the people ; that every individual has the right to privacy and that personal information is exactly that - personal ; that every individual has a right to justice - access to proper representation , to know the evidence against them , and be punished only if a normal court of law has decided the law has been broken ; that every individual has the right to communicate , move about , assemble and express him or herself without the state obstructing , interfering with or monitoring those activities ; that government and the state are not the same thing ; that good government is only possible when these liberties are respected and government is fully accountable to the people .

The following is an article - by - article summary of the changes

be changed article , even if only one sentence or word was changed in the article .

YOU know that nerves are taut when a couple of stray comments set off a flurry of selling .
The dollar fell sharply on Wednesday November 7th after mid-ranking Chinese officials , not actually responsible for foreign - exchange policy , made remarks that were seized upon by already jittery markets .
A Chinese parliamentarian called for his country to diversify its reserves out of “ weak ” currencies like the dollar and another official suggested that the dollar 's status as a reserve currency was “ shaky ” .
The greenback reached $ 2.10 against the pound and a new record of $ 1.47 against the euro , before recovering slightly .
A widely traded index , which tracks the dollar 's value against six major currencies , also fell to a new low .
The sliding dollar , along with record losses from General Motors , the threat of $ 100 - a - barrel oil and more bad news from the mortgage industry , spooked Wall Street .
On November 7th the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 2.6 % and the S&P 500 index by almost 3 % .
To add to the worries , Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's president , ramped up the political rhetoric on a visit to Washington .
Alarmed that the weak dollar boosts America 's competitiveness relative to Europe's , he told Congress that George Bush 's administration needed to do something about the dollar or risk an “ economic war ” .
Wall Street seers wondered whether official intervention to prop up the dollar was on the cards .
A true dollar crisis has long been one of the more frightening possibilities for the world economy .
If foreign investors suddenly abandon America 's currency and the dollar collapses , financial markets could crash while the plunging currency constrains the Federal Reserve 's ability to cut interest rates .
That fear is exacerbated by rising concerns about higher crude oil and food prices .
For now , the dollar nightmare is still unlikely .
The currency 's decline is neither surprising nor , at least until this week , alarmingly rapid .
The gaping current - account deficit and interest - rate differentials between America and other big economies point to a weaker currency .
The Fed has cut short - term interest rates by 0.75 percentage points in the past two months .
Given the scale of the credit mess and rising fears of recession , expectations are growing that the central bank will cut rates once again when its rate - setting committee next meets on December 11th .
Elsewhere , central bankers have stood pat or tightened .
The Reserve Bank of Australia raised short - term rates to 6.75 % on November 6th , citing inflationary pressure .
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England , meeting on November 8th , both kept short - term rates on hold , at 4 % and 5.75 % respectively .
If cyclical considerations point to a weaker dollar , the most recent nervousness seems to be driven more by structural worries .
Judging by the dollar 's slump in the wake of the Chinese officials ' comments , investors are fretting that central banks in emerging economies will abandon the ailing greenback .
In the short term at least , that fear is easily exaggerated .
The share of global foreign - exchange reserves held in dollars has fallen in recent years , but only gradually .
Central banks are unlikely to accelerate a dollar rout by making dramatic changes in their reserve portfolios .
That said , many long - standing dollar bulwarks are looking weaker .
Many countries that link their currencies to the dollar , from Arab oil exporters to China , face inflationary pressure .
As the greenback slumps , these countries have ever - stronger domestic reasons to allow their currencies to rise .
So far , the dollar 's decline has caused little alarm among American policymakers .
There is scant sign that the depreciation has aggravated price pressures .
And inflation expectations , though up slightly , have not soared .
Instead , the weaker currency , along with strong growth abroad , has boosted exports , helping to support output growth and unwind external imbalances faster than many thought possible .
America 's current - account deficit fell to 5.5 % of GDP in the second quarter , from a peak of 7 % at the end of 2005 .
For all the official talk of a “ strong dollar ” , most American policymakers have lost little sleep over the sliding greenback .
A dramatic fall in the dollar , however , would be a different story .
If this week 's ructions are a sign of things to come , the weak dollar could become a big headache .

Procter & Gamble
Deep doo- doo
The parents of two Florida toddlers sue Procter & Gamble after they are surprised to find images of their children on packages of Luvs diapers .
The parents say they were paid a " nominal fee " at a casting call but were promised an additional payment if the photos were selected .
So what ’s on your party menu for watching the big game ?
We ’ve put together the following items , which go beyond bowls of corn chips , pretzels and cheeses .
We make no specific claims about their healthiness , so pace yourself !
Your final menu choices will depend on how much prep work you feel like doing for your party .
The Easy & Traditional Snacks
These are the snacks that are easy to put together , and mostly require minimal effort .
Lighter & Healthier Snacks
If you ’re feeling slightly peckish instead of all - out hungry , here are a few suggestions .
Most are pretty traditional , like the items above – just lower in calories .
Crudites and dip .
Cut up some celery , carrots , cucumbers , and red peppers into bite - size pieces and serve with a nice dip .
Cold cuts .
We feel that some of the best cold cuts and sliced meats come from Italian markets .
Just roll each slice up into a tube , or fold into a wedge , and arrange on a platter .
Olive selection .
Even simpler than cold cuts or crudites .
While you ’re at that Italian or Mediterranean market , pick up a nice array of olives – from savory to spicy , with different stuffings , from pimento to cream cheese to even almonds .
Cheese bites and ( wheat ) crackers .
Cheese platters do not have to be boring .
There are so many cheeses to choose from – go for different textures and flavors – and then add some grapes and nuts to the platter as well .
A crazy big salad .
A big salad is the perfect complement to most game day foods – and relieves the guilt of eating all the other ( heavier ) snacks .
Chop items small and throw it all in — vegetables , fruits , olives , boiled eggs , cheese , etc. — depending on your tastes .
Top with balsamic vinegar , extra - virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lime .
Savroy Pies .
Quiche can be served hot or at room temperature .
Baked spinach pie , reminds me of spanakopita , only easier to make because this recipe uses frozen puff pastry .
A store bought pie crust makes these recipes easy as …
Sandwiches and Burgers
What ’s a game party without some sort of sandwiches .
Here are a few variations , some possibly unique to this article .
Hot sandwiches .
Serve spicy Italian sausage with plenty of peppers and onions , on crusty rolls .
“ Grilled cheese ” burgers .
You read that right .
Make your burgers in one pan and keep it warm .
Then , on order , make a grilledcheesesandwich ( shown above ) in another pan , using regular bread slices .
Split it open ( careful , it ’s hot ) and place tomato slices , pickles ( optional ) , and a cooked burger patty .
Have hot sauce or ketchup on the side .
Tex - Mex Cheese Burgers .
Need I say more !
Check out the video .
Pocket subs .
Whether you call them hoagies , rockets , subs or something else , these are always a hit , especially with kids .
Make sure you have lots of small Italian buns or sub buns , a variety of cold cuts , pickles , toppings and spreads .
Something Extra and Hearty
These are for those colder football days , when you feel like something heartier .
Now if none of these look tempting , check out Cooking Light ’s list of Football Party Recipes !
“ Trumpery ” is not the first foray into science for Mr. Parnell , a screenwriter and dramatist who has worked on television shows like “ The West Wing ” and who teaches television writing at the Yale School of Drama .
That would be “ QED , ” a play about Richard Feynman , the physicist and theorist of quantum electrodynamics , the modern theory of electromagnetism .
It was while working on that play that Mr. Parnell stumbled on a book , “ The Song of the Dodo ” by David Quammen , which describes Wallace ’s work .
The book led Mr. Parnell to more study of Darwin , Wallace and their times .
Pretty soon , he had a three - act play with , he realized , a cast of way too many characters dealing with way too many subjects  not just evolution , but topics like Colonialism and a Tierra del Fuegan accused of murder .
Image Michael Cristofer , top and above left , as Charles Darwin in  Trumpery ,  and Manoel Felciano as Alfred Russel Wallace .
Credit ... " Trumpery ” photographs by Sara Krulwich / The New York Times
“ I did n’t know for a long time what the play was about , ” he said .
But just as “ QED ” focused sharply on Feynman , Mr. Parnell found this play by focusing on Darwin and telescoping some of the events in his life to bring his quandaries into sharp relief .
For example , much of the play is an argument involving Darwin , his biological allies Joseph Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley , and their foe , Richard Owen .
In fact , their debates took place in letters .
But confrontation is useful for a dramatist dealing with science .
“ The ideas have to be accurate , they have to be intelligible , ” Mr. Parnell said .
“ But you have to find a dramatic way to tell it  a reason it can be a play , to exist on stage . ”
He added , “ It has to be grounded in conflict . ”
“ Trumpery ” is not Mr. Parnell ’s first exploration of a frightening idea either .
That was “ And Tango Makes Three , ” a children ’s book he wrote with his partner , Justin Richardson .
The book tells the true story of Silo and Roy , two male penguins at the Central Park Zoo who courted each other and formed a relationship .
When a keeper saw them trying to incubate a rock , he gave them an orphaned egg , which they cared for until it hatched as the chick Tango .
House Judiciary Committee compromises whistleblower E-mail addresses
The House Judiciary Committee has compromised the identities of up to 150 Department of Justice employees , reports TPMMuckraker Friday .
By launching the " Write Congress to Right Justice " campaign back in June , the Committee sought to give employees an avenue to report politicization within the Department , without fear of retaliation , in the wake of the U.S. Attorney firing scandal .
While anonymous tips were not allowed , confidentiality was assured to all who requested it .
In a mass Friday e-mail sent to all parties who submitted tips or complaints , the recipients ' addresses were left visible , and the message was copied to the Vice President .
An attempt at recalling the message revealed the addresses again .
TPMMuckraker has more .
While the Democratic and Republican candidates for president blather on about non-issues like who will be meaner to immigrants , who will use the most water on torture victims , who wanted to be president at the youngest age , who ’s the best Christian and other such nonsense , and while Congress and the president dance their meaningless dance of pretend conflict , let ’s for a moment ponder something more momentous .
What if the US just packed up and left Iraq and Afghanistan , and brought the troops all home , shut down the 750 - odd overseas bases we operate around the globe , and slashed our military budget by 75 percent ?
That would be an instant savings of roughly $ 365 billion per year .
Now , the first thing we need to do is address the criticism that such an action would be abandoning the people of Afghanistan and Iraq , whose countries we have been systematically destroying for the last four to six years .
Okay .
I agree we have an obligation here .
So let ’s allocate say $ 50 billion in annual aid to those two countries , to be funneled through international aid organizations , from the U.N. to CARE and the Red Cross / Red Crescent .
That still leaves $ 315 billion in funds to play with .
We also have to address those who will ask fearfully if we are n’t opening ourselves to attack from our many enemies abroad .
But hold on a minute .
If we cut the US military budget down to a paltry $ 115 billion a year , that would still leave us with by far the largest military budget in the entire world .
The next biggest spender on its military is China , at $ 62.5 billion , followed by Russia , at $ 62 billion .
That is to say , our military budget , if slashed by three quarters , would still be about equal to Russia ’s and China ’s military budgets combined .
And that only tells part of the story .
Most of China ’s army is a repressive police force , required to keep order in what is a widely despised dictatorship , and would never be available for foreign adventures .
( That ’s why China , with a million or more soldiers , has n’t ever invaded Taiwan , with a population of just 23 million .
The army China could spare for an invasion would probably be no larger than the one little Taiwan could field to defend itself . )
The same can be said for Russia , which is eternally in danger of splitting apart into myriad smaller states , and has to be held together by threat of force .
Figuring that neither China nor Russia is likely to attack us anyway , given that one needs us to buy all the junk they make , and the other needs us to buy their oil , maybe we should look at those “ axis of evil ” states and their ilk , that might think we ’re easy pickin’s if we were to slash our military spending .
Well , maybe not .
It turns out if you add up all the military budgets of America ’s other “ major ” enemies — those so - called “ rogue ” states like Cuba , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Sudan and Syria — and throw in a few extra possible hostiles for good measure like Myanmar , Somalia and , oh , what the heck , Grenada ( you never know when that troublesome little island might have another revolution ! ) , it comes to a grand total of $ 15 billion spent on military stuff .
That ’s less than one - seventh of what we ’d still be spending .
And of course we would n’t be alone .
Our allies — Britain , Germany , France , Japan , Israel , Holland , Canada , Italy , Australia , South Korea and Spain for example , though there are surely more who would come to our aid in a crisis — collectively spend another $ 258 billion on their militaries ( and yet even today we have our military based in many of those countries .
Go figure ! ) .
So we would hardly be at anybody ’s mercy .
We could even take a few billion of that $ 115 military budget and shift it productively from our huge and useless strategic nuclear program ( you know , the one that just lost six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles for 36 hours , and flew them across the country , unprotected and unnoticed ) over to operations like border patrol , satellite monitoring , and the Coast Guard , where it might actually help protect us , instead of just funding futuristic weapons that will never be used for anything but helping generals justify their stars by having units to command .
So here we would be with still , by a factor of two , the largest and most advanced military in the world , but at peace and with $ 315 billion a year suddenly freed up and at our disposal .
What might we do with all that money ?
Well , for starters , if we accept for argument ’s sake that the Social Security System is running at a deficit and will eventually be defunded ( which , by the way , I do not for a minute believe ) , actuaries say that injecting about $ 130 billion a year into the fund ( the equivalent of increasing everyone ’s SSI payroll tax by 2 percent ) would solve the alleged problem indefinitely , allowing all current and future Americans to count on an inflation - adjusted secure retirement forever .
So let ’s do that .
Then there ’s education .
Currently , the federal government spends about $ 58 billion a year on education .
That gives us classroom sizes in our cities of 30 - 35 kids ( 40 here in Philadelphia ) .
That ’s not education — that ’s child abuse ( and teacher abuse ) .
So what say we boost that amount by 50 percent — a much better educational reform than a lot of stupid “ No Child Left Behind ” testing regimens .
Then there ’s healthcare , on which the government spends a paltry $ 52 billion , leaving us with declining life expectancies and infant mortality rates , particularly among our poorest citizens , that are a scandal .
Let ’s boost that spending by 50 percent , too .
Geez !
We still have another $ 130 billion left !
The federal government right now only spends some $ 40 billion a year on science , energy and the environment .
That includes nuclear power and waste containment , and the entire NASA budget .
Given the global climate change disaster we ’re facing , we should probably double that , with the added $ 40 billion going all to environmental research , do n’t you think ?
Now we ’re left with $ 90 billion .
Well , it turns out that ’s about what the government spends on “ social programs . ”
You know , like welfare — the thing that we were supposedly ending ?
Truth is , of course , that over the last decade , the number of poor people and hungry people in the US has been rising , not falling , so maybe we should rethink that “ ending welfare as we know it ” mantra , and start thinking about improving the lives of those at the bottom of the ladder .
That extra $ 90 billion , by doubling social programs — especially if it was spent on housing and job creation — would go a long way towards making America a better place for all .
It would also reduce crime significantly , meaning we ’d have a whole lot of money freed up that currently goes to police and prisons , so we could spent that money on other good stuff too .
So who ’s going to make this eminently sensible proposal ?
I ’m frankly sick to death of hearing about how “ tough ” our next president is going to be .
Our current president has shown just what being tough is good for : nothing .
The country is less safe , we ’ve got 80,000 returned soldiers suffering from life - long injuries , we ’ve made enemies out of friends all over the world , and this country ’s been going down the tube , with joblessness rising , the economy teetering and the once mighty dollar headed for Third World currency status .
Until I hear political candidates start talking about slashing military spending — and I mean on the order of 75 percent , none of this nickel - and - dime stuff , and about funding the things that really need funding —
I ’m not even listening to these moronic campaigns .

First off , I like to think that I 'm a cool girl .
I 've got good taste in music , I 'm educated , and I read a lot of books .
I cook , take care of the apartment I share , volunteer , got to lots of shows , and attend college as well as work full time .
I 'm young , very thick , cute , tall , and blonde .
I watch sports and adult swim , and I 'm naturally very easy to get along with .
I 'm not shallow or close - minded .
I value my family , and always find time for my friends .
I do n't do drugs , have stds , or drink anymore , although I do have a cigarette every once in a while .
I 'm well dressed , play a little guitar , always drama free , and am friendly .
and ... I'M SINGLE AND I WISH I WASN'T !!
Seiously , I get asked all the time , " Why do n't you have a boyfriend ? "
Well what am I supposed to say to that ?
I do n't fucking know why I 'm single , I guess things are n't supposed to work out for me just yet .
Now , some would consider the following statement a deal - breaker , but I 'm gonna spill it anyway .
After all , this is MY RANT .
I am promiscuous .
( Wikipedia has a great definition of the word if you 're interested ) .
I like sex .
A lot .
Actually , I love sex .
I have n't been in a real relationship in a very long time , and I miss regular sex ( among other things ) .
I 'm multi-orgasmic , and while I 'm not going to get too into it , I 'm wierd when I 'm not getting a sufficient dose of coitus .
Now granted , while I am on the ADVENTUROUS side , I am no slut .
I think the right guy is out there for me somewhere , but I do n't know where the hell he is , or why I have n't found him yet .
After all , I am still young right ?
I got out of a pretty bad relationship about 8 months ago , and I decided that what ever I was doing to meet men was not working .
A friend of mine met a pretty impressive nsa buddy on Craigslist , and I figured " Well , Try everything once right ? " nope ..
WRONG !
ONCE TURNED INTO ME BECOMING A TOTAL CL CE ADDICT !!
So now , the year is ending , and I am swearing off of craigslist for a while .
But I thought I would visit the rants and raves section to vent a little first .. 34 MEN .
Yes , that 's right , I 've met 34 men off of CL .
No joke .
NO , I have not had sex with all of them , but I could have .
I 've gotten over 3500 responses in the past 6 months , from ads that I have posted , and I have met about 8 from ads that I responded to .
I know most people reading this will think I 'm full of shit , but it 's all true .
I do n't know if I can do them all justice in this little post , but I 'll try my best .
SO NOW ..
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO ..
THE MEN I'VE MET OFF CRAIGSLIST.1 ) ANDREW : You were so nice .
I posted some silly ad about being bored and wanting company , and you thought it would be cool if we painted together or something completely juvenile like that .
You sounded awesome , and we met the same day .
Little did I know that you would turn out to weigh about 100 LBS and look like a cancer patient , but hey , I gave you a shot anyway .
We went grocery shopping together on our date , and you would n't stop talking about your fucking Jetta .
Yes ,
You drove a Jetta , and let me tell you , that 's the way to get the ladies !
Well , you were cool , but I never saw or talked to you again , and was pretty wierded out when you tried to kiss me , but I played it off like the nice girl I am .
You were n't so bad , sorry it did n't work out .
2 ) ADAM :
The only thing I 'm going to say about you is ..
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR PHOTOS RETOUCHED ?
Seriously .
You sent me pics , and I saw Calvin Klein Ads .
You brought yourself , and I saw Kramer from Seinfeld .
What the FUCK ??
yeah , definitely ditched out on your ugly ass .
No way I was letting you buy me a drink , creep.3 ) CURTIS : I found your from one of my " NSA I really just wanna get fucked right now " posts .
I went to your place , and you had the most awesome apartment I had ever seen .
We talked , got to know eachother , then started to mess around .
The minute you put the condom and slid inside me once , you came .
PEACE OUT !
I grabbed my purse , felt like an ass , and walked out .
You running down the stairs half - naked yelling " I can go again ! " was n't enough to make me turn around .
You e-mailed me for weeks to come , no hard feelings man , just clean out the pipes next time BEFORE you invite pretty girls over to fuck .
4 ) CHRIS : I do n't remember what post we met from , but I 'm glad I found you either way .
We had the greatest friendship ever , and the best sex .
I loved you , and you loved me , even though we would have never worked together .
You would always tell me that I gave the best head in the world , and had the prettiest face you 'd ever seen .
You were selfish , and was always petrified that I was sleeping with other men , and you knew I was .
I tried to get you to devote a tiny part of yourself to me , but you would never commit , and that hurt .
I would have given you my all if you had asked for it .
We used to fight , but it never mattered because I could never stay mad at you .
When you moved to Canada , I could n't say goodbye to you and we have n't spoken since .
5 ) ROGER : MY GOD YOU WERE AMAZING .
I think I went crazy over you the minute we met .
First off , you were too cool .
You wore Seven Jeans , smelled like a shower , and had eyes like the sunrise .
Your smile would n't quit .
The first time we met , you took me to my favorite coffee shop , and we talked for hours .

I wanted to laugh just listening to you and your ridiculous little gay laugh , but I thought we could be friends at least .
Well , when I went to your apartment and you locked the door behind me , I freaked out .
The minute you went to the bathroom , I scrambled to the door , struggled with the lock , then ran out like the fucking house was on fire , jumped over your 6 - step stoop , and hit the ground running .
I do n't think I 've ever been more freaked out .

How Shyness Became a Mental Illness |
EVANSTON , Ill . ---
What 's wrong with being shy , and just when and how did bashfulness and other ordinary human behaviors in children and adults become psychiatric disorders treatable with powerful , potentially dangerous drugs , asks a Northwestern University scholar in a new book that already is creating waves in the mental health community .
In " Shyness : How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness " ( Yale University Press , October 2007 ) , Northwestern 's Christopher Lane chronicles the " highly unscientific and often arbitrary way " in which widespread revisions were made to " The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders " ( DSM ) , a publication known as the bible of psychiatry that is consulted daily by insurance companies , courts , prisons and schools as well as by physicians and mental health workers .
" The number of mental disorders that children and adults in the general population might exhibit leaped from 180 in 1968 to more than 350 in 1994 , " notes Lane , Northwestern 's Herman and Beulah Pearce Miller Research Professor .
In a book that calls in doubt the facade of objective research behind psychiatry 's revolution , Lane questions the rationale for the changes , and whether all of them were necessary and suitably precise .
By labeling shyness and other human traits as dysfunctions with a biological cause , the doors were opened wide to a pharmaceutical industry ready to provide a pill for every alleged chemical imbalance or biological problem , he adds .
Lane , who meticulously and systematically researched the archives of the American Psychiatric Association , uses social anxiety disorder ( first dubbed social phobia ) as the lens through which to analyze American psychiatry 's extraordinary shift in the last 30 years from a psychoanalytic orientation relying on talk therapy to its current emphasis on neuroscience and drugs .
He draws on previously neglected letters and memos written by the framers of the new disorders to argue that DSM revisions to social phobia or social anxiety disorder placed the diagnostic bar too low , turning social anxiety into a mental illness common enough to be considered , according to recent studies , third only to alcoholism and major depression .
The DSM continues to stipulate that social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) must be " impairing " for a diagnosis to occur .
The problem , Lane argues , is that DSM - defined symptoms of impairment in 1980 included fear of eating alone in restaurants , concern about hand trembling while writing checks , fear of public speaking and avoidance of public restrooms .
By 1987 the DSM had removed the key phrase " a compelling desire to avoid , " requiring instead only " marked distress , " and signs of that could include concern about saying the wrong thing .
" Impairment became something largely in the eye of the beholder , and anticipated embarrassment was enough to meet the diagnostic threshold , " says Lane .
" That 's a ridiculous way to assess a serious mental disorder , with implications for the way we also view childhood traits and development , given the increased focus on reticence , " Lane adds .
" But that did n't stop SAD from becoming what Psychology Today dubbed ' the disorder of the 1990s . ' "
In addition to providing extensive documentation from the American Psychiatric Association archives , Lane includes previously confidential material from the drug companies themselves that present a worrisome history of the antidepressant Paxil .
The drug came onto the marketplace in 1996 despite the fact that its makers earlier had considered shelving it because of poor performance and early signs of side effects in clinical trials .
Using a memo circulated among drug company executives , Lane presents evidence that a lot of information about the drug 's poor track record was withheld from the public .
When Paxil became the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in 1999 , however , its makers launched a $ 92 million awareness campaign on the theme " Imagine Being Allergic to People . "
This and other advertising campaigns helped change the way Americans think about anxiety and its treatment .
" Every marketer 's dream is to find an unidentified or unknown market and develop it .
That 's what we were able to do with social anxiety disorder , " a product director for the drug told Advertising Age magazine .
In 2001 , with 25 million new prescriptions written for Paxil , the drug's U.S. sales alone increased by 18 percent from the year before .
Although psychiatrists insist that the line between ordinary shyness and social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) is sharply defined , Lane points to psychiatric literature that repeatedly confuses them , putting patients at risk of over - diagnosis and unnecessary , sometimes harmful treatment .
A professor of English in Northwestern 's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences , Lane previously directed a psychoanalytic studies program in Emory University 's psychiatry department .
Long interested in psychology , he presents evidence of a burgeoning backlash to psychiatry 's current trends in the form of analyses of novels including " The Corrections " by Jonathan Franzen and " The Diagnosis " by Alan Lightman , as well as the film " Garden State " by Zach Braff .
Lane , who was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study psychopharmacology and ethics , audited medical courses and invited psychiatrists and pharmacologists to review his book , particularly a chapter on rebound syndrome .
That term refers to a boomerang effect experienced by some patients on discontinuing Paxil that is more intense and dangerous than the turmoil that caused them to take the drug in the first place .
In examining the American Psychiatric Association archives , Lane -- who argues that psychiatry is using drugs with poor track records to treat growing numbers of normal human emotions -- even came across a proposal to establish " chronic complaint disorder , " in which people moan about the weather , taxes or the previous night 's racetrack results .
" It might be funny , " he says , save for the fact that the DSM 's next edition , due to be completed in 2012 , is likely to establish new categories for apathy , compulsive buying , Internet addiction , binge - eating and compulsive sexual behavior .
Do n't look for road rage , however .
It 's already in the DSM , under intermittent explosive disorder .

A while back , Forbes Magazine ranked the richest Americans through history using 2006 US dollars weighted against historic GDP at the height of each individual 's wealth .
On the day of his death during his 83rd year in January of 1877 , shipping and railroad titan Cornelius Vanderbilt was worth $ 105 million in 1877 dollars .
According to the Forbes analysis , to control the same percentage of GDP that Vanderbilt controlled in 1877 one hundred and twenty nine years later in 2006 , one would have needed to possess wealth in the amount of $ 168.4 billion .
Forbes in turn pegged the 2006 net worth of Bill Gates at $ 53 billion .
In the spirit of the Rockefeller family , Andrew Carnegie , and others before him , Gates has famously and commendably put more than $ 28 billion into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
This foundation focuses on bringing initiatives in health and education to the global community .
This past June , Warren Buffett announced that he would eventually give away 85 percent of his fortune — about $ 37.4 billion worth of stock in Berkshire Hathaway — to five charitable foundations , with about $ 31 billion going to the Gates Foundation .
Although in his day he possessed more than three times the wealth of Bill Gates and approximately four times the wealth of Buffet , Cornelius Vanderbilt was never so generous .
Indeed , he was not generous at all .
In researching my new biography Commodore : The Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt ( Basic / Perseus ) , I found Vanderbilt to be the personification of the ultimate economic man as drawn by Charles Dickens in the form of Ebenezer Scrooge during the 1840s .
No cult of charity claimed Vanderbilt ; no temptation toward beneficence beckoned .
Once , when asked to give aid to people standing on a line for a distribution of free food , he noted his own impoverished beginning on Staten Island and , without a hint of irony , said : " Let them do what I have done . "
Not long after this , in an editorial for Packard 's Monthly , Mark Twain admonished Vanderbilt to " go and do something [ that will ] shine as one solitary grain of pure gold upon the heaped rubbish of your life .
...
Go , boldly , grandly , nobly , and give four dollars to some great public charity . "
In his parsimoniousness , Vanderbilt was a creature of his times : an era of institutionalized harshness .
During 1817 , when the already - prosperous Vanderbilt was just 23 , a group of prominent New York merchants and professionals ( many of them having formerly been the principle supports of such institutions as the New York Hospital and a variety of other worthy causes ) officially and quite publicly began to rethink their habit of giving .
Such previously generous philanthropists as DeWitt Clinton , Thomas Eddy , and John Griscom took their cue in this from British reactionaries .
In so doing , they succumbed to the rhetoric of several hard - nosed British social thinkers , most notably Thomas Robert Malthus , Jeremy Bentham , and the Scottish conservative Patrick Colquhoun .
Twenty years earlier , all three of those gentleman had been instrumental in the founding of the London Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor .
Despite the burden of its long - winded name , the London Society specialized in the cutting off of funds for social welfare rather than the distribution of charity .
Men like Malthus , Bentham and Colquhoun believed that a distinct line must be drawn between the " deserving poor " ( those hit with hard times resulting from unfortunate histories ) and " undeserving paupers , " the latter being the drunk , lazy and whorish of society , to whom the provision of any form of aid was a reprehensible act of facilitation .
Another key concept underpinning the logic of the London Society was the presumption ( for lack of a more accurate term ) that paupers outnumbered the deserving poor by a factor of about 9 to 1 .
In reform meetings and from church pulpits , politicians and clerics again and again cited this astonishing though unverifiable statistic , which soon became accepted as fact .
In time , the public mind became convinced that a mere ten percent of London 's poor were the crippled and the orphaned , while 90 percent were degenerates .
For every one individual in London 's slums who genuinely needed aid , popular wisdom held that there were nine who required something else entirely : intolerance , punishment and correction .
As a corollary to this line of thinking , logic dictated that 90 % of the charitable aid previously offered was superfluous .
In turn , wallets closed , and checks stopped being written .
The London Society remained a venerable body and dominant force in British life for decades : influential in the development of such institutions as workhouses and debtors prisons .
It was likewise influential , through its example , in New York and other American cities .
By the end of 1817 , Clinton , Eddy , and Griscom , joined by hundreds of other New Yorkers , had formed a clone organization on the banks of the Hudson : the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism ( SPP ) .
Several months before the founding of the SPP , New York 's Humane Society ( which at that time specialized in helping humans rather than dogs and cats ) announced rather forlornly the result of recent research revealing a startling fact : no less than 15,000 men , women and children - the equivalent of one - seventh of the city 's total population - had been " supported by public or private bounty and munificence " the previous winter .
In their book Gotham , historians Edwin Burrows and Mike Wallace have eloquently described the SPP 's point of view , expressed in response to the above data .
In the grand tradition of the London Society , the SPP said it believed that " willy - nilly benevolence " only made things worse .
" Giving alms to the undeserving poor not only undermined their independence but also drove up taxes and sapped the prosperity of the entire community . "
Thus , " for their good as well as everyone else 's … the SPP recommended that all paupers in the city be cut off from all public assistance forthwith . "
Soon the Humane Society itself announced its intention to disband , in the wake of its realization that the very act of giving charity had " a direct tendency to beget , among [ the citizenry ] habits of imprudence , indolence , dissipation and consequent pauperism . "
" Tough love " was in .
Cruelty equaled kindness .
Frugality equality generosity .
And all three were not only cheap , but easy .
A few ministers sang out against the reverse - logic of the SPP , but far more praised the organization than damned it .
God himself , it seemed was on the side of self - reliance .
A generation later , Social Darwinists would express a similar point of view : that the strong must be allowed to flourish , and not be hamstrung by the needs of the clawing weak .
Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species would not see print until 1859 .
Indeed , Darwin himself was but eight years old in 1817 , and would not depart on the voyage of HMS Beagle until 1831 .
Nevertheless , the seeds of what was to become the philosophy of Herbert Spencer ( born 1820 ) , not to mention the nearly identical philosophy of the 20th century 's Objectivist saint of selfishness , Ayn Rand , were quite evident in the grand pronouncements of the London Society and its New York equivalent , the SPP .
A few notable men of New York , such as John Jacob Astor and the young Peter Cooper , repudiated the SPP , ignored the trend toward avarice , and continued their philanthropy , even expanding it in many areas to try to make up for some of the rapacity of their contemporaries .
But Vanderbilt did not .
Only very late in life , in efforts to please his much younger second wife , ( Frank Crawford Vanderbilt , whom he married in 1869 ) , did " the Commodore " engage in two relatively paltry acts of giving .
During 1870 , Vanderbilt spent $ 50,000 to purchase the unused Mercer Street Presbyterian Church in Manhattan .
In turn , he gave life interest in the property to Frank 's friend Charles Force Deems , a Methodist cleric and proprietor of a congregation he had dubbed the Church of the Strangers .
( The church catered to people like Frank : former Confederates who , having lost everything during the Civil War , washed ashore as " strangers " in New York . )
According to the terms of Vanderbilt 's limited gift to Deems , control of the property was to revert to Vanderbilt or his heirs / assignees following Deems 's death .
The deed on the property , which Vanderbilt knew would appreciate greatly in value through the years , always remained in the name of Cornelius Vanderbilt .
Several years later , at the request of Nashville 's Methodist Bishop Holland McTyeire ( a cousin - in - law of Frank's ) , Vanderbilt provided $ 1 million ( less than 1 % of his total net worth ) to fund Nashville 's planned Methodist " Central University , " subsequently renamed Vanderbilt University .
Although he did not bother to attend the dedication ceremonies during the autumn of 1875 , Vanderbilt 's gift was nevertheless hailed as the largest single act of philanthropy in American history to that time .
Attention to the fine print , however , revealed that a substantial percentage of the $ 1 million endowment was , by Vanderbiltian order , to be kept in the first mortgage bonds of Vanderbilt 's own New York Central & Hudson River Railroad .
Thus , as with the church on Mercer Street , Vanderbilt 's charity was hardly outright .
Not long before his death , Vanderbilt confided to one of his doctors that he had been " insane on the subject of money - making " all his life .
Subsequently , in devising a will which gave more than 95 % of his fortune to just one of his eleven surviving children , Vanderbilt said he intended to keep his property " compact ... I will not have it scattered .
I will leave it as a monument to my name . "
Thus he left behind him the legacy he most coveted : a vast hoard of stocks , bonds , greenbacks and railroads , but next to nothing in the way of good works or improvement of society .
Luckily for the planet and mankind , contemporary moguls such as Gates and Buffet have chosen to leave something more .
RIP down the traffic signs , throw them out and erase the road markings - it does n't seem the logical way to improve road safety .
But Bendigo City Council , in Victoria , has decided to do just that , and follow a revolutionary overseas trend in urban design that planners say saves lives , improves health and creates better communities .
The council will today unveil a $ 16 million makeover of its city centre , coined " naked streets " by commentators .
It will radically alter the city centre by narrowing spaces for cars and returning the town 's wide streets to walkers and cyclists .
A Toronto - led team of researchers has found a way to use stem cells derived from skin to treat spinal cord injuries in rats .
The finding lends promise to the idea that stem cells could one day be used to heal spinal cord injuries in humans , helping thousands of Canadians to walk again .
Injured rats injected with skin - derived stem cells regained mobility and had better walking co-ordination , according to the study published yesterday in the Journal of Neuroscience .
The skin - derived stem cells , injected directly into the injured rats ' spinal cords , were able to survive in their new location and set off a flurry of activity , helping to heal the cavity in the cord .
Freda Miller , a senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children and lead author of the study , said skin - derived stem cells have some advantages over other stem cell types .
Scientists who use skin to generate stem cells do not need to use embryos , for example , and skin - derived stem cells can potentially be harvested from patients themselves , she said .
" You can imagine a scenario for people with spinal cord injuries , that maybe , just maybe , we could take a piece of their skin , grow the cells up and transplant them ( the patient ) with their own cells , " she said .
" You would n't have to give them immunosuppressive drugs .
That 's a tremendous clinical advantage if it comes true . "
Miller and her colleagues from The Hospital for Sick Children and the University of British Columbia have been exploring the possibilities of using skin to derive stem cells since 2001 .
Over the course of their research , the team found that skin - derived stem cells share characteristics with embryonic neural stem cells , which generate the nervous system .
They also showed skin - derived stem cells can produce Schwann cells , a cell type that creates a good growth environment to repair injured central nervous system axons – the long nerve cell fibres that conduct electrical impulses between nerves – and that these Schwann cells put down myelin along the injured spinal cord .
Like the insulation around an electrical cord , myelin wraps around nerves , creating a sheath that helps quickly conduct nerve impulses .
Miller said the next step was to see whether transplanting the Schwann cells directly into spinal cords would help treat injured rats .
To test their hypothesis , Miller and her team generated stem cells from the skin of rats and mice and forced them to differentiate into Schwann cells , which were then transplanted into the rats .
After 12 weeks , the rats were able to walk better , with more co-ordination .
Miller said the cells thrived within the injured spinal cord .
Before treatment , the injured rats had a cavity in their spinal cord , a result of their injury .
But after treatment , Miller said the Schwann cells had created a bridge that spanned the cavity , and helped nerves grow through the bridge .
The next step is to see whether stem cells derived from human skin can produce similar results .
" We are highly encouraged , " said Miller .
Danny O'Brien of the EFF says ,
Newsweek is reporting that companies like AT&T , working with the White House are using their money to push for blanket retroactive immunity for their involvement in the administration 's warrantless wiretapping schemes :
But critics say the language proposed by the White House–drafted in close cooperation with the industry officials –is so extraordinarily broad that it would provide retroactive immunity for all past telecom actions related to the surveillance program .
Its practical effect , they argue , would be to shut down any independent judicial or state inquires into how the companies have assisted the government in eavesdropping on the telephone calls and e-mails of U.S. residents in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks .
The plan is to kill by fiat the court case the EFF is running against these phone companies .
What 's weird is the Democrats appear to be going along with this , even though it would effectively cover up the Bush administration 's past crimes .
As Glenn Greenwald writes in Salon , quoting a New York Times piece :
Democratic Congressional aides say they believe that a deal is likely to provide protection for the companies .
If you think that the Democrats should stand up to AT&T 's lobbyists , you can call them now :
Call Rep. Nancy Pelosi – 202-225-4965
Call Sen. Harry Reid – 202-224-3542

The Bush White House hosted its first white tie dinner for the Queen
I have seen George Bush fumble for grammar , cringe in front of the cameras and shrug off insults from world leaders .
I have seen him joust gamely with opponents and stare down enemies with a cold eye .
But I have never , ever seen the commander - in - chief of the mightiest nation on earth look utterly terrified .
This week an elderly lady , who is at least a head smaller than the president and who , by all accounts , has never harmed a fly , achieved - unwittingly - what Osama Bin Laden , Saddam Hussein and Nancy Pelosi have all tried and failed to do : reduce George Walker Bush to a quivering mass , make his lower lip tremble and - I promise you I saw it with my own eyes - make him blush to the roots of his Texan rind .
Yes , the 43rd President of the United States was smitten by her Britannic Majesty , Queen Elizabeth II .
Memorable gaffe
The endearing thing about George Bush is that his body language and the spoken variety both betray his true emotions at every turn .
At Monday night 's state dinner , the first white tie event in the Bush White House , a pair of lacquered black shoes could be seen virtually tap dancing with jitters on the red carpet next to the royal footwear .
Her Majesty was not amused by President Bush 's gaffe - and wink
Then there was George Bush 's hesitant " should I sit or should I stand " toast which left the Queen on her feet , sipping her Riesling all by herself .
The most memorable gaffe had been committed earlier that day , when the president almost implied that the Queen was 200 years older than her current age by thanking her for attending America 's bicentennial celebrations in 1776 .
He corrected himself mid-date , then did what he often does in sticky circumstances .
He winked , smiled and lunged for recovery .
The Queen was heard to mutter : " Wrong year ! "
The president responded with disarming honesty .
The Queen had given him " a look that only a mother could give a child " he told his guests and the world , under a glorious Washington May sky .
Call me churlish , but I thought this was a charming escape from Royal Protocol Armageddon .
To my knowledge no reigning Queen of England had ever been winked at .
The first Elizabeth would surely have had George Bush 's guts for garters .
This one responded with dead - pan aloofness .
Her Majesty was not amused .
There was n't even a flicker of a smile and the stiff upper lip of the House of Windsor remained resolutely stiff in the land of the free .
Shared ancestry
If I may take the presumptuous role of presidential shrink for a moment , I would say there are three reasons for George Bush 's quivers .
Does the Queen remind Mr Bush of another matriarch in his life ?
It is not royalty per se that makes American presidents nervous .
It is British royalty .
For all the loathing of the Red Coats , Mad King George and British colonial rule , America feels the Stockholm syndrome of its ancestry .
Even an abused child sent for adoption is fascinated by his or her real mother .
Secondly the Queen probably reminds George Bush of his own Mama , the formidable Barbara , the matriarch of the Bush clan , who apparently raised her eldest son with a patrician mixture of love and discipline .
He may argue with his father over Iraq and diplomacy .
They have a vexed relationship .
But , I 'm told , it is the mother he cherishes and dares not contradict .
Britain is to history what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil .
We have lashings of it and do n't feel the need to draw attention to it
The third point is a more general one about the role of Britain 's history in the United States .
Americans nurture their historical shoots like a gardener fusses over a sapling .
In Virginia , where the rich earth moans with the memories of the civil war , the war of independence and the lives of the founding fathers , every brick and beam dating back a hundred years or more is festooned with a plaque .
History is such a precious commodity because it is so rare in a young nation .
By comparison Britain is to history what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil .
We have lashings of it and do n't feel the need to draw attention to it .
Americans are proud of their young nation 's relatively short history
Despite lattes and paninis , suicide bombs in London and the foreign takeover of English football , Britain lives , breathes and governs unselfconsciously in a historical context .
Which American politician does n't at some stage enlist the help of the founding fathers or invoke the American dream enshrined in the Bill of Rights ?
Which British politician ever mentions the Magna Carta ?
For Americans , the Queen and her pageantry embody an exotic reality tinged with a whiff of shared ancestry .
It is a matter of affection mixed with curiosity verging , sometimes , on incomprehension .
It is the same attitude found when Washington grandees munch cucumber sandwiches on the British ambassador 's lawn and are too polite to ask about the missing crust .

Arithmetic gives us tools to smoosh , slide and stretch numbers .
These transformations are handy : sometimes there ’s things in the real world we want to smoosh , slide and stretch in the same way .
Why ’s this important ?
Seeing arithmetic as a type of transformation prepares you to make sense of seemingly - weird concepts , like the square root of - 1 , and visualize problems in a new way .
Let ’s take a look .
Addition
Addition is simple , yet it can mean several things :
Accumulate : Count up similar quantities ( often for tangible items ) .
: Count up similar quantities ( often for tangible items ) .
Slide :
Shifting a number along a scale ( for less tangible things , like temperature ) .
: Shifting a number along a scale ( for less tangible things , like temperature ) .
Combine : Make a new quantity out of two different ones ( like notes in a music chord ) .
What ’s the right meaning ?
It depends on the context .
When adding apples , we count up similar items ( 3 apples + 4 apples = 7 apples ) .
When measuring temperature , we add heat to move along a scale ( 3 degrees + 4 degrees = 7 degrees ) .
When adding vectors , a combination makes the most sense : 3 blocks east + 4 blocks north = 5 blocks in a new direction ( “ as the crow flies ” distance ) .
In this case , you must track the component parts , keeping “ North ” and “ East ” separate .
When adding apples , you can combine everything : once you have 7 , you do n’t care that it was once 3 and 4 .
A single operation ( addition ) can take on several intuitive meanings .
This list is n’t exhaustive — they are the interactions I ’ve noticed , and I ’m sure you have others .
Multiplication
Multiplication can also be interpreted in several ways :
Repetition : Performing multiple additions .
: Performing multiple additions .
Scaling : Making a number grow or shrink all at once .
Context determines our meaning .
With apples , “ 4 x ” means turning an order of 2 apples into an order of 8 ( 4 groups of 2 ) .
With photo software , “ 4 x ” means expanding a 2 - inch photo to be 8 inches long .
Each meaning is different : you ’d be annoyed if I gave you a giant , 5 - lb apple or 4 separate photos .
In a narrow sense , multiplication is “ repeated addition ” .
Sure .
But that ’s not always the easiest interpretation — care to “ repeatedly add ” 7.3 times ?
Negatives and Inverses
Negatives and inverses both represent the idea of “ reverse ” or “ opposite ” .
But that ’s ambiguous :
What ’s the opposite of multiplying by two ?
“ Opposite ” can mean a few things :
Multiply by 1/2 : Turn a profit of 1 into a profit of 1/2 ( “ unscale ” it )
: Turn a profit of 1 into a profit of 1/2 ( “ unscale ” it ) Multiply by - 2 : Turn a profit of 1 into a loss of 2 ( flip it )
Yet again , our context determines meaning .
When a company “ reverses a gain ” it implies a loss , aka multiplying by a negative .
When we “ reverse a zoom ” in photo software , we want to shrink the photo ( not mirror - image it ) , so we multiply by 1/ 2 .
Context , context , context ( tired of that word yet ? ) .
When adding , there ’s only one type of opposite : the reverse of +8 is - 8 .
But the trick is to know that - 8 really means “ 0 - 8 ″ or even “ 0 + ( - 8 ) ” : you ’re moving backwards relative to some reference point .
Moving “ in reverse ” means different things depending if your original direction was East or North .
What ’s in an equation ?
Equations ask questions .
When you see
It ’s more than just a plug and chug problem .
Think about the question like this :
What transformation ( “ times x ” ) , when applied twice , will turn 1 into 9 ?
We have two answers :
Scale by 3 ( times 3 ) :
Do it twice and you ’ll get 9 : 1 * 3 * 3 = 9
: Do it twice and you ’ll get 9 : 1 * 3 * 3 = 9 Scale by 3 and flip ( times - 3 ) : Done twice , you get 9 also : 1 * - 3 * - 3 = 9
Nifty .
I included “ 1 ″ to show what is being transformed .
Sure , it ’s optional , but it ’s not something we think about .
What is the “ times 3 ″ acting on ?
Stepping back this way , we can see arithmetic as a method to push , pull , tug and squeeze one number into another .
We ’ve managed to turn one large transformation ( “ times 9 ″ ) into two equal , smaller ones ( “ times - 3 ″ or “ times 3 ″ ) .
Real - World Example : Random Numbers
Enough theory — let ’s show this mindset in action .
Most programming languages offer a random ( ) function that gives a number from 0 to 1 .
But what if you want something from 5 - 10 ?
The question is : how do I transform my range of 0 - 1 into a range from 5 - 10 ?
Arithmetic to the rescue !
First , you stretch 0 - 1 into 0 - 5 by multiplying by 5
0 - 1 into 0 - 5 by multiplying by 5 Next , slide 0 - 5 to 5 - 10 by adding 5
0 - 5 to 5 - 10 by adding 5 And tada .
You have a range from 5 - 10 .
Try it out below .
You start with a number “ r ” and transform it into the proper range .
By the way , this range could be the ages 18 - 65 , the years 1960 - 2007 , or the temperatures 30 F – 80 F for use in your simulation ( everyone runs simulations , right ? ) .
No matter your range , you can start with the “ 0 to 1 ″ building block and modify it .
Sure , you can figure this out without a diagram , but sometimes it ’s nice to visualize what ’s happening .
Our brain is a vision - processing supercomputer , so let ’s use its strengths .
What ’s next ?
This post introduces the idea that arithmetic is a transformation .
You bend numbers into other ones , and each transformation has a meaning .
Some fit a situation better than others : use the one you like most .
The goal is n’t to turn multiplication into a cumbersome diagramming process .
It ’s a technique , a mindset , a new weapon to use against seemingly complex operations .
When studying linear algebra ( matrices ) , you can view multiplication as a type of transformation ( scaling , rotating , skewing ) , instead of a bunch of operations that change a matrix around .
This approach will help when we cover imaginary numbers , that foul beast which has befuddled many students .

The Australian : A Saudi prisoner died at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp today , apparently the fourth person to commit suicide at the controversial US enclave in southeastern Cuba .
" The detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards .
The detainee was pronounced dead by a physician after all lifesaving measures had been exhausted , " the US military 's Southern Command said in a statement .[.. ]
It said a cultural adviser was assisting the military to ensure that the remains were handled in a culturally sensitive and religiously appropriate manner .
Faced with mounting calls at home and abroad for the camp to be shut down , SouthCom insisted that " the mission of detention and interrogation at Guantanamo continues . " [..]
Human rights groups say there have been dozens more suicide attempts by detainees , many of whom are held in isolation .
The investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government , Mubadala Development , announced on Friday it has purchased an 8.1 percent stake in the world 's second largest chipmaker , AMD .
The deal , which includes a $ 622 million cash infusion for AMD in exchange for about 49 million company shares , makes Abu Dhabi one of the company 's largest shareholders .
According to the Wall Street Journal , Mubadala will not gain any special access to the boardroom as a part of the deal , and the company itself stressed that the transaction does not present a controlling investment … or an acquisition .
That said , Mubadala seems to be increasingly interested in partnering with ( and investing in ) a variety of tech companies across the globe as of late .
Flush with oil money , the company recently announced a partnership with Northrop Grumman to develop aerospace and aviation training programs earlier this week .
The company also happens to have a 7.5 percent stake in the Carlyle Group , a private equity firm specializing in aerospace , defense and high - tech investments .
Indeed , the $ 622 million comes just in time for AMD , which has struggled financially over the past few quarters due to an going price slashing contest with its larger rival Intel .
Most recently , in Q3 , the company posted a $ 396 million loss despite an uptick in sales .
AMD chief Hector Ruiz says the company will use the money primarily on future research and development , ( AMD relies heavily on an IBM partnership for its R&D ) , as well as product innovations and manufacturing improvements .
As we recently noted , Intel spent more on research and development last year ( $ 5.87 billion ) than AMD 's entire annual revenue stream ( $ 5.65 billion ) .

China is planning to tighten punishments for sex- selective abortions amid concerns that its widening gender imbalance will lead to wife trafficking , sexual crimes and social frustration .
Shocking new figures released by the state media show that the worst affected city , Lianyungang in Jiangsu province , has a ratio of 165 boys to 100 girls among children aged one to four .
Nationwide , six males are born for every five females , far above the international average .
With the gap growing every year as a result of increased access to ultrasound sex- checking technology , one senior official warned that China faces the ' most serious gender imbalance in the world ' .
There has been alarm for more than a decade , but it has reached a new pitch in recent months as state demographers forecast that 37 million men will be unable to find wives by 2020 .
Already there are 18 million more men than women of marriageable age .
In a recent survey by the China Youth Daily , 85 per cent of respondents were worried about the implications of the gender gap .
The main reason for the imbalance is a traditional preference for boys , particularly in the countryside .
Males are considered better at carrying on the family line , caring for elderly parents and earning money .
Many farmers believe that raising a girl baby is a waste because she will marry into another family .
China 's problem is compounded by a strict family planning policy that limits many couples to one child .
The government credits these restrictions for preventing 400 million births since the rules were introduced in 1979 .
Without them , it says the world 's largest population - now 1.3 billion - would have spiralled out of control .
But the result is an increasingly lopsided demography .
In the past , unwanted girls were abandoned .
Now they are more likely to be aborted .
As China has become wealthier , more couples have access to ultrasound checks .
Although there are two laws banning doctors from telling pregnant women the sex of the foetus , the practice is common .
Local media report that one common way around the regulations is for doctors silently to give a thumbs - up if the foetus is a boy .
If it is a girl , a thumbs - down serves as an execution order .
While Lianyungang had the worst imbalance , it was one of 99 cities with a ratio of more than 125 boys for every 100 girls , says the state - run Xinhua news agency .
Citing a report by the China Family Planning Association , it said other provinces with serious problems were Guangdong , Anhui and Hainan .
In Guizhou province , the media have reported the existence of ' bachelor villages ' where most men of eligible age are unable to find a bride .
In cities there has been a rise in commercial matchmaking parties aimed at bachelors , also known as ' guangun ' , or single sticks .
Family planning experts said the imbalance in China far surpassed the ' normal level ' , which they defined as an international average of about 105 boys for every 100 girls .
The authorities have found the gender balance harder to manage than restricting population growth itself .
In 2003 , the government introduced a ' Care for girls ' policy , which provided incentives - such as tax breaks and exemptions from school and health fees - for families raising girls .
It also intensified a propaganda campaign in the countryside , where many buildings are daubed with slogans proclaiming ' Girls are as valuable as boys ' .
Old - style propaganda campaigns are not working , however .
This summer , the government said it will punish for the first time any medical institution that tells couples the sex of unborn babies .
It is also trying to standardise its slogan campaign .
According to the China Daily , out have gone threats such as ' Your house will be demolished and your cows confiscated if you reject abortion demands ' , and in have come sensitive entreaties aimed at raising the status of women , such as ' Both boys and girls are the hearts of their parents ' .
Whether rural parents agree they are equal remains to be seen .
People turned to farming to grow fibre for clothing , and not to provide food , says one researcher who challenges conventional ideas about the origins of agriculture .
Ian Gilligan , a postgraduate researcher from the Australian National University , says his theory also explains why Aboriginal Australians were not generally farmers .
Gilligan says they did not need fibre for clothing , so had no reason to grow fibre crops like cotton .
He argues his case in the current issue of the Bulletin of the Indo - Pacific Prehistory Association " Conventional thinking assumes that the transition to farming was related to people 's need to find new ways of getting food , " says Gilligan .
" That does n't really make sense for a number of reasons .
" Gilligan says it does n't explain why cultivating plants and domesticating animals only started 10,000 years ago in some areas of the world .
He says a better explanation is climate .
He says in the northern hemisphere during the last ice age it was 12 - 15 ºC cooler than today , which led hunters and gatherers to develop sophisticated forms of clothing .
This included tailored and multilayered clothes , including underclothes , to keep out the cold winds , says Gilligan .
Animal hides and furs from hunted animals provided the most suitable warm clothing , he says .
But once the climate warmed , humans wanted lighter and more breathable clothing .
Textiles based on fibre crops such as cotton , linen and hemp and woolly animals like sheep and goats did the job .
At the same time , says Gilligan , clothing became important as a form of display and decoration .
But the story in Australia was different , says Gilligan .
"
In Australia , even in Tasmania , conditions were never so cold that Aboriginal people needed multilayered tailored garments , " he says .
Gilligan says in this most severe environment , temperatures was only about 6 - 8 º C lower than today .
He says Aboriginal people habitually went without clothing and when they did wear something it was simple .
For example , they might have draped a single layered wallaby fur cloak around their shoulders at the height of the last ice age , says Gilligan .
And decorations were made directly on their body .
Gilligan says there was no incentive for Aboriginal people to take up farming because all their needs were met by hunting and gathering .
" The idea that early farming offered humans a more reliable food supply has been exposed as a myth , " he says .
Gilligan says hunting and gathering was a far more flexible , reliable and efficient way of getting food .
" Australian Aborigines never worried where their next meal was coming from , even in the outback , and they enjoyed much more leisure time than any early farmers , " he says .
Professor Lindsay Falvey from the University of Melbourne , whose research interests include agriculture in traditional societies , says Gilligan 's paper is " really important " .
" There 's been a lot of difficulty how we explain the transition from hunting and gathering to farming , " he says .
Falvey , a former dean of agriculture at the university , thinks both clothes and food were important in establishing agriculture , which he sees as a product of co-evolution between humans , plants and animals .
Whatever the origins of agriculture , he welcomes Gilligan 's contribution .
" Keeping the discussion open , like this paper does , is the most important thing , " he says .
The vast majority of my dreams are completely impossible : owning Mars , traveling to the future , writing a book .
So when -- thanks to the magical economics of failed television pilot writing -- I got to buy a house , and that house needed a new bathroom , I was about to realize one of my lifelong dreams : owning a home urinal .
My contractor , obviously , thought this was the best idea anyone had ever come up with , and immediately went shopping with me for a classy , retro porcelain model , the kind you can saunter up to in a tux and slap a highball on .
But then my neighbor , Holly Purcell , a very successful real estate broker , informed me that I absolutely could not install a urinal of any kind if I ever hoped to resell my house .
Noting my confusion , she slowly explained that urinals , to my shock , gross women out .
I spent the next few weeks asking women , many of whom I barely knew , what they thought about urinals .
The results were not good .
First of all , it ’s got an unfortunate name .
Toilets would still be kept outside if they were called crapinals .
Also , my female friends said urinals conjured images of large , impersonal institutions such as prisons .
They felt like the lidlessness was unsanitary .
Basically , what I learned is that women have vastly overestimated the precision of peeing into a toilet bowl while standing up .
When I countered with the clear advantages of the urinal -- toilet seat always down , decreased water use , saved time , ease of cleaning , the option to pour in ice and play the most fun game in the entire world -- the truth came out .
Urinals , these women eventually conceded , are simply too aggressively male .
It is , they explained , like hanging a codpiece over the mantle .
Which , of course , is now my new lifetime dream .

This seemed grossly unfair because there is so much woman stuff in a house .
Such as , for instance , the house .
Looking for some sane , fair advice , I called Jeff Lewis , the OCD - wracked L.A. real estate speculator on Bravo ’s reality show “ Flipping Out . ”
He too advised against my plan .
“ You do n’t want to get too specific with your improvement .
You narrow your market , ” he said .
“ A lot of women would have a problem with it .
They ’d rather have room for something else .
Women love soaking tubs . ”
I told him that there was room in my bathroom for both .
He countered that women do n’t love soaking in a tub near a vat of urine .
It was becoming clear that I should never open a day spa .
Seeing my dream fade away , I did what any mature person does when faced with an uncomfortable reality : Search out someone who will tell you what you want to hear .
But even Michael Carney , the director of Cal Poly Pomona ’s Real Estate Research Council , said that the home urinal was on the same level of bad idea as a bathtub in the middle of the master bedroom or an above - ground hot tub .
People who buy houses , it seems , hate urine and sex .
Finally , Gopal Ahluwalia of the National Assn. of Home Builders , who knows nothing about home urinals , told me to go ahead and do it .
“ Somebody might say they like it .
People like variety .
I do n’t see anything wrong , ” he said .
Advertisement
Which was all I needed .
Plus the Bravo real estate guy said that if I was going to stay in my house for 10 years , I should get a urinal and , when I sell the house , immediately rip it out , cap the pipe and plaster over it .
Better yet , I found out that the 2006 New American Home -- the model house shown at the International Builders Show -- featured a bathroom with a urinal .
Sure , the house was 10,023 square feet and the urinal was above the garage , but still , it was there .
So I was all set to go ahead and get my urinal , but then I developed this weird , postlapsarian shame about it all .
And I ’m more than a little grossed out by my wife , Cassandra , for not being grossed out by the home urinal in the first place .
Still , if that ’s the kind of woman she is , I ’m thinking she ’ll definitely go for the above - ground hot tub .

Alex Russell calls for a return to the browser wars , citing ( among other things ) the stagnancy of the W3C as a part of the problem , with the argument that browser makers are the ones who can innovate and they ’re being prevented from doing so by a slavish insistence on “ standards ” .
Meanwhile , Andy Clarke calls for the current W3C CSS Working Group to be immediately disbanded , Opera file an antitrust complaint against Microsoft , the HTML5 spec removes a recommendation for non-patent - encumbered video formats after pressure from Nokia and Apple , and all the old fights start up again .
Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies .
Rivers and seas boiling .
Forty years of darkness .
Earthquakes , volcanoes .
The dead rising from the grave .
Human sacrifice , dogs and cats living together .
Mass hysteria .
Alex has a point .
There is nothing but truth in the old saw that a camel is a horse designed by committee .
Evolutionary theory tells us that actual forward progress happens faster in small communities , not in big ones .
Browser manufacturer innovation is exemplified by Microsoft creating XMLHttpRequest , which ushered in the shiny world of Ajax ; standards committee “ innovation ” is exemplified by XHTML 2.0 , about which no - one gives a shit .
Forward the innovation .
Let the browser builders off the leash of blind and feverish compliance with “ standards ” made up by committee .
However .
Let us not forget that the problem with the browser wars was n’t that it fragmented the world in lots of different directions .
The problem with the browser wars was that it fragmented the world in lots of different directions that were n’t possible to eventually implement everywhere .
Do n’t think of the output of this “ innovation ” as XMLHttpRequest .
Think of it as the IE filter property , which is , as described on that page , “ not available on the Macintosh platform ” .
For those of you innocent of such things , this allows you , in Internet Explorer , to apply a visual effect to a bit of an HTML page , where that visual effect is actually implemented by DirectX , Microsoft ’s graphics library .
Good luck porting that to Safari if it takes off .
Oh no , hang on , it ’s “ not available on the Macintosh platform ” , even in Mac IE , is it ?
Not that Mac IE exists any more .
The point here is very much the same as the point behind objections to DRM technologies on music .
When browser manufacturers are told “ go ahead and innovate — we want to see progress ” , it ’s jolly difficult for them to not think “ hey , I know , why do n’t we take this opportunity to provide something that we can do and other browsers can ’t ?
Then , when people start using it , we ’ve locked all their users into our browser ! ”
There are corporate executives the world over furiously masturbating themselves into unconsciousness at the very thought of that technique being open to them again .
Perhaps you ’ve bought a few products from their corporations in the past .
Standards bodies are n’t really there to think up ideas , although that ’s what they seem to have evolved into .
They ’re there to say , now , hang on a second , if you do that then what about all the people with no working eyes / some other operating system / touchscreens / no money for patent licences .
They ’re there to make sure that the web , which is meant to be there for everyone , is n’t separated into the haves and the have - nots , where the have - nots is everyone who wo n’t or ca n’t jump on the latest bandwagon .
This is precisely why Silverlight is trying to supplant the web : to divide us into haves and have - nots .
It ’s why Flash is trying to supplant the web : to divide us into haves and have - nots .
It ’s why XUL as an application - development language for web apps was doomed .
It ’s possible that the people Alex is calling on to do “ innovation ” in the browser will put the best interests of the web first , and the best interests of their companies and their browsers second .
It ’s also possible that a duck will fly in the window right now , juggle some lemon pies , and then deliver IE8 , but I do n’t think that that ’s very likely either .
The current mess over the proposed < video > element is a perfect case in point here : Nokia and Apple have refused to contemplate using the suggested Ogg Theora video codec as a baseline format , because they fear submarine patents despite the Theora project ’s assurances .
OK , they may have a point .
However , the HTML5 people have stated , after this pressure from Nokia and Apple , that “ we need a codec that is known to not require per- unit or per- distributor licensing , that is compatible with the open source development model , that is of sufficient quality as to be usable , and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies ” .
It is just not possible for such a codec to exist .
So , what we , the ordinary web developers of the world , are left with is precisely the same cluster - fuck that we currently have when publishing video : it is still not possible for me to make a video and put it on the web with some assurance that everyone can actually see the fucking thing .
How is browser vendors ’ “ innovation ” going to help with this ?
If they were truly “ innovative ” then we ’d see them trying to co-operate on issues like this , because how can it be bad for ordinary web users and web developers to make it easier to publish and watch video ?
Standards organisations are n’t there to dictate what Microsoft and Apple and Mozilla and Opera are “ allowed ” to implement .
They ’re there to provide a voice for people who will otherwise be merrily buttfucked and then thrown over the side in the pursuit of “ innovation ” .
Think Web Standards Project rather than W3C .
Of course , the WaSP seems to have lost its way and its voice a bit recently ; are they coming back ?
It ’s easy to just say “ no , no , no ” to new ideas , but it ’s equally easy to say , well , I ’m alright , Jack , if you ’re not coming along with us then you ’ll just get left behind , regardless of whether you ’re not coming along because you ’re unable to .
If you think that Apple were right to resist video formats , ask yourself if you ’d have been happy if the HTML5 spec had suggested Windows Media format as the default .
If you think that browser vendors should innovate , ask yourself how happy you ’d be implementing DirectX on a Macintosh .
Fix things , yeah .
Put some innovation back in , yeah .
Let ’s , though , try to not throw out the baby along with the bathwater .
Finally , certain of the figures in the report have been revised , and so these have been revised ( and marked as such with endnotes ) in the below summary .
These revisions do not change the overall trends .
It is also noted that only 15 % of coal produced globally is exported , the rest being consumed domestically , with Australia is responsible for almost 40 % of global coal exports .
In particular greater detail has been added regarding future US coal production , noting that the US has now switched from being a net exporter to a net importer of steam coal and arguing that total ( volumetric ) US coal production will peak between 2020 and 2030 .
The general consensus view on coal supplies has long been that we have hundreds of years of the stuff left , and that oil and gas depletion are the pressing concerns .
However , dissenting voices are emerging .
Canadian geologist David Hughes recently claimed that " peak coal looks like it 's occurred in the Lower 48 ( US states ) " , and the consensus position on coal is also called into serious question by the Coal : Resources and Future Production report soon to be released by the Energy Watch Group in Germany .
I present a summary of its findings here .
Reserves
The report highlights that thepublished in the most recent BP Statistical Review of World Energy in June 2006 are stated as being for year end 2005 , but are actually based on the latest World Energy Council ( WEC ) assessments , which contain data for the end of 2002 .
So our best figures on this are actually over four years old .
And our worst figures ?
Well , some have n’t been updated in 15 years ( China ) and some in up to 40 years ( Vietnam , Afghanistan ) .
But really the key message in the global data lies in the rate at which reserves estimates have been revised downwards .
As Peak Oilers well know , conventional wisdom has it that reserves will increase as more exploration takes place and prices rise .
Yet , in truth , estimates for global coal resources have been consistently revised down , and by 55 % over the past 25 years , from 10 trillion tons hce ( hard coal equivalent ) in 1980 to around 4.5 trillion tons hce in 2005 [ 1 ] .
Certain countries ( including Germany and the UK ) have been revised down by over 90 % in this period .
The UK reported proved recoverable reserves of 45bn tons in WEC 1980 [ 2 ] , but these were continually revised downwards to reach only 0.22bn tons by the latest report .
Cumulative UK production in this period amounted to only approx 1.8 bn tons .
Even Poland , the biggest coal producer in the EU , reports reserves revised down by 50 % over the last 10 years .
Since production alone cannot explain such revisions , they are deemed likely to be due to improvements in data .
The chief exceptions to this rule are India and Australia , both showing significant upward revisions , but as we have seen the global trend is firmly downward .
Only South Africa shows continuously shrinking reserves roughly in line with cumulative production .
Globally , the report concludes that data quality is very poor and that these downward revisions must be expected to continue .
China
Types of Coal
USA
So back to China , the world ’s largest producer , with the fourth largest reported reserves globally .
The 2006 Statistical Review of World Energy credits China with 55 years of remaining reserves at current production rates ( depleting its reserves at almost 2 % per annum ) .
But as previously mentioned , the Statistical Review faithfully reproduces proved reserves figures which were last changed in 1992 ( note that China ’s cumulative production in the 15 years since comes to about 20 % of those stated reserves ) , so we can knock 15 years off that number straight away , reducing the remaining total reserves to 40 years ’ worth .
The Energy Watch Group report gives projected production profiles showing that China is likely to experience peak coal production in the next 10 - 15 years , followed by a steep decline .
It should also be noted that these production profiles do not take into account uncontrolled coal fires which – according to satellite based estimates – add around 5 - 10 % [ 3 ] to regular consumption .
Since China ’s production dwarfs that of any other country ( being almost double that of the second largest producer , the USA ) the global coal production peak will be heavily influenced by China ’s production profile .
Now , before I outline the situation in the USA , which comfortably holds the world ’s largest reserves of coal , it may be instructive to distinguish the different types of coal .
There are four basic types , starting with the most energy - rich – anthracite ( about 30 MJ / kg ) , bituminous coal ( 18.8 -29.3 MJ /kg ) , sub - bituminous coal ( 8.3-25 MJ/kg ) and lignite ( 5.5-14.3 MJ/kg ) .
Those towards the anthracite end of the scale are often termed ‘ hard coal ’ , and those towards the lignite end of the scale as ‘ soft coal ’ , although the exact definition of these terms varies .
The softest coals are sometimes termed ‘ brown coal ’ .
The USA , then , as we have all heard , has reported proven coal reserves that would allow continued production at current rates for more than 200 years .
Three federal states ( Wyoming , Montana , Illinois ) hold about 60 % [ 4 ] of US coal reserves , but the low production rates relative to reported reserves in Montana and Illinois cast some doubt on the reliability or suitability of those reported reserves .
As many of these reserves are of low quality , with high sulphur content and / or other drawbacks , it may be considered doubtful that they will ever be produced .
Measured in terms of produced tons per miner , US productivity steadily increased until 2000 , but has declined since , which also implies that ‘ easy coal ’ is running short .
The USA had passed peak production of anthracite ( by far the rarest form ) by 1950 and peaked in bituminous coal in 1990 , but sub - bituminous coal more than made up for this decline in terms of tonnage .
However , due to the lower energy content of softer coals , the total energy content of annual US coal production peaked in 1998 .
Global Picture
So , having looked at the world ’s biggest coal producer and the holder of the world ’s biggest reserves , we may perhaps turn our attention to the global picture .
Six countries ( USA , Russia , India , China , Australia , South Africa ) hold about 85 % [ 5 ] of world coal reserves , when this is measured in terms of energy content .
According to the latest assessment by the WEC , total world reserves at the end of 2002 stood at 479bn tons of anthracite and bituminous coal , 272bn tons of sub- bituminous coal and 158bn tons of lignite .
According to the Energy Watch Group , global coal production can increase for 10 - 15 years ( mainly driven by China ) , but then production of anthracite and bituminous coal will peak around 2020 at a production rate around 30 % higher than at present .
Lignite production is predicted to peak somewhere between 2050 and 2060 .
However , as the quality of coal produced will be declining continuously the world coal energy peak is projected to come around 2025 .
It is also important to note that ‘ peak coal exports ’ should come even earlier , as lower - energy - density coals are not worth transporting long distances .
When we compare this with the scenarios ( represented by the dashed and the solid line ) from the IEA ’s 2006 World Energy Outlook ( WEO ) we get the following graph :
Click to Enlarge
As we can see , according to this report the WEO reference scenario is unrealistic , and only the production in the WEO alternative policy scenario ( which assumed political measures constraining coal due to fears over greenhouse gas emissions ) is actually feasible .
The Energy Watch Group ’s report , however , is not considering potential policy constraints , and is describing only what production may be physically possible .
I must stress that one of the key findings of this report is that data quality is very poor globally , and so all of the findings should be taken with that caveat , but the trends do seem clear .
Indeed , we sent a copy of this report to Richard Heinberg and he has revealed that a Dutch study - in - progress using different criteria has reached preliminary results confirming this report ’s findings .
And the poor data quality is itself hardly reassuring for an energy source which is becoming increasingly central to our global future .
This report clearly carries many serious implications , but for now I ’ll just share the information and leave these to be discussed on TOD .
Further analysis of the report has also recently been released in Heinberg ’s March MuseLetter .

Keith Olbermann talked with The Huffington Post 's Arianna Huffington on Thursday 's Countdown about the latest in a string of scandals surrounding Rudy Giuliani .
Apparently , Rudy 's law firm made millions of dollars , possibly illegally , lobbying on behalf of a software company that developed data mining programs that kept huge databases on millions of Americans , getting the company 's owners in front of Vice President Cheney , the FBI and other high ranking White House officials just one month after being hired .
The meetings led to millions of dollars in federal and state contracts for Giuliani 's client , but after privacy concerns were raised , the contracts were all dropped -- but not before the company could be sold for huge money -- and thanks to stock options in the contract , Rudy 's firm pocketed millions of dollars , which is illegal .
If any of you wondered if Rudy Giuliani would continue President Bush 's intrusive and illegal spying programs , you now have your answer .
Rudy 's already a big player in the game ...
BRATTLEBORO , Vermont ( Reuters ) - A Vermont town that is gaining national attention for brash displays of nudity -- from teens in the buff to naked elderly people -- awoke on Wednesday to an emergency ban on nakedness in most public places .
Officials in Brattleboro voted 3 to 2 on Tuesday night for a temporary 30 - day ordinance prohibiting people from going about in the nude .
Public nudity made headlines last summer when the weather grew hot and a couple of dozen teens took to holding hula hoop contests , riding bikes and parading past stores wearing only their birthday suits .
The disrobing has resumed this summer .
But many locals say it has gone too far .
Some cite a case in which a senior citizen from Arizona strolled through the center of town wearing only a waist pack and sandals .
“ We ’ve received quite a number of complaints on this , ” Assistant Town Manager Barbara Sondag said .
“ This was brought up last summer ... and kind of died down .
Then a couple of incidents again this summer have got the issue to resurface . ”
Vermont has a live - and - let - live tradition , allowing skinny - dipping and nude sunbathing .
Brattleboro , the first permanent English settlement in the state in 1724 , is home to a community of writers , artists and musicians as well as transplanted entrepreneurs from Boston and New York .
Although skinny - dipping and nude sunbathing will stay legal in the state , doing the “ full monty ” in the middle of this town has now become taboo .
A violation can cost $ 100 .
The topic is hotly debated at Harold & Son ’s Barbershop , where Heather Birmingham , 30 , cuts and colors hair .
“ ( Nudity ) does rub some people the wrong way , ” she said .
“ Some people say ‘ to each his own ’ .
But some of the older people say ‘ be respectful ’. ”
She disagrees with the ban .
“ This whole town is about peace and about being your own person .
So if it is , then why is n’t nudity accepted ? ”
Caleb Morris , 15 , said he was n’t surprised by the town ’s tough response because outsiders could find the nudity offensive , but he added that Vermont has always been unique .
“ It ’s a lot more free - spirited than some other states .
We do n’t have a lot of laws banning things here . ”
The ban covers nudity in the main part of town and near schools and churches and is part of a broader anti-nudity proposal that is likely to be decided next month .
Breast feeding in public will still be allowed .

Vuze , an application that allows users to search , browse , and download “ DVD and HD - quality ” video content using the peer - to - peer protocol BitTorrent , has petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to restrict Internet traffic throttling by Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) .
Vuze ’s timing is important .
John
Hart filed suit in a California state court Tuesday against Comcast , which offers ISP services .
The suit alleges that Comcast ’s secret use of technology to limit peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent violates federal computer fraud laws , the contracts users have with Comcast , and anti-fraudulent advertising statutes .
Hart wants the court to force Comcast to stop interfering with Internet traffic .
( Wired report . )
Since it uses the peer - to - peer protocol BitTorrent , Vuze has been keenly aware of Comcast and the “ bandwidth shaping ” issue .
Vuze filed its “ Petition for Rulemaking ” ( PDF ) to urge the FCC to adopt regulations limiting Internet traffic throttling , a practice by which ISPs block or slow the speed at which Internet content , including video files , can be uploaded or downloaded .
“ Now is the time to embrace the sea changes in entertainment consumption that are occurring , ” said Vuze CEO Gilles BianRosa in a release .
“ The rapid convergence of the entertainment and Internet industries has enabled the delivery of high - quality video , and these throttling tactics represent growing pains as ISPs resist inevitable change .
“ We hope our petition will trigger a pubic discussion , but we also need the FCC to act .
The industry needs transparency into what ISPs are doing and an environment that fosters innovation in online entertainment . ”
last100 editor Steve O’Hear has covered Vuze and the ISP issue extensively in several reports .
( Vuze . ) ( ISPs . )
At issue is whether “ throttling ” should be allowed .
“ Throttling ” is often characterized by ISPs as “ network management ” or “ traffic shaping ” , which Vuze and others contend interferes with the consumer Internet experience .
If these tactics continue unchecked , Vuze contends , the openness and fairness of the public Internet could be called into question .
In an email to last100 , Vuze explained that one of the petition ’s aims is to get ISPs , P2P providers , content creators and consumers to contribute to a discussion on the issue and help develop future solutions .
A piece by Lee Gomes in the WSJ argues that Linux has a long way to go .
Proof of this , he says , is the fact that even back in the open - source mother country , Finland , Linus Torvalds ' father and sister use Windows , not Linux .
( His mother , however , apparently does use Linux . )
Regardless of what Torvalds ' dad might think , Linus did get some Windows trash talk in there :
I think Microsoft used to actually care about trying to help the consumer .
I may not think that they did wonderful technology , but I think they really did try to serve their customers .
But look at their [ digital rights management ] and their " Genuine Windows Advantage " — they 're not trying to serve their customers any more in their products ; they are adding features that are actively bad for users , because they probably feel like they are n't even competing any more .

Another interesting factoid from the piece : " Far more people requested that Dell sell Linux than actually bought a machine once it went on sale . "
OK , but you know , it 's only been like six months .
I say give it a full PC turnover cycle , like what , two or three years , before making the final judgment .

Software IS Design : Part 1
Corinthians I 13:11 :
“ When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child .
When I became a man , I put childish ways behind me . ”
But I have still got so much to learn .
I do n’t remember what kind of activity I originally thought programming was , maybe I had n’t formed an idea .
Engineering I think , certainly I did some software engineering at University .
I still remember my lecturer , he said if ai n’t tested it does n’t work , and strive for low coupling and high cohesion .
That ’s about it .
Good advice though .
Sometime in my C++ days I learnt from Steve McConnell that software development was definitely a construction process and I learnt a great many other things as well .
He also thought low coupling and high cohesion were important and that the most important part of producing software was , well , producing the software , the programming , since it was the only piece guaranteed to be done and probably the only accurate description of the software anyway .
I held this view of building up software from its component pieces for a long time .
The problem with software viewed as construction ( still an engineering task really ) , is it should be more predictable than it is .
It normally takes longer and cost more than we thought , unlike houses .
We ca n’t even work out how long it will take , unlike bridges .
We do n’t actually know in real detail what we will actually get , how it will work and how fast it will run , unlike PCs .
And programmers are difficult to manage , they ca n’t just be replaced with an equally skilled alternative .
When things get behind , adding more just seems to make things worse .
Not like construction workers at all .
Then after quite a while , I came across software development as a purely design process :
Architectural design is design .
Functional or detailed design is design .
Even Test and Debugging is design .
But most importantly Coding is design .
What !
Of course it ’s not , we work out all the details in the specification and then get a coder to translate it into code for us .
We only need to test it , to fix the mistakes coders make .
Well , no , not quite , not by a long way .
We do have a translation process and a build process , in fact we call it a build , it takes a few minutes or perhaps longer and its performed completely automatically by the compiler and linker or ‘ ant ’ or ‘ make ’ or the IDE or something like that .
The build process takes an exact set of plans , the source code , and constructs all the pieces into a finished product .
As if it was a television or a house , but faster and so cheaply it might as well be free .
I shall not try to convince you that programming is software design directly for now , but show you some of the consequences of thinking of programming as design .
Design Construction Design is open ended with only a poorly defined delivery Construction is specific , with a well defined delivery and timescale Designers are not interchangeable , especially in the middle of the process .
Construction equipment and personnel are largely interchangeable at any stage of a project .
Design can not be automated .
Larger parts of construction are routinely automated Each design will be different from each other design , though there may be similar aspects Each construction will typically be the same as dozens , hundreds even millions of others .
Designers are difficult to manage and can be unpredictable .
Construction workers are much easier to manage .
There are not a lot of good designers and they are hard to find .
There are many good construction workers and they are significantly easier to get
There can be orders of magnitude difference in the end result from different designers .
There will be much less than an order of magnitude in productivity and quality variation in construction workers .
Design is a difficult and error prone process requiring trial and error .
Construction is a well understood process , with effective quality control .
Designer love to innovate .
Construction workers rarely get a chance to innovate .
A good designer can transform a product , even a company .
e.g. Jonathan
Ive A good construction worker can be relied on to do his bit .

Neither is survival . ”

Bush Administration officials have announced that President Bush will use a claim of " Executive Privilege " to thwart congressional investigation into the firings of several U.S. attorneys .
This claim is the latest in a long series of unconstitutional invocations of the notion of Executive Privilege by presidents prominent and obscure .
In fact , Executive Privilege is itself a myth unfounded in the language or original understanding of the Constitution .
The Constitution was not supposed to give presidents power to withhold information from Congress .
When a president invokes Executive Privilege , he is saying that despite a congressional request for information , or even despite a congressional subpoena , he is not going to let Congress learn what it wants to know .
He , in other words , knows better than Congress what matters Congress should investigate .
At root of the error behind this line of thinking is the idea that the president is a competing policy maker with Congress , that the two political branches in some cases may have competing views of policy and that the Executive is then entitled to thwart the fact - finding efforts of the Legislative Branch .
This idea is entirely mistaken .
The Executive Branch was intended by the Constitution 's authors and ratifiers to be precisely that — the executor of policies made by Congress , not a competing power center empowered to thwart Congress 's attempts to gain information .
If the Executive can simply refuse to allow Executive Branch personnel to testify before Congress and refuse to pursue congressional contempt referrals , Congress will be altogether unable to perform its legislative functions .
It will be subordinate to the Presidency in the way that Parliament was subordinate to English kings before the establishment of Parliament 's unlimited power to investigate in the 17th century .
All of the information - gathering agencies of the federal government , the FBI and CIA , the NIH and Department of Agriculture , the Department of Energy and the Bureau of the Census , fall under the Executive Branch .
Can it really be up to the president 's discretion whether government employees assigned the task of performing research of various kinds must divulge information to Congress ?
Of course , it is not information resulting from research activities that is at stake in the matter of the firings of U.S. attorneys , but information that may be politically damaging to the Bush Administration .
Yet , Congress 's right and need to gather information about possibly improper behavior by Executive Branch officials are even more pressing than its need for those other types of information .
And we know that the draftsmen and ratifiers of the Constitution intended for Congress to be able to call on Executive Branch officials for information at will .
In the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the Constitution , the Committee of Detail referred to Congress as the " Grand Inquest of the Nation " — a title used in England at that time to refer to Parliament as the untrammeled investigatory body empowered to impeach misbehaving officers of the Crown .
Since Congress has the power to impeach , it must be able to root out all wrongdoing in the Executive , and without having the Executive decide which trails of possible wrongdoing Congress may investigate .
One thought that this principle of the Executive 's duty to obey the other branches ' valid requests for information , wherever they lead , had been established in U.S. v. Nixon ( 1974 ) .
The first Congress , full of framers and ratifiers of the Constitution , passed legislation requiring the treasury secretary to provide Congress with information " respecting all matters referred to him by the House of Representatives , or which shall appertain to his office . "
Rep. Elias Boudinot had noted that , " this power is essentially necessary to the Government … it is absolutely so . "
No one argued to the contrary .
Secretary Alexander Hamilton , a framer , drafted that bill , and he advised President George Washington , also a framer , to sign it .
Which he did .
It is true that there were a few instances in the early history of the United States in which presidents refused to supply Congress with information .
For the most part , however , the idea of Executive Privilege , like the term itself , is a post - World War II innovation .
And certainly no administration has made so sweeping a claim of Executive Privilege as is currently being made by the Bush Administration .
The Legislative Branch is , as James Madison noted , the leading branch in a republican government .
It is up to Congress to decide on behalf of the American people what information it needs , what questions Executive officials must answer .
Refusal to comply with valid congressional requests for information is an impeachable offense on the part of any Executive officer who makes the refusal .
Before it comes to that , however , Congress can sidestep the administration 's announcement that it will not allow U.S. attorneys to enforce violations of legally valid congressional subpoenas by resuscitating the congressional power to hold individual citizens in contempt .
The issues at stake in this matter are far more significant than the firing of a few U.S. attorneys , or even the fates of the Democratic congressional majority and the Bush Administration .
What is at issue is whether Congress will defend itself against a grave threat to its basic power to investigate matters clearly within its legislative cognizance .

There ’s a certain kind of supernova that ’s totally dependable .
Let a white dwarf accumulate 1.4 times the mass of the Sun , and it ’ll detonate in an explosion visible clear across the Universe .
When astronomers saw supernova 2006gz , that ’s what they thought they were dealing with , but hold on , the explosion was much more powerful than you would expect from just a single white dwarf .
Maybe two came together in a colossal explosion .
Malcolm Hicken is a graduate student at the Harvard University Department of Physics , and he ’s the lead author of the team that made the explosive discovery , published in the November 1st issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .

Astronomers from Europe and Asia are reporting that the normally dim Comet 17P / Holmes has had an eruption .
Instead of being 17th magnitude – only visible to powerful telescopes – it ’s now 3rd magnitude .
This makes it easy to spot with the unaided eye , even in cities with heavy light pollution .
To confirm this discovery , head outside after the skies are dark , and look to the Northeast .
The comet is currently in the constellation Perseus , which is below the more familiar Cassiopeia .
If you ’re familiar with the constellations at all , you ’ll now see a new , bright yellow star .
A telescope reveals the fuzzy corona surrounding the comet .
One report from Japan says , “ Perseus does not look ‘ Perseus ’ familiar to us due to the bright stellar object now . ”

CHENEY : Syria is not a country , Tim .
It ’s a way station run by an eye doctor .
RUSSERT : Conservatives are tossing around some lock - and - load language .
The president is talking about Iran sparking a “ nuclear holocaust ” and World War III .
Giuliani adviser Norman Podhoretz thinks we ’re in World War IV .
Should n’t you at least give the new sanctions against Iran a chance to work ?

Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
CHENEY : Oh , we have , Tim .
The sanctions were announced Thursday .
It ’s now Sunday .
I think things have gotten so bad inside Iran , from the standpoint of the Iranian people , my belief is we will , in fact , be greeted as liberators .
RUSSERT : But what if your analysis is not correct — again ?
Let ’s put up on the screen part of an interview The New York Times ’s Thom Shanker did with the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen : “ With America at war in two Muslim countries , he said , attacking a third Islamic nation in the region ‘ has extraordinary challenges and risks associated with it . ’
The military option , he said , should be a last resort . ”
Your own chairman of the Joint Chiefs does not think the military can handle a third war .
CHENEY : If Admiral Mullen wants to be Admiral Sullen , that ’s his business .
I ’m not going to be a defeatist or question the courage of our fighting men .
RUSSERT : Critics say that if you attack Iran , there will be riots in every Muslim capital , the Iranians will flood Iraq with more explosives and money for the Shiite militias .
They say you ’ll only end up making more enemies for America , and our troops .
CHENEY : Why do n’t we just give the Islamofascists Sudetenland , Tim ?
Peace in our time .
RUSSERT : The Europeans are upset that you might start another war in their backyard .
CHENEY : ( Rolling his eyes and muttering under his breath ) Eurappeasers .
RUSSERT : An Iranian spokesman dismissed the new U.S. sanctions as “ worthless and ineffective ” and said they were “ doomed to fail as before . ”
And Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari , the head of Iran ’s elite Revolutionary Guards — a group you have accused of proliferating weapons of mass destruction — also warned that his forces would respond with an “ even more decisive ” strike if attacked .
So there I am driving to the Northwestern / Iowa football game last Saturday when my friend Bruce says , " Hey , what do you think of the Buick Enclave ?
I think it 's pretty sharp . "
Well Bruce , you are not alone .
The latest stats from J.D. Power 's Power Information Network shows the Buick Enclave was the fastest selling vehicle in the U.S. last month .
Yes , # 1 .
The Enclave sold so fast , it was in showrooms fewer days than the Toyota Prius , Mercedes C Class , GL Class , and Honda Fit which rounded out the top " hot selling cars " in October .
Why is this a big deal ?
Buick is hurting , and if the Enclave is generating buzz with little marketing it is significant .
It shows a good looking model can be sell even if the badge on the front is gasping for air .
It also shows GM 's designers have hit the right chord with it 's latest crossovers ( the GMC Acadia was the only other American model in the top ten of fast selling models ) .
If you 've read this blog for any amouint of time you know my thoughts on Buick .
It 's the forgotten brand at GM with an undefined niche , little marketing support , and until now , few models I found attractive .
Heck sales are down 23 % this year and it represents less than 5 % of GM 's total sales .
All reasons why I 've wondered why GM does n't go ahead and give Buick the Oldsmobile treatment and kill it .
That may still happen .
But for now , the Enclave is giving Buick executives and fans a reason to smile .
As I told my friend Bruce , " The Enclave is very nice , give it a look "

A lot of folks did n’t notice that Hillary gave an interview last week about Iraq that read like George Bush at his worst .
Not only did she lecture Democratic voters about how Iraq is tied to September 11 – which it most certainly is not – but she then one upped herself by chastising the other Democratic candidates , and we presume their supporters , over the fact that SHE was alive on September 11 , and apparently we were n’t :
Attention focused on Iraq and her vote to authorize the use of force ahead of the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 .
Presidential rivals such as former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards now say the vote in support was a mistake .
“ There are no do - overs in life , ” Clinton said .
She says Congress received bad information going into the vote and that she would have voted differently given what she knows now .
“ As a senator from New York , I lived through 9/11 and I am still dealing with the aftereffects , ” Clinton said .
“ I may have a slightly different take on this from some of the other people who will be coming through here . ”
Clinton said her view is that the nation is engaged in a deadly fight against terrorism , a battle that she contends Bush has botched .
“ I do think we are engaged in a war against heartless , ruthless enemies , ” she said .
“ If they could come after us again tomorrow they would do so . ”
With all due respect , that ’s a load of crap .
As a resident of Washington , DC I too lived through September 11 and have been dealing with the aftereffects .
I watched the Pentagon burn outside my window the entire day , so spare me the “ you lived through September 11 and I did n’t ” crap .
Secondly , I suspect every American alive on that day was scared to death and worried about their lives and their loved ones and their country .
It is beyond hubris to suggest that somehow Mrs. Clinton suffered more than the rest of us , and even worse , she implies that we did n’t suffer at all .
We do n’t have a problem with Hillary , here at AMERICAblog .
Other than John Kerry , who has now left the presidential race , we do n’t have firm views about any of the candidates ( though Biden gives us the willies ) .
Sure , we have concerns about all of candidates , to varying degrees , and we have things we like about each of them – but we have written off no one , and we most certainly are not Hillary - haters .
But .
Invoking September 11 when asked about Iraq is unconscionable .
It is pure Dick Cheney , and an outright lie .
It is not what a Democrat says , and hell , it is n’t even what a sane moderate Republican says .
I have no idea what Senator Clinton was trying to telegraph in her speech – who exactly does n’t think that we ’re engaged in a war against heartless enemies ?
– but speaking as a blog that has a pretty damn good record of treating her fairly , she really crossed the line on this one .
Do n’t question our patriotism , and do n’t talk like George Bush , or this is going to be a very problematic race .
Using it wisely , you can make hundreds or even thousands of dollars from credit card arbitrage .
Here ’s how you can profit from free loans from credit card companies .
A couple of days ago , I received an email from Mike regarding my credit card arbitrage :
I was just wondering how you were able to get 100 K onto your credit cards ( cash advances ? ? ) …
I transfer every $ from my credit card bills ( i buy everything i can with credit ) to a 0 % card then put that cash ( that i would have used to pay my credit card bills ) into a high yield savings , but that limits me to whatever i can purchase for the month , i would like to quickly utilize all of my 25 K worth of credit ( on credit cards currently owned ) , rather than only 1 - 2 K per month which is too slow when 0 % APR only lasts for 12 months .
First of all , it ’s a misperception that you have to have a balance in order to make the transfer .
No , you do n’t have to .
The money can go to any where that accepts check payment as long as the credit card company can issue you a check .
However , it ’s important you should be able to get the money you transferred once the check payment is made so you can save it in your bank account and earn interests .
That ’s the whole purpose of the game .
Before I go ahead with how I play the credit card arbitrage game , here ’s a word of caution : Credit card arbitrage is not for everybody .
If you ca n’t resist the temptation to spend thousands of dollars * easy money * , it ’s not for you .
If you have history of late in making payment , it ’s not for you either .
You do n’t want to get into a deeper trouble by trying to make a small profit .
OK , now the complete process of making money from balance transfer :
1 . Get a credit card with 12 - month 0 % APR balance transfer promotion
If the only purpose of getting a new card is to use the interest free period to make money , then length of the promotion period is the key .
There are many cards offer a 12 - month period with 0 % introductory rate .
Any period that ’s shorter than 12 months is less desirable , unless you can use the card even without the 0 % rate .
For existing cards , however , a shorter term such as 9 months or 6 months is acceptable , but you need even larger amount to make up the fees .
The shortest term I had was 4 months .
2. Request a convenient check to transfer balance
Not all issuers send out convenient checks right after the card is issued .
If the promotion period starts from the time a balance is transferred , you can wait till the condition is right ( such as the interest rate of your savings account if you expect it to go up in the coming months ) .
I know Discover Card ’s promotion starts when the card is issued .
If that ’s the case , do the transfer immediately after receiving the card .
To expedite the process , call the issuer when the card arrives and request a convenient check .
It ’s better to get a blank check , but there are credit card company requires your name and the amount you want to transfer be printed on the check before they can send it to you .
Once the check is in , just deposit the money into your bank account .
3 . Or make the transfer over the phone
If you feel comfortable , you also initiate the transfer on the phone and have the money sent to your bank account directly ( you have to provide your bank ’s routing number and your account number ) .
I did that a couple of time with Bank of America and Chase which already have my bank information from the online bill pay .
Things will a lot easier if you transfer the money right to your bank account , but that ’s not always the case .
For instance , last year Discover insisted I can only use the money to pay balance on another credit card .
If this is what ’s happening , it ’s less desirable but still doable if you have cards that can issue refund for over payment .
Check out my previous post on how to use Citi card to transfer balance .
4. Consolidate credit limits to get the most out of the deal
It would be impossible for me to have $ 100 K in balance transfer without some consolidations .
If you have multiple accounts with the same issuer , you can get the most out of the deal by consolidating your existing credit limits .
All you need to is call the credit card company and tell them to move credit lines from this and that card to the card with 0 % offer .
Just move the credit lines , but do n’t close the accounts as they are likely to be older than the card you just got .
When the game is over , you can always move the lines back to those cards if you wish .
I have done credit consolidations before and it ’s quite easy to do .
5 . Do n’t spend the money and do n’t buy stocks with the money as well
Nobody can predict where the market will be one year from now .
If you do n’t have other funds to cover the balance when the transfer expires , you will have to sell your stocks which could be losing money at that time .
Just save the money in a high yield savings account .
There are plenty of online savings accounts offer 5 + % interest rate .
Keep the money in liquid accounts so you can have an easy access .
In case something unexpected happens ( like late in making payment ) , you can pay the money back right away .
6 . Pay more than the minimum on time every month
If you are late in making minimum payment , even once , you are screwed .
So make sure you give enough time to let your payment hit the card ahead of the deadline .
And paying the bill online instead of mailing a check can reduce the risk of late payment .
In addition , adding $ 10 more to the minimum payment is always a good practice .
7. Confirm the payoff date
Call the issuer one month early to confirm the last day the balance has to be paid off to avoid any financial charge .
Do n’t just assume the date on the offer letter is the deadline .
Also , since transferring money via ACH usually requires at least three business days before the fund settles , give yourself enough time to arrange the money and pay off the entire balance without any delay .
Finally , there are a couple of items that you should be careful when playing the credit card arbitrage :
Think twice before getting a new card for balance transfer if the fee depends on the amount transferred ( such as the 3 % fee that Citi charges ) .
The profit will be eroded even if you can get 5 + % return from a savings account .
Make sure there ’s no balance from purchases on the card before making the transfer .
Since any payment you make will be automatically used to pay balance with the lowest interest rate , the charge from your regular purchase will started to accumulate interests until you pay off the entire balance , including that from 0 % transfer .
Edit :
And do n’t use the credit card until the balance transfer money is paid off either for the same reason ( Thanks Tim ) .
And do n’t use the credit card until the balance transfer money is paid off either for the same reason ( Thanks Tim ) .
Read carefully the deadline on your offer letter .
If it says something like “ the billing cycle includes August 31 , 2008 , ” then August 31 , 2008 is NOT the deadline to pay off the balance and avoid financial charges .
Depending on the date of your billing cycle , you may have to give the money back well ahead of August 31 , 2008 .
Call the issuer to confirm the deadline .

Although mother - to - be Emily Barton was expecting only one child , passers - by would stop her and ask if she was having triplets .
Her bump grew so rapidly that she put on an astonishing seven stone during her pregnancy .
The reason was a massive ovarian cyst which was wrapping itself around her unborn son .
scroll down for more
Eventually it became such a threat to her baby 's life that she was given an emergency caesarean section - after which the cyst was found to contain 18 pints of fluid .
" After that I felt so light that I literally skipped down the hospital corridor , " said 30 - year - old Mrs Barton , a pharmacy dispenser from Woking , Surrey .
" I can't believe I had something that big growing inside me . "
Mrs Barton and her husband Rob , 32 , a systems administrator , were delighted when she became pregnant in July 2005 .
scroll down for more
When she had her first scan at 12 weeks , doctors at St Peter 's Hospital in Chertsey delivered some shocking news .
The scan had showed that Mrs Barton had a 31 / 2inch cyst on her right ovary .
" I was shocked when they told me , " she said .
" I was worried that it might affect the baby .
" Because it was attached , the doctors said they could n't remove it , but would monitor it carefully .
But I was so worried . "
The doctors scanned her regularly , and the cyst grew at an alarming rate .
When she was 16 weeks pregnant , she began suffering severe pains as her growing baby competed for space .
" I kept thinking I was in labour I was in so much pain .
The scans kept showing that the cyst was pushing the baby to one side .
" I was wondering how he could possibly survive with this cyst growing faster than he was .
" My bump was growing at twice the normal rate .
At 16 weeks I was so big that friends joked that it was going to be a huge baby .
" By 23 weeks I had to stop work as I was so big , and by 28 weeks I could no longer fit even into maternity clothes . "
By the time Mrs Barton was almost full term in her pregnancy she had ballooned from 13 stone to 20 stone .
" I was so big that I could n't get in and out of the bath by myself .
Rob had to help me .
And I could n't put my own shoes on - or even see my toes .
I could n't even stand and wash the dishes .
" When I went for my scans the sonographer kept saying she had never seen anything like it . "
The caesarean was carried out in April last year , with baby Sam weighing 6lb 15oz .
The cyst , by now a foot across , took a further two hours to remove .
" I could n't believe how much lighter I felt straight away , " said Mrs Barton .
" It felt wonderful .
I could actually look down and see my own toes . "
After ten days , the couple were allowed to take their baby home .
But there was more anxiety to come when Sam needed an operation at four months old to repair a heart defect .
" We were so worried about him having the operation , " said his mother .
" But we knew that if he had spent nine months battling against the giant cyst that was growing next to him , then he could survive this .
He is such a fighter . "
The operation was a success and Sam was allowed home after a week in hospital .
Doctors still do not know what caused the cyst to grow inside Mrs Barton 's womb .
But tests have shown that it had pre-cancerous cells , so she will need check - ups every six months in case the disease develops .
" I now have only one fallopian tube as the doctor had to remove it when they took the cyst out .
" I will think very carefully about getting pregnant again in the future .
" Luckily I 've lost the weight now , but putting on seven stone was staggering .
" One day I will tell Sam about his unusual start to life and that he had to battle with a giant cyst for nine months - luckily it was a battle that he won . "
Beckham makes little impact as Galaxy , Vancouver play 0 - 0 draw VANCOUVER , British Columbia  David Beckham filled another stadium in another country , even signing a few autographs for some lucky girls playing on the field at halftime .
That was about the extent of Beckham 's impact Wednesday night .
He did n't even get the loudest ovation .
That went to a streaker .
" Shame there was n't any goals .
Hope ( the fans ) enjoyed it with the streaker and other things , " Beckham said .
The Los Angeles Galaxy , getting outplayed by their lower - division counterparts , played to a 0 - 0 draw against the Vancouver Whitecaps in an exhibition match at BC Place Stadium .
Beckham played an uneventful 72 minutes , leaving without taking a shot or using his deft touch to set up any scoring chances .
It was n't a notable performance , potentially leaving a tougher decision about his spot on England 's national team .
The Galaxy are scheduled to play the Minnesota Thunder of the USL in Minneapolis on Sunday , likely Beckham 's final chance to show England coach Steve McClaren he 's fit and healthy enough for a spot in England 's lineup .
England faces Austria in a friendly on Nov. 16 before hosting Croatia in a European Championship qualifier Nov. 21 at Wembley Stadium .
" We 'll have to wait and see , " Beckham said .
McClaren watched Beckham play 83 minutes in a match last Sunday that benefited fire victims in Southern California .
" All I have to do is keep myself fit and put myself in the position to be selected for the national team and keep my fingers crossed that I will . "
Part of the agreement on playing in Vancouver was that Beckham play at least 45 minutes and that was the original plan .
But the midfielder felt fine at halftime and played a little more than 20 minutes of the second half .
He occasionally grabbed and stretched his left leg in the first half , but did n't appear winded when he left to a loud ovation , giving the fans applause as he checked out .
Yet , the cheers for Beckham could n't top those for the streaker or a successful marriage proposal that even Beckham clapped for from the Galaxy bench .
" It 's unfortunate when there are draws like this , " Beckham said .
" People want to see goals .
But I think both teams canceled each other out tonight . "
Beckham 's pedestrian performance came on the same day that Pele said fans in the United States were misled by the MLS about Beckham 's goal scoring ability .
After the match , Beckham chuckled briefly before saying , " everyone 's got their own opinions . "
Vancouver easily had the better scoring chances , outshooting the Galaxy 12 - 3 .
The only one keeping Vancouver off the scoreboard in the first half was goalkeeper Joe Cannon , who atoned for tripping Eduardo Sebrango in the penalty box , by making a kick save on Sebrango 's penalty attempt in the 30th minute .
Los Angeles did n't get its first shot on goal until the 51st minute with Vancouver goalkeeper Matt Nelson punched Edson Buddle 's shot over the crossbar .
It was easily the Galaxy 's best scoring chance as Beckham 's passes often failed to find a teammate .
" It 's nice to play against a player like that , " Vancouver midfielder Martin Nash said .
" Once in a lifetime . "
Galaxy reserve keeper Steve Cronin also made a pair of difficult saves late in the second half as the Whitecaps pushed forward trying to pull out the victory .
The match , delayed for more than a month by Beckham 's injuries this season , drew 48,172 .
It also was the first match for interim Galaxy coach Trevor James , who took over after Frank Yallop resigned to take the head coaching job in San Jose earlier this week .
" For an exhibition , ( the game ) was very competitive , " James said .
The Associated Press
In my opinion there have been three generations of blog networks so far in the industry .
The first was when Gawker and Weblogs Inc. made huge names for themselves and their sites .
This was the first generation , and woke up millions to the potential and possibility of making their own network of content rich blogs .
The second generation included a huge number of networks including the original 9rules , b5 media , 451 press , and hundreds of others .
These blog networks were all very young , but they all had great potential .
The problem was that there were so many entrants into the second generation of blog networks that many eventually died due to the high competition .
The third generation is here and still developing .
One network that stands out more than the rest as a third generation network is Splashpress Media .
They have come in with a few decent sites , and bought their way into the RSS readers , and bookmarks of thousands .
I am only going to talk about five blog networks today .
Mentioned above , these networks are ones you will want to join if you want to become a problogger .
The order is not from best to worst , but instead it is alphabetical .
I think that the best and word is highly subjective , but all of these networks have been and continue to be huge successes in the blogosphere .
As of July 31st , 2007 , 451 press has claimed that they are the largest blog network in the world with over 329 different blogs .
A few contacts I have in other networks did n’t like their claim , but the truth of the matter is that 451 press has the most blogs currently , and they are working hard to keep ahead of other large blog networks .
Covering every niche from the local city scene to television shows , 451 press has built a large network though not necessarily having the most unique visitors or page views .
Officially opening their doors on October 2nd , 2006 , it is nearly the one year anniversary of the network .
One thing that I am not a fan of with 451 press is that their sites all look the same except for some minor tweaks .
This limits the personality of the site as its own entity in my opinion and thus limits site growth as apparent by the design , the network comes first .
Why is it worthy of being in the top 5 ?
Well , being that it is the biggest in the number of blogs , and is looking at adding new sites every week , I think that they really have something here .
As they continue to grow , they will be able to leverage the brand they have created by being in every niche .
Another amazingly huge blog network is b5 media .
b5 media was created by some of the blogosphere ’s hardest hitters .
With people like Jeremy Wright , Darren Rowse , and Shai Coggins at the helm , there is little reason why b5 media would n’t be successful .
Add to that multiple million dollars of venture capitalism money , and you have a business .
With their head office located in Toronto , Ontario Canada , they have an extra special place in this Canadian ’s heart .
b5 media also covers the gambit of topics with over 250 in subjects ranging from arts and design to video games .
Like 451 press , I have an issue with b5 media , and that is that they have created two or even three blogs to cover a subject where one would do .
They do have more customized themes for their blogs , allowing more of a brand to be created around each site , but I do wonder if sometimes blogs of a similar niche cannibalize each others traffic .
Why is it worthy of being in the top 5 ?
One of my idols Darren Rowse is part of the creators .
THE Problogger .
While it can be quite difficult to make a name for yourself blogging with b5 media these days , in their earlier days , many of their bloggers quickly became well known in the industry , and some now make more money than myself and other full time bloggers .
One of the first major blog networks , Gawker Media is looked up to by many networks just starting out .
Created by Nick Denton , each of the 14 blogs are huge pillars of what a blogging network could be like .
With each and every site being very well known .
Sites like , Lifehacker , Gizmodo , and Valleywag .
All of the sites have a very similar structure in where everything was placed , to create a sense of unity , but each site is branded differently , and each site has become its own brand .
Unlike some of the other blog networks , you would n’t be working on your own site if you were hired to write for Gawker Media .
They keep a limited stable of blogs , and only so many bloggers per site .
This allows them to remain focused and most likely part of the reason for their amazing growth over the years .
Why is it worthy of being in the top 5 ?
Gawker Media blogs pretty much defined the niches they were in , and are some of the most linked to blogs in the world .
I am a huge fan of LifeHacker , and I know many people who ca n’t help but read Valleywag and Consumerist every single day .
Splashpress Media is part of what I like to consider the third generation of blog networks .
They grew from a small group of blogs , into a blog network powerhouse overnight by acquiring some key sites , and continuing to develop them .
Originally comprised of five separate businesses , Splashpress Media has come together nicely and continues to add powerful sites to its arsenal .
Their best acquisitions including the Blog Herald , 901am , and Wisdump among others .
Splashpress Media has a pretty strong stable of writers now , but they are always looking for great bloggers to participate in their blogs .
Each blog has a unique design , and that allows for some great branding .
All the blogs are tied in together by the Splashpress Media logo , but are otherwise designed for the niche the sites are targeting .
I think this has been a very wise move for Splashpress , and will serve their sites well in the long run .
The network is n’t as important as the blogs within .
I think other networks should learn that .
I do think though that Splashpress Media should update their network home page to at least reflect their updated logo .
Why is it worthy of being in the top 5 ?
I know a few people that expected Splashpress Media to fade into the background after their purchase of the Blog Herald , but they surprised everyone as they continued to add new blogs , either by creating them or buying them and even better , a few of the blogs became very powerful in their niches .
The biggest shock was when Performancing was bought by Splashpress , but it really cemented them as worthy of being one of the top five blog networks .
Weblogs Inc. was founded in September of 2003 and now has over 90 different blogs in its network though some report that only around thirty are really active , and less than half are considered high level blogs .
The company was founded by Brian Alvey and Jason Calacanis with an initial investment from Mark Cuban .
In October of 2005 , Weblogs Inc. was purchased by AOL for a reported $ 25 million dollars .
When this happened , everyone decided it was time to give blogging a try , and the whole blogosphere quickly ballooned .
Much like Gawker Media , all the blogs share a similar design , with some color and header tweaks to make it look unique .
This has worked for them , but I find the designs to be a bit stale , even their newly refreshed attempts .
I am not sure how easy or difficult it is to get a position at Weblogs Inc. , but being owned by AOL , I would guess it is at least as hard as getting a job for AOL .
Some bloggers I know attach a stigma to working for AOL , myself , I ’d love to write for sites like Engadget or Joystiq .
Why is it worthy of being in the top 5 ?
This is one of the two progenitors of all other blog networks .
It was acquired by a major company for $ 25 million dollars .
What is even more interesting to me is how unlike other services under the AOL name , Weblogs Inc. did n’t get worse due to their new ownership .
Sure things have changed , and so the current quality is subjective , but at least it did n’t get moved to AOL subdomains , or changed like the recent Netscape to Propeller move .
Conclusion
So there you have it .
The top 5 blog networks according to me .
Sure , there are other networks that get more page views , or make more money than some of the ones listed above , but I think looking at the history of some on this list and the potential of the others , you can agree that these networks are very powerful , and a job with them could mean both some serious self promotion and / or some decent wages .
Blog networks have gone from friends working together to become a real business model , much like a magazine company with multiple niche focused publications .
If you want to be a full time problogger , a network could be the key to help you achieve that goal .
Just make sure you choose the network that best fits your goals .
Full Disclosure : I work for Bloggy Network , and I would have put them in the list , but I figured that was a conflict of interest , so I used them as a comparison point for all the rest of the blog networks on this list .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein said Thursday that she favors legal immunity for telecommunications companies that allegedly shared millions of customers ' telephone and e-mail messages and records with the government , a position that could lead to the dismissal of numerous lawsuits pending in San Francisco .
In a statement at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is considering legislation to extend the Bush administration 's electronic surveillance program , Feinstein said the companies should not be " held hostage to costly litigation in what is essentially a complaint about administration activities . "
She endorsed a recent statement by Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D - W. Va. , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , that companies assured by top administration officials that the surveillance program was legal " should not be dragged through the courts for their help with national security . "
Feinstein , D - Calif. , plays a pivotal role on the Judiciary Committee , which has a 10 - 9 Democratic majority .
If she joins committee Republicans in voting next Thursday to protect telecommunications companies from lawsuits for their roles in the surveillance program , the proposal - a top priority of President Bush - will become part of legislation that reaches the Senate floor .
The immunity measure would require judges to dismiss suits accusing companies of collaborating illegally in the surveillance program if the government declared either that a firm had not participated or that its participation was authorized .
Lawyers for the companies ' customers would be excluded from the hearing and the reason for the dismissal would not be made public .
After Thursday 's hearing , Feinstein spokesman Scott Gerber released a statement from the senator saying the legislation was " a work in progress " and that she was " open to evaluating all suggestions for improvement . "
Opponents of immunity for the telecommunications companies said they would try to persuade Feinstein to change her mind .
" Hopefully , since the case is in her own backyard , she wo n't want to foreclose people 's opportunity to have their day in court , " said Caroline Frederickson , lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union .
" There are compromises possible here , " said Cindy Cohn , legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a lawyer for AT&T customers in a surveillance case before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
One suggestion that Feinstein previously indicated she was considering , Cohn said , would be to allow the suits to proceed but set limits on damages against the companies .
The AT&T suit , filed in January 2006 , is the lead case of nearly 40 filed around the country accusing telecommunications companies of allowing the National Security Agency to intercept customers ' phone calls and e-mails and examine their records without a warrant .
The suits have been transferred to a federal judge in San Francisco .
Bush acknowledged in December 2005 that he had ordered the agency after the 2001 terrorist attacks to wiretap phones and read e-mails of communications between Americans and alleged foreign terrorists without the court warrants required by a 1978 federal law .
With lawsuits pending against the government and the companies , Congress authorized the surveillance program in August but did not immunize the companies for their past conduct .
The Judiciary Committee is considering immunity for the companies as part of a bill to extend the program past February .
Feinstein , in her statement Thursday , said the suits are unfair to the companies , which are " unable to defend themselves in court " because the government has insisted that their activities be kept secret .
Although suits against the companies are " not the right remedy , " Feinstein said , the administration should be held accountable through an audit of the surveillance program by the Justice Department 's inspector general , as proposed in the Senate legislation .
Cohn disputed Feinstein 's assertion that the companies could not defend themselves in the lawsuits .
She said federal law allows such defendants to present secret evidence in private to the judge , a practice she said has been carried out for decades without any leaks .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Soldiers manning a checkpoint near Baghdad stopped a wedding convoy to find that the purported bride and groom were wanted terror suspects , an Iraqi Defense Ministry official said Monday .
Abbas al - Dobbi , left , and al - Bahadli were reportedly part of a wedding convoy that drew soldiers ' suspicion .
The army set up the checkpoint last week in the Taji area , about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) north of Baghdad .
The soldiers became suspicious of the convoy because its members -- save the " bride " -- were all male and because one of the cars in the convoy did not heed orders to stop , the official said .
Also , soldiers said , the people in the car seemed nervous and the groom refused to lift his bride 's veil when soldiers asked him to , according to the official .
Soldiers ordered everyone out of the car , the official said .
Upon inspecting the convoy , soldiers found a stubbly - faced man , Haider al - Bahadli , decked out in a white bride 's dress and veil .
Bahadli was wanted on terror - related charges , as was his groom , Abbas al - Dobbi , the official said .
Two other terror - related suspects were detained as well .

All About Iraq War
For months , President Bush has been promising an honest accounting of the situation in Iraq , a fresh look at the war strategy and a new plan for how to extricate the United States from the death spiral of the Iraqi civil war .
The nation got none of that yesterday from the Congressional testimony by Gen.
David Petraeus , the top military commander in Iraq , and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
It got more excuses for delaying serious decisions for many more months , keeping the war going into 2008 and probably well beyond .
It was just another of the broken promises and false claims of success that we ’ve heard from Mr. Bush for years , from shock and awe , to bouquets of roses , to mission accomplished and , most recently , to a major escalation that was supposed to buy Iraqi leaders time to unify their nation .
We hope Congress is not fooled by the silver stars , charts and rhetoric of yesterday ’s hearing .
Even if the so - called surge has created breathing room , Iraq ’s sectarian leaders show neither the ability nor the intent to take advantage of it .
The headline out of General Petraeus ’s testimony was a prediction that the United States should be able to reduce its forces from 160,000 to 130,000 by next summer .
That sounds like a big number , but it would bring American troops only to the level of troops that were in Iraq when Mr. Bush announced his “ surge ” last January .
And it ’s the rough equivalent of dropping an object and taking credit for gravity .
The military does not have the troops to sustain these high levels without further weakening the overstretched Army and denying soldiers their 15 months of home leave before going back to war .
The general claimed a significant and steady decline in killings and deaths in the past three months , but even he admitted that the number of attacks is still too high .
Recent independent studies are much more skeptical about the decrease in violence .
The main success General Petraeus cited was in the previously all - but - lost Anbar Province where local sheiks , having decided that they hate Al Qaeda more than they hate the United States , have joined forces with American troops to combat insurgents .
That development  which may be ephemeral  was not a goal of the surge and surprised American officials .
To claim it as a success of the troop buildup is , to be generous , disingenuous .
Myanmar country profile Published duration 3 September 2018
Myanmar , also known as Burma , was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011 .
The generals who ran the country suppressed almost all dissent and stood accused of gross human rights abuses , prompting international condemnation and sanctions .
A gradual liberalisation began in 2010 , leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year .
But an army operation against alleged terrorists in Rakhine State since August 2017 has driven more than half a million Muslim Rohingyas to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh , in what the United Nations called a " textbook example of ethnic cleansing " .
This has damaged the new government 's international reputation , and highlighted the continuing grip of the military in Myanmar .

President : U Win Myint

Parliament elected U Win Myint as president in March 2018 , replacing U Htin Kyaw , who resigned , reportedly because of ill health .
The role of president has been largely ceremonial since the end of military rule in 2016 , with Aung San Suu Kyi effectively leading the government in the role of State Counsellor .
She is barred from taking the Burmese presidency under the military - drafted constitution as her sons are British citizens .
The reputation of Aung San Suu Kyi , long - term leader of the pro-democracy movement , was battered in 2017 by her government 's treatment of the Muslim Rohingya community , who the UN said were victims of ethnic cleansing at the hands of the Myanmar military .

Myanmar 's media have seen a gradual easing of strict state controls since 2011 .
But media freedom has not been a priority for the democratically elected government that took office in 2016 , says Reporters Without Borders .
The state still controls the main broadcasters and publications , and self - censorship is commonly practised .

George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lied the United States into Iraq and now Hillary Clinton is lying to keep the United States in Iraq .
Where is Oliver Stone when we need him ?
The magic bullet theory has been replaced by the disappearing act of the 423 million lawyers in the United States .
Pervez Musharraf locked up the lawyers and the judges in Pakistan but in the United States they all just fell asleep .
Fortunately “ Deep Throat II ” has come to our rescue , and it is n’t Monica Lewinsky or Larry Craig , aka “ Bathroom Boy ” .
This past Saturday Nov. 17 , 2007 , the 10th anniversary since Bill and Hillary Clinton refused to send the Kyoto Protocol to reduce planetary poisoning to the Senate for ratification and refused to ratify it , when 172 other countries did , Hillary Clinton spoke in Los Angeles at a Global Warming Forum .
It got so hot at the forum that anti Iraq War protester Tyghe Berry of Code Pink was forced to scream , “ Do n’t tase me bro ! ” , before being carted away by police , arrested and fined , for asking Hillary Clinton , “ How can you say you ’re for the environment when you ’re always voting for war ? ” Congressman Dennis Kucinich and Senator John Edwards also spoke at the forum .
Neither were arrested .
As Tyghe Berry was being thrown out , Hillary Clinton said , “ Our ( The Democrats ’ ) obstacle to getting anything through the Congress ( ie “ A law ending the Iraq War ” ) is the filibuster rule in the Senate .
That means we have to get 60 votes in the Senate which means unless we have 60 Democrats we actually have to get some Republicans to vote with us .
It ’s one of the unfortunate obstacles we face because of the rules of the Senate . ”
You can watch Hillary Clinton say this here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiRBQqIEgm8
In simple terms Hillary Clinton told the American people that the Democratic Party cannot end the war in Iraq because they do n’t have enough votes in the House or Senate , and they need 60 in the Senate .
Hillary Clinton passed the buck on Iraq to the Republicans with this outright lie .
A sign “ The buck stops here ” sat on President Harry Truman ’s desk in the oval office in the White House .
It is unknown how many interns sat on President Clinton ’s desk in the oval office .
“ Is that your stethoscope or are you just happy to see me ? ” During Bill Clinton ’s presidential campaign Gennifer Flowers , who had a twelve year relationship with Governor Clinton complained of his miniscule member .
In the smoking tape recordings of conversations between Bill Clinton and Gennifer Flowers they each called each other “ Honey ” .
Two Arkansas Police Officer bodyguards of Governor Clinton confirmed the affair .
Bill Clinton denied the affair .
He said , “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman , I had sexual relations with those women . ” after the smoking dress was unveiled .
In response to Gennifer Flowers , Hillary Clinton also denied the affair , and said that everyone calls everyone “ Honey ” in Arkansas .
This is where the “ Bee Movie ” was filmed , a major disappointment despite the stellar cast .
If one more bee dies next spring then we are all going extinct .
In the case at hand , how many Senate votes does it take to leave Iraq ?
Hillary Clinton says “ 60 ” .
BZZZZZZ !
Sorry , next contestant .
Our next contestant is “ Deep Throat II ” aka Democratic Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich .
Recently Rob Kall , the editor of OpEdNews.com interviewed Congressman Kucinich on this very point , here .
This is where Congressman Kucinich spilled the beans on the Democratic leadership , the game they are playing with the American public , and the real rules of the United States Congress which allow the Democrats to end the Iraq War tomorrow , tomorrow , I love ya , tomorrow , you ’re only , a daaaay a waaay !
In November 2006 the American people elected a Democratic Congress , a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House .
This allowed the Democrats to elect Harry Reid as the Senate Majority Leader and Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House of Representatives .
According to the official rules of the Congress , only the Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid or the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi can refer a bill to committee and then to the floor for a vote .
This is the power of the purse which the American people gave to the Democratic Party last November as an expression of their will to leave Iraq immediately .
In other words , if Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi decides to kill any war funding bill by not referring it to committee or the floor it ’s dead .
Lets say that some congressman is an alcoholic and drunk and signs and puts a bill into the clerk ’s hopper saying that henceforth no member is permitted to pick their nose more than 15 times per hour .
As with any bill no matter how important Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid can kill it dead immediately .
Without a war funding bill the American troops in Iraq will not have gasoline to drive their tanks , or bullets , and they will not be allowed to get killed or maimed anymore .
Hillary Clinton is talking about a filibuster of a bill that actually made it to the floor for debate and a vote .
This is like talking about which tactics Devil ’s Bag ’s jockey should use in the Kentucky Derby when Devil ’s Bag had already broken his leg before the race anyway .
In November 2006 the Republicans broke both their legs , the House and the Senate .
The founding fathers gave the Congress a check on the President and the Vice President , who shot his lawyer in the face deliberately for telling him this stuff .
Buster Douglas scored the biggest upset in sporting history by winning the undisputed heavyweight championship by knocking out Mike Tyson , who at the time was Superman .
Mike Tyson used to knock his opponents into the third row on the first punch before he found myspace .
For fun the Democrats should introduce a bill ending the Iraq War in the Senate .
People will jump to pay $ 60 to watch it on pay per view .
Imagine Lindsey Graham spending 12 hours in the Senate filibustering by reading the full line of Harry Potter novels and explaining to the American people how the Iraq War has been so helpful for the American Health Care system , educational system , the 10 trillion dollar deficit and global warming .
By the time the Republicans are done mouthing off they wo n’t get a single vote next November .
Once the American people understand that Russia , China and the 1.3 Billion person Muslim world will never allow the United States to steal the Middle East oil , then the troops can come home .
Russia , China and Iran have formed a strategic military alliance .
Russia and China helped tiny North Vietnam defeat the United States .
Russia is building nuclear reactors in Iran and giving Iran advanced missiles .
Hillary Clinton believes that Jesus is coming in the Apocalypse Nuclear World War 3 , on a flying horse from Heaven to defeat the snake , goat , lion Beast Devil of Revelations because she does n’t know that the New Testament was written by Greek authors who plagiarised the story of Prince Bellerophon on his flying horse Pegasus defeating the snake , goat , lion Chimera .
Coincidentally Nostradamus ’ first two anti Christs Napoleon and Hitler code named Hister lost their Empire ’s armies in Russia .
Nostradamus ’ third anti Christ is named maBUS .
Turn the “ m ” upside down .

K -WHAT ?
Unbuilt Maui TV station lands questionable call letters
THE call letters KUNT have landed at a yet - unbuilt low - power digital television station in Wailuku , Maui .
Alarmingly similar to a word the dictionary says is obscene , the call letters were among a 15 - page list of new call letters issued by the Federal Communications Commission and released this week .
The same station owner also received KWTF for a station in Arizona .
From Skokie , Ill. , comes a sincere apology " to anyone that was offended , " said Kevin Bae , vice president of KM Communications Inc. , who requested and received KUNT and KWTF .
It is " extremely embarrassing for me and my company and we will file to change those call letters immediately . "
On the Net :
» svartifoss2.fcc.gov/reports7/callsign.cfm
He thanked your columnist for bringing the matter to his attention and pledged to , " make sure I do n't fall asleep on the job when selecting call signs again . "
One might understand how Bae 's eyes could glaze over during selection , as KM has some 80 sets of call letters and alpha-numeric callsigns for TV and radio stations in several states .
No KM station is yet on the air in Hawaii but its mainland TV stations carry programming from America One Network , My Network TV and the CW .
The call letter snafu was a source of great mirth for Bae 's attorney .
" I can't tell you how long he laughed at me when he learned of my gaffe , " Bae said .
Broadcasters for generations have joked among themselves about call letters resembling off - color words or acronyms knowing the FCC would never approve their assignment -- but that was before computerization .
KCUF -FM near Aspen , Colo .
got its F - word - in - reverse call letters in August of 2005 and has been on the air since December , " Keeping Colorado Uniquely Free , " its Web site says .
Uh , yeah .
Station officials could not be reached , but the automated pop-music slinger has been written about twice in the Aspen Daily News .
The paper said radio regulators " blessed the call letters . "
However , assignment of call letters actually is an automated process , according to Mary Diamond of the FCC's Office of Media Relations .
Broadcasters use the FCC
Web site to request and receive call letters with no oversight from Beavis , his partner , or any FCC regulator .
Dude , seriously .
Even after years of concerns over broadcast indecency and the debate about fines for fleeting profanities that hit the air .
The Code of Federal Regulations allows applicants to request call letters of their choice as long as the combination is available .
Further , " objections to the assignment of requested call signs will not be entertained at the FCC , " it states .
The Conservatives Against Fred Thompson volunteers have compiled a list of proposals supported by Fred Dalton Thompson in the senate that include Gun Bans , confiscations and limitations to the free speech of Gun Rights Advocates .
Dates and bill numbers are provided so this information can be easily verified .
Summary :
1. Anti-gun terror bill ( S. 735 )
On June 7 , 1995 , the Senate passed an anti-gun terror bill ( S. 735 ) by a vote of 91 - 8 .
This version of the terror bill included : a BATF pay increase of $ 100 million ; a provision authorizing “ roving wiretaps ” allowing government officials to wiretap one ’s home if a person under investigation visits the home — even if one had no knowledge the person was a suspect ; a weakening of the Posse Commitatus law to give the military more authority to get involved in law enforcement in certain circumstances ; a grant of power to the FBI to conduct “ fishing expeditions ” and secure one ’s financial and travel records in certain circumstances without any evidence one has committed a crime ; and finally , the “ Randy Weaver entrapment provision ” which extends the statute of limitations for violations under the National Firearms
Act of 1934 from three to five years .
Thompson voted in favor of the bill .
2. Anti-gun terror bill — final passage
On April 17 , 1996 , the Senate passed the conference version of the anti-terrorism bill by a vote of 91 - 8 .
The final version of the bill ( S. 735 ) contained several problems , including ones that will : order an “ anti- hunter ” rifle and ammo study ; authorize a $ 40 million pay increase for the BATF ( through the Treasury Department ) ; potentially punish gun dealers ( and individuals ) for selling ammunition to someone they should have known would commit a violent crime ; federalize many state crimes , thus tremendously increasing the scope and jurisdiction of the BATF ; restrict the right of habeas corpus in such a way as to severely damage the ability of the courts to rescue honest gun owners who are unjustly incarcerated ; allow the government to use “ secret evidence ” against certain individuals ; remove protections against wiretapping wireless data ; and require banks to freeze the assets of domestic groups in certain situations .
Thompson once again voted in favor of the bill .
3. Taggants in gunpowder
On September 12 , 1996 , the Senate voted ( 57 - 42 ) to keep an anti-gun amendment off of the Treasury - Postal appropriations bill ( H.R. 3756 ) .
The Kerry amendment — which Thompson voted for — would have made funds available for a study of tagging explosive materials , including black and smokeless powders ( thus setting the stage for registering ammunition ) .
The amendment also sought to further demonize firearms by selectively examining the misuse of firearms by criminals .
The study would not examine the number of times firearms are used to save the lives of decent citizens .
4. Lautenberg Domestic Confiscation gun ban
On September 12 , 1996 , the Senate passed the Lautenberg gun ban as an amendment to the Treasury - Postal appropriations bill ( H.R. 3756 ) .
The Lautenberg Domestic Confiscation Gun Ban disarms gun owners for small ( misdemeanor ) offenses in the home — “ offenses ” as slight as spanking a child or grabbing a spouse .
This lifetime ban , in certain cases , can even be imposed without a trial by jury .
It is also retroactive , so it does not matter if the offense occurred 20 years ago .
Thompson voted in favor of the amendment .
5. Free Speech restrictions
On October 7 , 1997 , the Senate defeated an “ Incumbent Protection Bill ” ( S. 25 ) which would have resulted in the government regulation of GOA ’s newsletters and other communications with its members , while expanding the relative political power of the liberal media and other anti-gun forces .
Senators failed in their effort , 53 to 47 , to shut down a filibuster of the bill that was ostensibly aimed at reforming campaign finance laws .
6. Smith “ Anti-Brady ” Amendment
On July 21 , 1998 , pro-gun Senator Bob Smith ( R - NH ) introduced an “ Anti-Brady ” amendment that passed by a vote of 69 - 31 .
The Smith amendment would prohibit the FBI from using Brady background checks to tax or register gun owners .
Further , the amendment requires the “ immediate destruction of all [ gun buyer ] information , in any form whatsoever . ”
Finally , if the FBI disregards this latter provision , the Smith language will allow private citizens to sue the agency and collect monetary damages , including attorney ’s fees .
Thompson , in keeping with his tendency to usually vote for expanded federal police power , voted against this limitation of FBI registration of gun owners .
7. Anti-gun Clinton judge appointment
On February 11 , 1998 , the Senate voted 67 - 28 to confirm Margaret Morrow to the Federal bench .
GOA vigorously opposed this Clinton - appointed judge , as she has not only taken strident anti-gun positions , she has showed herself to be a gun control activist .
8. Anti-gun Surgeon General
Having nominated anti-gun David Satcher for Surgeon General , President Bill Clinton was forced to wait several months as debate raged over his controversial pick .
But on February 10 , 1998 , the President finally realized victory .
By a vote of 75 - 23 , anti-gun Republicans teamed up with the Democrats to kill the filibuster over the Satcher nomination .
Mr. Satcher was later confirmed by a vote of 63 - 35 .
Since the key vote was to end the filibuster , that is the one that was rated by GOA .
9 . Ending the filibuster of a major anti-gun crime bill
On July 28 , 1999 , the Senate ended a filibuster led by Senator Bob Smith ( I - NH ) — a filibuster intended to keep anti-gun crime legislation from progressing any further .
After the 77 - 22 vote , the Senate moved to send the language of the anti-gun Senate crime bill ( S. 254 ) to a House - Senate conference committee .
Thompson voted to break the pro-gun filibuster .
10 .
Young adult gun ban
The young adult gun ban could severely punish parents who allow their kids to even touch a so - called semi-automatic “ assault weapon . ”
While the amendment allows for certain exemptions , there are some imponderable questions which NO senator could answer , but which a parent would have to answer in order to avoid incarceration .
For example :
What is a “ semiautomatic assault weapon ” ?
The definition , plus exemptions , takes up six pages of fine print in the U.S. Code .
Second , a child can handle a banned semi-auto if he is in the “ immediate and supervisory presence ” of a parent or if he possess a written permission slip from the parent .
But what happens when , during a target practice session , the parent walks to the car to retrieve his lunch and the juvenile is no longer in the parents “ immediate ” presence and does not have a permission slip ?
A parent can receive jail time for this infraction .
The provision passed the Senate on May 13 , 1999 , with Thompson voting in the majority .
11 . Adopting the “ Gun Control Lite ” strategy
On May 13 , 1999 , a majority of Senators — including Thompson — defeated a motion to table ( or kill ) an anti-gun amendment introduced by Senators Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) and Larry Craig ( R - WY ) .
This amendment was offered as an alternative to gun control proposals being pushed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg .
12 . McCain ’s Incumbent Protection ( 2000 version )
By 59 to 41 , the Senate passed S. 27 , to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act to include Incumbent Protection provisions .
The bill severely curtails the ability of outside groups such as GOA to communicate the actions of incumbent politicians to members and supporters prior to an election .
13 . Incumbent Protection ( 2002 failed filibuster )
This was the key vote in the Senate regarding the odious Incumbent Protection bill in 2002 ( H.R. 2356 ) .
The legislation finally became law that year .
As he had on previous occasions , Thompson voted in favor of the bill .

Pentagon plans base along Iran border RAW STORY
Published : Monday September 10 , 2007
Print This Email This The Pentagon is preparing to build a base near the Iraq - Iran border in an effort to stem the flow of " advanced Iranian weaponry " to Shiite militants in Iraq , according to Monday 's edition of the Wall Street Journal .
" The push also includes construction of fortified checkpoints on the major highways leading from the Iranian border to Baghdad and the installation of X - ray machines and explosives - detecting sensors at the only formal border crossing between Iran and Iraq , " the Journal said .
The move comes amid continuing reports of US plans to strike Iran and several weeks after a RAW STORY report which signaled that the US had shifted its focus from Iran 's alleged nuclear weapons program to its alleged shipment of IEDs across the Iraq - Iran border as the principal rationale in selling a possible attack .
 There is clear evidence that someone in Iran is manufacturing the EFPs ,  a source currently working with military and intelligence joint operations in the Middle East told RAW STORY .
 They have a distinctive signature .
These devices are being used against US troops , Sunnis , and even some Shi'as . 
 This is viewed by some in the Bush Administration as sufficient justification for taking military action against Iran ,  said the source , who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the topic .
In its report Monday , the Journal echoed the US argument that Iran is funneling weapons to extremists in Iraq .
" Gen. Petraeus is expected to warn that Iran is expanding its attempts to destabilize Iraq by providing Shiite extremists with lethal weaponry such as advanced roadside bombs capable of breaching even the strongest U.S. armor , " the Journal says .
" U.S. commanders say that Iranian - made weaponry is used in an increasing percentage of attacks on U.S. forces , and that Shiite extremists are now responsible for as many anti-American attacks as Sunni radicals . "
Iran denies supplying weapons to Iraqi militants .
Intelligence officials have told RAW STORY that some weapons manufactured in Iran -- including explosively formed penetrators , armor - piercing bombs -- are killing American troops in Iraq .
Officials caution , however , that there is no evidence these devices are manufactured by the Iranian government or that the government knows of their shipment .
The new U.S. base is to be built about four miles from the Iranian border .
The U.S. officer overseeing the project , Maj . Toby Logsdon , " says that the new base will have living quarters for at least 200 soldiers .
He hopes U.S. forces will begin living at the new outpost in November . "
" Iran will know this is here -- they will have to rethink how they do things , and the smugglers will have to rethink how they do things , " he told the Journal .
" The challenge of preventing Shiite militants from smuggling weaponry and explosives across the largely porous Iraqi - Iranian border was apparent on a recent visit to Wasit , a sparsely populated Iraqi province that abuts the long border between the two countries , " the paper adds .
" There is no fence or wall separating Iran and Iraq , and the border itself is unmarked . "
The full registration - restricted article is available here .
North Korea ’s public reaction prompted speculation about a possible link to the Syrian target , though whether the target involved nuclear activity , missiles or something else remained unknown to all but a handful of officials briefed on what had happened .
This week China abruptly canceled a new round of diplomatic talks that had been planned to discuss a schedule for disbanding North Korea ’s nuclear facilities under a deal negotiated in February .
It is not clear when those talks may resume .
Mr. Bush said Thursday that the United States expected the North Koreans “ to honor their commitment to give up weapons and weapons programs , and to the extent that they are proliferating , we expect them to stop that proliferation . ”
Some current and former American officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because information about the raid remained classified , said they believed that the site was involved in Syria ’s missile program .
They said that Israeli intelligence officials believed that they had evidence that the activity at the site involved North Korean engineers believed to work in the nuclear program .
So far , several current and former American officials who have been involved in evaluating the Israeli claims say they are not yet convinced of a nuclear connection .
Yet the enormous secrecy around the findings , both here and in Israel , suggests that the activity that prompted the Israeli attack involved “ more than a run - of - the - mill missile transaction , ” one official said , noting that the Israelis took considerable risks in carrying out the attack .
“ The Israelis are very proud of what they are doing ; they are boasting about it , ” said one senior American official who has been dealing with Israeli officials .
“ But we do n’t know enough yet about what they actually hit . ”
In Israel , military censors have prohibited the press from reporting any details , while Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s government has succeeded in remaining silent about the raid .
The head of Israel ’s military intelligence , Gen . Amos Yadlin , appeared to refer to the matter obliquely when he told the cabinet that Israel had “ restored its deterrence ” in the region .
Many think that Agile teams all work in “ common rooms " , but the truth is not so simple .
We forget that the classic XP teamroom layout was called “ caves and commons ” and it explicitly recommended that people have access to some personal space , as well .
Teams find out fast enough that some of the facilities and creature comforts left behind in our former traditional spaces were there for good reasons .
When working with Agile , working close together and without interruption , it 's more important than ever to affirm the needs of human beings for healthy and effective workspaces .
To that end , this article shares the collected wisdom of dozens of teams , as collected by several experienced Agile coaches .
The Problem with Meetings
Over time , traditional software teams can become oblivious to the time they dedicate to activities like making meeting invitations , reviewing email , looking for meeting rooms , and waiting for stragglers to finally arrive .
These are the necessary evils of teamwork in large organizations .
However as teams move toward a fully Agile approach , these inconveniences are raised to the level of major obstacles :
You do n’t want to have to wait to find a meeting room that ’s available in order to get some modeling done .
You do n’t want to have to worry about somebody erasing your whiteboards , or throwing your index cards in the garbage .
I ’ve worked in several companies where there was a severe shortage of space , where we would have to wait for days to find meeting rooms .
Progress ground to a halt .
-- Scott Ambler [ 1 ]
War Rooms , Team Rooms , Bullpens
The classic solution , and a key strategy to support and foster Agility , is co-location .
The “ osmotic communication ” which buys Agile teams immediate feedback within the team relies on team members working within the same visual and auditory space .
The idea of teams working in an entirely new type of space often comes as a shock to the organization .
But while some teams have trouble getting management to replace cubicles with tables and whiteboards , other teams suffer equally when eager ( or scheming ) managers remove not only cubicle walls but also other facilities long deemed important to team morale and function .
This may be done innocently , not realizing what is lost ; or with an eye to reclaiming space in a congested building , a sacrifice demanded of the team in exchange for the open space they need .
Look Before You Leap
It 's important to look around before eliminating an existing space .
We can become so used to our surroundings that we no longer notice what 's really going on .
Take the time to notice how things work : where are people going when they are not at their desks ?
Not every absence is for a meeting .
People run errands , take walks , confer with other departments , and reappear with drinks , markers , printouts , and new facts .
Think of the entire calendar year if your location has changing weather : team members will bring their coats , gym bags , umbrellas and motorcycle helmets in with them .
Determine how much space each person really needs : both at their workstation and elsewhere in their team space .
A single person 's workspace , for example , probably should n't be less than 25 square feet .
This calculation is especially important when two are pairing at a single workstation , where it 's tempting to " save space " , but people still each need their own space and teamwork will suffer if it's not provided , as people inevitably get on each others ' nerves .
In general , a collaborative team space accomodates no more than half the number people it would if arranged as a conference room .
As teams move to a collaborative style , consider the activities they 'll need to handle in their spaces .
People will still need to handle sensitive , or personal , phone calls and emails .
New collaborative tools like flip charts , whiteboards , bulletin boards and projection screens require extra planning to remain unobstructed and useable .
And when many people and computers share a single space , ventilation becomes more important than ever .
Care and Feeding of an Agile Team
It 's important that , at the beginning , someone be tasked with watching for and following up on infrastructure problems .
This seems simple , but the team is sometimes so engrossed in learning new practices and working in unaccustomed ways that they neglect such details , not realizing that these are in fact contributing to their difficulties .
Common problems can be as simple as putting a programmer at risk for back pain or tendonitis by using a keyboard at the wrong height , easily resolved with an under - table keyboard tray .
Some team members strain their eyes against window glare on their monitor – again , easily fixed by moving a workstation or providing filters on windows or screens .
People will , at first , sacrifice their lunch hour to make important personal calls .
As the team progresses and their work achieves a regular rhythm , these accomodations become inadequate and grate on the nerves .
Team self organization also means that food and drink are likely to appear in the workplace – by way of celebration or to facilitate collaboration at key moments .
Over time candy tends to be replace with fruit and other healthy snacks that take up space .
A cramped workplace that makes this awkward hampers the flow of teamwork and team building – a little extra table space is a simple device to foster team creativity .
Obstacle removal is a key function of the team coach , ScrumMaster , or PM .
Obstacles related to the team space should be prioritized near the top of the team 's obstacle list , and should be resolved early on .
While it may be tough to quantify the impact of inappropriate working conditions , again and again we 've seen significant increases in teamwork , and hence effectiveness , once these obstacles are resolved .
Elements of a Humane Workspace
After so many years of using professionally designed work spaces , teams sometimes “ throw out the baby with the bathwater ” when they start over from scratch with their own designs .
Elements like light , air , traffic flow , noise , refreshments and comfort are not negligible : high productivity teams still consist of people , not robots , and these hard working people can be enabled or discouraged by the spaces in which they work .
It 's true that motivated teams have been known to work in the weirdest , most disadvantaged locations .
However , when a team commits to increasing their delivery of business value using Agile methods , it is appropriate for them to ask management to support the needs of their new collaborative work style appropriately .
Here is some advice on creating spaces that work , from coaches who have seen many and varied team spaces , in both successful and unsuccessful arrangements .
Mishkin Bertieg has blogged about 8 important areas to consider when creating a healthy and effective work space .
While some of these may seem obvious , we 've seen them compromised again and again .
Light , Air , Nature :
An appropriate amount of natural light , air circulation and live plants are excellent ways to make a space suitable for human occupation .
Layout : People need to be able to face each other and work beside each other .
They also need a semi-private space to have discussions or make phone calls .
The walls of the space need to have large areas that can be used for whiteboards .
Ergonomics : Good chairs , tables at an appropriate height , and the flexibility to allow individual ergonomic needs to be accommodated .
Privacy : Everyone needs to be able to get away for short amounts of time .
Some organizations provide separate mini conference rooms or “ hotelling ” spaces .
Others allow staff to keep a private cubicle away from the team room .
Personalization :
The space a person occupies needs to be flexible and personalized .
People need space for pictures , toys , plants , and other incidentals to help them make a space their own .
Visibility to Outsiders :
Other people in the organization need to be able to walk by to see and hear what is going on with the Agile Work team .
Open doors , windows or a “ bullpen ” formation of cubicles all allow this .
Convenience : Washrooms , coffee , printers and other common services must be easily accessible .
The team should not be set off and isolated far away from everything else .
Noise :
The team will be noisy .
Make sure that other people outside the team room are far enough away or isolated in some way from the noise .
It can be hard to balance this with convenience and visibility .

Support for Agile Modeling
Agile teams use a variety of methods to increase collaboration .
A common one is the move away from formal intermediate documentation .
This approach is worth planning for explicitly : when replacing heavy documents with models on whiteboards and other information radiators , teams suddenly discover the needs for lots of wall space , for example , or for different electronic aids .
Scott Ambler has written in depth about specific factors teams should consider if they are moving toward Agile Modeling .
Here are some key points from his more detailed article :
Significant whiteboard space : whiteboards floor to ceiling wherever empty wall exists , even on support pillars if they ’re more than a foot ( 30 cm ) or so in width .
Developers should have their own private whiteboard space .
Digital camera : to take snapshots of your modeling artifacts .
Common uses : to display them on internal web pages describing your project , to capturing images of paper - based models ... or simply to capture a permanent copy of a diagram so it may be placed under version control .
Modeling supplies : the practice Use The Simplest Tools suggests that you work with the simplest tool that will get the job done , therefore you need ... ready access to whiteboard marker , Post - It Notes ( have different colors and different sizes ) , index cards ( you may also want different colors and sizes as well ) , writing paper , flip - charts , tape , stick pins , string , and whatever other modeling supplies that your team requires .
A bookshelf or storage cabinet : to store your modeling supplies and reference books .
Large table : some techniques , such as Class Responsibility Collaborator ( CRC ) modeling , require a large table to work on .
Computer : having a computer in your modeling area can often prove advantageous , particularly ... to access previous models that have been placed under version control ...
Make sure you get a good one because you do n’t want a group of people waiting on a machine .
Wall space to attach paper : ... somewhere where you can attach paper artifacts .
Projector : i f you are going to have a computer in your working area you should also consider having a projector so you can display images on the wall .
This promotes communication because everyone can see the information .
Toys : something to play with in your hands can help you to get “ unstuck ” when you ’re working .

A Real Example :
An Agile Teamroom Wishlist
Over time , organizations with many teams may want to formulate a list for the " ideal " team room , to help facilities staff in creating more team spaces .
Resist the temptation to tightly define this : constraints and team needs will be different each time , and you must leave room for creativity .
Any formula you create should focus on the goals , the needs to be met , not the means .
Here is list compiled by Joseph Little with a team of coaches for a particular organization , based on lessons learned after a dozen teams had struggled to create suitable spaces with varying degrees of success .
This is specific to the needs of a given business : with its own hardware , teleworking , and space constraints .
What 's really important when reading this list is the human considerations , not the specific details .
Note the phrasing : it 's intended as a basis for discussion , not a ransom note .
And it is critically important to allow teams to participate in the design of their own spaces , which will naturally lead to new ideas and uniquely customized spaces .
This last pointer is all too often skipped over in the name of " efficiency " , so it 's worth restating .
Involve team members in the design of their own space , to eliminate obvious stumbling blocks that will hamper their work in early iterations .
The gains in morale and productivity outweigh the cost of their involvement .
Here is Joe 's list :
Our Agile Team Room Wishlist
Note that there are other ways of accomplishing the underlying goals ; we can pursue other alternatives if we cannot have these ideal conditions .
Room size :
In one successful case , we had 9 monitors / docking stations ( for laptops ) set up in a room with a “ maximum occupancy ” of 20 people .
The room is rather large and gives space for people to “ live ” together for an extended period .
This seems about right and comfortable for a team that is almost 100 % dedicated ( ie , in the room most of the day ) .
Team Privacy : privacy from , say , hall traffic .
Constant outside noise distracts and stresses the team ; this also suggests that team conversations are carrying outside the team room , not a good idea .
Individual Privacy : Ensure there is a place to make personal phone calls or do sensitive work ( ex : filing a health claim or writing a performance review ) .
Light , Ventilation : the needs for these are much greater when the Team is in the room all the time .
Fans :
Teams want these for when the A/C goes out , which has happened again recently .
Creative Space :
This is hard one to describe , but important .
At a minimum , the space should not be dull and depressing .
Ideally the colors and other aspects should support creativity .
Docking Stations :
The docking stations add value , but also take up room .
They need to work with all , not just some , of the team 's laptops , and must have network connectivity .
Think through exactly what the new team will need in advance .
For teams using pair programming : we recommend large ( 23 inch ) flatscreen monitors , connected to the docking stations .
White Boards :
The room should be covered with whiteboards .
Magnetic whiteboards are expensive , but quite key .
Obviously whiteboards require markers and erasers .
Need at least 300 tiny multi-colored magnets .
Flip Charts and stand : preferably with large “ post - it note ” paper , and space in the room for it .
Polycom speaker phone : maybe two ( if a large room ) .
Land lines : several phones to allow people to make and receive phone calls , with speaker phone capability .
Placement of phones should be balanced : at least two of the phones should be placed on the center table , others at the “ edges ” of the people space .
Cards : Start with 400 cards in multiple colors .
( 25 % should be 4x6 ” , the rest 3x5 ” )
Outlets :
We need network access ( via the docking stations ) , outlets for land lines , and .
electrical outlets .
Remember that people will move around , we need more outlets than people .
There are cheap ways to protect the team from tripping on cords running to a central table .
Tables :
A mixture of small and large tables ( or small tables that can easily be put together ) .
Usually arranged as one big table ( for 6 - 8 people ) in the middle , and several small tables around .
One small round table , for small adhoc meetings of 2 - 3 people .
Large Wall Clock : so all can see when the stand - up will start or when meetings will reconvene .
Wireless Internet : so visitors from other departments can connect .
Printer : A good laser printer should be in the room , or very close , including paper up to 11x17 .
Small Conference Rooms : either : ( a ) a quiet space within the Team room for conferences ( eg , provide more space or one adjacent with low walls ) – this works if it is a very large room compared to team size , or ( b ) two small conference rooms very nearby that are dedicated to the team .
Place to hang coats and leave outer footwear ( in winter ) .
Space for storage of personal stuff . : could be under - desk filing cabinets or a large horizontal filing cabinet .
More of this is necessary with contractors or other “ mobile ” team members who have nowhere else to put their things .
Desktop PC : that can be used for miscellaneous purposes ( developer testing , integration of code , etc ) .
Calendars : a few big calendars ( monthly views ) that can be written on .
Digital Camera : saves lots on documentation time .
Can be shared with another near - by team .
Must be easy to download pictures to the laptop .
Small Fridge – A small refrigerator in the room ( or nearby ) where cold water and soda is stored .

Plan to Learn
Hopefully managers , team members and other leaders will collaborate to create the best team space they can , given their resources and perceived constraints .
Of course , a month in the new space is sure to reveal surprises and errors in judgement .
Do n't forget to apply the " Retrospective Prime Directive " when looking back on what you 've created : everyone did the best they could at the time .
Continue to consider your workspace when each retrospective asks : " what should we change ? "
When you discover a better way , act on it quickly , and do n't forget to celebrate your successful changes when the retrospective asks " what worked well ? " .
Remember that you do n't need to imagine everything up front - you can tweak it with each iteration .
But big , immovable and expensive items are definitely worth considering up - front to allow lead time - too often we see teams ready to go long before their workspace is .
Be aware that what you learn might just include : " we ca n't do this here " .
Be realistic , and be prepared to defend what your team really needs to reach high productivity .
If you can't get it , you may need to design a hybrid , semi-Agile process - but be sure to make it known that the full gains of Agility probably wo n't be achieved .
It 's just not worth it to have a high - performance team hampered by a poor workstation setup .
-- Mishkin Berteig [ 2 ]
I ’ve seen lack of basic resources such as decent chairs , tables , food , drink , and top - notch workstations dramatically hamper software development efforts .
If your project team is being nickel - and - dimed to death then I have to question if your project is important to your organization – if it is n’t , cancel it now and invest your efforts on something more productive .

What motivates humankind to burrow deep into the Earth ?
From London to Paris , Budapest to Moscow , the USA to Australia , here are seven of the most amazing examples in the world .
Some were built for military defense or shelter , many are abandoned while others thrive .
These amazing images feature tunnels , caverns , crypts an labyrinths from seven underground location around the world , following the acclaimed 7 Underwater Wonders and 7 Abandoned Wonders of the World from our 7 Wonders Series .
Paris , France :
There are extensive networks of catacombs , quarries and other tunnels running under the capital of France .
Some of these amazing photographs were taken by urban explorers who lit the scenes with candles , producing remarkable image effects .
The other images show the work of Paris General of Police from the late 18th Century , when disease led the city to bury bones underground in unused quarries rather than risk further infection of the population .
Moscow , Russia :
This particular photographer is uniquely privileged , as an official government photographer , to take rare looks and snapshots of the myriad tunnels of all kinds running underneath Moscow .
Clearly he does a great deal of post - production work , giving these images an air of surreality .
Still , they are incredibly impressive and show a compelling range of locations .
London , England : The West Norwood Cemetery has a remarkable collection of historic monuments .
Even more fascinating , however , are the catacombs below the chapel on site .
As these images show , there is a remarkable collection of coffins in spaces of various sizes .
The mahogany coffins have largely survived the test of time , while the pine ones have not fared quite as well .
All in all , a beautiful collection , and largely left to wear naturally with time .
Ozarks , Midwest : The Ozark mountain range is filled with caverns and mines that date back generations .
They are perhaps most famous for being the site where Radium was discovered shortly after radioactive elements were beginning to be understood in Europe .
These more recent explorers featured here have certainly shown dedication , bringing along a raft to use flooded areas .
Budapest , Hungary : A labyrinth of caves and tunnels span for miles under Castle Hill .
These are believed to date back many centuries and to have been created for military purposes , and were more recently used as an air - raid shelter during World War II .
Visitors are now allowed on two kinds of tours : a flashlight tour and fully lit tour .
The aged walls and arches are something to behold .

Orlando , Florida :
For a long time , mysteries circulated about tunnels underneath the so - called Magic Kingdom .
As it turns out , the rumors were true : Disney World has an extensive system of underground passages used my employees to travel quickly and discreetly from place to place .
These highly private tunnels are large enough to accommodate vehicles as well as pedestrians , and connect a series of offices , kitchens , cafeterias , storage and break rooms , which all lurk below the glittering facade of the world ’s most famous theme park .
Coober Pedy , Australia :
This small town in the middle of nowhere , Australia , is home to some of the strangest houses on Earth .
A combination of climactic conditions and the existence of opal mining in the region have literally driven the residents underground .
Everything from residences to churches are carved out of the ground as the above images show .
The place is something of a tourist attraction , with underground hotels as well as a golf course above ground – though golf is played at night due to the regional heat !

As many as 95 per cent of CCTV systems in the UK are operating illegally , according to a CCTV expert .
The revelation comes as new legislation is about to take effect in Scotland which could render even more systems illegal .
Companies whose premises have CCTV systems in operation must alert the Information Commissioner that they are gathering personal information about the people they are recording .
They must also put up signs to warn the public that recording is taking place .
A new law will come into force in Scotland on 1 November requiring those operating systems on a contract to have a separate licence .
The law , which is already in effect in England and Wales , does not apply to operators working directly for the company whose premises are being surveyed .
Bernie Brooks of CCTV compliance consultancy DatPro told OUT - LAW
Radio that he comes across few systems that operate within the law .
" From my own my experience after personally surveying many , many hundreds of buildings , I would say probably less than five per cent are compliant , " said Brooks .
" I would say that 95 per cent are non-compliant in one way , shape , form or another with the [ Data Protection ]
Act .
Obviously , that 's quite a worrying thing .
If the system is non-compliant it could invalidate the usefulness of the evidence in a court of law . "
Brooks 's assessment matches that of non-profit CCTV awareness raising body Camerawatch .
It said in June that its research showed that over 90 per cent of the UK's 4.2 million CCTV systems were not compliant with the Data Protection Act .
" That has profound implications for the reputation of the CCTV and camera surveillance industry and all concerned with it , " said Camerawatch chairman Gordon Ferrie in June .
The new law in Scotland could push even more systems into illegal territory .
The new licences for individuals is operated by the Security Industry Authority ( SIA ) .
" If you operate CCTV equipment monitoring public or private space and you are monitoring members of the public then it is likely you will need a SIA licence , " said SIA head of investigations Jennifer Pattinson .
" The reason for licensing is to remove the criminal element from the private security industry but also to improve levels of training and professionalism in the industry . "
People who work directly for the firm which owns the monitored premises do not need a licence .
Pattinson said that this was because companies which directly employ security workers are likely to conduct the kind of thorough background checks that it does when issuing a licence .
The news that almost all systems are likely to operate illegally will raise questions about the effectiveness of CCTV .
The news follows the revelation last week that London 's dense network of CCTV cameras may not have an effect on the solving of crimes .
An analysis of London 's 10,000 cameras showed that boroughs with many cameras had no better crime - solving statistics than those with few cameras .

For nearly two decades , the Thatcherite dictum that " there is no alternative " has been used to stifle serious challenge to the way the world is run , and right now there seems to be an increasingly urgent insistence that there is only one possible social and economic future for us all .
It is n't just the hard men of the moneyed right asserting that capitalism is the only way to order human affairs .
Liberals are also now unshakeably convinced that there can be no alternative to capitalism - unless perhaps it is a collapse into some variety of barbarism .
Timothy Garton
Ash recently declared here that " global capitalism now has no serious rivals - but it could destroy itself " while Martin Kettle pronounced socialism incontrovertibly dead with no prospect of a second coming .
And the latest issue of Prospect magazine polls 35 intellectual movers - and - shakers on " what 's next " for a world moving beyond left and right .
Only the historian Eric Hobsbawm and US academic Andrew Moravcsik believe that left and right will remain " plainly central " , in Hobsbawm 's words in the new century .
From the rest , we get dystopian warnings of technocracy defeating democracy , new forms of terrorism , random use of nuclear weapons , more God , even something dubbed by Michael Lind the " war of Patria vs Plutopia " .
The philosopher Jonathan Rée summed it up best : " We are now facing a crisis both of hope and of serious collective argument . "
That is certainly true of many intellectuals - though , judging by opinion polls , less so of the wider public - but perhaps they have buried left and right and embraced the new world order too soon .
As in most of the rest of the world , the gap between rich and poor in Britain has grown under a Labour government .
Privatised industries have turned out to be ramshackle rip - offs .
Women are still paid far less than men , Britain 's children are the most deprived in the western world , fascists are winning council seats and workers can get sacked in a canteen by megaphone .
And that 's before we get on to the neo-colonialism which is making a catastrophic comeback , amid bloodshed and racism .
But our opinion - forming and governing classes have evidently convinced themselves that no form of socialism has anything to do with solving the problems of the world today .
A litany of crises like these would once have had Blairite stalwarts like Charles Clarke and Alan Milburn condemning the system that generated them .
But we can be confident that there will be no discussion of any alternative to the private ownership and control of our resources or of a transfer of economic and political power to the majority in the phoney Clarke - Milburn " debate " on Labour 's future .
This silencing of the S - word might make sense if capitalism , having been given the whole world to itself to do its worst with for the last generation , was delivering the economic , social , moral and environmental goods .
Maybe not , the post - socialist would say , but the economics have been settled , with capitalism leaving socialism a distant second in the prosperity race .
And anyway , even to the extent that socialism once had something useful to say , the world has now changed out of all recognition .
This is dodgy history and worse futurology .
The Britain of the 1960s and 1970s was only socialist in the nightmares of capitalists , but it had some of the elements which made for a better society .
Public ownership and full , stable , employment underpinned not merely high levels of economic growth , but also a radical improvement in the lives of the working class , protected by a strong trade unionism which , while far from as mighty as subsequent myth - making has suggested , did at least prevent those at the bottom being pushed around at will by those at the top .
Even the Soviet Union 's place in history looks different depending where you stand .
Russians today miss its relative egalitarianism , welfare and public economic control , not to mention the more stable inter-ethnic relations , if not the one - party authoritarianism .
Meanwhile in Venezuela , for the first time in a generation , there is a government committed to establishing socialism .
Of course , the movie can't be rewound .
Twenty - first century socialism in Britain or elsewhere cannot look east for inspiration , nor will it be the work of coal - miners and shipyard workers .
But what could it offer ?
For a start , socialism makes possible the re-establishment of democracy whether at national , multinational or global level .
Capitalist globalisation has become synonymous with democratic powerlessness as all important decisions are taken further away from the people affected and concentrated in the hands of ever fewer corporate bosses , private equity and publicly traded alike , for whom the common weal cannot be their priority .
It also raises the prospect of a more peaceful world .
The idea that unchallenged capitalism meant universal peace - quite popular in the early 1990s - hardly takes much debunking now .
A system that replaced fighting for scarce resources with the global management of them offers the chance both of sparing lives and of the decisive action necessary to save the planet .
And there is social justice .
There is little sign of gender or race inequality within countries , or between the rich world and the poor , being eroded , much less eliminated , despite recent global growth .
Rather the opposite .
If you think greater inequality is fine , then you 'd better get back to your hedge fund desk .
But there are far more people in trade unions and the anti-war movement than there are selling guns to despots or trading oil futures .
And of course there is an alternative .

This is the twelfth progress report from the Wide Finder Project .
It exists to host the excellent discussion so far from others ; see the comments .
My Notes So Far · Check out the results , which I think are remarkable ; JoCaml , a concurrent variant of a language often regarded as a CS - research toy , totally wiped the carpet with all other contenders .
Near the top is a thread - oblivious implementation in Python , a language with no particular concern for concurrency .
What do you think ?
If your thoughts are material , write ’em in your own space and link from the comments .
I do have one specific question , which I hope to address at length :
Which of these programs is the best ?
Now let ’s turn to others ’ contributions ; they are definitely worth reading :
Why is it that most of our prisons are denying prisoners the right to have computers in their cells ?
Quite rightly people in prison are denied access to a great many of the privileges that people on the outside take for granted , but the denial of the right to a PC " in possession " should not be one of them .
Being computer literate is a vital requirement for so many areas of everyday activity these days .
When it comes to getting on in life , in education , vocational training , jobs , careers or even just social communication - in the digital age anyone lacking PC skills is guaranteed to lag behind their computer literate brethren .
The main argument against computers in prison cells is " security " - the assumption being , I guess , that if they were allowed such a facility people in prison could not be trusted not to " abuse the privilege " .
There is no reason however why suitable security procedures could not be set in place to ensure appropriate use .
Where there is a will there is a way .
Or perhaps it is the will that is lacking , too many prison governors fearing that computers in cells will " send the wrong message ? "
A few months after I started writing my column , A Life Inside , for the Guardian some seven years ago , I asked the governor of the prison I was in if I could have a word processor sent in by supportive friends .
" Oh no , " he said after a sharp intake of breath .
" The public would n't like that . "
I was n't sure how exactly they would find out , and if they did I could always hope that there were some who would see it as an aid to a successful reintegration into society if I ever were to be released .
" But word processing is a transferable work skill , " I said , " essential for a ( ahem ) writer . "
He still was n't convinced .
" We 've got to think about the climate out there , " he said pointing towards the local townsfolk .
And that was the end of the matter .
Yet in a previous higher security category prison , the governor had positively encouraged not only access to word processors , but also to computers .
Many prisoners
I knew there had been allowed to have laptops for use in their cells handed in by family or friends who could afford it .
Forward thinking
There was an element of unfairness on those whose supporters could not afford such an expense - but at least the governor was trying to be forward thinking .
Instead of looking forward now however , too many governors , perhaps with the tacit agreement of the government , are turning their backs on what should be an obvious practical use of prison time .
With ever increasing numbers of people in prison living with literacy and general educational deficiencies and overcrowding placing unprecedented demand on the ever limited resources of the prison system , never has there been a better time to provide prisoners with computers , in their cells , and to ensure fairness and equality , why not meet the cost ?
It might not be so expensive .
Currently prisons provide televisions for the vast majority of prisoners to enjoy in their cells at a cost of around £ 50.00 per unit .
That 's around $ 100.00 at current exchange rates .
Well why does n't somebody from the prison service get in touch with the OLPC - the One Laptop Per Child association ?
The OLPC , a USA based non-profit organisation , is currently promoting a quiet revolution in computer accessibility by attempting to ensure that all children , particularly those from underdeveloped countries , have access to a laptop .
If all goes according to plan the computer in question , the XO - 1 , will soon be available for under $ 100.00 .
The idea is that governments purchase the laptops and issue impoverished children one each .
The computer is of a rugged construction , heat and water resistant - ideal therefore for the unpredictability of prison life .
And in case there is a fear that prisoners might try to access inappropriate internet sites ( that is if governors were prepared to go a step further and allow internet access ) - fear not .
The OLPC has introduced built - in filters .
The obstacles in the way of successful reintegration for prisoners once they have been released are many , not least of which is simply being a convicted criminal .
A chance to learn how to use a computer effectively while in prison might just provide a step up so that other possibilities come into view .
Denying prisoners ' access to technology for vague and untenable reasons is a sad failure on the part of the prison system .
It might not be popular with " the public " to begin with , but we could do worse than start a new prison initiative - the OLPP - One Laptop Per Prisoner .
It would be much more constructive use of taxpayers money and prisoners ' time than in - cell television and could change the direction of future penal philosophy .
In a report sure to further complicate the U.S. - led drive for additional sanctions against Iran , the atomic watchdog agency of the United Nations has given Iran relatively good marks for its recent cooperation in clearing up suspicions over past nuclear work .
" Iran has provided sufficient access to individuals and has responded in a timely manner to questions and provided clarifications and amplifications on issues raised , " the International Atomic Energy Agency said .
The report was acquired by a Washington think tank , the Institute for Science and International Security , and released Thursday on its website .
The IAEA said it had been " able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . "
However , the agency warned that its understanding of Iran 's current nuclear operations " is diminishing " because of Tehran 's earlier decision not to follow a separate IAEA protocol that would permit more extensive inspections .
The Vienna - based agency also termed Iran 's cooperation " reactive rather than proactive " and said the probe of Tehran 's once secret nuclear history would continue .
Also worrisome : Media reports suggest that Tehran recently denied IAEA requests to interview at least two Iranians about their nuclear work .
That raises concern within the Bush administration that IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei , who has suggested that it is unrealistic to bar Iran from uranium enrichment , is too eager to put a positive spin on Iran 's cooperation .
In particular , agency investigators are still waiting for Iranian explanations and documents about uranium contamination at a technical university , the operations of a uranium mine , and alleged studies related to atomic weapons research , including high - explosive testing and the design of a missile re-entry vehicle .
Just last week , the IAEA received from Iranian officials a copy of a 15 - page document laying out how to reduce uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal and cast it into hemispheres — in the fashion of a nuclear bomb .
Why Iran had not shared the document earlier received no explicit comment .
The Bush administration and most of its European allies say the report will not prevent them from seeking a third , tougher round of sanctions at the U.N. Security Council .
The British Foreign Office called on Tehran to " come clean " on unresolved issues " without delay . "
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said , " We believe that collective cooperation is not good enough ....
And unfortunately , this report makes clear that Iran seems uninterested in working with the rest of the world . "
But Russia and China , which have resisted more sanctions and cited the new Iranian - IAEA cooperation as a reason to show patience , are likely to seize on the report to buttress their stand .
Skeptics believe that Iran has released documents bit by bit as part of an effort to delay more international penalties — and to split Russia and China from the West , if possible .
Iran said the report shows that new sanctions would be illegal and that the accusations against it are " baseless . "
The report was unequivocal in verifying that despite Security Council demands to the contrary , Iran is proceeding with uranium enrichment and construction of a heavy - water production plant , which would supply a heavy - water reactor capable of producing plutonium .
The IAEA found that Iran had installed nearly 3,000 centrifuges at its main uranium enrichment plant as of November 3 .
A group of six countries is seeking talks with Iran — but only if it first suspends work on making nuclear fuel .
Iran refuses .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said earlier this week that without a " positive outcome " from the IAEA report and another one from the European Union , he would advocate harsher sanctions , including hitting Iran 's oil , gas , and financial sectors .
Amazon 's new Kindle device , dubbed by some as the ' iPod of reading , ' has been shipping in limited quantities since its introduction a few weeks ago .
AppleInsider is preparing a full review , and offers these quality unboxing photos in the meantime .
Despite early criticisms of the device and its $ 400 price tag , the Kindle electronic eBook reader sold out in just over 5 hours following its debut on November 19th , a representative for Amazon told AppleInsider .
Since then , the device has taken a beating from the mainstream media .
Early reviews have expressed general appreciation for Amazon 's run at a fresh concept but fault the retailer 's inexperience in developing consumer electronics for the device 's clunky and cumbersome user experience .
Still , Amazon has managed to remain completely backlogged on new orders and is warning customers that they should not expect their Kindle in time for the holidays if they 're just now placing orders .
" Due to heavy customer demand , Kindle is temporarily sold out , " reads a message on the retailer 's website .
" Because we ship Kindles on a first - come , first - served basis , please ORDER NOW to reserve your place in line .
Your Kindle will not arrive by December 25th . "
IT ’S just grass , but do n’t tell Sheldon Lodmer , for whom the sight of a well - kept lawn borders on the transcendental .
“ It ’s very peaceful .
It reminds me of openness and cleanness , ” says Lodmer , whose home in the hills above Malibu ’s Zuma Beach is fronted by an expanse of fescue roomy enough to field an NFL scrimmage .
“ There ’s just something about the look .
It ’s very calming , ” says his wife Emily , gazing out from a second - floor window framing patches of brown rolling hills that lie beyond .
Brown , of course , is the normal shade of topography throughout the desert that is Southern California , but it ’s a hue that most people consider unthinkable for the yard .
A garden means the green , green grass of home , for crying out loud .
It ’s a feeling hard - wired into the Miracle - Gro souls of America .

Lawn trends : A July 5 story on lawns and other ground covers said Scotts Miracle - Gro is a $ 7 - billion company .
The correct figure is $ 2.7 billion .
The year ’s record low rainfall , however , may change all that .
As the debate builds over the future of the lawn in Southern California , landscaping and horticulture experts say more homeowners are breaking away from water - gobbling turf and replacing the requisite emerald carpet with cactus , native plant collections , synthetic turf or rock gardens .
The frontyard of one home in Woodland Hills is filled with decorative wood chips .
“ Brown is beautiful , especially during a drought , ” says Susan Tellem , who ripped out her lawn just a few blocks away from the Lodmers and left the rest to nature .
Standing in an accidental landscape of fallen leaves , dirt and the odd cactus and succulent , she calls homes that install monster amounts of sod “ a travesty . ”

“ These lawns suck up tremendous amounts of water to keep them green , ” she says .
“ Even more moronic are the rich and not - so - rich homeowners here who allow their gardeners to fertilize and mulch those damn lawns while they water the streets and driveways , causing tremendous runoff of toxic chemicals . ”
Interest in drought - tolerant landscapes has “ increased greatly , particularly in the last year , ” says Barbara Eisenstein , horticulture outreach coordinator for the Native Plant Garden Hotline , a collaboration between the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont .
The hotline provides expertise on sustainable gardens and helps homeowners reduce the amount of water and maintenance their yards require -- often by removing lawns .
About a third of all residential water use in the nation -- about 7.8 billion gallons of water annually -- goes to outdoor landscaping , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
In Southern California , the average family uses 500 gallons of water every day , one - third of which flows outside , according to the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power .
That ’s about 60,000 gallons a year per household , just for lawn and other landscaping .
Some parts of parched San Bernardino County have started mandating less turf .
In Victorville , lawns for new homes can’t take up more than 10 % of the property .
The Victor Valley Water District has a “ cash for grass ” program , offering 40 cents per square foot of lawn converted to a desert landscape .
Last month , Hesperia also began to restrict lawn size of new homes to a maximum of 20 % of frontyard space .

But any reexamination of lawn digs up more than entrenched Bermuda .
It reveals the extent to which this iconic garden feature has enamored a culture and permeated our suburban identity .
Walter Hrubesky tried to kick the turf habit .
Concerned about water usage , he planted succulents and cactuses in his Van Nuys frontyard , but the desert vista left him cold .
“ I did n’t like the looks of it , and I did n’t like going out in it , ” the retiree says .
So he switched back to grass .
Now his two grandkids run back and forth , fall on the lawn and love it .
They would n’t be able to do that with succulents , he points out .
Although Hrubesky feels guilty about watering his lawn , he says adamantly , “ I ’m not giving it up . ”
LAWN , some researchers suggest , is more than a custom .
They say humans are drawn to open , lush landscapes for safety and survival .
Lawns represent an oasis , albeit a denaturalized one , according to Paul Faulstich , who teaches environmental studies at Pitzer College in Claremont .
He has written that “ lawns represent the metaphorical waterhole in the parched savanna . ”

Lawns also tap primal notions of natural beauty .
“ People want to rationalize the landscape , ” says Jim Folsom , director of the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino .
“ The hauntingly beautiful vista or the garden of paradise is always a place where you have this rich texture surrounding you , but in it is an opening of Shakespearean glade .
There is something in our aesthetic that is pleased by these clearings .
A lawn fits into that .
It gives us this smooth , contemplative , quiet surface . ”
The color of turf is part of the attraction , beckoning us to the oasis on our doorsteps .
Green is a symbol of life and park - like calm ; in color psychology , green represents balance and stability .
“ For men , especially , the color green provides a deep sense of comfort , ” says “ The Organic Lawn Care Manual ” author Paul Tukey .
“ The color green is serene .
It lowers everybody ’s pulse . ”
The all - American lawn hails from waterlogged England and is n’t a natural fit for the climate extremes of the U.S.
It took the advent of grass hybrids and a concerted campaign by the Garden Club of America starting in the 1930s to sell the lawn as a badge of suburban affluence , a civic duty of sorts .
By the ‘ 50s the social norm of the lawn was fully entrenched .

Lawns would n’t have stuck around , though , if they did n’t serve practical needs .
Turf extends the living area outdoors .
It stabilizes the soil and keeps down dust and mud .
It ’s cooling in the summer .
You want to walk on it , barbecue near it , cartwheel over it .
“ There is nothing like the lawn for gathering , for play , ” Folsom says .
“ You can get playgrounds where they ’ve got those rubber chips , where they ’ve got sand , but none of those has the quality of a lawn .
“ If you ’re living in Southern California and you ’re putting all that water into a lawn , what you ’re investing in is a wonderful open surface for activity , for enjoyment . ”
For skeptical environmentalists who happen to be sports fans , he offers another comparison : the stadium outfitted with synthetic turf .

“ Now tell me , ” he says , “ which is a better carbon footprint : a lawn we ’re watering or a $ 250 - million space that we ’re air conditioning ? ”
For many of us , grass was our first stage on the world outside , the surface of our youth , and the associations run deep .
Emily Lodmer remembers her son squirting down the Slip ‘n Slide and the party in the frontyard for her daughter when she went away to graduate school .
Unlike the travails that play out in our indoor lives , turf is a reminder of unburdened days in the sun .
“ Those are the wings right there , ” Fran Arrowsmith says , pointing to the see - through propellers of a blue darner in a photo from her garden album .
The dragonfly is one of many visitors she and husband Bill have welcomed to their Torrance backyard since they dug up half the lawn and turned it into an 1,100 - square - foot native plant gallery .
Flame skimmer dragonflies , western tiger swallowtail butterflies , bees , hummingbirds and an aviary of winged drop-ins are regulars now but were n’t when the yard was all grass .
With a wending dirt trail and artfully arranged blooms wrapping around it , the garden looks like a scenic nature trail .
In fact , it does get tours , conducted by the California Native Plant Society .

A bright sun beats down as Bill and Fran detail the local color -- pinkish - red buckwheat , purple salvia and yellow - clustered mallow , among 100 - plus plants in the collection .
The salvia gets watered once a month ; the lupine and mallow have n’t needed a drink since April .
“ It just killed us to be watering all the time , ” says Bill , a retired TRW engineer like Fran .
“ Our primary reason for the garden was environmental . ”
Adds Fran :
“ The water situation is only going to get worse .
You look at the lowering of the reservoirs -- Mead , Powell -- we ’re going to be in real trouble . ”
Active in the campaign to preserve Madrona Marsh in Torrance , the Arrowsmiths decided to take their environmental work to their own backyard .
They immersed themselves in native plant courses and , with the direction of natural landscape designer Tony Baker , had most of their garden planted in two days .

The resulting profusion of greens and wildflower hues enhanced -- not sacrificed -- the garden ’s color .
They ’re so happy with the results , they ’re going to replace the turf in the frontyard .
“ It ’s not a choice between a green lawn and ugly cactus , ” Bill says .
The rich palette of native plants makes for the most competitive alternative yet to the classic lawn , and some communities are paying attention .
The city of Palm Desert is encouraging a mix of natives with gravel and rocks to combat “ nuisance ” runoff .
It has a pilot program to replace grass with desert plants , remove sod within 24 inches of the sidewalk or street , and install subterranean irrigation .

“ Overhead sprinklers cover more ground than they ’re designed for , ” says Spencer Knight , landscape manager for the city .
“ So we have water running down gutters that should be bone dry this time of year .
It ’s 112 out there . ”
Lawn care executive John Marshall blames faulty irrigation and broken sprinklers -- “ lawn geysers ” -- as the culprit in runoff .
“ Turf areas are very good at collecting water , filtering water and holding it in place , ” says Marshall , who ’s in charge of training at Scotts Miracle - Gro , a $ 7 - billion lawn - care company in Marysville , Ohio .
His keys to cutting landscape water consumption : better - informed sprinkler users and systems working properly .
Another factor that could cut water usage is , oddly enough , the backlash against lawn chemicals , which is driving demand for organic fertilizers , soil nutrients and other products .
Scotts ’ own organic line , launched in 2003 , is booming .
Advertisement
Andy Lopez , a landscaping entrepreneur in Malibu , converted the Lodmers ’ lawn to organic care and cut its water needs by half , he says .
“ There are lots of benefits from an organic lawn , ” he says , “ but there are no advantages to a chemical lawn . ”
For its part , the conventional lawn - care business counters that organic fertilizers are n’t free of risks .
If washed onto pavement , these nutrients flow into storm drains and may find their way into rivers and lakes , according to the industry group Planet , the Professional Landcare Network .
The group also says organic pesticide techniques are ineffective .
But Tukey , a “ self - confessed lawn junkie , ” became a leader in organic lawn care after he got seriously ill working with lawn chemicals .
He formed the organization SafeLawns.org to promote organically managed lawns , and today he and other advocates say organic lawns use one - third to one - half less water by feeding the soil , not the grass , as chemical products do .

“ Soccer moms do n’t want their kids rolling around on toxic lawns , ” Tukey says .
“ These pesticides and weed killers are toxic to children .
No one argues that . ”
THE Great American Lawn has come under scrutiny during other droughts , only to assume its place at the head of the porch when rainfall picks up again .
But with reservoirs falling and green consciousness rising , the public debate might finally be shifting for good .
“ Maybe we ought to be going for a new aesthetic , ” says the Huntington ’s Folsom .
“ Maybe you go to something that ’s more layered . ”
Lance Walheim , a California horticulturist and author of “ Lawn Care for Dummies , ” sees change ahead too .
Advertisement
“ For a long time we ’ve known we have too much lawn , ” he says .
He envisions a future with smaller lawns , more buffalo grasses and other varieties that suck up less water , as well as better use of sprinkler timers .
Finding a more sustainable landscape may also take the realization that the lawns where we played whiffle ball and dove into plastic pools are empty these days , that kids are lost in video games and MySpace , that parents are locked in workweeks without end .
We ’re not in lawn Kansas anymore .
As turf fan Tukey puts it , “ If the only time you see your lawn is on top of a mower , is n’t there something better to be done with a lawn ? ”

So some day , if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House , even by a tiny margin , they can impeach the President , without due process or fairness or any legal rights .
All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here — a lynching .
But we will WIN !
Neither crazed fiends not the dregs of white society , the bulk of the lynchers tended to be ordinary and respectable people , animated by a self - righteousness that justified their atrocities in the name of maintaining the social and racial order and the purity of the Anglo - Saxon race .
The mobs who meted out " summary justice ” were pronounced by one Georgian as " composed of our best citizens , who are foremost in all works of public and private good ” ….
Drawn from all classes in southern white society , from the " red- necks ” to the best people , ” lynchers came together in an impressive show of racial and community solidarity ….
But white solidarity almost always prevailed .
Townspeople closed ranks to protect their own kind , thereby becoming partners in the crimes committed .
Eyewitnesses refused to testify , and grand juries refused to bring indictments against easily identifiable mob participants ; even if they had , juries would have refused to convict , whatever the evidence .
Historian Ibram X. Kendi believes Donald Trump is the second most racist president in American history , ranking only behind Andrew Jackson .
Based on Trump ’s ongoing behavior , Kendi may need to re-evaluate that assessment .
On Tuesday , America ’s racist in chief managed to combine his lawlessness and white supremacy in a single tweet :
In the worst of ways , Donald Trump has shown himself once again to be a deft multitasker of ignorance , hate and authoritarianism .
Lawlessness : Donald Trump does not believe in the rule of law or the U.S. Constitution .
He has said as much , describing the Constitution as “ phony . ”
Impeachment is also one of the most important elements of the Constitution because it is the ultimate protection against a tyrant .
Trump and his regime , of course , do not believe that any substantive restrictions on the president ’s behavior exist — as long as the president is Donald Trump or another Republican .
White supremacy :
At least 4,000 black Americans were killed by white mobs and individuals in the extrajudicial killings known as lynchings across the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries .
This political terrorism was not confined to the South .
Black people were also lynched in states such as Indiana .
The goal of white - on - black racial terrorism was to intimidate and control black people who desired , struggled for and demanded their full human rights as citizens of the United States .
Racial pogroms and lynchings — especially what are known as “ spectacular lynchings , ” attended by hundreds or even thousands of white people — were a for of terrorism used by whites to intimidate and control black Americans .
Trump ’s comments on Tuesday are also a reminder that lawlessness and white supremacy are not discrete and separate from one another .
They have a complex and contradictory relationship .
White supremacy is maintained through the law : Racists ignore the law when they need to , and invoke the law when it serves their purposes .
White - on - black lynchings were not vile acts perpetrated by outliers in white society , people who were exceptionally barbarous compared to the “ ordinary ” white person .
Lynchings were part of a regime of racial terrorism with the goal of maintaining white control over black people in all areas of American life .
This culture of racial terrorism that Trump references so casually was central to American society .
That ethos of racism as violence against black people specifically , and against nonwhite people ( including Latinos and Muslims ) more generally , continues through to the Age of Trump .
This violence has “ evolved ” to fit the sensibilities of the post - civil rights era .
In his book " Trouble in Mind , " historian Leon Litwack writes about America ’s culture of lynching : Trump defenders , as they always do , have summoned ridiculous defenses .
They note that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said , some decades ago , that he was a victim of a “ high - tech lynching . ”
They claim people are too " sensitive " because of " political correctness . ”
They claim that lynchings do n’t necessarily have anything to do with race .
of course , they insist that Trump is not a racist ; he is misunderstood or being persecuted by Democrats and the " liberal media .
” Like almost all defenses of Trump ’s behavior , such claims are easily dismissed by honest and ethical human beings .
The racism of Trump ’s comments about lynching is easily exposed through several basic questions .
Jewish World Review Nov. 23 , 2007 / 13 Kislev 5768
Hey , Hey , Ho , Ho , Western Civ Has Got to Go By Greg Crosby
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
The title of this week 's column was a student protest chant started by Jesse Jackson at Stanford University in the 80's .
The idea was to throw out the university 's required courses on Western Culture because they were filled with " European and Western male bias " and replace them with courses that teach non-Western cultures and " works by women , minorities , and persons of color . "
Jackson was successful - today almost all colleges and universities stress A.C.B.W. ( Any Culture But Western ) courses and ignore the classic teachings of Western civilization 's " white men . "
Looking back now , over two decades later , we can see the results of Jackson 's efforts .
How do you like it ?
Anti-Western civilization is what 's cool .
Third world is wonderful , Western civ is bad .
" Multicultural " is all inclusive , right ?
Wrong .
Anything called " multicultural " never includes the American culture .
Colleges and universities have been teaching anti-Western dogma for years ; popular music has been rapping that tune for a couple of decades ; media like the press and TV and movies push it , and you even see it in the edgy names of big chain retail stores .
Would you shop at a store called " Inter- city Gang Wear ? "
Well , " Urban Outfitters " comes pretty close .
How about buying your duds at " Third World Clothiers ? "
No ?
Well , you shop at " Banana Republic " do n't you ?
According to the dictionary , a banana republic is a derogatory term for a small country whose economy is dependant on a single export and is usually governed by a dictator or officers of the armed forces .
Not a very sophisticated , high tone place .
Why would anyone want to go to a country like that to buy clothes ?
I guess for the same reasons that people want to buy clothing that looks like inter-city gang wear .
See , gangs are acceptable and celebrated in our society because the vast majority of them are populated by " people of color " and cultures other than the European white man culture - so society can't really crack down on them too hard because , hey , it would be deemed " racist . "
Gangs kill , they traffic in drugs , they destroy property , and they promote disorder but look on the bright side ….at least they 're not white !
Are there white gangs ?
Of course .
There are white supremacists and other white lowlifes that are still around , but for the most part they 've been marginalized .
The preponderance ( and most dangerous ) gangs today are the " gangs of color " - many are Latino such as MS - 13 , an international street gang which has chapters in cities across our entire country as well as in countries through Latin America .
MS - 13 started as a Los Angeles street gang and has expanded itself into a real terrorist group .
Their numbers internationally are estimated to be around 96,000 with 20,000 members associated with 125 cliques in the U.S. alone .
The Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI have located groups in 30 states plus Washington D.C .
MS - 13 is responsible for thousands of killings and mutilations in the US , Mexico and Central America .
Their major source of income is narcotics and arms trafficking .
They are the largest gang in Northern Virginia and groups associated with the gang are growing in Montgomery County , Md. as well .
Mara 18 is a rival gang based in El Salvador , and is just as violent .
The level of torture and sadistic killings that these gangs engage in make Al Capone look like the Pope .
It 's enough to make you nostalgic for the good old Cosa Nostra .
For some reason or another people seem to idolize these creeps .
They dress like them , they talk like them , they act like them .
You see it in every walk of American life today .
Just like prison convicts , gang members , and third world tribes , Americans from every economic level are getting themselves tattooed and pierced .
I have to believe that the worship of the third world and the under cultures is due because people , especially people under the age of 35 or 40 , have been taught that white Europeans were the bad guys that kept the " people of color " down .
If you 're told long enough that certain people are bad , naturally you want to distance yourself from them .
So farewell to Plato , Galileo and Isaac Newton .
Goodbye to St. Paul , Gutenberg , Columbus , da Vinci and Michelangelo .
So long St. Augustine , Homer , Voltaire , Francis Bacon , Beethoven and Johann Bach .
See ya , Einstein , Pasteur , Shakespeare and Oliver Cromwell .
Adieu to George Washington , Ben Franklin , and Thomas Jefferson .
Ta , ta Wright brothers , Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell .
And rest in peace Judeo - Christian worldview .
" Hey , hey , ho , ho , Western Civ has got to go ! "
It is .
It 's going .
It 's going fast .
Jesse Jackson will get his wish .
As one of the songs say in the Broadway musical Wicked - " I hope you 're happy .
I hope your happy now . "

" In his groundbreaking new book Bottom Up : Tapping the Power of the Connection Revolution , Rob Kall invites and eases us into in a much - needed meta - level shift -- a truly basic paradigmatic shift from top - down to bottom - up .
He capably and imaginatively explores the differences between these ways of approaching life , clearly demonstrating that bottom - up allows us to flourish .
His vision and his book are enriched by telling references to interviews which he has engaged in over the years with bottom - up researchers , theorists , activists , and dreamers in a variety of areas .
Think about Rob 's interviews .
Read this revolutionary book .
And take one step further into the bottom - up universe yourself .

Own the taboo - shattering documentary that Newsweek says " irreverently lays out the case that Jesus Christ never existed . "
In this critically acclaimed film , you will discover :
The early founders of Christianity seem wholly unaware of the idea of a human Jesus

Contemporary Christians are largely ignorant of the origins of their religion
Fundamentalism is as strong today as it ever has been , with an alarming 44 % of Americans believing that Jesus will return to earth in their lifetimes
From exposing the hidden history of Christianity to lampooning the bloody excesses of Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ ( which caused Gibson to attempt legal action against the documentary ) , The God Who Was n't There pulls no punches .

In reading an excellent book , Satanic Purses : Money , Myth and Misinformation , by R.T. Naylor , I suddenly realized why Adolf Hitler was so popular during the first years of his administration .
The funny thing is that the book is not about Hitler or Germany , but about the U.S. and the bogus war on terror .
It is an outstanding book , carefully researched and footnoted , and written in a reasonable manner , though with delicious dollops of sarcasm .
It ’s the carefully detailed accounts of injustices committed by the U.S. government against American Muslims that gave me the insight about Hitler .
In the early days of the Third Reich , if you were n’t a criminal , a communist or a Jew , you never saw the dark side of the Nazi government .
You saw an economy being revitalized , superhighways being built , Germans being put back to work , the disgraceful Versailles Treaty being scrapped .
It must have looked a lot like morning in Germany to the people who had suffered through runaway inflation , economic depression and street riots .
Similarly , if you are not a Muslim or an Arab - American who has been a victim of the PATRIOT Act and other laws carelessly passed in the hysteria following the attacks in 2001 , then the Bush administration probably looks perfectly normal .
You probably even believe that it is really protecting you from terrorists , just as many Germans believed Hitler was protecting them from the “ bad guys . ”
What Naylor ’s book demonstrates is how often this is pure nonsense , and at the same time what terrible damage is being done to the rule of law and America ’s traditional respect for human rights .
Typically , the government will swoop down and seize an organization ’s records and computers , while making public accusations of the people being “ involved ” with terrorists .
The important point is that this is done before any determination of guilt or innocence has even begun .
By the time a defendant gets to court , if he ever does , he ’s ruined .
Quite often then , the fearless feds will say , “ Well , never mind about this terrorist business , just plead guilty to a minor immigration violation . ”
Often defendants are bullied into admitting guilt they do n’t deserve by threats of being declared an enemy combatant , which means indefinite imprisonment , probably for life .
You can see the process going on with the four men charged with planning to blow up the fuel lines to JFK International Airport in New York .
In the first place , it is common knowledge that if you blow up a fuel line , you will get an explosion and fire at one point .
The claim that the whole pipeline would blow up for miles is nonsense , and the government knows that , but it threw that out to claim the plot endangered “ thousands ” of lives .
The real question is , Did these guys actually plan it , or were they set up by the government ’s federal informant ?
The federal government has a terrible record of using informants to entrap people .
The whole tragedy of Ruby Ridge , which cost the lives of Randy Weaver ’s wife and son , resulted from a federal informant who nagged Weaver into sawing off the barrels of a shotgun , something any kid can do with a vice and a hacksaw .
The feds then arrested Weaver with the intention of forcing him to become an informant , and the tragic farce ensued .
So even though you have n’t felt the arbitrary and unjust power of the government , you should read this book and find out just how much deception is involved in this war on terror .
You ’ll discover how often oil , diamonds and big business play behind - the - scenes roles in this current so - called war .
As the German people discovered , once a government has unlimited power , it will eventually use that power against everyone .
In 1984 , Harrington & Richardson Firearms got together with the Federal Cartridge Company and introduced a dandy little revolver cartridge called the .32 H&R Magnum .
They lengthened the .32 S&W Long cartridge and loaded it to higher pressures to give a lot more power to the little .32 revolver .
The factory load was advertised to propel an eighty - five grain jacketed hollowpoint bullet to around 1100 feet - per- second ( fps ) .
There was also a ninety - five grain lead bullet load at an advertised 1030 fps .
This new ammo was a significant improvement over the shorter .32 S&W and .32 S&W Long cartridges , and the new H&R revolvers could also fire the other two cartridges in addition to the .32 H&R Magnum .
While never loaded to true magnum pressures like the .357 , .41 , and .44 Magnum cartridges , the little .32 Magnum was a step in the right direction .
About three weeks ago , Federal and Ruger introduced a new .32 caliber cartridge that promises to be all that the .32 H&R should have been , had it been loaded to magnum pressures .
The problem was with the early H&R revolvers .
They just would not take real magnum pressures , so the .32 H&R Magnum cartridge , while still a relatively hot .32 , was never loaded to its potential .
Ruger jumped on board with the .32 H&R cartridge back in 1985 , and handloaders have been hot - rodding the .32 H&R in Ruger revolvers ever since , loading the cartridge to its potential using powders like Hodgdon ’s Lil ’ Gun , WW296 and H110 , among others .
To keep the new .327 Federal Magnum out of the weaker H&R and other lightweight revolvers , and to increase its powder capacity slightly , Federal lengthened the .32 H&R case by .125 inch , for a .327 Federal Magnum case length of 1.20 inches .
The first handgun on the market chambered for the .327 Federal Magnum is the tough , reliable little Ruger SP101 .
The little SP101 , as stated above , has been chambered for the .32 H&R cartridge for over twenty years .
It is also chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge in a five - shot version , but the .327 Federal Magnum version still uses the six - shot cylinder of the .32 H&R SP101 .
Ruger and Federal are marketing the new gun / cartridge combo towards the self defense handgun buyer at this time , but I see plenty of potential for this new cartridge as a hunting round as well .
Immediately after the new cartridge was announced , the shooting forums were filled with shooters , and some who pretend to be shooters , denouncing the new cartridge as everything from being too loud to it being almost useless ; all this from people who had never seen the gun nor the cartridge , much less having ever fired one .
Some of us , including myself , were almost ecstatic hearing the news of the little .327 Federal Magnum .
Those whom I know personally , like my friends Terry Murbach , Al Anderson , and Fermin Garza , who got excited about the new cartridge are actually shooters .
These men shoot more ammunition in one year than most shooters will ever see in their lifetimes .
All three of these gentlemen , while owning and shooting many big bore revolvers , are also great fans of the little .32 H&R cartridge , and immediately recognized the potential for the new .327 Federal Magnum .
These three friends are scattered geographically around the United States , but we all know each other through our love of firearms , and our inclusion in that brotherhood known as " The Shootists " .
I mentioned these men here because they are true experts on guns , and revolvers in particular , but also would consider themselves as students of firearms , always willing to learn and experience new advancements in cartridge design .
I contrast this with the pseudo experts who sit readily by their respective keyboards anxiously awaiting the opportunity to knock any new gun or cartridge that is introduced .
Having stated the above , the question is bound to be asked ; " What is the .327 Federal Magnum good for ? "
That is always a fair question , even if it is grammatically incorrect .
The simple answer is that it can do anything and everything that the .32 H&R cartridge can do , but do it better .
It has more pressure and more case capacity , resulting in more bullet speed .
Lots more bullet speed .
More velocity makes it hit harder and penetrate deeper , with the right bullet .
The .327 Federal Magnum will probably supplant the .32 H&R in every area except for the game of Cowboy Action Shooting , where light bullets and low velocities are preferred .
However , Cowboy Action Shooting is only a game .
The .327 Federal Magnum is made for more serious applications .
It offers more power than the .32 H&R , with less recoil and muzzle blast than the .357 Magnum .
In the SP101 , you get six shots of .327 Federal as opposed to five shots of .357 magnum , but the main attraction , for defensive purposes , is that the .327 promises true magnum penetration without the recoil of the larger magnums .
Some " experts " claim that the new cartridge is not needed , as we already have the .30 Carbine and .32 WCF ( .32 - 20 ) cartridges .
First , the .30 carbine is a good cartridge , but it has no rim , is slightly tapered , and would require moon clips for reliable , quick extraction in a double action revolver .
While the case capacity of the new .327 Federal Magnum and the .32 - 20 are close to the same , loading the .32 - 20 to the higher pressures required to achieve the velocities desired from a three inch barrel would destroy many of the old guns that are chambered for the cartridge .
The .32 - 20 is also tapered , being primarily a rifle cartridge .
Lengthening the .32 H&R into the brand new .327 Federal Magnum was the logical choice .
For a defensive handgun , I always lean towards penetration .
I am asked everyday to recommend a defensive cartridge to those who are needing a handgun for protection .
If a person can easily handle a small .357 magnum revolver , that is a good choice .
However , the question of recoil often enters into the choice of cartridge .
While in a service sized revolver the .357 is easily controlled , in a smaller package it can be a handful .
Many times , I recommend a . 22 Magnum for those who , for whatever reason , cannot handle or desire a hard - kicking gun .
The .22 Magnum penetrates well , and getting the bullet to the vitals as deeply as possible damages more nerves , organs , and blood vessels .
A bullet that does not penetrate does not tear up as much flesh .
The new .327 Federal Magnum promises penetration , with less recoil than the .357 Magnum .
That , along with good bullet design , should make for a dandy little defensive gun .
Regarding the Ruger SP101 revolver , it is probably the toughest , most reliable compact double action revolver on the planet .
Weighing 28 ounces with a three and one - sixteenth inch barrel , the SP101 can easily handle a steady diet of the high pressure .327 Federal Magnum .
The weight is heavy enough to help tame the recoil , but light enough to carry easily and comfortably in a belt holster .
I regard the SP101 as being a bit heavy for everyday carry in my pants pocket , but for wintertime carry in a coat pocket , or in a compact inside - the - pants holster , it rides easily .
Made primarily of stainless steel , the SP101 is highly resistant to corrosion from sweat and damp weather , as any carry gun should be .
The synthetic rubber grip is an excellent design , combining a compact size with a comfortable hold .
Even in the .357 Magnum version of the SP101 , the grip design is very comfortable to shoot .
The barrel is of a heavy profile , and also aids in accurate rapid fire .
The sights are pretty easy to see for a compact defensive weapon , and the rear is adjustable for windage correction .
The trigger pull on the sample gun measured a smooth nine pounds , six ounces in double action mode , and a crisp three and three - quarters pounds in single action mode .
The sample SP101 has a very good trigger action .
The barrel / cylinder gap measures five one - thousandths ( .005 ) of an inch .
The cylinder bolt notches are offset , and not directly over the chambers , making for a stronger design .
Federal is offering three factory loads for the .327 Federal Magnum at this time ; a Federal Premium 85 grain Hydra - Shok hollowpoint at 1330 fps , a Speer Gold Dot 115 grain hollowpoint at 1300 fps , and an American Eagle 100 grain jacketed soft point at 1400 fps .
These velocities are advertised as being fired from the 3 1/16 inch barrel of the SP101 .
I only had the American Eagle load for testing .
It chronographed at an average velocity of 1374.9 fps at eight feet from the muzzle , so corrected to muzzle velocity , the Federal specifications are dead on accurate .
With all of the negative comments early on from folks who have never fired the cartridge , there was a few things that I particularly wanted to test ; those being muzzle blast , recoil , and penetration .
I compared the muzzle blast of the .327 Federal Magnum to the .357 Magnum fired from guns with equal length barrels .
I used for this test two Ruger SP101 revolvers , identical except for the cartridge .
Holding the decibel meter beside the shooter ’s head , the readings seem close , with the .327 registering 120db and the .357 reading 124db .
However , decibel readings are logarithmic instead of linear , and 124db is noticeably louder than a reading of 120db .
The .327 Federal Magnum does indeed have less muzzle blast than does the .357 Magnum , at least using factory loads with the same bullets weights .
Measuring recoil was more subjective , meaning I did not have any instrument to measure the recoil .
However , recoil has to abide by the laws of physics , and can be calculated .
Both guns having equal barrel lengths and almost identical weights , the .357 Magnum has more recoil using equal bullet weights because it will fire a 100 grain bullet about 200 fps faster than the .327 Federal Magnum .
The difference in felt recoil to the hand is also noticeable .
The fly in this ointment is that the .357 Magnum is hardly ever used with the light - for - caliber 100 grain bullet .
To get better penetration , most shooters use at least a 125 grain bullet in the .357 Magnum , and recoil with that bullet is heavier than the recoil of the .327 Federal Magnum using the 100 grain bullet by a considerable margin .
Keep in mind here that in all these tests , I am using factory ammunition .
I will get into the handloading portion a bit later .
To keep things fair and in perspective , only factory loads were used in the recoil and muzzle blast tests .
Next I moved on to testing the .327 Federal Magnum for penetration .
As mentioned early on , I am a believer in penetration above all else when it comes to a cartridge that will be used against flesh .
The .327 Federal Magnum is marketed as a defensive revolver , so it had to be tested in flesh .
Since shooting live humans is illegal , immoral , and distasteful , and fresh cadavers are hard to come by out in the woods , I rode into town and bought a whole pork shoulder from the local butcher .
I told him that I wanted the biggest one that he had .
It weighed just over twenty - three pounds .
Again , I used only the Federal factory American Eagle 100 grain load for this test .
I had three reasons for this : I wanted to use a load that is available to anyone who buys one of these revolvers , most people will carry their defensive handgun loaded with factory ammunition , and meat is expensive .
Taking aim from a distance of ten feet and aiming just inside the shoulder blade , I fired into the pork shoulder from the end .
The American Eagle jacketed softpoint bullet fully penetrated the shoulder .
I had hoped to be able to stop the bullet and see just far it would penetrate the meat , but sixteen inches was the entire length of the shoulder .
The entrance and exit holes were very similar , with some cratering around the entrance .
Opening up the shoulder , about seven inches in showed a large amount of cavitation and tissue damage .
Seven inches is about optimum for this .
Measure into your chest about seven inches and you will see that there is a lot of important stuff in that area .
This damage started near the entrance , peaked at about seven inches , and then tapered into a channel of about one - half inch diameter through to the exit .
I am very pleased at the performance of the penetration test .
Handloading for the new .327 Federal Magnum presented a slight challenge , as there is yet no load data available .
I used a set of Lee carbide .32 H&R loading dies , and crimped separately from the seating operation .
The dies worked perfectly for all bullet weights tried , and all loading was done on a Dillon 550B machine .
I based my powder choices upon what I have learned from loading the .32 H&R Magnum to higher than factory pressures , taking advantage of the .327 ’s greater case capacity .
My powders of choice were H110 , Lil’ Gun , Accurate Arms Number 9 , H4227 , Accurate 1680 , and Winchester 571 .
I found H110 , AA # 9 , and to a limited extent Lil ’ Gun to work best in this particular revolver .
With H4227 and AA1680 , I could not achieve velocities equal to the factory load with a 100 grain bullet , so I gave up on those .
I tried no light target loads in the .327 , as we have the .32 S&W Long and the .32 H&R Magnum for target and mid-range loads , respectively .
The .327 Federal Magnum is a true magnum , and that is the area in which I concentrated my efforts .
Using Winchester 571 was a mistake .
It is an excellent powder , but not at all suited for my purposes here .
I screwed up , and found out that the Ruger SP101 is even a lot stronger than I had previously believed .
Brass flows at 75,000 psi , and I exceeded that .
I would have badly wrecked a lesser gun .
The best powders for the .327 Federal Magnum proved to be H110 and AA # 9 for most all bullet weights , with Lil ’ Gun performing very well with the heavier bullets .
I tested many different combinations using 60 , 85 , and 100 grain Hornady XTP hollowpoints , 113 grain cast lead gas check bullets from Cast Performance , 120 grain cast lead gas check bullets from Mt. Baldy Bullet Company , and a 135 grain cast lead bullet that was hand - cast by my friend John Killebrew .
John designed this bullet with the help of Jimmy Pilcher , and it is a dandy bullet for loading the .32 H&R , .32 - 20 , and now the .327 Federal Magnum cartridges .
I was able to safely achieve velocities equaling the 100 grain factory load using AA # 9 and H110 .
AA # 9 also proved to be the powder of choice for the 60 and 85 grain XTP hollowpoint bullets .
The little 60 grain XTP screamed out of the little Ruger at over 1740 fps .
Moving to the lead bullets , AA # 9 , H110 , and Lil ’ Gun did very well .
One thing that I really like about lead bullets is that they give greater velocity , as compared to jacketed bullets , with equal pressures .
In the Ruger SP101 , with its long cylinder , I was able to seat the 135 grain Killebrew bullets out longer than usual , crimping in the top lube groove instead of the crimp groove , taking advantage of the case capacity of the .327 Federal Magnum .
I was able to push the 135 grain cast lead bullet to over 1250 fps with Lil’ Gun .
I achieved significantly higher velocities than that , but extraction became a bit sticky over 1300 fps , so I backed off .
I used CCI magnum small pistol primers in all loads tested , but I am deliberately not listing powder charges , as none of this data has been pressure tested .
By the time guns and ammunition hit the dealer ’s shelves by January 2008 , pressure tested load data from reputable sources should be available .
I will add that handloaders can safely reach factory velocities with jacketed bullets , and exceed them with lead bullets .
Later , I will get into another article dealing with handloading the .327 Federal Magnum for hunting , but as for right now , the Ruger SP101 is a dandy little defensive revolver , but its barrel length precludes it from being a legal hunting arm in most states .
For accuracy testing of the .327 SP101 , I enlisted the help of my Ransom Master Rest , to eliminate as much human error as possible .
I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the little Ruger , with it being a brand new high pressure handgun cartridge .
All ammo tested grouped into less than two and one - half inches , with both the best and worst groups fired shown in the pictures .
Even the largest group at just over two inches is excellent accuracy , good enough for small game hunting , and more than enough accuracy for defense .
While it is not absolutely necessary for a fighting handgun to display target grade accuracy , it is always nice when it does .
Over the course of the last three weeks , I have really given this SP101 a workout .
I have loaded and fired the weapon hundreds of times , and never cleaned it .
It is filthy , but it never misses a beat .
Case life has been very good , despite my abuses .
I began with one hundred factory cartridges , and used the first fifty of those that I emptied for all of the handloading .
I only lost one case , and that was due to my negligence .
All of the others have held up perfectly , and the primer pockets are still tight .
I carried the little Ruger around concealed in the very versatile Simply Rugged Pancake holster .
This holster has detachable belt loops that allow it to be used as an inside - the - pants holster , and has slots to allow either strong side or crossdraw carry on the belt .
Rob Leahy at Simply Rugged makes some fine holsters at very reasonable prices .
As I have in the past , I highly recommend his work .
The little SP101 is a pleasure to shoot .
The design of the synthetic rubber grip is hand filling , but compact .
Recoil is very manageable , somewhat like a .38 Special , and muzzle blast is not bothersome .
Penetration exceeded my expectations with the one factory load that I had available .
I would suspect that the other two factory loads using the high performance hollowpoint bullets would penetrate less , and they just might be ideal for self defense .
I wo n’t know for sure until I try them .
If you ca n’t tell already , I really like the new .327 Federal Magnum .
It is everything that the older .32 H&R should have been .
It operates at true magnum pressures to deliver true magnum performance .
It has a good home in the Ruger SP101 , but I also see a future for the cartridge in other handguns , and maybe even a carbine .
As I type this , I know of at least one custom gunsmith that is making up a couple of single action revolvers for the .327 Federal Magnum .
In the SP101 , the .327 offers a good package for a self defense weapon , especially for those who want an effective weapon with good penetration and less recoil than the .357 Magnum , along with one more cartridge in the same sized handgun .
A lot of shooters opt for a semi-auto defensive pistol , but for many , the rugged reliability and simplicity of a good revolver has its advantages . , and it does n’t leave empty brass laying around on the ground .
In the world of rugged and reliable compact medium bore double action revolvers , the SP101 is king , and I will not hesitate to recommend the .327 SP101 to those needing an accurate defensive piece .
It is a very versatile weapon , firing the .32 S&W , .32 S&W Long , and the .32 H&R cartridges in addition to the .327 Federal Magnum cartridge .

( Updates with Obama appearance in New Hampshire , new poll )
DES MOINES , Iowa , Dec 19 ( Reuters ) - Republican Mitt Romney attacked rival Mike Huckabee for criticizing President George W. Bush 's foreign policy on Wednesday , while a new poll showed the race among Democrats in Iowa still neck - and - neck .
As candidates revved up their campaigns before a brief Christmas break , some released advertisements evoking the holiday spirit , including one from Republican Rudy Giuliani that featured Santa Claus .
None of the light - hearted spots provoked the criticism that former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee did with a " Merry Christmas " advertisement that included a book shelf behind him that looked like a cross .
Huckabee , a former Baptist preacher seeking support from Christian evangelicals in Iowa , rejected criticism of the ad .
Iowa on Jan. 3 starts the state - by - state process to pick the Democratic and Republican candidates who will face off in the presidential election on Nov. 4 , 2008 .
Romney , who has lost a big lead to Huckabee in the midwestern state , sought to raise doubts about his rival 's foreign policy credentials , saying his criticism of Bush 's foreign policy was more suitable for a Democrat .
Last week , Huckabee said the Bush administration 's " arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad " and promised that as president he would reach out to the rest of the world .
" I think Governor Huckabee made a significant error in insulting the president as being subject to an arrogant bunker mentality , " Romney said in Davenport , Iowa .
" I disagree with that .
I think the president is a man who has acted out of a desire to do what is right for America . "
Romney , a former Massachusetts governor who said in August he would not be a " carbon copy " of Bush if elected , but has supported his troop build - up in Iraq , wants to peel away conservative Republican voters from Huckabee .
Huckabee has come out of nowhere to lead Republican polls in Iowa and challenge Giuliani for the lead nationally .
He defended his words in an MSNBC interview but said he was criticizing the administration , not Bush himself .
" I do n't apologize for that because I think that when we 're engaged in the world , we need to make sure that even if we call people to join us in a multilateral approach to fighting terrorism , if they do n't do it on our terms we do n't say that they 're with the enemy , " Huckabee said .
HUCKABEE , ROMNEY GAIN
A Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday said Huckabee has wiped out an 18 - point deficit in one month to pull within one point of Giuliani , 23 percent to 22 percent , nationally , with Romney in third place at 16 percent .
An NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday , showed Romney gaining nine points in a month to tie Giuliani , who dropped 13 points .
The two Republicans were each at 20 percent in that poll , with Huckabee in third place at 17 percent .
Among Democrats , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton 's national advantage over Illinois Sen. Barack Obama shrunk slightly to eight points from 11 points last month , according to the Reuters / Zogby poll .
In the NBC / Journal poll , Clinton held her national lead , with the support of 45 percent of Democratic primary voters , compared with 23 percent for Obama .
Campaigning in New Hampshire , which holds its primary on Jan. 8 , Obama zeroed in on struggling lower - and middle - class voters by highlighting his plans to ease their tax burden and make health care and college education more affordable .
" There are n't many issues that you are concerned about that I have not worked on , " Obama told a high school student at a town hall meeting in Manchester , trying to convince her to cast her first vote for him .
While Clinton leads nationally , all eyes are on a tight race in Iowa between her , Obama and former North Carolina Sen .
John Edwards .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll said 33 percent of Iowans planning to vote on Jan. 3 support Obama , compared to 29 percent for Clinton and 20 percent for Edwards .
Giuliani , who was New York mayor during the Sept. 11 attacks , issued a Web ad wishing for peace with strength , secure borders against illegal immigration and lower taxes .
" And I really hope that all of the presidential candidates can just get along , " he says .
A red-suited Santa Claus chimes in : " Ho , ho , ho .
I was with you right up until that last one . "
Obama 's ad featured him , wife Michelle and their two children in front of a Christmas tree with a message that highlights " the things that unite us as a people . "
Clinton , in her ad , is surrounded by festively wrapped gifts labeled with her wishes , such as " bring troops home . "

It was a year ago this month that Seymour Hersh wrote in the New Yorker that the White House ( ie : Cheney ) was pushing back against the release of a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran that had failed to find any evidence of an ongoing nuclear weapons program .
Once again I guess you could say Sy is the polar opposite of ' the boy who cried wolf ' . '

Wolf Blitzer had him on to discuss it and what to make of the new NIE and the recent claims by the President that he was just informed about it 's contents a week ago .
Hersh :
What 's interesting here is the President 's position .
As you know today in his news conference he said he only learned about this the other week .
Blitzer :
He said he only got the word from Mike McConnell , the National Intelligence Director , last week that there was in fact now a new the National Intelligence Estimate , although last Aug he was told there is some new information - we have n't vetted it - it 's not yet confirmed - there may be some new information .
He only says that he learned about the new NIE last week .
Hersh : Look , it 's a lose - lose for them .
Either he did know what was going on at the highest levels - the fight I 'm talking about began last year .
I was writing about something in November and also you mentioned earlier .
They were aware of a big dispute inside the community that is between the White House and the community about this .
Now , maybe he did n't know what was going on at the Vice Presidential level about something that serious .
If so , I mean , we pay him to know these things and not to make statements based on information that turns out not to be accurate , or else he is misrepresenting what he knows .
I do n't think there is any question this is going to pose a serious credibility problem .
I assume people are going to be asking more and more questions about what did he know , when .
...
It 's little wonder why Seymour Hersh is so often the target of fierce criticism from Bushco as he's been a thorn in their side just as he has many an administration before them .
Sy has earned his place as one of the US 's greatest investigative reporters / muckrakers ever after his exposing many of the greatest scandals of our time .
He broke the My Lai massacre , the torture at Abu Ghraib , and the CIA 's " Family Jewels " that led to the Church hearings , and even Clinton 's bombing of a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan , just to name a few of his more well known .

PHILADELPHIA —
In a cluttered gymnasium on North Broad Street , the stench of a lifetime of hard work hung over the tools of a trade that once made Joe Frazier a heavyweight champion and a wealthy celebrity .
On a quiet , sunny Sunday afternoon in this city he adopted , Frazier stayed well beyond the reach of the natural spotlight that beamed through the front window of Joe Frazier ’s Gym and swept across an old boxing ring and rows of rusty lockers .
Caught in the glow were tables covered with boxing gloves and head gear , and not nearly enough trainer ’s tape to hide an old warrior ’s wounds .
In a back room beneath a dim bulb , Frazier sat on a sofa and taped his 62 - year - old hands for a light workout .
“ A sound body keeps a sound mind , ” he said .
Then the man known as Smokin ’ Joe Frazier , who once formed half of one of the greatest rivalries in sports , rose slowly to his feet .
Slightly stooped but still feeling unstoppable , he began to shadow box .

ACCORDING to a recent report from the Census Bureau , poverty fell from about 12.6 percent in 2005 to about 12.3 percent last year .
That ’s about 500,000 fewer people living in poverty , the first statistically significant decline since 2000 .
( In 2006 , the poverty line was $ 20,614 for a family of four . )
As usual , there was much commentary in the news media about poverty ’s intractability : today ’s poverty rate is hardly lower than it was in 1968 , when it was about 12.8 percent .
But a closer look at the experience of one group , Hispanics , tells a very different story .
As a group , Hispanics are enjoying substantial economic progress .
Their poverty rate has dropped by a third from its high 12 years ago , falling from 30.7 percent in 1994 to 20.6 percent in 2006 .
These numbers come from the Census Bureau ’s Current Population Survey , widely used by pro- and anti-immigration groups alike as a reasonably reliable source of information about illegal as well as legal immigrants .
They show that although Hispanics still have a long way to go to achieve the full promise of the American Dream , as a group they are clearly on the economic up escalator .
CLIMATE CHANGE :
Overcoming the Ostrich Effect
By Stephen Leahy
May 30 ( IPS ) –
The vast majority of North Americans now declare that they want action on climate change .
But whether people are truly willing to embrace “ carbon - neutral ” lifestyles — including giving up their gas - guzzling sports utility vehicles — remains an open question , say experts .
This article is part two of a three - part series published by IPS on natural capital and how future global prosperity and equity can be achieved through the preservation of ecosystems .
See Part One : Like Enron , Earth Inc. Sliding Into Bankruptcy and Part Three : How to Kick - Start the 21st Century Eco-Economy
Scientists have made a strong case that the only way to stave off the worst impacts of climate change — floods , storms , wildfires , disease epidemics and sundry other unpleasant events — is by slashing greenhouse gas emissions a whopping 80 percent from the 1990 baseline by 2050 .
European policy - makers are already putting plans in place to meet that target .
North Americans , whose region is by far the worst polluter , are beginning to talk about reductions , but few understand the sweeping breadth of the changes needed to reach the 80 percent target .
“ The American public ’s awareness about global warming is extremely high , but that does n’t mean very much , ” said Anthony Leiserowitz , director of Strategic Initiatives at Yale University ’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies
“ They are not convinced they need to make any changes or sacrifices in their lives , ” Leiserowitz , a psychologist who has studied public reactions to climate change for nearly two decades , told IPS .
“ Most people think it is a very distant threat in terms of time and space . ”
In other words , climate change will only have an impact on remote islands in the South Pacific , or poor countries in Africa , and only many years from now .
Even the devastation and death wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 has not brought the potential impacts of a warmer world home to U.S. citizens , he said .
“ The predominant image of climate change in most people ’s minds is melting ice of Antarctica or the Arctic , ” Leiserowitz said .
And while a few people worry about polar bears disappearing , most simply do n’t see global warming as a significant threat , he said .
Leiserowitz ’s view appears to conflict with a March 2007 poll by the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy that reported 83 percent of U.S. citizens consider global warming to be a “ serious problem ” — up from 70 percent in 2004 .
Most dramatically , 63 percent agreed that the United States “ is in as much danger from environmental hazards , such as air pollution and global warming , as it is from terrorists ” .
But Leiserowitz points out that public concern about global warming was also high in 2000 , and then fell off the radar in 2001 , notably after the 9/11 attacks .
“ The current greening of Americans is broad across all sectors , but it is likely not deep , ” he argued .

1/ Low utility bills blamed for cuts in energy research ( Telegraph , Sat 06 Oct )
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/10/06/cnener...
Comment :
The article is reporting on the findings of a “ year - long review of the [ UK ] Government ’s science and innovation policies ” .
The statement made by Lord Sainsbury is pretty obvious , “ low utility bills were not necessarily in the public ’s long - term interest ” , but getting this idea across to the govt and the UK general public i.e. the idea of voluntarily increasing energy ( and water ) prices now because it is better in the long - term , will not be easy .
The article title uses the word ‘ energy ’ , it means ‘ electricity ’ .
Politically popular energy and water price cuts have forced energy and water companies to slash their investment in new technologies to such an extent that it could impede Britain ’s ability to harness renewable energy sources , former science minister Lord Sainsbury has warned .
Launching the findings from his year - long review of the Government ’s science and innovation policies , the Labour peer said low utility bills were not necessarily in the public ’s long - term interest .
He said Ofwat , the water regulator , and Ofgem , the energy regulator , had focused on price cuts rather than encouraging investment in technologies that could deliver power and water more efficiently and cleanly .
The decision led to a complete collapse in research and development in the power sector by 2002 .
Last year , the industry spent just £ 6.5 m , which Lord Sainsbury said was “ too low ” .
Investment by water companies had also declined “ sharply and continuously ” since 2000 …
2a / Cost of loans rises as credit crunch bites ( The Independent , Thu 04 Oct )
http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article3024772.ece
The cost of taking out a personal loan is set to rise significantly , with nine lenders this week raising interest rates by up to 4 percentage points .
Personal finance analysts warned yesterday that a price war in the loans market was over , with the global credit crunch reducing the extent to which lenders can compete on price .
Moneyfacts said that while rates below 6 per cent a year were available as recently as four months ago , it is now increasingly difficult to find a loan costing less than 7 per cent .
Deals that would previously have looked expensive , such as Direct Line 's rate of 8.4 per cent for a three - year loan of £ 5,000 , are now making it into best buy tables .
Lisa Taylor , a spokeswoman for Moneyfacts , warned : " With increasing uncertainty in the financial markets , rising levels of bad debt and a year of interest rate rises putting pressure on our disposable incomes , lenders are increasing their margins in what has become a far more risky environment to do business . "
Rate rises for new borrowers introduced this week include Bradford & Bingley 's decision to raise the cost of its unsecured lending from 13.9 per cent to 17.9 per cent .
The Cheshire and Derbyshire building societies have increased their rates by up to 3 percentage points .
In recent weeks , Eskimo Loans , Goldfish , Norwich Union and RAC Financial Services have all edged their rates up by up to 1 percentage point , while Norwich & Peterborough Building Society and Northern Rock have raised rates up by 0.7 points and 0.5 points respectively …
2b / Jump off the deranged bull now ( The Telegraph , Tue 02 Oct )
http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/business/ambrosevanspritchard/september07/d...
Comment : Business blog from Ambrose Evans - Pritchard .
A bleak economic outlook .
... As Alan Greenspan said this week about the Shanghai market , “ If you ever wanted to get a definition of a bubble in the works , that ’s it . ”
He also said that US house prices were going to fall “ a lot further than people think ” .
Bet against him if you dare .
The relief rally since the Federal Reserve slashed rates half a point to 4.75 pc is a moral hazard bet , based entirely on assumptions that Ben Bernanke will debauch the monetary system to boost asset prices .
... Today feels more like January 2001 , when the S&P 500 rallied for two weeks on the Fed ’s emergency cut , only to tank by 19 pc over the next two months as it became clear why the Fed had taken drastic action – and what this meant for profits .
Wall Street fell a lot further thereafter , taking two years to stabilize .
The S&P 500 halved in the end .
Or if you like parallels , try October 1987 , when the US dollar was falling in the same disorderly fashion we have seen since August this year .
It is fundamentally worse this time : the global dollar index has hit record lows ; and the US is no longer a net creditor .
It now has external liabilities reaching 35 pc of GDP , putting it within a few percentage points of a compound debt crisis .
We will find out from the TICs data in November whether China ’s central bank was responsible for the $ 48bn fall in official foreign holdings of US Treasuries in July .
But if China was n't , somebody was .
Who ?
Why ?
The pattern leaves the US reliant on short - term funding to cover its trade deficit .
This is a well - trodden path to crisis , as Latin America can attest .
The Fed is boxed in by the dollar , and by lingering inflation .
Oil has jumped back up to $ 82 .
Copper is over $ 8,000 a tonne again .
Wheat has risen 70 pc in a year .
Gold has kissed $ 750 , the ultimate reproach .
...
By the way , while I did not expect the Fed to cut a half point in September , I do n’t not share the view that this was a reckless bail - out .
It was entirely necessary , given the heart attack in the commercial paper markets – which have contracted $ 368bn in seven weeks , and are still contracting ; and above all , given the speed with which the US housing market is collapsing .
Robert Schiller is now warning that prices call fall 50 pc in some areas .
It is already well under way .
( Interestingly , auctions of foreclosed buy - to - let properties in the UK are selling at 40 pc discounts already – buy - to - let is Britain ’s subprime ) ...
Will it take a 25 pc correction in New York , Frankfurt , and London to flush out the excesses ?
Or more ?
Japan ’s Nikkei fell 81 pc over fourteen years from a peak of 39,000 in December 1989 to a nadir of 7,600 in May 2003 .
Land prices in Tokyo fell by four fifths .
House prices fell by over half .
True , Tokyo delayed recovery with a bad mix of policies in the 1990s .
But are the bubbles in America , Britain , Australia , Canada , Ireland , Spain , Greece , Latvia , Romania , Kazakhstan , the Gulf , Argentina , and above all China , really that different from Japan ’s errors in the late 1980s ?
2c/ Dollar 's double blow from Vietnam and Qatar ( The Telegraph , Thu 04 Oct )
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/10/03/bcnvie...
Vietnam is planning to cut its purchases of US Treasuries and other dollar bonds , raising fears that Asian central banks with control over two thirds of the world 's foreign reserves may soon join the flight from US assets .
The Saigon Times said this morning that the State Bank of Vietnam was abandoning the attempt to hold down the Vietnamese currency through heavy purchases of dollars .
The policy is causing the economy to overheat , driving up inflation to 8.8 pc .
Vietnam , which has mid-sized reserves of $ 40bn , is seen as weather vane for the bigger Asian powers .
Together they hold $ 3,575bn of foreign reserves , over 65 pc of the world 's total .
China leads with $ 1,340bn , but South Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , and even Thailand all built up massive holdings .
The concern is that once one or two members of the region jump ship , it could set off a broader scramble .
None of them want to be the last one left holding a devalued asset .
Vietnam 's central bank said this week that it would move " gradually " to a floating currency .
Separately , the gas - rich Gulf state of Qatar announced that it had cut the dollar holdings of its $ 50 bn sovereign wealth fund from 99 pc to 40 pc , switching into investments in China , Japan , and emerging Asia .
The move is intended to increase long - term returns for future generations , but it can easily be seen as a vote of no confidence in US economic management .
The drastic shift by the Qatar Investment Authority is a warning that petro - dollar powers with some $ 3,500bn under management may pull the plug on the heavily endebted US economy -- which needs to suck in the majority of the world 's savings just to stay afloat ...
2d / Sub - prime borrowers face repossession ( BBC News , Sat 06 Oct )
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7030723.stm
Comment : Panorama : Sub Prime Suspect : BBC 1 , 2030 UK time , Monday 8 October
Sub - prime mortgage lenders who give loans to people with bad credit records account for more than 70 % of all repossessions , a BBC investigation has found .
The market for high interest sub - prime mortgages has been booming and it now accounts for about 8 % of the total UK mortgage market .
But a survey of more than 7,000 court hearings over the past three months - carried out jointly by BBC programmes Panorama and Five Live Report - has found that lenders who specialise in these mortgages or offer them as part of their business disproportionately make up over 70 % of all repossession cases .
...
The investigation into Britain 's sub - prime market found cases of council tenants on benefits being encouraged to significantly exaggerate their incomes in order to buy their houses under the right - to - buy scheme - some of whom now face having their homes repossessed .
In other cases families were given mortgages which became unaffordable within months .
Despite being in their late 50s , on benefits and in poor health , David and Maureen Bradbury were given a 25 - year mortgage worth £ 55,000 by London and Scottish Bank .
With their interest rate currently more than 11 % , the couple have struggled to make repayments .
...
The bank says it follows industry rules regarding responsible lending and took into account the income of the daughter of the Bradburys when granting the mortgage - although she too is on benefits .
3a / Shortage of skilled staff hits oil projects ( Financial Times , Thu 04 Oct )
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23554182-7214-11dc-8960-0000779fd2ac.html
Comment : A shortage of workers in the oil and gas industry will not be news to those familiar with Peak Oil , but it may be news to the FT readership .
CERA ( Cambridge Energy Research Associates ) are one of the flag bearers of the anti-Peak Oil brigade , and yet here again they are being quoted giving reasons why new oil production is being set back .
See also : Labour and Skills Crisis Could Stall Oil and Gas Investment Boom ( http://www.boozallen.com/capabilities/Industries/industries_article/1083..., Booz Allen Hamilton , 24 Aug 2006 )
Rising drilling and riggings costs , combined with shortages of skilled personnel and equipment , are affecting hydrocarbon projects throughout the Middle East , with some being delayed and other contracts being renegotiated .
Producers in the region , from Libya to Saudi Arabia , have embarked on ambitious plans to increase production and capacity to meet growing global demand and take advantage of record oil prices .
But many will struggle to meet their schedules , experts say , and can expect to pay exorbitant prices if they are to ensure they have the material and personnel in a market suffering severe constraints .
" It 's having an impact and that impact is going to increase over the next few years .
We are seeing projects being delayed simply because they can't get the equipment delivered on the timescale they used to , " says Candida Scott , an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( Cera ) .
Experts say a critical bottleneck is the shortage of skilled staff , with an industry workforce dominated by people close to retirement and inexperienced graduates .
The issues affect producers worldwide , with the Middle East and Libya accounting for 20 per cent of world projects adding productive capacity between 2007 and 2011 , according to Cera .
Significantly , it is also the region requiring the most manpower for design and project management over the same period , with 35 per cent of the world 's projected total , the institute says …
3b / Shortage of engineers likely to hit projects by 2010 , says study ( Financial Times , Thu 04 Oct )
http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=071004000012&ct=0
Comment : CERA warn of shortages of engineers .
Will this warning appear in their next anti-Peak Oil report ?
Big oil and gas production projects are likely to suffer delays with the industry expected to face up to a 15 per cent shortage of qualified engineers by 2010 .
The shortfall in the industry is already taking hold with insufficient engineers to meet 2007 exploration and production project demand , according to Pritesh Patel of consultants Cambridge Energy Research Associates and co-author of a report into the skills shortage .
By 2010 the industry is likely to face a shortfall of 5,500 to 6,000 , leaving between 10 and 15 per cent of posts unfilled .
Cera declined to give examples of the impact on current projects but the FT reported last month that BP had indefinitely postponed several deepwater developments in the Gulf of Mexico , including Tubular Bells , Dorado , and Puma .
BP said at the time that " like other operators , we are adjusting our future project plans in the face of resource constraints and significant inflation in the oil field service sector . "
Current forecasts anticipate that output globally from such deepwater projects is set to rise from 4 m to 11 m barrels of oil per day by 2017 .
But Mr Patel warns that these projections are based on " the assumption the industry will be able to avoid major delays , which is becoming more unlikely - not to say impossible - every day . '' ...
Yet such people are leaving the industry in unprecedented fashion , as experienced engineers reach retirement age .
" That pool is just shrinking by the day , " Mr Patel said .
Oil companies are responding to this labour crisis by recruiting talent in Asia through design houses , though the required mentors are retiring , and it will take time to train the new engineers
With an average age of 51 years , Cera anticipates that more than 50 per cent of today 's workforce will have retired by 2015 , an attrition rate of 6 per cent per year .
4/ Demand Growth Picks Up , Non-Opec Supply Set To Fly ( Energy Intelligence [ Energy Intelligence Briefing ] , Wed 03 Oct )
No link , from Newsletter .
World oil demand got its first psychological check at $ 80 per barrel oil in September , and it more than passed the test with year - on - year growth of 1.7 % .
Establishing a new trend , non-OECD countries seem to be getting pretty comfortable with higher oil prices .
With maintenance out of the way in most of the non-Opec countries , a fourth - quarter supply spurt is expected that could add as much as 2 million b/d to the third - quarter totals .
5/ Delays Hit Qatar's New Gas Projects ( Energy Intelligence [ International Oil Daily ] , Thu 04 Oct )
No link , from Newsletter .
Delays are creeping into Qatar 's gas export mega- projects , threatening the timely start - up of the Qatargas - 2 LNG scheme and putting back full production from the cross - border Dolphin project until the summer of 2008 .
According to a Qatari government source , the problem stems in part from soaring costs and shortages of labor and equipment .
" The overheating of the market , in terms of contractors and material , has created some issues with what is going on in Qatar , " the source said .
6a / The Turkmenistan - Russia - Ukraine Natural Gas Saga Comes Back To Life ( Energy Intelligence , Thu 04 Oct )
No link , from Newsletter .
Comment : From the commentary section , ‘ World Watch -- Comment & Interpretation on Today 's News ’ , of the daily newsletter , so the above title is ODAC’s .
Just when the Moscow - Kiev - Ashgabat natural gas saga seemed to be resolved , it raises its head again .
Why ?
Last year / earlier this year , Ukraine , the main transit country for natural gas from Russia to western Europe , was upset when Russia insisted it , Ukraine , started paying the same prices as western Europe for its gas imports from Russia .
This meant a quadrupling - or - so of gas prices for Ukraine .
A compromise was reached whereby Turkmenistan would supply Ukraine with natural gas , via Russia .
Two of the main components that allowed this setup to work were that Russian - friendly parliamentarians took control of the Ukrainian parliament , and Turkmenistan was prepared to sell its gas at a knock down price to Ukraine / Russia .
Ukraine held elections last weekend ( 30 Sept. ) in which it looks like the West - leaning bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko will regain control of parliament ( see Orange bloc edges to poll victory , http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7025382.stm), which will in all likelihood upset Moscow .
Plus Turkmenistan wants to raise its gas prices from $ 100 / 1000 cu m to $ 150/1000 cu m , and Russia will pass on the costs to Ukraine .
It does not help that the company that brokered the gas supply deal for Ukraine is half - owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who has done very well out of the deal , and who Yulia Tymoshenko is not keen on , to put it mildly .
Yulia would like to see the original deal torn up .
For an eye - opening account of the gas deals between Turkmenistan and Ukraine , see Global Witenss ’s It 's a Gas.
Funny Business in the Turkmen - Ukraine Gas Trade ( http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/479/en/its_a_gas._...).
Tuesday Gazprom warned that it might cut off Ukraine 's natural gas if Kiev did n't pay a mysterious $ 1.3 billion overdue gas bill by Nov. 1 . Wednesday the threat to Europe 's gas supply disappeared when Ukraine agreed to pay .
Right ?
Wrong .
Gazprom said that " the Ukraine Government of the day " had " regained control " and resolved to pay .
But today 's Ukraine government probably wo n't exist by Nov. 1 , and its replacement will probably be less Moscow - friendly , since it 's likely to be run by recent electoral victor Yulia Tymoshenko .
She has railed against the compromise that ended Ukraine 's run-in with Gazprom two years ago .
Gas flows to Europe briefly fell during that feud , undermining confidence in Russia as a reliable supplier .
Also , Turkmenistan appears poised to demand a 50 % higher price for the gas its sells to Gazprom .
Since Gazprom resells Turkmen gas to Ukraine , that price rise would inevitably be passed on to Kiev -- not a relaxing prospect .

6b / Gazprom says it has deal on gas with Kiev ( Financial Times , Thu 04 Oct )
http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=071004000050&ct=0
Comment : The FT take on current events .
Gazprom , the Russian state - controlled energy group , yesterday said it had secured an agreement from Ukraine 's current government to pay $ 1.3bn ( €921 m , £ 639 m ) in natural gas arrears by November 1 , thus avoiding potential cuts in supplies .
Dmitry Medvedev , the Gazprom chairman and Russia 's first deputy prime minister , said that following talks with Yury Boiko , Ukraine 's energy minister , " we have reached agreement to avoid such problems in the future " .
He added : " Euro - pean consumers wo n't suffer .
European consumers are in an absolutely comfortable situation . "
But despite his assurances , confusion remained about the exact nature of the agreement reached in Moscow , with analysts suggesting it might be only an initial step towards resolving a standoff that has rekindled fears over possible shortages in gas supplies to Europe .
... President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine went further : " The Ukrainian state and [ the state gas distributor ] Naftogaz Ukrainy have no debts to Gazprom . "
He also raised doubts about the timing of the dispute that erupted days after the elections .
" I do n't think that . . . this statement was formulated in such a way and at such a time so as to be constructive for our relations , " he said .
...
Mr Yushchenko earlier this week looked poised to resurrect his partnership with opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko in forming a coalition that would have probably seen Ms Tymoshenko replace Mr Yanukovich as prime minister .
Ms Tymoshenko has promised to clean up the involvement of intermediaries in the gas trade between Ukraine , Russia and Central Asia ...
7/ Plans for Saudi's $ 3bn smelter underway ( Arabian Business , Thu 04 Oct )
http://www.arabianbusiness.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article...
Comment :
The article explains one reason why Saudi Arabia needs substantial new electrical power , a major new aluminium smelter , but no details on how the new 4,860 MW power station will be fired – gas or coal .
Saudi Arabia may have the world ’s fifth largest natural gas reserves , but as the IEA ’s Natural Gas Market Review 2007 points out ( p154 ) : “ Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also facing gas shortages , as a result of allocations for power generation projects and in the former , petrochemicals .
There has always been considerable interest in Saudi Arabia as a potential net gas exporter from the region given the size of its reserve base .
However , unconfirmed reports suggest that near and mid-term gas availability even for domestic uses is tight .
This has had the impact of delaying supplies of feedstock for planned petrochemical projects and may cause future project plans to be revised .
Saudi Arabia has also reverted to the use of oil products for some new power generation , rather than natural gas , in contrast to previous policies favouring natural gas as a means of displacing oil use . ”
Malaysian infrastructure and energy group MMC Corporation and its Saudi Binladin Group partner agreed to co-build an aluminium smelter costing $ 3 billion in the Middle East with Aluminium Corporation of China , MMC said on Thursday .
The smelter forms part of a $ 30 billion , 30 - year contract to build a 117 - sq km " Jizan Economic City " 725 km south of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia that MMC and its 50 - 50 Saudi partner , Binladin Group won last year .
The project will include ports , aluminium smelters , steel and copper processing plants , oil refineries , fisheries and agro - based industries , MMC said in the November announcement .
...
" In conjunction with this project and the on - going development of the industrial zone , MMC has plans to build a power plant with an estimated capacity of 4,860 MW that will cater to the needs of the industrial users , " the firm told the stock exchange .
MMC did not provide additional details on the power plant ...
8/ US energy policy ( Financial Times , Thu 04 Oct )
http://search.ft.com/nonFtArticle?id=071004000247&ct=0
Comment : Comment from the FT , ‘ LEX ’ section , suggesting the US love affair with corn - to - ethanol may have something to do with upcoming elections .
If US energy policy were a dish , it would be an unwholesome mélange of cake , corn and pork .
No wonder America 's cars have bulked up .
The Environmental Protection Agency says the weight of the average US car or light truck rose 29 per cent in the past 20 years to almost 1.9 tonnes .
That helps explain why , despite advances in engine technology , average fuel economy has actually fallen from 22 miles a gallon to 20.2 .
Cheap oil meant that " bigger is better " became the mantra of vehicle design .
High oil prices have had a small effect recently , with an increase of 0.9 mpg in average fuel economy since 2004 .
But energy policy remains focused on allowing drivers to have their cake and eat it rather than curbing demand .
Nothing demonstrates this better than Washington 's love affair with corn-derived ethanol .
Corn farmers benefit from subsidies for investments in ethanol production and higher produce prices resulting from the displacement of food crops .
Ethanol corrodes pipelines - so it is often transported in trucks which , er , burn fuel - and several academic studies claim its production uses more energy than the resulting fuel actually provides .
Continuing subsidies may have something to do with the fact that America 's top 10 corn - growing states hold almost 40 per cent of electoral college votes .
Inducements have fuelled oversupply , causing ethanol margins to collapse while also pushing up food prices .
Meanwhile , Detroit struggles to reinvent itself , having spent two decades pushing more horsepower and metal at US drivers while foreign competitors have taken the lead in energy efficient vehicles .
And a 14 - year freeze on federal fuel tax encourages more driving of those heavier cars , battering America 's roads and bridges while simultaneously undermining the revenue base used for renewing them .
Throw in growing concern about environmental deterioration and it's enough to leave you feeling queasy .
9a / Stellar Performance With Astrophysicist
At The Helm ( Press and Journal ‘ Energy ’ supplement , Mon 01 Oct )
http://www.thisisnorthscotland.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=149212&comma...
Comment : The Press and Journal ( P&J ) is the main Aberdeen , Scotland daily newspaper and is very pro oil and gas industry .
Thus it usually avoids any mention of Peak Oil / oil depletion although the P&J monthly supplement , ‘ Energy ’ , occasionally covers Peak Oil .
Both articles 9a and 9b are from the October ‘ Energy ’ supplement ( http://emag.digitalpc.co.uk/nep/energy_october07.asp), item 9b near the back ( p24 ) .
The first article ( 9a ) is an interview with James Buckee , ex-CEO of Talisman , now firmly entrenched in the Peak Oil community – he was a panellist in the first panel discussion at ASPO - 6 and stated clearly that PO would occur within the next few years / was here already , or words to that effect .
The article also covers the Forties field .
The latest data suggest that Forties has had its second peak ( http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/pprs/full_production/oil_production_sorted_by_f...), and is in decline again .
… Talisman has been in the North Sea for 11 years , and as far as Buckee is concerned , the strategic value of the province has not waned at all .
" The world consumes 30 - plus billion barrels of oil a year , but is finding less than 10 billion .
This is unsustainable .
I do believe in the Peak Oil theory .
It 's obvious , which means oil prices will move higher .
It also means that a premium is placed on existing fields .
" In the North Sea , we have the infrastructure and we have lots of oil in place beneath .
I believe we can keep on improving the recovery factor of such fields for quite a long time yet . " …
But Buckee did n't get everything he wanted .
Consider Forties .
Not many years ago it was the next big thing for BP in the North Sea - redevelopment would yield another 400 million barrels of oil at least .
It was on the projects list , but then it was suddenly sold in February , 2003 , to US independent Apache - around the time that North Sea general manager Steve Marshall was shunted off to Alaska .
" We looked at Forties .
BP had left a very clear roadmap of what to do .
It had done 4D seismic , carried out very clever subsurface work - including applying subtle seismic interpretation techniques - set out a drilling schedule , and so forth .
" But Apache bought the field , said thanks very much and used that map .
We would have , too .
We bid Forties , but they bid more than us ( two others bid , too ) . "
The winning bid ?
It was 1.3 billion , according to headlines at the time , and almost certainly a steal for Apache .
Buckee said : " However , majors are coming around to the view that they 've been giving away assets that are much more valuable than they seemed at the time .
In the case of Forties , John Browne ( ex group CEO ) was trying to send the signal out that there were no sacred cows in the BP portfolio - even Forties , the backbone of BP .
9b / Peak Oil 10 - 20 Years Away , Claims World Energy Council ( Press and Journal ‘ Energy ’ supplement , Mon 01 Oct )
http://www.thisisnorthscotland.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=149212&comma...
Comment : Gives a very rosy picture of global natural gas reserves , overlooking the trend that global gas demand is beginning to outstrip supply now , as detailed in the IEA ’s Natural Gas Market Review 2007 .
