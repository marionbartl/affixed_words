Act , Structure - Bitch Break So Miss Dara tells met that a traditional screenplay has 3 acts .
The first act sets up the conflict ; the second , intensifies the conflict and the third , resolves ( gulp ! ) the conflict .
We begin with an “ inciting incident ” .
In our case that would be the absolute boredom our heroine feels for life : she fucking hates it .
She ’s putting one beautiful foot in front of the other .
She ’s Cinderella .
She has n’t my bunions .
She has n’t my skinny , long toed feet .
She has beautiful , unbony feet .
The kind of feet you might want to suck if you were that kind of person .
She sighs .
The man .
Hm. Hi .
Yah , it ’s been a few days – I was n’t scattered however , just busy .
I ’ve got to bring home my bacon and that will probably come from things other than this story , as much as I enjoy writing it .
" A Great Story Tells Us " ...
Ok , working from the screenwriter ’s workshop I was at a few weeks ago , I ’m examining my story .
1 . “ A great story tells us :
a . How a person succeeds or fails ( character )
b. To grow and change ( arc )
c. Within the context of the conflict that is unfolding ( plot )
d . From the writer ’s point of view ( theme ) ” ( 1 )
How a person succeeds or fails :
My writer is going to fail to write a novel .
She is going to sketch everything out , but at the end , fail to bring it all together .
Bam !
Blast – like Chernobyl .
She is going to fail because she lacks confidence .
Because her depression , loneliness , feelings of loss and confusion overtake her .
She is scattered .
She can not finish things .
The man is going to fail as well .
The alien – she will fail because she “ is ” the writer .
The Missing Plot Plot – that is something I have to work on .
It ’s essential to a story yet I do n’t have one .
What will be the plot ?
I guess there is the plot of the author writing the story .
She could complete the story or not .
Or something could happen to her – like Chernobyl – that prevents her from completing the story .
Of course , she could literally get drawn into the story , or the story ’s characters could get drawn into her life .
Or something else entirely .
Fiction – yah , it ’s pretty great that way .
What about the man , the toad and the alien ?
Should I nuke em ?
Do I want to write about the man with all the sores on his body ?
Or the lonely alien ?
Or the toad ?
What about the mushrooms I said I wanted to write about ?
Do I have to choose my plot now or can I just start writing and see where I go , later , once I ’m done my research ?
I guess some sort of plot outline would be good .
I definitely like the author part .
It ’s easy to write and does n’t require much imagination .
This is important to me : I ’m pretty ordinary and thinking up imaginative things is work .
Quotes from People Who Lived Around Chernobyl at Time of Disaster Ok , back to the evacuation .
From reddit.com thread ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/86i8l/picture_tour_of_cherno...):
“ I grew up about 100 mi from there .
I remember when the evening news announced there was a " minor " incident and showed a very brief image of smoke rising in the distance .
It did n't seem like anything serious ... at least my father was n't worried .
Fuckers covered it up .
And only started admitting what really happened when radiation was reaching Western Europe .
Then they offered free apartments and other perks for those who wanted to go and clear up the mess .
Many who took the offer did n't need apartments when they got back -- they headed straight to the hospital and then to the cemetery .
I heard stories of people being cooked alive , their meat was falling off they bones , yuk !
I also remember my mom's plants on the balcony died that summer .
I do n't know how much dosage we all absorbed .
Getting to Know
Theme , cont .
I guess my purpose is to shine a compassionate light on depression , loneliness , feelings of loss and confusion .
My purpose is to state that these states of being will always be with us .
In the case of Chernobyl , is there any doubt that lost men and confusion caused the accident ?
I do n’t know if they were depressed and lonely , but surely the accident caused depression and alienation among many , many people who ’s lives were destroyed by the whims of a government and officials they had little control over .
Does anyone deny them the right to be sad , and alienated ?
Lost ?
Confused , if they had been trusting in the basic goodness of other people , as many people around me seem to be ?
Why should I not be allowed to be depressed and / or alienated ?
Why should I be expected to bring lightness and frivolity to meetings and socials ?
Because I ’m fair skinned , blue - eyed and blond ?
Because I ’m tall and thin ?
Because you think that because I meet the beauty ideal for women , I must have it all ?
Because I meet that beauty ideal , I must be ( imprisoned by ) it ?
Getting to Know
Theme I should probably write two entries this morning : one for last night and one for tonight .
Tonight , I ’ll be at a sleep over with the performing arts troupe I joined .
I ’d tell you more about the troupe , but this novel is about me .
Theme – Er , I added about ½ page to yesterday ’s work that I ’ll include in today ’s word count .
I ’m feeling a bit sick , by the way .
Sure hope I do n’t have H1N1 .
Hello to you ,
Theme !
I need to do an entry and three - quarters this eve , it seems .
Yesterday , I went to a writing workshop .
It was for screenplay writing but since I ’m about to start a documentary , and have been working on another video project , it seemed a good idea .
Also , I need to practice my social skills cause my work is extremely non-social , making it hard to interact with clients and potential clients .
Dara , the woman leading the workshop , told us that we need to know what our theme is .
We have to know what our theme , plot and characters are ; ie .
we need to describe them with intention .
She gave us tools ; ie .
questions to answer and story arcs and timelines to follow , to help us describe our characters and tell our story with intention .
She said that the raw draft is always kind of a mess – that its purpose is to just get the basic elements down and that after that , we analyze what we are trying to say and recreate the characters , plot and story arcs to best say it .
So let me pull up my weird little outline again ( I ’ll use the updated one ) : The Evacuation People were not evacuated from Pripyat , Chernobyl and the surrounding areas until 36 hours after the explosion .
Other areas took weeks , months and even years before they were evacuated .
The explosion occurred on Apr. 26 , 1986 , at 1:23 am. 400 times more fallout was released than at Hiroshima .
336,000 people were resettled .
The accident was largely the result of testing an emergency cooling system .
To be continued ..
Chernobyl , Pripyat and Slavutych Compared Tonight ’s task : Chernobyl , Pripyat , Slavutych and area before the accident , during and afterwards .
Chernobyl is a town , about 800 years old , about 14.5 km from the Chernobyl Disaster plant .
The city of Pripyat was built along with the power plant , starting in 1970 , to house the plant workers .
Slavutych was built post disaster to house the evacuated people of Pripyat .
Pripyat , on the bank of a river of the same name , Pripyat , is closer to the Chernobyl plant than Chernobyl , while Slavutych , on the Dnieper River , is 45 km east of Chernobyl .
Chernobyl , at the time of the blast had 14,000 inhabitants ; Pripyat , 50,000 .
Slavutych , as of 2005 , had 25,000 inhabitants .
Chernobyl is in the Zone of Exclusion .
Of the 400 people who refused to leave / went back to their homes , about ½ of them are from and / or in Chernobyl now .
They mark their houses with signs stating “ Owner of this house lives here . ”
Outline Review and More Research Today , I ’ve updated “ Too Broad Outline to Specific Outline and Work Plan ” , Nov. 6 09 ’s entry .
I added “ Pripyat , Slavutych and area ” to the “ Describe Chernobyl , item c ” .
It now reads : “ Chernobyl , Pripyat , Slavutych and area before the accident , during and afterwards . ”
Also , I will try to write a page a day , but will be lenient with myself when research takes more time than I planned .
Research is a good thing ; something many people view as time wasting , but facts , ideas and knowledge are healthy food for imagination .
A lot of people view vegetables as basically , a waste of time also .
Stupid people .
I also think I will add a plot outline .
I ’ve got the theme of me , the author , being a lost , lonely , confused and depressed woman , but how is this author going to become part of the story ?
How is she going to interact with the man , the alien and the toad ?
I ’ll finish my research first , though .

OpenSSH cutting edge
Federico Biancuzzi interviews OpenSSH developer Damien Miller to discuss features included in the upcoming version 4.3 , public key crypto protocols details , timing based attacks and anti-worm measures .
Could you introduce yourself ?
Damien Miller : I am one of the developers of OpenSSH and OpenBSD .
I have been working on OpenSSH since starting the project to port it to other platforms ( initially Linux ) back in 1999 , but found myself working more and more on the native OpenBSD version of OpenSSH and on the OpenBSD operating system itself as time went on .
I also maintain a couple of other free software projects , most notably a collection of NetFlow tools ( pfflowd , flowd and softflowd ) .
The upcoming OpenSSH version 4.3 will add support for tunneling .
What type of uses is this feature suited for ?
Damien Miller : Reyk and Markus ' new tunneling support allows you to make a real VPN using OpenSSH without the need for any additional software .
This goes well beyond the TCP port forwarding that we have supported for years - each end of a ssh connection that uses the new tunnel support gets a tun ( 4 ) interface which can pass packets between them .
This is similar to the type of VPN supported by OpenVPN or other SSL - VPN systems , only it runs over SSH .
It is therefore really easy to set up and automatically inherit the ability to use all of the authentication schemes supported by SSH ( password , public key , Kerberos , etc. )
The tunnel interfaces that form the endpoints of the tunnel can be configured as either a layer - 3 or a layer - 2 link .
In layer - 3 mode you can configure the tun ( 4 ) interfaces with IP or IPv6 addresses and route packets over them like any other interface - you could even run a dynamic routing protocol like OSPF over them if you were so inclined .
In layer - 2 mode , you can make them part of a bridge ( 4 ) group to bridge raw ethernet frames between the two ends .
A practical use of this might be securely linking back to your home network while connected to an untrusted wireless net , being able to send and receive ICMP pings and to use UDP based services like DNS .
Like any VPN system that uses a reliable transport like TCP , an OpenSSH 's tunnel can alter packet delivery dynamics ( e.g. a dropped transport packet will stall all tunnelled traffic ) , so it probably is n't so good for things like VOIP over a lossy network ( use IPsec for that ) , but it is still very useful for most other things .
Some companies have included crypto features in their hardware , for example Intel included a PRNG in some chipsets , and VIA bundled a full hardware set of crypto functions in its recent CPUs .
How and when can OpenSSH take advantage of specific types of hardware like these ?
Damien Miller : OpenSSH depends on OpenSSL for cryptographic services and therefore depends on OpenSSL to take advantage of hardware facilities .
On OpenBSD at least , this support is seamless - OpenSSL has hooks to directly use Via Padlock instructions ( which are amazingly fast ) or go via the crypto ( 4 ) device to use co-processors like hifn ( 4 ) or ubsec ( 4 ) .
On other operating systems , OpenSSL needs some application support to tell it to load " engine " modules to provide access to hardware services .
Darren Tucker has posted patches to portable OpenSSH to get it to do this , but we have n't received any test reports back yet .
Why did you increase the default size of new RSA / DSA keys generated by ssh - keygen from 1024 to 2048 bits ?
Damien Miller : Firstly , increasing the default size of DSA keys was a mistake ( my mistake , corrected in the next release ) because unmodified DSA is limited by a 160 - bit subgroup and SHA - 1 hash , obviating the most of the benefit of using a larger overall key length , and because we do n't accept modified DSA variants with this restriction removed .
There are some new DSA standards on they way that use larger subgroups and longer hashes , which we could use once they are standardized and included in OpenSSL .
We increased the default RSA keysize because of recommendations by the NESSIE project and others to use RSA keys of at least 1536 bits in length .
Because host and user keys generated now will likely be in use for several years we picked a longer and more conservative key length .
Also , 2048 is a nice round ( binary ) number .
Do you plan to add any other algorithm to generate / exchange keys ?
For example , why did n't you include an implementation of ECC , used by the NSA ?
Damien Miller : ECC ( Elliptic Curve Cryptography ) has some speed and key size advantages , but there are two impediments to use using it .
First , no ECC key exchange method has been specified for the SSH protocol .
This is n't too much of a problem as the protocol has a great extension mechanism that allows us to define new methods without breaking other implementations or having to go begging to the IANA for a number reservation .
The second reason is more of a killer : many ECC methods are patented .
The NSA made the press recently for licensing these patents , something that we have neither the means nor the desire to do .
There are ECC methods that are not patented , but the whole area is a minefield that we do n't really want to navigate .
Also , some of the ECC methods that are patented are the optimizations that give ECC its performance advantage .
On modern machines , the key exchange is n't much of a delay anyway and can often be avoided by using the connection multiplexing support that has been in openssh - 3.9 ( reusing the one SSH connection for multiple commands , file transfer or login sessions ) .
The recent version 4.2 " added support for the improved arcfour cipher modes from draft - harris - ssh - arcfour - fixes - 02 .
The improves the cipher 's resistance to a number of attacks by discarding early keystream output " .
Could you tell us something more ?
Damien Miller : Remember that RC4 is a stream cipher ; generating a stream of random - looking bytes ( based on the key you feed it ) that you XOR with the data that you want to encrypt .
Fluhrer , Mantin and Shamir found that this early keystream can be correlated with the original key .
This unfortunate property may be used to construct an attack that recovers the original key .
In its strongest form , this attack is devastating ( it is the basis of the 802.11 WEP crack for example ) - fortunately the use of RC4 in the SSH protocol has been better engineered , but it still needed to be fixed .
An easy and computationally cheap way to avoid this attack is to simply discard this early keystream .
These new cipher modes discard the first 1.5 KB of keystream .
This does n't slow down the cipher at all , and so these modes are recommended for people who want to use a faster , but weaker cipher than AES .
I.e. use these in favour of the original ' arcfour ' cipher .
A future release of OpenSSH will probably remove the old method from the default list of accepted ciphers .
GFS : Fundamental Paradigm Shift or One - off Oddity ?
As regular readers know , I believe that the current model of enterprise storage is badly broken .
When I see something that blows that model away I like to learn more .
In particular , I assess the marketability of the innovation .
So a cool technology , like GFS or backup compression , makes me wonder if and how customers would buy it .
This article offers a 100,000 foot view of GFS by way assessing its commercial viability .
If you want a technical article about GFS , I can only recommend The Google File System by Ghemawat , Gobioff , & Leung , from which this article draws heavily .
The Wikipedia article , oddly , is n’t very good on GFS ( as of 5 - 16 - 06 ) .
If you do n’t have a BS / CS or better you ’ll likely find Ghemawat et. al. a slog .
Probably worthwhile .
Good for temporary relief of insomnia .
Google From Space
GFS is one of the key technologies that enables the most powerful general purpose cluster in history .
While most IT folks lose sleep over keeping the Exchange server backed up for a couple of thousand users , Google ’s infrastructure both supports massive user populations and the regular roll out of compute and data intensive applications that would leave most IT ops folks gibbering in fear .
How do they do it ?
Partly they are smarter than you .
Google employs hundreds of CompSci PhDs as well as many more hundreds of really smart people .
Partly it is their history : impoverished PhD candidates can’t afford fancy hardware to build their toys , so they started cheap and got cheaper .
And finally , being really smart and really poor , they rethought the whole IT infrastructure paradigm .
Their big insight : rather than build availability into every IT element at great cost , build availability around every element at low cost .
Which totally changes the economics of IT , just as the minicomputer in the ’ 70s , the PC in the ’ 80’s and the LAN in the ’90 ’s all did .
Only more so .
When processors , bandwidth and storage are cheap you can afford to spend lots of cycles on what IBM calls autonomic computing .
With the system properly architected and cheap to build out , it scales both operationally and economically .
All that said , Google has n’t done anything unique with their platform that other people had n’t already .
They just put it together and scaled it to unprecedented heights .
Note to CIOs : it is n’t going to take your users long to notice that Google can do this stuff and you can ’t .
Your life is n’t going to get any easier .
GFS From Low - Earth Orbit
Despite the name , GFS ( not to be confused ( although how exactly I do n’t know ) with Sistina ’s GFS – maybe we should call it GooFS ) is not just a file system .
It also maintains data redundancy , supports low - costs snapshots , and , in addition to normal create , delete , open , close , read , write operations also offers a record append operation .
That record append operation reflects part of the unique nature of the Google workload : fed by hundreds of web - crawling bots , Google ’s data is constantly updated with large sequential writes .
Rather than synchronize and coordinate the overwriting of existing data it is much cheaper to simply append new data to existing data .
Another feature of the Google workload is that it mostly consists of two kinds of reads : large streaming reads and small random reads .
As large reads and writes are so common , GFS is optimized for sustained bandwidth rather than low latency or IOPS .
As multi-gigabyte files are the common case , GFS is optimized for handling a few million files , so , doing the math , a single GFS should be able to handle a few petabytes of active data .
All this is built on very cheap components whose frequent failure , given the size of cluster , is expected .
The system monitors itself and detects , tolerates , and recovers quickly from component failures , including disk , network and server failures .
GFS From An SR - 71 Blackbird
A GFS cluster consists of a single master and multiple chunkservers , and is accessed by multiple clients .
Each of these is typically a dirt - cheap Linux box ( lately dual 2 GHz xeons with 2 GB ram and ~ 800 GB of disk ) .
Files are divided into chunks , each identified by a unique 64 - bit handle , and are stored on the local systems as Linux files .
Each chunk is replicated at least once on another server , and the default is three copies of every chunk ( take that RAID - 6 fanboys ! ) .
The chunks are big , like the files they make up : 64MB is the standard chunk size .
The chunkservers do n’t cache file data since the chunks are stored locally and the Linux buffer cache keeps frequently accessed data in memory .
If , like me , you thought bottleneck / SPOF when you saw the single master , you would , like me , have been several steps behind the architects .
The master only tells clients ( in tiny multibyte messages ) which chunkservers have needed chunks .
Clients then interact directly with chunkservers for most subsequent operations .
Now grok one of the big advantages of a large chunk size : clients do n’t need much interaction with masters to gather access to a lot of data .
That covers the bottleneck problem , but what about the SPOF ( single point of failure ) problem ?
We know the data is usually copied three times — when disk is really cheap you can afford that — but what about the all - important metadata that keeps track of where all the chunks are ?
The master stores — in memory for speed — three major types of metadata :
File and chunk names [ or namespaces in geekspeak ]
in geekspeak ]
Mapping from files to chunks , i.e. the chunks that make up each file
Locations of each chunk ’s replicas
So if the master crashes , this data has to be replaced pronto .
The first two — namespaces and mapping — are kept persistent by a log stored on the master ’s local disk and replicated on remote machines .
This log is checkpointed frequently for fast recovery if a new master is needed .
How fast ?
Reads start up almost instantly thanks to shadow masters who stay current with the master in the background .
Writes pause for about 30 - 60 seconds while the new master and the chunkservers make nice .
Many RAID arrays recover no faster .
The last type of metadata , replica locations , is stored on each chunkserver — and copied on nearby machines — and given to the master at startup or when a chunkserver enters a cluster .
Since the master controls the chunk placement it is able to keep itself up - to - date as new chunks get written .
The master also keeps track of the health of the cluster through handshaking with all the chunkservers .
Data corruption is detected through checksumming .
Even so , data may still get pooched .
Thus the GFS reliance on appending writes instead of overwrites ; combined with frequent checkpoints , snapshots and replicas , the chance of data loss is very low , and results in data unavailability , not data corruption .
GFS RAID
They do n’t call it that , but StorageMojo.com cares about storage , and I find this part particularly interesting .
GFS does n’t use any RAID controllers , fibre channel , iSCSI , HBAs , FC or SCSI disks , dual - porting or any of the other costly bling we expect in a wide - awake data center .
And yet it all works and works very well .
Take replica creation or what you and I would call mirroring .
All the servers in the cluster are connected over a full duplex switched Ethernet fabric with pipelined data transfers .
This means that as soon as a new chunk starts arriving , the chunkserver can begin making replicas at full network bandwidth ( about 12MB / sec ) without reducing the incoming data rate .
As soon as the first replica chunkserver has received some data it repeats the process , so the two replicas are completed soon after the first chunk write finishes .
In addition to creating replicas quickly , the master ’s replica placement rules also spread them across machines and across racks , to limit the chance of data unavailability due to power or network switch loss .
Pooling and Balancing
Storage virtualization may be on the downside of the hype cycle , and looking at GFS you can see what simple virtualization looks like when built into the file system .
Instead of a complex software layer to “ pool ” all the blocks across RAID arrays , GFS masters place new replicas on chunkservers with below average disk utilization .
So over time disk utilization equalizes across servers without any tricky and expensive software .
The master also rebalances replicas periodically , looking at disk space utilization and load balancing .
This process also keeps a new chunkserver from being swamped the moment it joins the cluster .
The master allocates data to it gradually .
The master also moves chunks from chunkservers with above average disk utilization to equalize usage .
Storage capacity is reclaimed slowly .
Rather than eager deletion , the master lets old chunks hang around for a few days and reclaims storage in batches .
Done in the background when the master is n’t too busy , it minimizes the impact on the cluster .
In addition , since the chunks are renamed rather than deleted , the system provides another line of defense against accidental data loss .

In the post , we are providing the option to this ...
By Daniel Sokol
Suppose you could save five lives by taking one - what would be the correct thing to do ?
Such ethical dilemmas provide classic " experiments " for philosophers .
Here the Magazine presents four such quandaries and asks readers to vote on what they think is right .
[ Magazine note : apologies but we have had a technical hitch with the votes .
We 've replaced the vote modules , and will add those already cast to the totals . ]
Like scientists , philosophers use experiments to test their theories .
Unlike scientists , their experiments do not require sophisticated laboratories , white - robed technicians or even rodents .
They occur in the mind , and start with ' What if ...'.
These " thought experiments " help philosophers clarify their understanding of certain concepts and intuitions .
In the field of ethics , thought experimenters typically present a dilemma , examine the most popular " intuitive " response and then show the implications for real - world issues .
But such experiments are rarely tested on large numbers of people .
So to reach a larger group , here are four typical experiments .
Readers are invited to vote on how they think they would act in each case .
Here is a well - known example : 1 . THOMSON'S VIOLINIST
One day , you wake up in hospital .
In the nearby bed lies a world famous violinist who is connected to you with various tubes and machines .
VOTE RESULTS
Do you have an obligation to stay connected ?
Yes 30.62 %
No 69.35 %
3765 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
To your horror , you discover that you have been kidnapped by the Music Appreciation Society .
Aware of the maestro's impending death , they hooked you up to the violinist .
If you stay in the hospital bed , connected to the violinist , he will be totally cured in nine months .
You are unlikely to suffer harm .
No one else can save him .
Do you have an obligation to stay connected ?
The creator of the experiment , Judith Thomson , thinks the answer is " no " .
It would be generous if you did , she claims , but there is no obligation to stay , even if that means the violinist will die .
So how is this bizarre scenario related to the real world ?
Thomson used the experiment to show that a pregnant woman need not go to full term with her baby , as long as she had taken reasonable steps to avoid getting pregnant .
It is thus a " pro-choice " argument .
The violinist represents the baby , and you - in the hospital bed - play the role of the mother .
If you think unhooking yourself from the violinist is acceptable , but aborting an unwanted foetus is not , what are the moral differences between the two cases ?
In both situations , you could save a person by bearing a great burden for nine months .
One major flaw with thought experiments , especially in ethics , is that they are rarely tested on people .
The sample size is minuscule .
The philosopher will simply assume that most people think that one option is right ( or wrong ) .
Philippa Foot , a renowned British philosopher , believed that if a doctor , about to save a patient 's life with a large dose of a scarce drug , was suddenly interrupted by the arrival of five patients each in need of one fifth of the drug ( without which death would be certain ) , then the doctor should give it to the five .
It is , after all , better to let one person die than five .
Elizabeth Anscombe , another prominent philosopher , disagreed : " There seems to me nothing wrong with giving the single patient the massive dose and letting the others die " .
As these assumptions about people 's intuition are central to the arguments of many philosophers , and as these assumptions can be tested , why not do so ?
2 . THE RUNAWAY TROLLEY CAR
One of the most famous thought experiments in ethics is " the runaway trolley " .
It aims to clarify how we should distinguish right from wrong .
Here is the scenario with two well - known variations .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you flip the switch ?
Yes 76.85 %
No 23.15 %
3814 Votes Cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion A runaway trolley car is hurtling down a track .
In its path are five people who will definitely be killed unless you , a bystander , flip a switch which will divert it on to another track , where it will kill one person .
Should you flip the switch ?
3. THE FAT MAN AND THE TROLLEY CAR
The runaway trolley car is hurtling down a track where it will kill five people .
You are standing on a bridge above the track and , aware of the imminent disaster , you decide to jump on the track to block the trolley car .
Although you will die , the five people will be saved .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you push the fat man ?
Yes 26.88 %
No 73.12 %
20320 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion Just before your leap , you realise that you are too light to stop the trolley .
Next to you , a fat man is standing on the very edge of the bridge .
He would certainly block the trolley , although he would undoubtedly die from the impact .
A small nudge and he would fall right onto the track below .
No one would ever know .
Should you push him ?
Philippa
Foot would say that everyone ( " without hesitation " ) would choose to flip the switch in the first trolley case , but that most of us would be appalled at the idea of pushing the fat man .
The philosophical puzzle is this :
Why is it acceptable to sacrifice the one person in The Runaway Trolley Car but not in The Fat Man case ?
Can it ever be morally acceptable to kill an innocent person if that is the only way to save many ?
Should some actions - such as deliberately killing innocent people against their wishes - never be done ?
The last thought experiment explores this idea : 4 . THE CAVE EXPLORERS
An enormous rock falls and blocks the exit of a cave you and five other tourists have been exploring .
Fortunately , you spot a hole elsewhere and decide to let " Big Jack " out first .
But Big Jack , a man of generous proportions , gets stuck in the hole .
He can not be moved and there is no other way out .
VOTE RESULTS
Should you blast Big Jack out ?
Yes 74.12 %
No 25.88 %
19377 votes cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
The high tide is rising and , unless you get out soon , everyone but Big Jack ( whose head is sticking out of the cave ) will inevitably drown .
Searching through your backpack , you find a stick of dynamite .
It will not move the rock , but will certainly blast Big Jack out of the hole .
Big Jack , anticipating your thoughts , pleads for his life .
He does not want to die , but neither do you and your four companions .
Should you blast Big Jack out ?
If the roles were reversed , what would you advise your trapped companions to do ?
Thought experiments , although abstract , possibly implausible and open to different interpretations , can have important repercussions on the way we think and act as individuals .
They raise thorny questions about morality in medicine , war , politics and indeed in everyday life .
Is there a difference between killing someone and letting them die ?
Are consequences all that matter , or are there some things we should never do , whatever the outcome ?
By pointing out inconsistencies in our thinking , or simply encouraging us to reflect on issues we usually ignore , they can sharpen our intellect and enrich our moral lives .
They also make for great conversation topics at the dinner table or at the pub .
But be warned : you may lose friends as a result .
And stay away from caves and bridges .

I feel sorry for the five people .
Not only have they had a runaway trolley hurtling towards them but also got trapped in a cave .
What a day !
Laura Kingdon , Cwmbran Surely the answer to the runaway trolley depends on the people involved .
If it were the choice between five 90 - year - olds and a single 20 year old , it would be right to save the 20 year old who , in probability , had longer to live than the others put together ?
Or what if those five were criminals and the other was a volunteer worker ?

It 's interesting to compare this with the Iraq war - was it right through intervention to kill as many people as we have in order to save a far greater number that were dying and would continue to die under the regime .
Usually people seem to say , no , as it is us pushing the fat man , despite the fact that five people arguably died through our inaction .

In the case of the Runaway Trolley Car , I would definitely NOT flip the switch .
The end does n't always justify the means .
Jenny , Leeds
In the examples given we must assume that all involved people are equal .
However , would it be right , good or efficent to kill one superior person to save four lesser people ?
I do not of course mean by race or any such thing but by worth to the whole .
If the one person was a brilliant doctor developing a cure for cancer , would you divert the trolley towards him to save four ?
What about ten ?
Fifty ?
A thousand people crammed onto a train car packed with explosives ?
Chris Fox , Derby I 'd use the dynamite to blast the trolley off the rails and then hook the violinist up to the fat man .
Robin , Edinburgh Thomson 's violinist is not the same principle as abortion .
If you choose to disconnect yourself you are in essence withdrawing treatment , that is refusing to intervene to save the life of someone who would otherwise die .
In an abortion you 're choosing to deliberately end the life of someone who would otherwise live .
Kate I would like to point out a problem I have with the direct application of the violinist thought experiment , as presented above , to the case of abortion .
In the experiment , if the violinist chooses to stay connected , they need have nothing to do with the violinist once the nine months have elapsed .
If a woman is pregnant , and chooses to keep the baby , they will have to bring the baby up - with important consequences for her life , that of the baby , and that of those close to her - or give the baby up for adoption - which again is likely to affect her strongly and will certainly affect the baby .
Suzanne Aigrain , Cambridge
If the violinist were my son or daughter I would not hesitate to stay connected .
( Maybe when they recover they will keep their rooms tidy to show their gratitude ! )
Jack , Coventry Cave Explorers : I am a caver , and I can assure you that the smaller six people definitely would NOT let Big Jack out first - he'd be forced to go last in order to avoid the very situation described ...

It 's your birthday .
Four of your friends together buy you one lottery ticket as a present .
You win £ 5 million .
Do you share the money with these friends , who only spent £ 0.25 each on your birthday present ?
Jagdip Singh Ajimal , Manchester
These situations in reality are n't as black and white as a yes or no answer - different people will respond differently and for different reasons , and no one is necessarily right or wrong .
However , in reality getting involved in choosing who survives will likely get you sued or arrested !
Hannah , Wokingham I really enjoyed the puzzle dilemmas , but I thought that the five people should die in the runaway trolley car as it's their fate ; flipping the switch would be intentional murder .
Also , if I was n't there to flip the switch they would have died anyway - so its all fate !
Ayelee , London
You can only flick switches if you have a perfect understanding of the future , otherwise you might save a serial killer or kill a Nobel peace prize winner .
It is an infinitely unpredictable world and philosophical conundrums cannot take account of this .
As for Big Jack , he 's history , primal instincts would take over from philosophy , the only decision to make is where to put the dynamite .
Julian , Shrewsbury
Would you injure Rooney and put him out of the world cup , or would you rather Gerrard and Lampard and Terry all were injured ?

Snake shows its colours
Enlarge Image
Researchers from Germany and the US discovered the water snake 's chameleon - like behaviour by accident when they put it into a dark bucket .
The environmental group WWF , which supports conservation work in Borneo , says wildlife in the region is threatened by deforestation .
It believes the newly described snake may exist only in one river basin .
Found in the Kapuas river in the Betung Kerihun National Park in Kalimantan ( the Indonesian portion of Borneo ) , it belongs to the Enhydris genus of rear - fanged water snakes and has been named E. gyii .
It is about 50 cm ( 18 inches ) long , and venomous .
Bucket research
The discovery of the ' chameleon " snake exposes one of nature 's best kept secrets deep in the heart of Borneo
Stuart Chapman , WWF
It was Dr Auliya , a consultant for WWF , who discovered serendipitously its colour - changing capacity .
" I put the reddish - brown snake in a dark bucket , " he said .
" When I retrieved it a few minutes later , it was almost entirely white . "
The reasons why it has evolved this attribute are unclear .
The chameleon , possibly the animal kingdom's most famous colour - changer , is believed to alter its hue depending on mood and temperature .
In the last 10 years , more than 350 new animal and plant species have been discovered on Borneo .
" The discovery of the ' chameleon ' snake exposes one of nature 's best kept secrets deep in the heart of Borneo , " said Stuart Chapman , WWF 's international coordinator for the island .
The environmental group warns that the home of the new snake is threatened , as Borneo 's forest cover has declined from 75 % in the mid-1980s to about 50 % today .

“ A company parking lot is just really cheap real estate , ” Mr. Schwartz said .
Mr. Schwartz rose to the chief executive position less than six months ago with a mandate to reverse the decline Sun has experienced since the end of the dot - com boom .
And computing experts suggested that the mobile data center was a gamble that could pay off .
“ What an out - there idea , ” said David A. Patterson , a computer scientist at the University of California , Berkeley , who has worked closely with Sun and with Mr. Hillis .
“ You could convert your warehouse into a modern data center . ”
Mr. Schwartz said the mobile data center would be attractive to customers that need to expand computing capacity quickly .
Sun will lease as well as sell the systems , and Mr. Schwartz said the entire system is recyclable .
On Monday , he gave a reporter a tour of the prototype system , which sits in a container case adjacent to a Sun office building here , connected to two large fire hoses for water cooling and 500 kilowatts of redundant power .
Painted black with a lime green
Sun logo , the system can consist of up to seven tightly packed racks of 35 server computers based on either Sun ’s Niagara Sparc processor or an Opteron chip from Advanced Micro Devices .
The system includes sensors to detect tampering or movement and features a large red button to shut it down in an emergency .
Once plugged in , it requires just five minutes to be ready to run applications .
Sun has applied for five patents on the design of the system , including a water - cooling technique that focuses chilled air directly on hot spots within individual computing servers .
The system , which Sun refers to as “ cyclonic cooling , ” makes it possible to create a data center that is five times as space - efficient as traditional data centers , and 10 percent to 15 percent more power - efficient , Mr. Schwartz said .
Picture it :
On election day in some future year , a presidential candidate ends up with the most popular votes but not enough electoral votes to win .
It 's a repeat of the 2000 election in which one contender , Democrat Al Gore , took the majority of the national popular vote , while the other , Republican George W. Bush , clinched the most electoral college votes and , hence , the presidency .
But this time there 's a twist :
A bunch of states team up and give all their electoral college votes to the nationwide popular - vote winner , regardless of who won the most votes in their state .
Then , the candidate who garners the most citizen votes in the country moves into the White House .
Legislative houses in Colorado and California have recently approved this plan , known as the National Popular Vote proposal , taking it partway to passage .
Other states , too , are exploring the idea of a binding compact among states that would oblige each of them to throw its electoral votes behind the national popular - vote winner .
At issue is the nation 's presidential election system governed by the electoral college .
Established by the US Constitution in 1787 , the system has occasionally awarded the presidency to candidates who could n't muster the most votes nationwide , as happened in 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , and 2000 .
While an amendment to the Constitution could change or eliminate the electoral college , battleground states and small states would probably oppose any change that would leave them with less influence .
Indeed , since the system 's inception , numerous efforts to amend it have been defeated .
Instead , reformers have turned to the interstate compact , saying it would be constitutional because agreements between states already exist .
The compact is designed to take effect only if states representing 270 electoral votes approve the compact legislation , giving those states majority control of the electoral college .
The result :
The " compact " group of states would be able to determine a presidential election .
The plan is supported by electoral reform activists and a bipartisan advisory group including former GOP Rep.
John Anderson ( a presidential candidate in 1980 ) and former Sen. Birch Bayh ( D ) .
They say the compact would allow long - ignored states to get attention again in presidential campaigns .
The current system has " just taken a lot of states off of the presidential map , " complains Rob Richie , executive director of FairVote , a nonpartisan organization based in Maryland , which supports the compact .
The compact proposal passed the California Assembly on May 30 with all but one Republican opposing .
It awaits a vote in the state Senate and , if it passes , approval or rejection by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) , who has n't publicly expressed an opinion about it .
Colorado's Senate approved the plan in April with bipartisan support , but it has not advanced because the legislative session there has ended .
Five GOP
Assembly members are pushing a popular - vote bill in New York , and legislators in Missouri , Louisiana , and Illinois have introduced bills .
Advocates hope to put the legislation before every state by 2007 , says Mr. Ritchie .
Meanwhile , several newspapers have come out in favor of the plan , including The New York Times , which calls it an " ingenious solution . "
But in California , GOP Assemblyman Chuck DeVore derisively refers to the proposal as a way to " amend the Constitution without amending the Constitution . "
" It 's like cheating , " says Mr. DeVore , who predicts that the plan would force candidates to campaign primarily in urban areas with large populations to win the popular vote .
Under the current system " we discourage regional candidacies and basically force people who are running for president to have a message that resonates with the vast middle of America , " he says .
DeVore supports a system that would allocate some of a state 's electoral votes based on the popular vote in congressional districts , an approach that exists in Nebraska and Maine .
All other states and the District of Columbia award all their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who gets the most votes in their state .
It takes 270 electoral votes out of 538 total votes in the college to win the presidency .
That total equals the number of members each state has in both houses of Congress , with the District of Columbia getting three of its own .
The electoral college system is " distinctly American , " says Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the University of California , Riverside .
In US history , there have been about 700 failed proposals in Congress to change the electoral college system , according to the Office of the Federal Register .
" It 's safe to say that there has been no aspect of what the founders worked up in Philadelphia that has received more criticism than the electoral college , " says historian Rick Shenkman of George Mason University .
If any state approves this new proposal , legal challenges are inevitable , Bowler says .
But he figures there might be a way to dampen enthusiasm .
" You could say the French elect their president directly , " he says .
" I 'm thinking that will get people running away from any support :
If the French do it , is it really right for the US ? "
[ Editor 's note :
The original version contained a paragraph that misstated how the proposed system would work . ]
The common argument in favor of the Military Commissions Act ’s restriction of habeas corpus is summed up by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist :
We do n’t want ( terror suspects ) to have everyday rights of American civilians right here .
These are war criminals .
There ’s really no other argument in support of it that comes even close to sounding sane , though there are of course a plethora of rephrasings out there ( such as the rhetorical “ Do n’t you want the government to be able to stop terrorists ? ” ) .
There are half - arguments , of course .
They tend to involve phrases such as “ This does n’t apply to US citizens ! ” or “ It ’s only for enemy combatants ! ”
They all boil down to one simple fact : supporters are working on the assumption that , somehow , it will only apply to people who are guilty .
The problem with that , of course , is that the Great Writ ’s entire purpose and the whole necessity for its existence is bound up in one single , simple aim :
The Writ of Habeas Corpus exists only to ensure that we have the right guy in custody .
One must wonder why the hell the government needs to deny accused terrorists access to the courts under a Writ of Habeas Corpus if the accused are actually guilty .
If they ’re guilty , the court proceeding that results from the serving of such a Writ should determine that — or , more to the point , should determine whether there ’s sufficient reason to even believe the accused is guilty to an extent that warrants detention and investigation .
If a Writ of Habeas Corpus leads to a decision that the accused is in fact not being held justly , the person should damned well not be held any longer !
That wrongly accused person should receive an apology and a ride home .
That person should never have been detained in the first place .
Mistakes happen , but they are not solved by ensuring that we cannot discover whether or not a mistake has been made .
The Military Commissions
Act in no way improves the ability to pursue a “ war on terror ” by suspending habeas corpus .
All it does is sweep mistakes under the rug and ensure that those who are wronged in pursuit of the specter of security will only continue to be wronged indefinitely , and nobody can do anything about it .
It seems impossible that those Senators and Representatives who voted for this , or that the President who will be signing it into law on the 17th , even for a moment considered the likelihood that they might think differently of this if they did not currently hold public office .
In short , the simple truth of the Writ of Habeas Corpus is that all it does is help sort the good guys from the bad guys , to the benefit of the good guys , and suspending it in whole or in part for those literally or effectively detained on US soil in no way benefits anyone at all except those whose errors destroy the lives of innocent bystanders and should be brought into the light of public scrutiny .

Shanghai grows at a dizzying rate
Greater Shanghai has a population that has passed 20 million .
The sprawl of Mexico City is estimated to house another 20 million .
And Mumbai too .
These cities are bigger than many industrialised nations .
And they are growing at a dizzying rate , sucking in workers from rural areas .
Sociologist Professor Richard Sennett believes the rise of these cities is changing their relationship with the countries they are in .
He is one of a number of academics carrying out research into the evolution of cities .
Economically , many of the world 's great cities are already divorced from their nation - states , with their main streams of investment come from other great cities .
" The most important place to London is New York and to New York is London and Tokyo , " Prof Sennett says .
" London belongs to a country composed of itself and New York . "
Anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity
London Mayor Ken Livingston
Shanghai has so much power and autonomy it has been described as effectively a city - state , within China only in geography .
And on Thursday London Mayor Ken Livingstone was handed a raft of new powers over planning , housing and the environment .
He joked : " Having been to Singapore and seen how successful it was I think anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity , with its own foreign and defence policies thrown in . "
And Ivan Massow , who has twice tried for Mr Livingstone 's job as first a Conservative and then Labour hopeful , has long campaigned for the capital to be given a " fair share of the national cake " .
" It will cost £ 2 billion to fix the Tube and £ 1.5 bn to benefit from the effects of the 2012 Olympics , yet [ Londoners ] subsidise the rest of the UK to the tune of £ 20 billion a year . "
Sister cities
There are many British people who already find London a strangely foreign place .
And when the London - centric media views the rest of the country , it has a pronounced tendency to view it through a prism of life in the capital .
Migrants move with their work
Prof Sennett says the inequalities between London and other British cities will only increase .
And with the economic and demographic gulf widening , it will soon be even harder to accept that London has more in common with Sheffield than Shanghai , with Preston than Paris .
It all has echoes of Europe 's great tradition of city states , from Ancient Greece through Renaissance Italy and pre-1870s Germany .
One thing that sets London apart - and puts it in the same bracket as the other mega-cities - is its attractiveness to immigrants .
Prof Sennett paints a picture of an intensely entrepreneurial class of economic migrants on a global travelator around swelling cities , moving Shanghai to London to New York .
Many have no moorings and an ambivalent attitude towards the country outside their host city .
But there are signs for hope , such as the national sense of loss over the 7 July bombings .
Prof Sennett concludes : " I do n't think people can really do without national unity .
It is culturally unsustainable . "
Capitalise on London 's success : Prof Sennett 's views make sense .
It is therefore important that a successful growing London continues to receive government investment for key infrastructure to maintain its position as the most productive area in the UK and Europe .
James Gardner , London
I no longer see London as part of my country , it 's economy , cultural make up , wealth and outlook are totally divorced from anything I recognise as British in any sense .
Ceebe , West Mids
No matter how developed they become , cities will always be reliant on the surrounding country for natural resources .
People have to eat , need gas for their automobiles .
No amount of economic development can change that simple fact .
Lance , Berkeley , California
The time is fast approaching when cities like Manchester and Birmigham need to have much greater freedom and control of their " city regions " in order to prosper .
The English " city regions " have much less in common with smaller cities and towns in the mainly shire counties and consequently need a different form of government .
A " city region " mayor as in London is probably a sensible first step but in any event change must surely come .
Doug Hardy , Manchester
So London subsidises the UK to the tune of £ 20 bn a year ?
Surely this is fair recompense for the non-financial subsidies ( workers , graduates , know - how etc ) the rest of the UK supplies to London thus enabling it to generate so much wealth .
Or what about the billions in Scottish oil revenue that floods into the wider UK economy and , hence , London's .
I 'm not arguing over whether any of this is right or wrong but simply pointing out that there are non-financial economic measures as well .

One life
Lawrence Koomson is a doctor living and working in London .
On the face of it , he seems no different from any other young man but Lawrence has a secret .
At 33 , he has never been through puberty .
He 's never had a spot .
He 's never had an erection .
And he 's trapped in the body of a 12 - year - old boy .
But this all changed in April 2005 , when he began treatment to bring on puberty .
The thought of treatment scared Lawrence
Lawrence has Kallmann 's syndrome , a rare condition affecting predominantly men , but also women .
A small area in the brain called the hypothalamus cannot work properly causing a hormonal imbalance .
For men like Lawrence , this means his body does n't produce testosterone , which prevents puberty being triggered .
Another characteristic of Kallmann 's syndrome is an absent sense of smell .
Having Kallmann 's syndrome can lead to extreme difficulties , especially during adolescence , when all one 's peers are going through puberty .
And the consequences of delayed puberty and not becoming sexually mature naturally has a far - reaching impact on sufferers ' lives .
In essence he's got the testosterone levels of a one - year - old so we 've got quite a lot of catching up to do
Professor Pierre Bouloux
" We 've tested Lawrence 's blood testosterone levels and the results make for quite interesting reading , " he said , before the treatment .
" The reference range for men Lawrence 's age would be a testosterone level between 9.9 and 27.8 .
" Lawrence 's level is less than 0.5 .
In essence he's got the testosterone levels of a one - year - old so we 've got quite a lot of catching up to do .
" In terms of penile length we 're talking about a resting length of about four centimetres , and for a chap of Lawrence 's size that shows that development has n't occurred as yet . "
With treatment , it 's hoped Lawrence will grow body hair , his voice will break , he 'll develop body muscle and sexual organs and for the first time will experience sexual desire .
36 - hour erection
The treatment consists of six implants in the buttock , which release 200 milligrams of testosterone over six months .
He will be dependent on implants for the rest of his life .
Professor Bouloux has treated more than 300 patients over the last 15 - 20 years .
" In extreme situations , I 've seen people not being able to handle the testosterone treatment , developing erections lasting hours and hours , and in one case up to 36 hours .
" There 's no script for this , we got to see what happens and navigate a safe course to give Lawrence a level which will put him in a normal range . "
It happened today .
I was so scared I was n't sure if it was going to or not going to .
I had an erection !
Lawrence Koomson
" The thought of treatment makes me feel a bit frightened or scared because I do n't know what 's going to happen .
I might have the urge to have sex when I do n't want to have sex !
" I feel excited - it 's something I 've never been through before .
I 'll grow a beard and I 've always wanted to see how I 'll be with a beard and you know I 'll get more muscle , so I think the ladies are going to love the new me ! "
Lawrence received his long awaited implants in April 2005 .
The next day , he was glued to the mirror watching and waiting for changes .
What will happen first ?
A spot ?
An erection ?
Or signs of a beard ?
Dating was a whole new world
" It happened today .
I was so scared I was n't sure if it was going to or not going to .
I had an erection !
" It really woke me up !
It lasted 10 - 15 minutes .
I was happy !
I wanted to call the doctor but it was too early in the morning . "
For the next six months , Lawrence went through puberty .
As the massive implant of testosterone began to take hold of his body , Lawrence started to feel sexual attraction to women for the first time .
He also experienced all the usual teenage distractions - surfing internet chatrooms looking for female company , even mobile phone porn .
It was all new territory for him .
" I 'm resisting that push into the teenage world , " he said .
" I have to behave more responsibly , much more responsibly .
Not only am I not a teenager .
Also , there 's the very fact that I 'm a medical doctor and I have to behave more responsibly than that . "
Novice
Moral conflicts aside , as Lawrence made tentative steps into the scary world of dating , the disappointments started to stack up .
Most men make their first advances towards women at an age when it does n't really matter but at 33 years old , Lawrence found out that the stakes were high .
He shyly arranged his first date over the internet and suggested a trip to the cinema , but baulked when he found out that she wanted to go clubbing .
I 've really missed out on two decades of life and I need to catch up
Lawrence Koomson
" I 'm too much of a novice to go into all that .
I could n't allow myself , for me I 'm not mature yet to do that - I can't do that , not yet . "
But mature enough or not , the opportunity to live a grown man 's life was not something Lawrence was going to let slip by .
" I 've really missed out on two decades of life and I need to catch up . "
One life - Male , 33 , Seeks Puberty , is on BBC One at 2235 GMT on Tuesday 6 December
Your comments :
This is really one of the " mistakes " of nature .
I can imagine the ordeal Lawrence has gone through .
Thanks
God however , that the treatment is a simple surgical procedure with a very promising prognosis .
There are other very complicated neurohormonal , genetic and congenital abnormalities that can be highly debilitating .
Thanks to the recent advances in the medical profession .
A.D.Russa , Morioka , Japan
I wish Lawrence all the best , puberty can be very trying to all and to go through it at 33 wont be easy but I think he will be fine and is mature enough to get through it .
I hope he meets someone who will take things slowly .
Sarah , Bracknell
I also suffer from the syndrome .
As a teenager I found it very difficult and could not understand why I was the way I was .
This programme will be great for other suffers , I 'm glad that more people will be able to now see what my life has been like !
Ian , Newbury Park , Essex
I am 56 years old and I was diagnosed with Kallmann 's Syndrome over 30 years ago .
I still have testosterone injections every three weeks .
I attended the endocrine clinic at St Bartholemew 's Hospital .
My wife and I were not able to have children and I have since had to have surgery on my testicles .
I will be most interested to see the program .
Mike , Milton Keynes
Kat seems unaware that Lawrence 's inability to have an erection is a separate symptom from his missed puberty .
Erections do not begin at puberty ; most boys are capable of having them from birth onwards .
Kelly Mouser , Upminster , Essex
What a brave man Mr Lawrence is .... Puberty is never an easy time ....
But to go through it at the age 33 .... I wish him all the best .... May his journey be a smooth one ....
Chris Ley , Shaftsbury Vermont U.S.A .
Wow !
It seems that everyone does take puberty for granted although many teenagers complain when puberty first starts , they should bear in mind Lawrence .
Thankfully , there is treatment and Lawrence will now experience what every other teenager experiences .

Scientists searching for the origin of HIV , the global pandemic infecting more than 40 million people , believe they have finally tracked its original source to two colonies of chimpanzees in a corner of Cameroon .
The finding represents the culmination of a 10 - year hunt for the source of the pandemic and provides a crucial link between HIV , which causes Aids in humans , and the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) , a strikingly similar virus that infects monkeys and chimpanzees .
Researchers believe that south - east Cameroon is where the virus first jumped from chimpanzees to humans before HIV infection began spreading among people as far back as the 1930s .
At the time , HIV , which destroys the immune system leaving those infected vulnerable to myriad diseases , was difficult to diagnose .
Carried by people travelling along the rivers , it spread unnoticed to Kinshasa , where the first human epidemic began to grow .
Researchers at Nottingham University joined scientists in Montpellier and Alabama to search for signs of the virus in 10 chimpanzee populations throughout Cameroon , where SIV was known to be circulating .
Cameroon is home to two different subspecies of chimpanzee , separated by the natural border of the Sanaga river which slices the country into north and south .
North of the river , tests on chimpanzee faeces found no traces of SIV , but it was present in colonies immediately on the southern side .
As the search for the source of HIV moved further south , researchers located two colonies , living deep in the south - east corner of the country near the Ngoko river bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Tests on chimpanzee faeces here revealed an SIV strikingly similar to the HIV that causes Aids in humans .
In some communities they detected SIV specific antibodies and viral genetic information in as many as 35 % of chimps .
" For us , this is really the last piece of the puzzle , " said Paul Sharp , a professor of genetics at Nottingham University .
" This is where it probably all started .
We 've got these viruses in south - east Cameroon , which are so close to HIV , and it 's difficult to envisage there could be any which could be closer . "
The research appears in the journal Science today .
" There was a nagging doubt that chimps had picked it up from monkeys , because monkeys carry the virus and chimps sometimes eat them , " he added .
" We did n't know for sure if humans picked up the virus in parallel from the same type of monkey .
No one had really shown if there was a reservoir of this virus out there in the wild . "
Researchers have various theories on how the virus jumped to humans ; the most widely held view is that hunters became infected when they caught and butchered infected chimps .
SIV appears to cause no outward signs of illness , so hunters would not have known if they were catching infected animals .
" When people hunt chimpanzees they tend to butcher them on the spot and then there 's a lot of blood flying around , " said Prof Sharp .
" If the hunter has any open wounds then , that 's an opportunity to get infected .
" Chimps and humans are extremely similar genetically , but here we have a virus that is seemingly harmless in chimps , jumps into humans and suddenly causes Aids . "
Researchers believe the virus infected humans some time before the 1930s and was gradually spread by river travel .
All of the rivers in Cameroon run into the Sangha , which joins the Congo river running past Kinshasa .
Trade along the routes could have spread the virus , which slowly built up in the human population .
For SIV to cause a pandemic in humans , it must have first mutated into a form that could readily be picked up from infected chimpanzees .
Then it adapted until it was infectious enough to be passed from person to person .
The first clearly identified case of Aids reported in the United States was in 1981 , though it seems an African American teenager died of it in St Louis in 1969 .
Epidemiologists who have studied the growth of the pandemic suggest that by the 1960s about 2,000 people in Africa may have had HIV , which was as yet unnamed .
By 1980 , closer to 1 million people were infected , and the virus was named a year later .
OF the 40 million people living with HIV now , more than two - thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa , which is also home to 77 % of the women with HIV .
Last year , there were nearly 5 m new HIV infections , 4.2 m among adults and 700,000 in children under 15 .
In the same year , there were 3.1 m deaths from Aids , more than half a million of whom were children .
Identifying the source of the HIV pandemic is more than filling in a missing link in the disease 's progression .
Understanding how the virus infects chimpanzees , and why it does not appear to cause disease in such a similar genetic species , could unveil useful clues about how the virus works in humans and which crucial changes happened to the virus when it made the leap to humans .

Apparently , ATI is moving into the field of stream processing .
In this post , I will tell you a little about what stream processing is , what your graphics processor has to do with it and also what problems I see with it .
But let me start by having a little fun with their announcement :
ATI has invited reporters to a Sept. 29 event in San Francisco at which it will reveal “ a new class of processing known as Stream Computing . ”
Wow .
Looks like they invented a whole new paradigma .
Or maybe not ?
I guess some smart guys in Stanford have been into stream processing for almost ten years now .
And I bet they were n’t the first ones either .
Ok , so stream processing is not entirely new and I will stop giving their poor marketing people a hard time .
It is expected that ATI will reveal a product called Firestream , which enables stream processing on their graphics cards .
The concept behind that is called GPGPU , or General Purpose Graphics Processor Units .
And this is where it gets really exciting .
In fact , it gets so exciting that a colleague of mine did a seminar ( in German ) on the topic with some very motivated students last semester – and this is basically where I learned everything I am going to tell you next .
Therefore , please take everything I will tell you here with a grain of salt , as I am certainly NOT an expert in this field .
You probably know that your graphics adapter has a lot of power ( at least you may know that it eats a lot of power , but that ’s a different , although related , story : P ) .
Modern GPUs have a complexity ( measured in transistors ) that rivals , if not surpasses the complexity of your CPU .
And it gets even better : while your CPU has to be able to do a whole lot of things , the GPU specializes on a very narrow task : it takes a huge amount of triangles and some textures , applies some relatively small operations to the triangles ( in its so called vertex shaders ) , splits them up into pixels , applies some more operations ( this time in the pixel shaders ) and spits out a whole lot of pixels for your viewing pleasure .
I can almost hear you scream in pain if you know your way around graphics programming and have to listen to this very gross oversimplification of the graphics pipeline , but since I am not an expert in this field and I expect most of you are n’t either , I will leave it at that : D. Feel free to flame me in the comments - section .
No dependencies are involved when applying the shader - operations and therefore you have many of them that can work in parallel ( which is good , because that makes the operations described above really , really fast ) .
Now , how does stream computing fit into the picture ?
Let ’s say you have a huge amount of data and want to apply the same operation to each element .
Maybe in the game of life .
Or if you want to simulate a waterfall .
Your CPU is not really well suited for that task , because it can only process one element at a time .
Your graphics adapter on the other hand is a perfect fit : just feed these data into the graphics pipeline ( turning them into a stream of data , which is really just a one - dimensional array ) and program the shaders with the appropriate operations ( called kernels in this context ) and the GPU will happily crunch through the data , using all its data - parallel processing power .
And because that ’s what it can do best , it will do so fast .
Really fast .
We have seen speedups of 30 in a simple experiment with matrix multiplication done by one of our students , but of course your results may vary .
Unfortunately , the story has downsides as well .
If you think parallel programming is hard , then programming GPGPUs is hell :( .
At least that was my personal conclusion after listening to some of the experiences made by our students .
Although there are some higher level languages available ( e.g. Sh or Brook ) , you basically need to be a graphics expert anyways to program in them .
You will also trip over countless bugs , as well as limitations of your particular graphic adapter that you never had to think about before .
And it gets even worse :
Because all the fun is happening on the graphics adapter , there is no way to access main memory !
Therefore , all the additional data you may need have to be converted into textures somehow , which can then be read by your kernels .
Very strange , if you ask me .
Your data may also not have any dependencies inside the stream , because the data is worked on in parallel by the different shaders on the GPU .
And finally , expressing your algorithms in a streamy way is not an easy task , when you look at the limitations sketched above .
I will even go as far as to say that most known algorithms and data structures today are not usable at all for stream processing and new ways to express them have to be found upfront .
A very rewarding task for a research project , but not so good when you want to utilize it in a product and your boss is bugging you with a deadline .
A very pessimistic outlook so far .
But maybe ATI has something more than just hardware up at its sleeves .
Some kind of Stream Building Blocks would be nice ( kind of like what the Intel Thread Building Blocks are trying to do for threads ) .
Or a language that abstracts away at least some of the hardware specifics and raises the level of abstraction considerably .
And actually works .
And if it ’s not ATI , maybe somebody else manages to make GPGPU - programming at least achievable without loosing all your hair beforehand ; ) .
I want to close this post with a citation from a commercial for a large tire - manufacturer , which I find very fitting in this context :
Power is nothing without control .
I am hoping at least some people at ATI worry about control as much as about power .

In economics there is a norm that authors are listed alphabetically .
The norm is surprisingly strong and deviations are punished .
On my first paper with Eric Helland we tossed for first authorship , I won , and we noted the names were listed in random order .
Believe it or not , Helland ’s tenure committee grilled him on this point and as a result we switched to alphabetical ordering on all our subsequent papers .
Citation counts , however , are historically assigned only to the first listed author and later listed authors are often buried under the et al. monster .
Do you think these effects are too tiny to matter ?
Take a look at the Yellow Pages and see how many firms choose A - names , AA - names , and AAA - names .
Even more surprisingly , a new paper ( free , working version , Winter 06 , JEP ) demonstrates that these effects have important consequences for careers in economics .
Faculty members in top departments with surnames beginning with letters earlier in the alphabet are substantially more likely to be tenured , be fellows of the Econometrics Society , and even win Nobel prizes ( let ’s see , Arrow , Buchanan Coase… hmmm ) .
No such effects are found in psychology where the alphabetical norm is not followed .
I ’m delighted that my young co-author , Amanda Agan , has a great career ahead of her but if Helland wins the Nobel I am going to be very annoyed .
It ’s time to end the tyranny of the alphabet !
The AER should announce a name randomization policy unless authors otherwise instruct .
Barring that , I wish henceforth be known as Alex Abarrok .
How To Better Engage Your Readers
The best way to engage anyone is to ask them questions about themselves .
Most people have one favorite subject in common and that subject matter is " me...me...me...me...me...me " .
Is n't that your favorite subject ?
I was fortunate to have one of the companies I worked for early in my career force me to go to what I thought was one of the most lame sales training courses called " Dale Carnegie " .
After all , I was 20 something and I knew all I needed to know ... right ?
Wrong !
I think you find that out when you hit 30 something ... you know , not knowing as much as you thought you knew .
Though I was forced to go to this training class I thoroughly hated , I chose to make the best of it and take away as much information as possible .
After all , I was there .... they were there and I did n't have a choice .
So , when life hands you lemons , make lemonade .
One of the greatest gifts I took away from that sales training coarse was reading the book " How to win friends and influence people " By Dale Carnegie .
I highly recommend this book to any person who will take the short amount of time it takes to read it , it will change you and your relationships .
It will help you understand that people simply want someone to take interest in " their stories " , what is going on in " their lives " and that taking an interest in other people really is the number one way to build better relationships .
On that note , I would like to encourage you to add questions to your blog posts to better interact with your readers .
There are many simple questions you can ask as you close out your blog posts , here are a few ideas :
1 . How will this information help you ?
2 . How do you plan to use this information ?
3 . How else might I be of assistance to you with the information I have provided above ?
4 . What experiences have you had that may add to the discussion ?
5 . After reading what you read , what is your commitment to implementing in your own blog or website ?
I will close by having you think back to the last social gathering you were at and recall if most of your conversations were about you or the person / people you were conversing with .
Which of those conversations were most interesting to you ?
How often were you engaged in " interesting " conversation where you were learning about someone else , what they do , etc .
If you are the type of person who finds yourself learning about others during conversations , I bet those people think you are a GREAT conservationist !
I love the old saying " you have two ears and one mouth .... remember to use them accordingly " .
I really am interested in your thoughts and opinions and truly wish to know how you plan to use this in your next blog post , networking event or sales call .
Thank you for taking your time to visit and hope you find the information useful .

Blog Marketing - why blogging IS marketing
I recently came across a situation where one of my clients was told by his business consultant that his blog was for one purpose only .
To educate people and share good information .
My client was told that his blog should not be used for " marketing purposes " and I tend to disagree .
If your blog is n't to be used for " marketing " , then what is the purpose in having it ?
Now do n't get me wrong , educating people and offering jasminlive visitors valuable information is crucial to the success of your blog , but factoring self promotion and marketing is also important .
You have to find good balance in your blog to make sure you are educating your readers , after all that is what most people are looking for when they read blogs , they want information and providing valuable information will keep them coming back for more .
My recommendation to you when creating a blog post is to educate FIRST and market second .
If you approach your posts by marketing first , you will most likely loose the interest of your readers within a few moments .
The best way to use your blog as a marketing tool is to provide valuable information with hyperlinks directly to your product pages where people can take action with the product or service you are offering .
It serves three purposes :
1 . Blogs create fresh content which is what " Googlers " want and what Google wants to provide .
2. Leads potential clients to the place to take action .
3 . Create links throughout your site or from your blog to your site , which helps with your quest to work with Google .
How To Name Your Blog
For those who wish to get started on blogging , whether it be to make money or to keep in touch with family and friends , trying to figure out what to name your blog can be one of your biggest challenges .
I have an easy solution to what many find to be a big " road block " to moving forward .
If you want people to be able to find your blog via the Internet Search Engines like Google , the fastest and easiest road there is to find a domain name for your live jasmin blog that matches what people are searching for related to your subject matter .
If you have read earlier posts on how to get found on Google , you understand that the Google algorithms are programmed to help people searching on Google to find the most relevant results .
Typically , the most relevant results to any search would be a domain name that matches the search term ... right ?
You may be asking yourself how exactly you figure what people are searching for ... and again ... pretty easy to figure out ... IF you know where to look .
Google has a " keyword tool " I like to use to help me figure out what to name my websites and blogs , which I STRONGLY encourage you to utilize before you name your blog or register your domain name .
The best way to use this tool is to type in different search terms that match the desired subject of your blog .
You will see a list of results with numbers that indicate the search volume for each term .
Your best bet is to find a term that has the highest number of search volume and try to buy a domain name to match it .
To give you a good example , I will use one of my most recent clients , " Moore 's Martial Arts " in Livermore , CA .
Moore 's does n't currently have a website or domain name for the school located in Livermore , so we are starting from scratch .
The steps I went through to find the " perfect " domain name are as follows :
I search using the keyword tool for terms that included Livermore martial arts .
Martial arts being the most generic term I could think of to describe what they do .
Upon doing my research , I found that there are close to 600 searches each month for the term " Livermore Martial Arts " .
When you consider the amount of search volume for that particular keyword , it would make great sense to see if I can obtain the domain name " Livermore Martial Arts " , which is exactly what we did .
IMPORTANT NOTE :
It is important for me to note that just because I have identified a great domain name that matches the search term , it in no way guarantees this website will make it to the front page of the search engines .
What helps get you to the front page of the search engines is good content that is relative to the term you wish to be found for .
It is also VERY important to submit your site to the search engines by submitting your site map .
No site map ... no search results .
Should you build your own blog or hire someone
The question of the day ... Should I try to build my own blog site or should I hire a professional ?
Let 's go over the advantages and disadvantages of both ...
Do It Yourself :
If you create your own blog , it will take time away from whatever it is keeps you busy now .
Building your own blog without the help of a professional designer and the assistance of what to include / not include could keep your blog from reaching its full potential .
If you consider yourself to be pretty " techy " and like this sort of thing , I encourage you to dig in and get your fingers " dirty " , if indeed you will actually follow through , the key here being ... will you actually follow through and get it done ?
By creating your own blog , you are in control and do n't have to depend on someone else to make changes and updates that are often needed on any live sex chat website .
You created it , so you know how to change it , update it or fix it if need be !
If you do n't happen to have an eye for what looks good and create your own blog , you may get visitors to your blog that " bounce " the second they arrive because your blog is n't inviting or looks cluttered .
If you do decide to create your own blog , we do encourage you to create a custom look and feel to your web blog and the easiest program to do that is Artisteer .
It requires NO PRIOR web design knowledge or experience and could not be more user friendly .
It is a great program and they do offer a free demo .
Visit this link for a full video tutorial on how to use the program .
The tutorial shows you how to build a simple , but completely custom blog theme in 5 minutes !
Yes , the video is 5 minutes with no outtakes or secret shortcuts .
The whole blog template is built in 5 minutes .
Hire A Professional :
Hiring a professional to set up your blog in most cases is a one - time fee because once a blog is set up it is done .
I have many clients who hire me to do exactly this because they either do n't have the time or just choose not to do it themselves .
It is not that time consuming for someone like myself that has done it many times and very cost effective if you have the funds available .
Feel Free To Contact Me For a Quote .
A professional will most likely set up your blog to match your company website or be able to integrate your company logo by using design software that you may not be familiar with .
As mentioned above , check out Artisteer and the tutorials to see if this is something you simply wish to take on yourself .
It really is easy with a little video training !
Hiring a professional will require a small investment , but typically when you have some " skin in the game " you are more likely to follow through with the actual blogging .
Your blog will need to have some structure to it and a professional will obviously have more insight in to creating that structure .
NOTE : If you do choose to hire a professional to create your blog site , make sure that your agreement includes training on how to log in , create blogs , and manage the site .
There is n't a lot to managing a blog other than adding " blogs " ( content and articles ) regularly , but you will need some guidance to get you started .
If your designer does n't include training , you are strongly encouraged to " pass " and find one that does .
As you can see there are benefits to both .
You may possible wish to try designing and creating your own blog if you feel you have the time to do so .
If you find you are n't succeeding at it , then hire a professional .
What have you got to lose !
It is also important to subscribe to this blog because I offer ongoing tips on how to add " widgets " and plug ins on how to make money with your blog and stay consistent with it !
Secrets To Being Found on Google
There are lots of techniques and a bit of a science to getting your website found on Google .
I am going to do my best to explain some of the most simple and basic things to increase rankings .
If the information I have given you here does n't do the trick , it is best to hire a professional .
Hiring an SEO Company that knows what to do and NOT do will help you .
You must follow Google 's rules if you want to play in their " sand box " .
Getting your website to page one of Google is like hitting PAYDIRT , IF the search term you rank for is a term people other than yourself are searching for .
I have heard more times than I can tell you , " my website comes up on page 1 ! "
Yes it comes up on page one , but only when you type in some " long tail search term like " online printing companies located in Dublin , CA " .
I am willing to bet that my printing company PrinterBees would come up somewhere on page one for this term without any effort .
Just a hunch as it would be the most " relevant result " for that search .
" Long tail search terms " like stated wo n't help your cause , and you do n't want to focus on a search term you will never stand a chance of ranking for like " printing " or " mortgage " , which is very generic and highly competitive .
For my printing business , it would be crazy for us to think we could get the term " business cards " as a newer online business .
Because we print business cards for companies like Keller Williams , Century 21 , ACN , Herbalife , Mona.vie and specialize in real estate printing or real estate marketing these would be good terms to focus on and not as competitive .
While they do n't have the traffic and the search volume that a term like " business cards " would have , it will help us gain popularity when we rank and improve our Google Ranking which will in turn help us rank for more popular terms moving forward .
Because I really do want you to see that what I am explaining here really does work , I encourage you to " Google " the terms I have listed above so you can see that we really do rank on page one of those particular search terms .
At the time of writing this article , we are working on other terms to improve our rankings .
Those terms are " bookmark printing " , " print bookmarks " , " online printing ' , " business card printing " , " door hanger printing " , color flyer printing " , " hang tag printing " , " save the date magnets " and a few others that I can't think of at the moment .
Feel free anytime to check our progress , I feel the best way to teach is to lead by example .
A few words about Google and why Google matters so much to your success on the Internet .
Think of Google as a librarian , a really busy librarian !
This particular librarian sends you business .... lots of business and you are n't even required to pay a fee for all the business the librarian sends you !
It is all FREE !!!!
( Yes , you can do pay per click , but why when you get traffic for FREE )
We all use Google because we can pretty much always find what we are looking for when we " google " something , right ?
Would you keep using Google if every time you went to search for something , you did n't find what you were looking for ?
Not a chance !
So , if Google wants us to keep coming back , and they do ... they have to consistently give us good and relative results or we will find a new " internet librarian " to help us .
The only way that Google can continue to give " googlers " accurate search results is if we , as website owners / webmasters do a good job of communicating to Google exactly what our websites are about and help Google to understand what categories our websites should be filed under .
If Google is n't clear where your website should be indexed , it is most likely just sitting out there in cyberspace not accomplishing anything for you other than being printed on your business cards , fliers , banners , postcards or other printed materials you use to market your business .
Your marketing efforts in this day and age should include some sort of Internet marketing plan and if it does n't , you will be eventually left behind , sorry to say that , but it is true .
The Internet has well over 2 BILLION searches done on it every month and if you think your services or business offerings are n't being searched , you are definitely still living in the early 1990's .
This video produced by Google in late 2008 helps to explain how to " speak Google " , get ranked on Google and more importantly how NOT to spam the search engines and lower your rankings .
Google wants you to succeed and they will give you very specific instructions if you just listen to what they have to say and more importantly FOLLOW THE RULES .
Lesson one :
GET A BLOG !!!
I know I sound like a broken record , but I would n't keep mentioning it if it were n't so important .
Lesson Two :
Blog !
Your blog will do you absolutely no good , if you do n't actually blog on it .
If you do n't feel it is something you can keep up with , hire someone to blog for you .
Blogging is really what will help your rankings and is the fastest and easiest way to accomplish " getting found on Google " .
One of the things that Google " spiders ' ' look for as they crawl the Internet is new / fresh content .
Blogging = new and fresh that is also the most current .
Lesson Three :
When you blog , make sure that you use the keywords you wish to rank for in your blog AND that they link either to a page on your blog / website or to another blog post to create internal links in your website .
This is also called " deep linking "
Getting Indexed on Google Lesson Four :
Use the social media networks like YouTube , FaceBook and Twitter to name a few .
You also will want to create your own YouTube channel and make sure to name your videos according to the key words you want to be found on .
I encourage you do to " podcasts " and post them on YouTube to create links to your site .
A great product for doing video pod casting is the " flip " hi definition digital video recorder .
It is about the size of a deck of cards , does great videos and comes with software that allows you to upload straight to YouTube .
What could be easier .
Using the social media networks creates links to your site .
An example of some of the social networks which should be on your radar are listed below this article .
Clicking on them will also allow you to bookmark this article which will help other people find it .
Getting Indexed on Google Lesson Five :
Mixed media -
What the heck is " mixed media " ?
Mixed media is the use of text , images , video and sound and your blog .
Your blog is the perfect place for mixed media type content .
One of the most important things to remember with your images or anything media related is to NAME THEM PROPERLY .
This is so important , so I will say it again ... NAME YOUR MEDIA FILES PROPERLY .
You are probably asking ... how do I name them properly ?
First let 's examine what NOT to do .
If the images in your website have names like " banner1.jpg " how does this help Google know what your website is about ?
Files not named properly tell Google a whole lot of nothing !
What if you named your images like we do on Printerbees .
On our " business card printing page " , the images have names like " business -card-printing.jpg " or " color- business - card- printing.jpg " .
When Google comes across these images , what do the file names tell Google about our website ?
It helps Google to know we are in the business card printing business .
One of the simple things often forgotten and overlooked is the use of " alternative text " also knows as " alt tags " , these tags that are always an option when you add in an image to your website or blog .
The " alt text " tags help people who are reading websites without downloading graphic images like on cell phones or donâ€˜t automatically download images know what the images are .
Using alt tags also gives
Google one more clue of where to index your site !
Every clue you give Google helps your cause .
Lesson Six :
Naming your pages :
How you choose to name your HTML web page files and blog posts is very important .
Every clue you can offer Google helps " your cause " .
For your Word Press blog , make sure take advantage of your ability to use the " permalink " editing option , right below where you title your article to make sure it matches your content OR gives Google the proper hints about what you website or blog is .
For your HTML pages , use all lower case letters to name your pages AND used a " - " between any words .
I have had make many repairs to the names of my own files from making this mistake many times .
Remember , always in lower case AND no spaces in your files name , always dashes .
Same goes for naming your images or anything else which will find its way to the Internet on your website .
Lesson seven :
Proper tagging :
When creating your website or blog , it is important to have proper " title tags " , ." meta description tags " , " meta key word tags " , and " Robot .
Tags " .
I know it sounds overwhelming , but with blogging it is super easy and very helpful if you wish to rank .
Again , it gives
Google the clues it needs to know where to " index " you .
This is what they all mean :
" Title Tags " -
The title of the page within the site or blog .
Make your title tags relative using the information above .
It is also what shows up as the title of your page or site on the search engine listing .
While putting your company name may seem important , you may consider leaving it out if it wo n't encourage someone to " click " .
" meta description tag " - This is a SHORT , did I mention " short " description of what the web page is about and should include your keywords .
If you make your description too long , it could end up counting against you ( I will explain this part in future lesions ) , so use your words wisely and this can end up being the description that shows under the page title in the Google search results so it should also be a good " heading " that captures the persons attention who is reading it when they find your site in the Google Index .
Also , make sure it includes your most important keywords .
" meta key words tags " - this is a list of words that best describe the subject of your website to the search engine .
The list should not be too long .
Did you hear me ???
The list should NOT include too many words .
Keep your code clean and precise , it works in your favor .
" Robot tags " - Your robot tags tell the search engine if the search engine spiders should crawl the page or NOT crawl a particular page .
You are probably asking yourself why you would have Google NOT crawl one of your pages .
Well , the answer is simple , the fast Google can crawl your site , the relevant pages of your site , the better .
There is no reason to have Google " follow " your companies " Contact Us " page for instance .
That particular page most likely has nothing on it that will improve your chance with Google , so why have the spiders crawl that page .
You want them in and out as past as possible .
To have the spiders crawl the page , use the word " follow " , to keep the spiders from crawling a page , use the tag " no follow " .
You will see this option in Word Press , for HTML pages , you need to manually add them in .
When it comes to getting found on Google , on of the most important step is submitting a site map to Google .
In order for Google to know your blog is up and ready for business , you must invite the spiders to " crawl on by " by submitting a site map .
Your site map tells
Google what pages are on your site and gives the spiders a " map " of where to crawl .
A site map also helps the spiders crawl your site fast , fast is important !
I personally use Google XML Sitemap .
I found it easy to install and set up , and I like it because it is automated .
This handy little " widget " keeps Google updated on new posts , pages , etc .
This site was being indexed on Google in just a week after submitting my site map via the plugin Google XML .
Though your site may not be " ranking " , you can find out if Google even knows your site / blog exists by typing your blog URL blog address in the Google search bar .
The Contact Form 7 plugin is also a great tool I have implemented on my own site so I can easily be contacted or asked questions on blogging , search engines , Google , etc .
I found it very easy to add in to the site .
Adding a plugin for people to bookmark your articles on sites like " Delicious " , share them via email or " digg " them on the " Digg " social network is very important .
Adding this sort of plugin to your blog site will help spread the word .
It is really important to getting found on Google because it creates links in to your site .
These are just a few on this great list of 20 I have tried myself and encourage you to check out the list .
It is a great list and any of these plugin's can be installed right from the " Add New " menu item under the Appearance section of your side menu .
Time Saving Tips for Blogging and Affiliate Marketing
RoboForm - I use Roboform all day , every day and it saves me so0 much time and frustration !
With RoboForm , I am able to keep track of all my passwords , website links , affiliate sites I belong to and so much more .
I keep all of my information on a flash drive that is with me at all times .
I also keep a back up of it in my Drop Box in the event I loose my drive and then I always have access to my website addresses , log ins and passwords from anywhere in the world .
Drop Box -
Can
I tell you how many times I have been saved by my faithful dropbox , which costs me all of about $ 9 / mo ?
Dropbox keeps a copy of files on your hard drive out on the Internet and available from anywhere in the world !
At a seminar yesterday , we needed a Power Point Presentation that was n't with us badly .
No Problem !
Pulled up Drop Box , opened the file and was editing it within about 1 minute .
If my hard drive were to crash , while it would SUCK big time ... I would n't have the stress of having lost all of my data , because there is an exact copy of it out on the Internet in my Drop Box account .
I also love that it is fully automated !
A spreadsheet - if you do n't have Roboform -
If you get tired of logging in to my affiliate sites to get the same link codes over and over , keep them in a spreadsheet , and make sure to save it in your Drop Box .
I personally use the " safe notes " feature in Roboform , because my Roboform is always up and then I do n't have to keep opening files .
When I get a new link code that I know I will want to use again , I copy and paste it in to my Roboform .
All the links are all in one place and I just copy and paste from there .
My recommendation would be to use Microsoft Works , because every windows machine comes with it and you can open it anywhere , even when using a computer that does n't have MS Office .

The Sims Online should have been a sure thing .
The premise reads like a gaming executive 's dream sheet .
A popular , long - lived franchise loved by casual and hardcore gamers alike ; a game that sells at Wal - Mart as well as it does at EB Games and developed by Will Wright , one of the most famous names in game design .
The launch window picked was close to perfect : December 17 , 2002 , just in time for Christmas , virtually assuring millions of sales .
In - house predictions called for an ongoing active subscriber base of up to 1 million people , but The Sims Online launched out of the gate and promptly fell flat .
Six months after launch , Wired reported 125,000 retail copies sold and 97,000 active subscribers - not bad , but not enough to justify the game 's $ 20 million budget .
By April , 2004 , their subscription rate peaked at around 55,000 , and has now stagnated near 35,000 .
The " sure thing " is now an " also - ran , " an embarrassment to all concerned and an eyesore on the balance sheet of the world 's largest game company .
" The game we shipped did n't actually have the complete feature set that Will and I envisioned , " says Gordon Walton , Executive Producer of The Sims Online , who called the task of transplanting the wonder of The Sims to an online environment one of the " real challenges .
We just could n't get everything built in the time available , even with great resource support from EA . "
" Not enough time " is a common refrain among developers of failed games , but gamers and reviews alike have also laid blame for TSO 's stunning failure at the feet of its a boring , repetitive skill system .
One that even the hardest - core MMOG players considered tedious .
There were also significant problems with the target Sims audience .
" Will was really interested in the social and gaming possibilities bringing the Sims audience together would offer , " according to Walton .
Fans of The Sims , however , did n't seem to agree .
The series ' core audience , in hindsight , had little interest in playing an online game at all , but if they were to play an online Sims game , they 'd much rather play one that was more like the rest of the series .
Instead , players logging into The Sims Online found themselves in a strangely familiar , yet incredibly unsettling place .
It was like The Sims , yes , but here they were expected to create and micromanage one Sim , rather than a family of them .
Moreover , they were expected to raise her up in the classic MMOG model : Doing repetitive things for a meager amount of money to raise numbers that make doing the repetitive thing slightly easier which would then enable them to possibly get more money .
In TSO , however , once the player clicked on an object , all there was left to do was watch and chat .
" Not having a fully functioning economy and more fun activities to entertain players made the game less appealing than we wanted , " according to Walton .
Those brave few who tried TSO would seem to agree .

BBC News health reporter
Patrick had to plan his swim very carefully
Twice on the 21 mile swim , Patrick had almost called it quits - once after four and a half hours , the second time just kilometres from his destination .
The crew , like Patrick , were determined he would succeed , but knew it was a delicate balance between helping him achieve his goal and risking his health .
For Patrick , from Watford , Hertfordshire , was no ordinary swimmer and when he reached terra firma after 14 hours and 12 minutes in the water , he became only the second diabetic to complete the swim and the first to do so on the first attempt .
Fund-raising
His mammoth effort helped raise thousands of pounds for a local diabetic charity .
Consultant diabetic nurse Jo Butler , who monitored Patrick from the training stage and accompanied him on his swim this week , said his diabetes necessitated extra special monitoring .
It was worrying for me during the swim thinking about whether he would be alright
Jo Butler
" Like with other swimmers , we had to count the number of strokes he did each minute to make sure he was not becoming too tired .
But we also needed to check that he was not going into a hypo ( hypoglycaemic coma ) .
" A couple of times he said that he was becoming too tired to continue and we had to decide whether that was because his energy stores had gone down too low . "
Patrick normally has regular glucose monitoring tests , but Jo and he quickly realised that was going to prove impossible during the swim .
Monitoring
During his regular training sessions they carefully monitored his glucose levels and worked out how much glucose he would need and how often he would need to take - on other drinks and food .
" We did agree though , that if he was unwell in the water that we would have to find a way to test him and to see if it was his diabetes that was causing the problem .
" But that was not necessary thankfully as the water was so choppy on the swim we would not have been able to have done it , " Jo said .
" He was cold and shivering when he got back in the boat , but I did regular blood checks on the journey back and he was fine .
" It was worrying for me during the swim thinking about whether he would be alright . "
Patrick needed to be carefully monitored
Patrick was already training for the swim when he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes last October .
Type 1 diabetes - also known as insulin - dependent or immune - mediated diabetes - is a disease that destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce the hormone insulin .
Insulin is needed to control blood sugar levels .
He started exhibiting the classic signs of diabetes - an excessive thirst , constantly dry throat , weight loss , tiredness and frequent urination .
When his doctor confirmed that he had diabetes , Patrick decided to donated part of the charity cash raised by his swim to help build a specialist resource centre for diabetes at the local Ashford and St Peter 's NHS Hospital .
Would I do it again ?
It is too early to say , but probably not
Patrick Turner
During training , Patrick had to change his diet so it contained a very high proportion of carbohydrates to compensate for the increase in activity - swimming in the sea can burn up to 800 calories an hour .
During the swim , he took in frequent snacks designed to boost his energy levels .
Tired
" They gave me the energy drink and hot chocolate in a sports cup which they held out on a piece of rope from the boat .
I was not allowed to touch the boat .
" I also had things like tinned peaches , rice pudding and chocolate rolls from a cup , which I had to eat while treading water .
" I did get very tired and did think about getting out , but my crew persuaded me to stay in .
I would not have got across without them .
" I was so exhausted when I did finish that I fell asleep soon after getting into the boat . "
But despite the euphoria of finishing and of raising so much money for charity , Patrick is dubious that he will be attempting anything else as strenuous .
" I felt so bad when I got into the boat .
I was vomiting sea water .
I am fairly stiff , but I do feel satisfied and glad that all my training paid off .
" Would I do it again ?
It is too early to say , but probably not . "
Analysis
The SCO Group and Senator Hatch are n't the only strange things you 'll find in the beautiful state of Utah .
Take Overstock , whose CEO Patrick Byrne has held calls with financial analysts in which he delved into his sexuality and experiences with cocaine , in the midst of a tirade on how a cabal led by a " Sith Lord " was out to destroy his company .
These days things are looking pretty awful for the online retailer .
It faces mounting losses .
It has suffered through an IT collapse .
And as we 've discovered , it forces buyers to endure the most shocking customer service we 've ever encountered .
All the while baffling Wall Street with a riddle wrapped in an enigma of a CEO .
This tale begins with our own experience , but grows into a saga of widespread grief .
In August , we ordered seven MP3 players from Overstock as gifts for a party .
Relatively pricey gifts ?
Maybe .
But Overstock promised a great bargain , so why not ?
A few days later only two of the seven MP3 players arrived .
They came in a 4 - inch high box that had room for nothing else .
We called Overstock to find out where the other MP3 players were .
The customer service representative told us that she could not track the items because of an IT overhaul - see the disaster mentioned above - but she guessed that they were being shipped in from different warehouses .
Fair enough .
Well , the party came and went , and the other five MP3 players never arrived .
That 's when the real fun began .
Once Overstock 's IT system came back to life , we were informed that all seven of the MP3 players had been delivered because the box weighed seven pounds , and each MP3 player weighed one pound .
This was n't Overstock 's problem , the company explained - it was UPS 's problem .
UPS told us that it could not initiate an investigation into the matter because a ) the box was not tampered with , and b ) it only had one box for that delivery .
We 'll save you all the ins and outs that transpired over the next two months .
In summary , we placed about 12 calls to Overstock and were given a different excuse about the package each time .
Some representatives said it was " impossible " that the box did n't have the items , others said a trace was in progress , while others said this was a partner 's problem .
We were promised a refund three times and never received it .
Two customer service representatives said they would " take us under their wing and follow up on the matter personally , " only to never call or e-mail us again .
Candice H said , " We can prove that we sent all seven . "
That seemed pretty awesome given that only two products arrived .
Ann L noted that , " This has been a nightmare .
I can tell . "
She never called back .
Finally the head of customer service called and said , " Holy Cow !
This is unbelievable .
I can't make excuses . "
He told us that he rings customers personally " all the time " to fix problems , which seemed pretty doubtful given that we spent close to three months trying to track down a refund , and did n't hear from him until after we had e-mailed the CEO .
In between all of this , Overstock 's customer service line would periodically hang up on us for no reason , customer service representatives would insinuate we were lying about the devices and representatives would give out phone numbers that could not be reached from outside the company .
Great times , as you can imagine .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 1 - The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee summoned top Pentagon officials to a closed - door session on Capitol Hill on Friday to explain a reported secret military campaign in Iraq to plant paid propaganda in the Iraqi news media .
The White House also expressed deep concerns about the program .
Senior Pentagon officials said on Thursday that they had not yet received any explanation of the program from top generals in Iraq , including Gen. John P. Abizaid , Gen. George W. Casey Jr. and Lt. Gen. John R. Vines , the three most senior commanders for Iraqi operations .
After reports about the program circulated this week , General Casey initially protested that it should not be discussed publicly because it was classified .
One senior Pentagon official said , however , that General Casey was told that response was inadequate .
The official asked for anonymity to avoid possible reprisals for disclosing the general 's reaction .
By hiring more revenue officers , the I.R.S. could collect more than $ 9 billion each year and spend only $ 296 million  or about three cents on the dollar  to do so , Charles O. Rossotti , the computer systems entrepreneur who was commissioner from 1997 to 2002 , told Congress four years ago .
I.R.S. officials on Friday characterized those figures as correct , but said that the plan Mr. Rossotti had proposed had been forestalled by Congress , which declined to authorize it to hire more revenue officers .
Critics of the privatization plan point not only to the higher cost but also to what they say is a greater potential for abuse .
With private companies in the mix , they say , debtors could more easily be tricked into paying money to scam artists using spoof Web sites or other schemes , a problem the I.R.S. alerted taxpayers to in April .
Brady R. Bennett , collections director for the I.R.S. , said that by 2008 , about 350,000 past - due tax records will be distributed among about 10 private debt - collection agencies .
To guard against fraud , he said , the agencies will contact taxpayers only by telephone or mail  not the Internet  and will instruct them to send all payments directly to the United States Treasury , not the private collection agency .
One of the three companies selected by the I.R.S. is a law firm in Austin , Tex. , where a former partner , Juan Peña , admitted in 2002 that he paid bribes to win a collection contract from the city of San Antonio .
He went to jail for the crime .
Last month the same law firm , Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson , was again in the news .
One of its competitors , Municipal Services Bureau , also of Austin , sued Brownsville , Tex. , charging that the city improperly gave the Linebarger firm a collections contract that it suggested was influenced by campaign contributions to two city commissioners .
I remember seeing an email with pictures of bollywood actresses as ascii text .
As a completely unnecessary and useless excercise , I decided to try doing it on my own last night ( I tend to do such things after a boring day ) .
Surprisingly , I had a working program to create ascii text image from a jpeg within 15 minutes .
The algorithm , as our Maths prof would put it , is idiotically simple .
Some characters are " darker " than others .
For example , a hash ( # ) is darker than a dot (. ) – it has more black pixels .
So , all you need to do is replace each pixel ( or set of pixels ) with an ascii character depending on the luminosity of the pixel (s ) .
The characters I used are ' @ ' , ' p ' , '*' , 'a ' , ' 1 ' , ' : ' , '. ' and ' ' ( space ) in decreasing order of darkness .
This is a crude method but it gives pretty decent results .
Send me a message if you want the source code .
An example ( with due apologies to Ms Katrina Kaif )
Output 1 - 100 characters per line , viewing in MS Word – Courier New Font ( so that every character takes the same width ) , Font size 6
Output 2 – 200 characters per line ( Higher resolution 🙂 ) , Font size 4 ( Click to see full - size image )

Image President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday .
Credit ... Mike Segar / Reuters
Mr. Bush spoke on Tuesday about Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and how they might be curbed , and about his broader visions for the Middle East — visions that Mr. Chávez saw as insincere , ridiculous or both .
“ Wherever he looks , he sees extremists , ” said Mr. Chávez , who won office by defeating a businessman educated at Yale , Mr. Bush ’s alma mater .
“ He looks at your color , and he says , ‘ Oh , there ’s an extremist . ’
Evo Morales , the worthy president of Bolivia , looks like an extremist to him . ”
Indeed , Mr. Morales , another leftist , does raise potential problems for United States interests in Latin America , though perhaps not as thorny as those posed by Mr. Chávez .
Unlike Bolivia , Venezuela belongs to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and is a major energy supplier to the United States , and Mr. Chávez has courted Fidel Castro and the leaders of Iran and Syria , all factors that make him a man Washington must watch .
Mr. Chávez ’s remarks were translated from Spanish , and while subtleties can sometimes be lost in translation , his feelings about the United States seemed to come through clearly enough .
The United States , he said , is “ the gravest threat looking over our planet , placing at risk the very survival of the human species . ”
“ We appeal to the people of the United States to halt this threat , like a sword hanging over our heads , ” Mr. Chávez said .
It was not clear if Mr. Chávez was exhorting Americans to rise up in revolution , or if his gibe was an indirect reference to previous American - aided upheavals in Central and South America .

Torture Bill States Non-Allegiance To Bush Is Terrorism Legislation tolls the bell for the day America died , birth of the dictatorship
By Paul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones
Prison Planet
Sep. 30 , 2006
There 's nothing like a touch of real - world experience to inject some reason into the inflammatory national debate over gay marriages .
Take Massachusetts , where the state 's highest court held in late 2003 that under the State Constitution , same - sex couples have a right to marry .
The State Legislature moved to undo that decision last year by approving a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages and create civil unions as an alternative .
But this year , when precisely the same measure came up for a required second vote , it was defeated by a thumping margin of 157 to 39 .
The main reason for the flip - flop is that some 6,600 same - sex couples have married over the past year with nary a sign of adverse effects .
The sanctity of heterosexual marriages has not been destroyed .
Public morals have not gone into a tailspin .
Legislators who supported gay marriage in last year 's vote have been re-elected .
Gay couples , many of whom had been living together monogamously for years , have rejoiced at official recognition of their commitment .
As a Republican leader explained in justifying his vote switch : " Gay marriage has begun , and life has not changed for the citizens of the commonwealth , with the exception of those who can now marry who could not before . "
A Democrat attributed his change of heart to the beneficial effects he saw " when I looked in the eyes of the children living with these couples . "
Gay marriage , it turned out , is good for family values .
Some legislators who strongly oppose gay marriages also switched their votes this year for tactical reasons .
They realized that the original measure was headed for defeat , and they had never really liked the part that created civil unions anyway .
They are now pinning their hopes on an even harsher proposal , endorsed by Gov. Mitt Romney , that would ban gay marriages without allowing civil unions .
SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 5 — Days before its scheduled debut , the first major television miniseries about the Sept. 11 attacks was being criticized on Tuesday as biased and inaccurate by bloggers , terrorism experts and a member of the Sept. 11 commission , whose report makes up much of the film ’s source material .
The six - hour miniseries , “ The Path to 9/11 , ” is to be shown on ABC on Sunday and Monday .
The network has been advertising the program as a “ historic broadcast ” that uses the commission ’s report on the 2001 attacks as its “ primary foundation . ”
On Tuesday , several liberal blogs were questioning whether ABC ’s version was overly critical of the Clinton administration while letting the Bush administration off easy .
In particular , some critics — including Richard A. Clarke , the former counterterrorism czar — questioned a scene that depicts several American military officers on the ground in Afghanistan .
In it , the officers , working with leaders of the Northern Alliance , the Afghan rebel group , move in to capture Osama bin Laden , only to allow him to escape after the mission is canceled by Clinton officials in Washington .
Mayer was pictured ( top right ) in an official Turin 2006 team photo
Top Austrian official Heinz Jungwirth said the option of a ban was considered but rejected after raids uncovered doping equipment at Austrian bases .
But the Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed IOC official saying there had been " no vote and no decision " .
Ten Austrian athletes were drug tested following the raids , sparked by the presence of banned coach Walter Mayer .
The results of the tests are likely to be known before the end of the Games on Sunday .
Jungwirth said : " There was a vote in the IOC 's executive committee on whether we should be expelled .
Thank
God there are still people that would not cheer were Austria suddenly to be missing . "
But the IOC said it was baffled by Jungwirth 's comments .
" There certainly was no vote and no decision regarding a ban of the Austrian Olympic Committee , " the IOC official said .
There 's a storm brewing at the IOC - whether the doping tests are positive or negative does n't matter
Austria 's Olympic boss Heinz Jungwirth
The Austrians could still be sanctioned even if none of their athletes actually test positive .
" To find somebody guilty of doping you do n't necessarily need urine and blood samples , " said IOC president Jacques Rogge .
" It can also be based on circumstantial evidence . "
Italian prosecutor Ciro Santoriello said there was no doubt the IOC will be able to act .
" Part of the testimony we already have confirms that the IOC can take sanctions against the athletes , " Santoriello told French sports daily L'Equipe .
" But as the investigation is still ongoing we have not yet been able to hand over the evidence to the IOC . "
The IOC investigation will also look at Austria 's decision to ignore the ban imposed on biathlon coach Mayer .
Mayer , 48 , was banned from the 2006 and 2010 Games for doping offences at the 2002 event in Salt Lake City .
" We want to avoid that .
The damage of a ban would be impossible to make good again , " Jungwirth , Austria 's Olympic boss , told the news agency APA .
" There 's a storm brewing at the IOC .
Whether the doping tests are positive or negative does n't matter .
" There was equipment found that was clearly not allowed , including equipment for blood transfusions .
The affair around Mayer and some participants is difficult and bitter
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel
" It 's possible that if Austria is seen to be unwilling to investigate doping cases then they 'll punish the Austrian Olympic Committee . "
Chancellor Schuessel supported the Austrian investigation , stressing that there should be zero tolerance for doping .
" The affair around the coach Walter Mayer and some participants is difficult and bitter .
I think they have behaved really irresponsibly , " he said .
" It 's important that we are making our own contribution , an honest contribution that can be taken seriously , to clarify the facts , and that we are sending the clear message - he who dopes , gets the push . "
Earlier , Jungwirth revealed that coach Emil Hoch , who disappeared shortly after the raids , would be banned from future Olympics .
Austrian Ski Federation president Peter Shroecksnadel , who met an Italian prosecutor on Thursday , has admitted that the two athletes who left the Games after the raids , Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottman , had confessed they " may have used illegal methods " .
I wanted to kill myself because my world had fallen apart
Walter Mayer
The first police raid came on Saturday when police were tipped off by the World Anti-Doping Agency that Mayer was with the team .
The second raid took place on Monday night .
Mayer , who has been treated in a psychiatric hospital , has since admitted he tried to commit suicide by crashing his car into a police road block in southern Austria .
" I wanted to kill myself because my world had fallen apart , " he told an Austrian magazine .
" I was shattered .
I could n't think clearly . "
The incident occurred on Sunday after police woke Mayer while he was sleeping in his car in the Austrian village of Paternion .
He sped off and was pursued before crashing into two unoccupied police vehicles , damaging the cars and slightly injuring a policeman .
Mayer was in court in Klagenfurt on Tuesday to plead guilty to charges of civil disorder , assault and damage to property .
However , he says his visit to Turin was for personal reasons and had nothing to do with doping .
Austrian Olympic chiefs sacked Mayer after hearing about his arrest but they could not stop the scandal from spreading .

Personal Sob Story Introduction
My earliest encounter with the World Wide Web was during my freshman year at MIT .
I was working late one night at the Media Lab , a lowly research assistant trying to learn the ropes of a technology that nobody outside of the lab , let alone myself , knew anything about .
Suddenly an e-mail from one of the other late - night vigilantes ( it was 4 A.M. , but most of the workstations were occupied ) came across the lab network .
The message was about some new global document - sharing network .
By adding a few header tags to research papers , the message claimed , one could publish them in such a way that scientists in other labs all around the world could access them easily .
I had n't written anything worth reading yet , and I 'd already read enough cryptic research papers for one night , so I deleted the e-mail and starting searching the file server for cool games .
That was around April or May of 1993 .
About that same time , www.mit.edu went online as one of the first 100 web servers in the world .
Naturally , this was not MIT 's official homepage ( 2 ) , because at that point , nobody had homepages .
It was actually a server set up by a bunch of students that collectively called themselves SIPB ( the Student Information Processing Board ) .
Their pages provided a central starting place for exploring MIT 's web sites , providing helpful information for " surfers " who were still confused by the whole concept .
(3) Bow down and give thanks to Archie
The grandfather of all search engines was Archie , created in 1990 by Alan Emtage , a student at McGill University in Montreal .
The author originally wanted to call the program " archives , " but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short , cryptic names such as grep , cat , troff , sed , awk , perl , and so on .
For more information on where Archie is today , see : http://www.bunyip.com/products/archie/
At the early date of 1990 , there was no World Wide Web .
Around this time , Tim Burners - Lee probably had a bad dream in which a scary monster with " HTTP " etched into its hide slowly ate up all of the Earth 's resources .
Nonetheless , there was still an Internet , and many files were scattered all over the vast network .
The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) .
This was ( and still is ) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet .
It works like this :
Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer .
He sets up a program on his computer , called an FTP server .
When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer , he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client .
Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol .
Initially , anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others .
Later , " anonymous " FTP sites became repositories for files , allowing all users to post and retrieve them .
Even with archive sites , many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers .
Unfortunately , these files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth : Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file .
Archie changed all that .
It combined a script - based data gatherer , which fetched site listings of anonymous FTP files , with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query .
( 4 ) In other words , Archie 's gatherer scoured FTP sites across the Internet and indexed all of the files it found .
Its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database .
Veronica and Jughead - but where is Betty ?
Gopher is like FTP , but for documents instead of files .
Gopher servers contain plain - text documents ( no images , no hypertext ) that can be retrieved .
Archie 's popularity had grown such that in 1993 , the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica ( 5 ) ( the grandmother of search engines ) .
It was created as a type of searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files .
Another Gopher search service , called Jughead , appeared a little later , probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic - strip triumvirate .
Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy 's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display , although , like Veronica , it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym .
Jughead 's functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica's , although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges .
The lone Wanderer If Archie was the grandfather of search tools and Veronica the grandmother , their child , and thus the mother of all search engines , was Matthew Gray 's World Wide Web Wanderer .
The Wanderer was the first robot on the web and was designed to track the web 's growth .
Initially , the Wanderer it counted only Web servers , but shortly after its introduction , it started to capture URLs as it went along .
The database of captured URLs became the Wandex , the first web database .
Matthew Gray 's Wanderer created quite a controversy at the time , partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the Net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation .
This degradation occurred because the Wanderer would access the same page hundreds of time a day .
The Wanderer soon amended its ways , but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the Internet remained .
What 's a Robot got to do with the Internet ?
The term robot has special significance to programmers .
Their version of the term is mostly unrelated to the metallic lumbering creatures of Asimov lore .
A synonym for robot " automaton " is actually more enlightening .
Computer robots are programs that automatically perform a repetitive task at speeds that would be impossible for humans to match , just like the tasks today 's robots perform in factories .
On the Internet , the term robot or bot has become a bit broader .
For the most part , it refers to programs that explore the Internet for some sort of information .
Web robots search the Internet for web pages , usually for the purpose of compiling a large , searchable database .
This category of robot is often called a spider .
The spider robot falls right into the standard definition of performing a repetitive task .
Other types of robots on the Internet push the interpretation of the automated task definition .
The chatterbot variety is a perfect example .
These robots are designed to communicate with humans about some topic in a human - like manner .
Some of them are fairly convincing ; others are obviously quickly written computer programs .
Chatterbots are sometimes used as an intuitive way to communicate certain basic information to users .
An example is the milk robot , which can answer lots of questions about milk .
One could force this type of program into the definition above by saying that it performs the repetitive task of communicating with clueless people .
The ALIWEB Strikes Back !
In response to the Wanderer , Martijn Koster created Archie - Like Indexing of the Web , or ALIWEB , in October 1993 .
As the name implies , ALIWEB was the HTTP equivalent of Archie , and because of this , it is still unique in many ways .
ALIWEB does not have a web - searching robot .
Instead , webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed .
The advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site , and a robot does n't run about eating up Net bandwidth .
Unfortunately , the disadvantages of ALIWEB are more of a problem today .
The primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted .
Most users do not understand how to create such a file , and therefore they do n't submit their pages .
This leads to a relatively small database , which meant that users are less likely to search ALIWEB than one of the large bot - based sites .
This Catch - 22 has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the ALIWEB search , but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as Yahoo ! or Lycos. Invasion of the Spiders !
As the web grew , it became more and more difficult to sort through all of the new web pages added each day .
Matthew Gray ’s Wanderer inspired a number of programmers to follow up on the idea of web robots , or spiders , as they are now called .
These programs systematically scour the web for pages by exploring all of the links on a starter site , which is a page that contains many links to other pages .
The concept was that by definition , every page on the web must be linked to another page .
By searching through a large number of pages and following all of the links , a user will discover new pages that have their own collection of links .
The hope is that most of the web can be explored through the continuous repetition of this process .
This process caused a great deal of controversy because some poorly written spiders were creating huge loads on the network by repeatedly accessing the same series of pages .
Most network administrators thought they were a bad thing , so naturally programmers created even more of them .
By December 1993 , the web had a case of the creepy crawlies .
Three search engines powered by robots had made their debut : JumpStation , the World Wide Web Worm , and the Repository - Based Software Engineering ( RBSE ) spider .
JumpStation ’s web bot gathered information about the title and header from Web pages and used a very simple search and retrieval system for its web interface .
The system searched a database linearly , matching keywords as it went .
Needless to say , as the web grew larger , JumpStation became slower and slower , finally grinding to a halt .
The WWW Worm indexed only the titles and URLs of the pages it visited .
It used regular expressions to search the index .
Results from JumpStation and the Worm came out in the order that the search found them , meaning that the order of the results was completely irrelevant .
The RSBE spider was the first to improve on this process by implementing a ranking system based on relevance to the keyword string .
5 The Easily Excitable Spider
The popular public search engine , Excite , has roots that extend rather far back in the history of the web .
Initially , the project was called Architext ; it was started by six Stanford undergraduates in February 1993 .
Their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the Internet .
Their project was fully funded by mid-1993 .
Once funding was secured .
they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites .
At the time , the software was called Architext , but it now goes by the name of Excite for Web Servers .
Billions and billions of catagorized links ...
Unfortunately , these spiders all lacked the intelligence to understand what it was that they were indexing .
Therefore , if you did n’t specifically know what it was that you were looking for , it was unlikely that you ’d find it .
This deficiency prompted the creation of EINet Galaxy , now know as the Tradewave Galaxy , which is the oldest browsable / searchable web directory .
Because it is a directory , Galaxy links are organized into hierarchical categories .
For example , a top - level category might be called " Computers . "
Within the Computers category there might be subcategories for " IBM , " " Sun Microsystems , " " Digital Equipment Corporation , " and so on .
Within each of these subcategories would be further subcategories , although these would be more or less consistent across the various machine types .
As an example , all of the computer company categories might contain the subcategories of " Hardware " and " Software . "
This method of organization allows users to more effectively explore the contents of the database by narrowing the field of interest .
The Galaxy went online in January 1994 .
It contained Gopher and Telnet search features in addition to the web - searching features .
Interestingly enough , Gopher was vastly popular as a document - sharing tool when the web was born .
The Gopher search capability was probably the primary reason for the creation of the EINet Galaxy .
( There were n’t really very many web pages to search through in January 1994 ! )
The web page search capability was simply an additional feature .
Through the present , Tradewave ( www.tradewave.com) still clings to its directory - based roots ; it uses no bots or spiders to seek out new URLs .
Therefore , the Galaxy is a true directory in the sense that it lists only URLs that have been submitted to it , and all categorization and review of the submitted URLs is done by hand .
This results in higher - quality pages and more relevant searches , but far fewer pages to search through .
Yahoo ! and a Yippity tai - yai - yay !
At this stage in the game , people were creating pages of links to their favorite documents .
In April 1994 , two Stanford University Ph.D. candidates , David Filo and Jerry Yang , created some pages that became rather popular .
They called the collection of pages Yahoo !
Their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos .
As the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day , the team created ways to better organize the data .
In order to aid in data retrieval , Yahoo ! ( www.yahoo.com) became a searchable directory .
The search feature was a simple database search engine .
Because Yahoo !
entries were entered and categorized manually , Yahoo ! was not really classified as a search engine .
Instead , it was generally considered to be a searchable directory .
Yahoo ! has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process , blurring the distinction between engine and directory .
The Wanderer captured only URLs , which made it difficult to find things that were n’t explicitly described by their URL .
Because URLs are rather cryptic to begin with , this did n’t help the average user .
Searching Yahoo !
or the Galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites .
Brian 's WebCrawler : Some Spider !
As bots got better and better , one rose above the pack with it ’s unique ability to index the entire text of a web page .
Other bots were storing the title and the URL , and the first 100 or so words of a document , but it was WebCrawler that first allowed the user to search the full text of entire documents .
The history of WebCrawler is best told by those responsible : " In early 1994 , students and faculty in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering [ of the University of Washington ] gathered in an informal seminar to discuss the early popularity of the Internet and the World - Wide Web .
Students typically try out their ideas in small projects in these seminars , and several interesting projects were started .
The WebCrawler was Brian Pinkerton 's project , and began as a small single - user application to find information on the Web .
Fellow students persuaded Pinkerton to build the Web interface to the WebCrawler that became widely usable .
In that first release on April 20 , 1994 , the WebCrawler 's database contained documents from just over 6000 different servers on the Web .
The WebC rawler quickly became an Internet favorite , receiving an average of 15,000 queries per day in October , 1994 when Pinkerton delivered a paper describing the WebCrawler . "
Eventually , the demand for WebCrawler devastated the network resources at the University of Washington .
Although a number of companies invested in server equipment to ease the load on the WebCrawler servers , there was no solution to the bandwidth issue .
At one point , the service became entirely unusable during the daytime hours .
Finally , America Online ( AOL ) saved the day by purchasing the WebCrawler system and running it on its own network .
In 1997 , Excite bought out WebCrawler , and now AOL is using an Excite derivative as the engine behind its own NetFind .
The most important point about WebCrawler is that it was the first full - text search engine on the Internet .
Until its debut , a user could search through only URLs or descriptions .
The descriptions were sometimes created by the engines themselves or reviewers trying to rate the sites .
A final word about WebCrawler from the company itself : " Several competitors emerged within a year of WebCrawler ’s debut : Lycos , Infoseek , and OpenText .
They all improved on WebCrawler ’s basic functionality , though they did nothing revolutionary .
WebCrawler ’s early success made their entry into the market easier , and legitimized businesses that today constitute a small industry in Web resource discovery . " ( www.webcrawler.com)
Mellon - Mania : The Birth of Lycos Lycos was indeed the next big kid on the block , bursting out of the labs at Carnegie Mellon University during the July of 1994 .
The person responsible for unleashing this force onto the world is Michael Mauldin .
He is currently on leave from CMU , acting as Chief Scientist at Lycos , Inc .
In a paper describing design decisions made while programming Lycos , he gives a very nice history of the service .
" Work on the Lycos spider began in May 1994 , using John Leavitt 's LongLegs program as a starting point .
( Lycos was named for the wolf spider , Lycosidae lycosa , which catches its prey by pursuit , rather than in a web . )
In July 1994 , I added the Pursuit retrieval engine to allow user searching of the Lycos catalog ( although Pursuit was written from scratch for the Lycos project , it was based on experience gained from the ARPA Tipster Text Program in dealing with retrieval and text processing in very large text databases ( 9 ) ) .
On July 20 , 1994 , Lycos went public with a catalog of 54,000 documents .
In addition to providing ranked relevance retrieval , Lycos provided prefix matching and word proximity bonuses .
But Lycos ' main difference was the sheer size of its catalog : by August 1994 , Lycos had identified 394,000 documents ; by January 1995 , the catalog had reached 1.5 million documents ; and by November 1996 , Lycos had indexed over 60 million documents -- more than any other Web search engine .
In October 1994 , Lycos ranked first on Netscape 's list of search engines by finding the most hits on the word ‘ surf . ’" ( 6 ) Hide and Seek Representatives of Infoseek , another major search engine , say that they founded their corporation in January 1994 .
Although this may be true , the search engine itself was not accessible until much later that year .
Initially , Infoseek was just another search engine .
It borrowed conceptually from Yahoo ! and Lycos , not really innovating in any particular way .
Yet the history of Infoseek and its current critical acclaim show that being the first or most original is n’t always that important .
Infoseek ’s user - friendly interface and the numerous additional services ( such as UPS tracking , News , a directory , and the like ) have garnered kudos , but it was Infoseek ’s strategic deal with Netscape in December 1995 that brought it to the forefront of the search engine line .
Infoseek convinced Netscape ( with the help of quite a bit of cash ) to have its engine pop up as the default when people hit the Net Search button on the Netscape browser .
Prior to this , Yahoo ! was Netscape ’s default search service .
Return of the DEC Digital Equipment Corporation ’s ( DEC ) AltaVista was a latecomer to the scene ; it had its online debut in December 1995 .
Nonetheless , it had a number of innovative features that quickly catapulted it to the top .
The least of the features was its speed .
Run on a bunch of DEC Alphas , it had the horsepower to handle millions of hits per day without slowing down in the slightest .
The rest of its features , all available from introduction , changed the face of search engines forever .
AltaVista was the first to use natural language queries , meaning a user could type in a sentence like " What is the weather like in Tokyo ? " and not get a million pages containing the word " What . "
Additionally , it was the first to implement advanced searching techniques , such as the use of Boolean operators ( AND , OR , NOT , etc. ) .
Furthermore , a user could search newsgroup articles and retrieve them via the web as well as specifically search for text in image names , titles , Java applets , and ActiveX objects .
Additionally , AltaVista claims to be the first search engine to allow users to add to and delete their own URLs from the index , placing them online within 24 hours .
One of the most interesting new features AltaVista provided was the ability to search for all of the sites that link to a particular URL .
This was very useful for web designers who were trying to get some popularity for their pages ; they could frequently check to see how many other pages were referencing them .
On the user interface end , AltaVista made a number of innovations .
It put " tips " below the search field to help the user better formulate a search .
These tips constantly change , so that after using the search for a few times , users see a number of interesting features that they possibly did not know about .
This system became widely adopted by the other search engines .
In 1997 , AltaVista created LiveTopics , a graphical representation system to help users sort through the thousands of results that a typical AltaVista search generates .
LiveTopics is interesting as a search tool , but conceptually it is more confusing than the standard search format .
Although its innovative qualities are uncontested , its effectiveness remains to be seen ( altavista.software.digital.com/search/showcase/two/index.htm ) .
A Spider Named " Slurp ! " : The Powerful HotBot On the May 20 , 1996 , Inktomi Corporation was formed , and HotBot was unleashed upon the world .
This is the youngest of all of the major search services , but even at its young age , it has already caused quite a stir in the online community .
According to the company : " Pronounced ‘ ink - to - me ’ , the company name is derived from a mythological spider of the Plains Indians known for bringing culture to the people .
Inktomi was founded in January 1996 by Eric Brewer , an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley , and Paul Gauthier , a graduate student in the computer science Ph.D. program , with a desire to commercialize the highly - effective technologies developed during their research .
( www.inktomi.com/press/icf-pr.html) "
The Inktomi search engine was quickly licensed to Wired magazine ’s web site , HotWired .
This site ’s popularity accounted for much of the initial fervor over HotBot .
Wired ’s reputation as the oracle of the Net made promoting the site fairly straightforward .
So what ’s the big deal ?
Just another search engine ?
Well , yes and no .
HotBot is probably the most powerful of the search engines , with a spider that can supposedly index 10 million pages per day .
According to the Wired web site , HotBot should soon be able to reindex its entire database on a daily basis .
This will ensure that the pages returned from a search are not out of date , which is now common with other search engines .
Additionally , HotBot makes extensive use of cookie technology to store personal search preference information .
A cookie is a small file that a site can store on your computer .
This file can be read only by the site that generates it .
It can hold a small amount of text or binary information .
This information is often used by sites to store customization information or to store user demographic data .
HotBot recently won the PC Computing Search Engine Challenge , a contest between the major search engines .
Representatives from each company were asked questions that could be answered only by a web search .
The engine that most effectively led the representative to the right answer won the question .
Although this challenge proved very little more than the searching abilities of the various representatives , it still garnered quite a bit of critical acclaim for HotBot , further increasing its popularity .
Information Overload : METAbolic Shutdown
What the PC Computing Challenge did show was that different engines pull up completely different sets of materials for similar searches .
This makes it extremely frustrating to find what you want on the web , because a query that has little effect using one engine may turn up a gold mine of information on another .
Additionally , the little differences between the engines , especially regarding the support of Boolean operators , has a large impact on the type of query format that works most effectively .
The current solution to this problem is the META engine .
META engines forward search queries to all of the major web engines at once .
The first of these engines was MetaCrawler .
MetaCrawler searches Lycos , AltaVista , Yahoo ! , Excite , WebCrawler , and Infoseek simultaneously .
MetaCrawler was developed in 1995 by Eric Selburg , a Masters student at the University of Washington ( the same place where WebCrawler was developed a few years earlier ) .
Like WebCrawler , MetaCrawler soon grew too large for its university britches and had to be moved to another site .
Here , Eric tells the story of how MetaCrawler became the go2net search engine : MetaCrawler was conceived in spring of 1995 by myself and my advisor , Oren Etzioni , as my master 's degree project .
It grew rapidly in popularity once we released it publicly , gaining many new users after Forbes mentioned us in a cover - page article .
Use jumped after C|Net reviewed all the major search services , ranking us No. 1 , with AltaVista No. 2 and Yahoo No. 3 ... In May of 1996 , I ( along with most of the rest of the AI department at UW ) created NETbot .
... When I left NETbot to return to research at UW … MetaCrawler was now under 7 ´ 24 monitoring service , the code was as reliable as ever , and we had made several performance improvements .
...
There was a realization that Netbot was ill - equipped to handle negotiations with the search services for continued MetaCrawler use .
Thus , the decision was made to license MetaCrawler to go2net , who could provide the resources necessary to make MetaCrawler viable as well as negotiate with the search services toward mutually beneficial arrangements .
( www.metacrawler.com/selberg-history.html)
MetaCrawler functions by reformatting the search engine output from the various engines that it indexes it onto one concise page .
Throughout MetaCrawler ’s history , the search engine companies that it worked with did not entirely approve of this procedure .
The most common complaint was that the advertising banners that the search engines had on their sites were not appearing when a user employed MetaCrawler .
This meant that their ads were not reaching the intended audience , reducing their ad revenues .
The move to go2net heralded MetaCrawler ’s concession to these concerns .
Now MetaCrawler displays the ads from each search site right above the results .
MetaCrawler users were not thrilled by this change because it increased the time it took for the result page to download .
However , skillful design of the result pages now causes the text to load first , calming the restless native users .
Are You Savvy Enough to Search with Me? Colorado State University also has a tool called Savvy Search that searches up to 20 engines at once , including a number of topic - specific directories such as Four11 ( e- mail addresses ) , FTPSearch95 ( files on the Net ) , and DejaNews ( UseNet database ) .
It ’s faster but less reliable than MetaCrawler .
SavvySearch ’s solution to the problem of differing types of search engine query formats is to ignore them all .
Users should not try and enter complex search strings into SavvySearch .
MetaCrawler at least tries to tackle this problem by creating its own search syntax ( using + to indicate AND , - to indicate AND NOT ) and by converting this syntax into the equivalent command for each engine .
However , neither MetaCrawler nor SavvySearch let you tap the full power of the advanced search syntaxes offered by most engines .
One Click , DoubleClick , Red Click , Blue Click
We ’ve already briefly touched upon the relationship between advertisers and search engines , but the area is now of such importance that it deserves its own section .
It was n’t long after the advent of search engines — especially when Yahoo !
made its much publicized move from the servers at Stanford to those at Netscape — before advertisers noticed that search engine sites were receiving numbers of hits in orders of magnitude greater than any other type of site on the web .
Receiving daily hits in the millions , search engines seemed like advertising gold mines .
This realization prompted the creation of many of the other current search engines .
" Intra " - ducing ...
Netscape , severely shaken and battered by Microsoft ’s free release of a competing web browser ( Internet Explorer ) , decided to concentrate on the new phenomenon of the intranet .
Corporations wanted to use web technology to facilitate document sharing within their own corporate networks .
These corporations also wanted to be able hide these documents from the rest of the web , yet provide their employees with the same search capabilities offered on the web .
Search engine companies now had a market for their product , which initially capitalized on the advertising industry for revenue .
Although there were a number of freely available search engines , corporations such as Digital Equipment and Infoseek capitalized on the lack of programmers who understood web administration and priced technical support and service into their commercial search engine packages .
Soon , another reason for having a " private " search engine became apparent .
Unlike most other media , a web page is constantly updated , and new pages are added to and removed from sites every day .
None of the major web - based search engines could search the entire web on a daily basis .
Therefore , the search databases would often contain out - of - date references or would miss entire sections of web sites .
The larger sites began indexing their own sites and providing search engines that would primarily search through their own materials .
Some allowed the user to search the rest of the web as well by linking the engine into one of the larger web databases such as AltaVista .
Many relatively small sites are now providing search engines for their own sites .
This is because search engines are becoming easier and easier to use and incorporate within a web site , and because the rapid growth of the web has led to an incredible amount of " junk " in the form of out - of - date pages , pages with misleading descriptions , pages deliberately designed to confuse search engines , and so on .
Additionally , it is often difficult to know what to search for , and many users have a hard time expressing what it is they wish to find in a language that search engines can effectively understand .
Using a site - specific search engine narrows the possibilities enough that a poorly formulated search may still return the intended result .
Summary
Now that we ’ve finished our search engine history lesson , you should be somewhat familiar with a number of the key players in the search engine area .
Additionally , you should be starting to get a feeling for some of the issues that search engines face .
The next chapter takes a closer look at some of the engines mentioned here as well as a few others .
You ’ll learn how users interact with each engine .
Ultimately , you ’ll understand the strengths and limitations of today ’s search techniques and what users have come to expect from a search engine .
This knowledge is extremely important when choosing a search engine for your own web site .
It will help you determine if a particular engine can handle the task you need it to accomplish .
You ’ll also be able to better understand how your users will interact with the engine you choose .

When you ask people for feedback on a design that has not yet been implemented , take care how much polish you put on the design 's representation .
A counter - intuitive principle of soliciting early design feedback is that people reviewing a highly polished design may concentrate on superficial details and overlook fundamental issues .
In the early stages of the process , you may be able to elicit deeper feedback by striving for an unfinished look in your design representations .
Even novice designers can employ production tools like Adobe Photoshop or Flash to quickly work up beautiful conceptual screen shots or prototypes .
They can lavish attention on the presentation of early design concepts , even those that might be thrown away .
However , when such a design is shown for review , reviewers may fixate on such details as the color on a button — and fail to question why the button , or indeed the entire screen , needs to exist at all .
One obvious force at work here is the visually engaging nature of beautiful imagery .
I believe another , subtler issue is that people unintentionally calibrate their criticism according to their impression of where you are in the development process .
A highly polished image may look like a screen shot of an implemented UI , or at least the result of many weeks ' work , leading someone to assume that only small details can be changed at this point .
Even if you repeatedly remind them that the design is just an early sketch , they may still demur from suggesting anything so bold as starting over .
People may also have difficulty criticizing a design if the representation seems far beyond what they could have created themselves .
As an antidote to this phenomenon , in my own design process I usually keep early designs looking rough , and try to refrain from jumping straight to a polished result .
I often draw early sketches by hand with paper and ink .
Why ink and not pencil ?
I do n't want to give myself too much opportunity to polish up even a hand - drawn sketch .
To avoid the tedium of recreating design elements like navigation bars , I sometimes draw a sketch of just the global design elements , then photocopy that to create a template for sketches of individual screens .
I take care to leave even the template sketch looking pretty rough .
Here 's a scan of an early sketch for Cozi Central 's Shopping Lists area :
No one has any trouble giving feedback at this stage , any may indeed call for something completely different .
Reviewers figure , " How hard could it have been to crank that out ?
I could have done that ! "
After I 've had a chance to iterate at this hand - drawn level , I may create a prototype in Microsoft PowerPoint to explore some interactive elements .
Again , I resist the temptation to apply visual polish .
It 's still too early .
I 'll eventually create a skeleton UI directly in a development environment 's visual designer , leading to a design like this :
At this stage , things are being to feel more solid and less mutable .
Design feedback may begin to focus on smaller details , but people still recognize substantial room for change .
Following further iteration , the design stabilizes enough to warrant a full treatment from visual design specialist :
The design is now polished to the point that many people may find it difficult to look past the surface .
Luckily , by now significant portions of the design are often functional enough that people can interact directly with the user interface .
This opportunity can counteract the tendency to notice only superficial issues .
People who have a chance to actually use a design will generally notice when it suddenly does something they did n't want .
A thoughtful user will step back and realize the problem lies with the software ( and not with them ) , and deliver this feedback to you .
In this particular interface , feedback that came late in the game on the surface appearance turned out to be quite important too .
People who looked at the above design said that it was " cool " , in both senses of the word : interesting , but also cold .
Since we were aiming the product at families for use at home , we iterated on the design to produce a warmer feeling .
The feature finally shipped like so :
If you 're intrigued by the idea of presenting rough sketches early in the development cycle , but appalled by the idea of manually drafting paper sketches , you might consider modifications to your own design process .
This past week I conducted design reviews of a PowerPoint prototype that used a free handwriting font ( at a suitably legible point size ) for the UI text .
The feedback collected during the reviews was at the right level for this stage of the process , and it was easy to refine the design between reviews , so I 'm likely to use this approach again in the future .

Whether you love Paul Graham ’s essays or you hate them , you have to admit they ’re thought - provoking .
The first part of this post ’s title comes from an evocative image in one of his recent essays , illustrating the idea that startups can make insanely great products by getting really , really smart people to think about problems that people actually care about solving :
That ’s the essence of a startup : having brilliant people do work that ’s beneath them … .
Think Einstein designing refrigerators .
Graham argues that one of the hardest things to do in starting up a company is coming up with something that people want .
Sadly , it is even harder in some ways than he lets on .
The trick is in that word “ want ” .
You see , for hackerly types , there ’s a natural ( to us , anyway ) assumption that “ want ” is connected to a rational evaluation of what is “ good ” , or would be good .
This then leads to the kind of interesting place where you can make a product that ’s really good for your customers , but which they do n’t necessarily want .
The first startup I worked at was one that made this mistake .
It was n’t a fatal mistake by any means ; our company survived under the same ownership for longer than any other company in our vertical market niche industry ; we watched numerous companies come and go that had more money , better marketing , and crappy products .
So , the fact that we had friendly , helpful service , and a product that actually benefitted people meant we got word - of - mouth that kept us alive for quite some time .
This only reinforced my belief that the way to ultimate success was creating a quality product that helps people do things well .
Too bad it ’s completely wrong .
Yes , quality helps .
But the real reason we outlasted our competition ( I think now in retrospect ) is that any sane competition got the hell out once they realized that management tools are n’t what real estate people wanted to buy .
Sure , they could be sold the products , easily enough , and if you were willing to spend time educating them about why it was a good idea , they might even use them .
But education is expensive .
It takes time .
It ca n’t be mass - produced – well , actually it can .
We eventually figured out that we could videotape our education / sales pitch , and were able to automate our sales pipeline to a certain extent eventually , where sales consisted mostly of calling people and hounding them to watch the videotape .
But it cost an enormous amount of roadwork and “ sales R&D ” to reduce it to such an automatable state in the first place – costs that would n’t have been there if we ’d just sold something that people already wanted in the first place .
And this is where the next part of this post ’s title comes in .
Halloween is the biggest part of the sales year for my wife ’s lingerie / adult store , and she sells a lot of costumes .
Earlier in the year , often even earlier than this , she goes through the costume catalogs to figure out what to buy .
Every year , the costume companies release lots of new and innovative costume ideas – that mostly do n’t sell .
What does sell ?
French maids , harem girls , policeman / woman outfits , fairytale characters , and recent movie characters .
( By the way , what I mean when I say that something “ sells ” , I mean that it outsells other products N:1 , not that other products never sell , or that only obvious or stereotypical producs are ever purchased .
To a retailer , when something “ sells ” , it simply means that people purchase it at some steady rate , as opposed to products that somebody will buy , but you ’re never sure when or how many .
Products that “ sell ” are essential to having a viable business . )
Anyway , the list of costumes that “ sell ” is actually longer than the one I gave above , but I do n’t remember all the others just now .
I do know that if I could name them , you would all nod your heads and say , “ Of course , ” because they ’re all “ classics ” in the sense that there ’s this cultural stereotype or archetype that the costume reflects .
I do n’t say this in order to try and delve into the psychology of wearing costumes or anything like that , though .
My point is much simpler : people buy what they already know they want ; they buy what is familiar ; they buy what they recognize , even if the only thing they have to recognize it from is a vague idea in their mind .
For example , my wife ’s store sells a number of “ romantic games ” , including one called “ Let ’s F*ck ” – and I did n’t add the asterisk , that ’s just what it says on the box .
This game sells quite well , as does one called “ Ultimate Sexual Fantasies ” .
There are lots of other games , and if you study their names for a while you can tell why some sell and some do n’t .
The ones that do , have names that are recognizable – when the customer reads it , it ’s something they recognize as “ what they want , “ even if they never actually heard of that game before .
Games with names like “ Let ’s F*ck ” , then , work surprisingly well .
In marketing this concept is sometimes called “ Overt Benefit ” .
It basically means that you tell the customer what it is that they ’re going to get , and you do it so overtly that to anybody else in your industry it sounds like you ’re bloody belaboring the obvious .
The more insanely obvious you can be , the better off you are .
If your game has a less overt title like “ Postman ’s Promise ” , then you ’re going to have to spend more effort communicating your sales message , unless that message is at least as overt as “ Let ’s F*ck ” .
To further illustrate this principle , let ’s look at Gilligan ’s Island .
More specifically , the new season of TBS ’ reality show based on Gilligan ’s Island .
They held a contest to decide which of the two “ Skipper ” candidates would get to stay on the island .
In this competition , two teams of “ castaways ” sat in boats , that then had holes opened in the bottom to create leaks .
They would then have to try to plug the leaks and bail the water out .
The Skipper whose boat remained above water longest , would be the winner .
( In order to prevent a stalemate , the team members were called on one by one to leave the boats , so that fewer people were left to cope with the ever increasing number of leaks . )
The two Skippers handled the situation very differently from each other .
One simply sat in the boat with his teammates until the contest began .
The other spoke softly – but urgently – to all his team members .
He told them he wanted them to plug as many holes as they could with their body parts , and to make sure that the coconuts were full of water when they threw the water overboard .
I imagine you can guess which team won , even though it makes no rational sense .
Obviously , if the goal is to keep the boat afloat , you should plug as many holes as you can , and bail a lot of water .
In fact , it ’s hard to imagine how he could possibly be any more more obvious !
( As opposed to simply being more detailed . )
But the mood of the two boats was completely different .
The team belonging to “ Captain Obvious ” was calm , cool , collected .
They co-ordinated with each other and kept their boat surprisingly free of water .
The other group flailed around ineffectually , almost randomly .
They were bailing harder and faster than the “ obvious ” group , yet their boat continued to sink .
Why ?
Because they were n’t blocking as many holes – perhaps because they had not been told to plug as many as they could !
Now , it ’s just an anecdote , but it illustrates a point about both leadership and marketing .
In both fields , there is no such thing as what people “ should know ” .
If you did n’t tell them , it does n’t count .
If your product is n’t as clear in its benefit description as “ Let ’s F*ck ” , or if your instructions to your people about what ’s important ( and what they should do about it ) are n’t as clear as those of “ Captain Obvious ” , then your boat still might not sink – but you will be bailing a lot more water than would otherwise be necessary .
It ’s easy , by the way , to think that this does n’t apply to you , that you have a much more rational approach to purchasing or anything else .
This is an illusion , because every person has areas of their life in which they are skilled or possess special knowledge , and in that area , their purchasing or other actions may approach rationality .
They then use this example to presume their behavior is rational in areas where they do n’t actually know much about the subject , or in circumstances where they need to fix a problem quickly , etc .
I ’m probably great at rationally evaluating a software purchase , but if I need car parts or something like that , the marketer is going to have to assume I ’ve got attention - deficit disorder , because I really am going to be focused on getting my car to work , not on what parts are “ better ” in some absolute sense .
And so , this kind of state actually constitutes the bulk of people ’s buying behavior , where they will choose whatever it appears will obviously get the job done .
The problem , then , is not so much that people are irrational , as that they are generally far too busy to pay attention to details .
If your idea or product requires careful attention to understand its benefits , you will lose out to Captain Obvious .
Similarly , managers often fail to tell their teams what they want with sufficient clarity , because they assume that what ’s obvious to them is obvious to their team , and that “ as professionals ” , they “ should just know ” .
But this is n’t the case at all !
A long time ago , I read that researchers have shown that programmers will optimize whatever you tell them ( implicitly or explicitly ) to optimize .
If you emphasize clean code , you ’ll get clean code .
If you emphasize features , you get features .
If you emphasize speed , you ’ll get that .
However , if you do n’t tell them anything , or you give them conflicting directives , God only knows what you ’ll get , but it wo n’t be pretty .
So remember : if you do n’t sound to yourself like you ’re belaboring the obvious , you ’re almost certainly not being obvious enough .
Have I made my point yet , or do I need to belabor it some more ? 🙂
I like cliches that are visual .
It 's why I am a fan of open the kimono , which according to an asian woman entrepreneur who was in my office last week is offensive .
I apologize for offending anyone who took offense and will be more careful with my use of that one in the future .
That said , I still like it .
Visual cliches are great because they pack some extra punch .
One cliche that I use a bit is The Strawman Proposal .
I do n't even know what the origin of the " strawman " term is but to me it means something that you can take apart without consequence .
The image for me is a strawman that you can kick around , pull apart , etc without harming anyone .
I know its kind of brutal , but that 's the visual that comes to mind .
A Strawman Proposal is very useful in all sorts of business exercises - budgeting , dealmaking , strategic planning , etc .
It is hard to have a really meaty conversation about something without having a reference point .
So A Strawman Proposal serves as that reference point .
It is not meant to be a " draft " of the final proposal .
It 's meant to be something that " can be kicked around , pulled apart , etc " .
So its more important that A Strawman Proposal address all the key issues in some way than anything else .
The cool thing ( and the reason the word gets used so much ) is that you can tell everyone upfront that the proposal is just A Strawman .
That tells everyone not to waste a lot of time and energy on the specifics of the proposal .
So poeple do n't start negotiating when The Strawman arrives ( in theory ) .
They should just start thinking .
It 's a great business trick and a great cliche .
The next time you are doing some important business in a large group , start with A Strawman Proposal .
And let me know how it goes .
Ukraine 's Orange Revolution was an excellent example of how a large and sufficiently dedicated group of people can , without the use of violence , force political change .
The Orange Revolution , like most revolutions associated with mass protests , had an identifiable cause : popular unrest at the notion that the incumbent party had contrived to steal the presidential election .
Being a revolutionary in a repressive state is tough work : leaders with the charisma , motivation , and following to become opponents of the ruling party inevitably attract the attention of the state as soon as , if not before , they become popular with the population at large .
It is tough to maintain cohesion within an opposition movement , or to trust collaborators to follow through when the time for action ( even peaceful action ) nears .
For these reasons , oppressive governments have persisted even as their ability to censor information effectively has vanished with the advent of the internet and anonymizing technologies like Tor ( which I am using to post this entry ! )
Another technology poses a much greater threat to tyrannical regimes , however .
Cell phone use has become ubiquitous in newly developed countries .
In China it has leapfrogged landline telephony as a means to connect the population without requiring the extensive investment associated with conventional telephone networks .
Some economists have argued that the spread of cell phone technology will be the single greatest factor in increasing the standard of living in developing countries .
Consider the following scenario , however : A committed group of tech - savvy Zimbabwean expatriates decides it can no longer watch as President Mugabe 's regime bulldozes slums .
The bulldozing program constitutes an atrocity , certainly - but there is no single act that can get the population out of their houses and onto the streets in the way the stolen election motivated the Orange Revolution Ukrainians .
So these tech - savvy expatriates elect to invent one .
Large crowds , they know , have a psychology all their own - ask anyone who has ever been involved in a soccer riot .
Even without a specific casus belli , they know that if they can get enough people out on the streets , the chanting and jeering will start and the closing bell will have tolled for the Mugabe regime .
As Paris Hilton discovered , cell phone networks are far from impregnable to electronic attack .
The Expats hack into the phone records of Zimbabwe 's cell phone companies , and download all the phone records from Harare , the capital .
This is where they get clever .
They crunch the data to establish social networks from the call logs .
If I call 555 - 5555 three times a day , an observer can assume that the number belongs to a friend or family member of mine .
I probably have him in my address book .
We 'll call him John .
When the analysis is complete , the Expats write a script to send one of a couple of dozen possible messages to each of the people I call frequently , all of them ostensibly sent from my number .
The text differs slightly ( and would be contrived so that no single person got the same message from two different people ) , but the essence is " come quick - there 's a rally to oppose mugabe " or simply " you 'll never believe this - come to XXX square , quick . "
With the messages staggered somewhat so that the rate seems natural , the following occurs : Seeing a plausible and interesting text message coming from my number , John decides to call me and find out what 's going on .
Because everyone in Harare has just had this same idea , the cell phone network is busy .
Perhaps our Expats have had an additional hand in this .
Aware that heavy call volume can cause cell networks to go down , John decides to see what 's going on , and starts to leave his house - indeed , he sees people marching toward the square even now .
Inevitably , some people will get a message from someone who is 1 . physically present next to them or 2 .
someone from whom such a suggestion could not plausibly have come ( say , a cautious mother ) .
Even in these cases , the people who are taken in , and who begin streaming toward the centers of power , will constitute a pretty strong indication that something is Really Going On .
The trick to all this is that , unlike a traditional flashpoint , this one will come without warning .
By the time the ruling party realizes it has an angry mob on its hands , the mob will number in the hundreds of thousands , and mobilizing troops or police to stop them will be impossible .
Unlike an organic revolution , this revolution will involve no inside conspiracy to be infiltrated by spies or to be nipped in the bud at the first sign of unrest .
It will happen so quickly that government - controlled media will be too late to broadcast warnings against it , and it will all be over by the time anyone - even the protestors themselves - understands what 's happening .
And I rather think it will happen bloodlessly .
What 's more , it all rests on a technology no modern government can deny its citizens .
Even Syria is seeing skyrocketing cell phone use among its population ; governments that do n't allow their citizens to go wireless risk lagging even further behind economically ( which is unacceptable , because governments must consider outside threats as much as inside ones . )
Of course , this scenario is not in the least limited to Zimbabwe - any country with an unpopular and undemocratic government , and a wired ( well , wireless ) and youthful population will be equally susceptible .
Nor do the hackers involved have to be expats .
Hacktivism has a short but storied history , and while socially motivated hackers have never pulled off a revolution , they have accomplished feats that require no more technical skill than this would involve .
The revolutionary heroes of the next wave of democratization may remain forever anonymous , having planned , organized , and executed a revolution in Harare or Tehran , from the comfort of their homes in Moscow , Madrid or Skokie -- or from their offices in the Pentagon .
After all -- the idea of starting a revolution by SMS is n't exactly a secret .
Hewlett - Packard will apparently need close to two months to start fulfilling backorders for the ( temporarily ) revived Touch Pad tablet .
" It will take 6 - 8 weeks to build enough HP TouchPads to meet our current commitments , during which time your order will then ship from this stock with free ground shipping , " read an email sent to customers and reprinted in a Sept. 7 posting on the Precentral . net blog .
" You will receive a shipping notification with a tracking number once your order has shipped . "
That would place the new TouchPads in consumers ' hands sometime in either late October or early November .
The reduced - price devices are not returnable , according to the email .
HP originally acquired webOS as part of its takeover of Palm in 2010 .
The manufacturer originally had big plans for loading the operating system onto a variety of devices , including tablets , smartphones , desktops and laptops .
However , sales of its TouchPad proved anemic , and HP made the decision to end the tablet 's life after a mere six weeks on the market .
In order to clear out inventory , the manufacturer sliced the starting price to $ 99 , which sparked a surge of consumer interest .
In the wake of that , HP made the decision to revive the line for a limited time .
In addition , HP plans on dividing its webOS arm into two separate units reporting to different areas of the company , according to two leaked memos that have made their way onto the Web .
The webOS software assets will find their way into the arms , however welcoming , of its Office of Strategy and Technology .
The other parts of the webOS corporate infrastructure , presumably including its hardware interests , will continue as part of the Personal Systems Group , which manufactures HP's PCs , and which will presumably be spun off into its own entity under the terms of the company 's new strategy .
" We have decided that we 'll be most effective in these efforts by having the teams in webOS software engineering , worldwide developer relations and webOS software product marketing join the Office of Strategy and Technology , " Todd Bradley , executive vice president of HP 's Personal Systems Group , wrote in an email circulated to the webOS developer team and also leaked onto Precentral .
net .
" The remainder of the webOS team , under Stephen DeWitt , will continue to report into PSG . "
According to at least one analyst , flooding the market with additional TouchPad devices could have significant benefits for HP going forward .
A " larger installed base of TouchPad and webOS devices should increase the value of webOS in a potential sale , " Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu wrote in a research note widely circulated on Barron 's and other financial Websites .
" We believe logical buyers may include Samsung Electronics , Research In Motion , HTC , Amazon.com , Facebook , Sony , Microsoft and others . "

“ Thou shalt not steal ” is a rule as old as human society itself .
It must have been , else no complex human society would have proved viable .
We are all taught very early to respect what belongs to others : “ Do n’t take your sister ’s toy away from her , ” your mother admonished , punishing you if you persisted in your toddler ’s larceny .
By the time you were three years old , you understood the difference between mine and thine .
If you did n’t take the lesson to heart and persisted beyond your childhood years in treating everybody ’s property as something for you to take , so long as you could get away with it , then you were viewed as a sociopath , an enemy of decency and of civilization itself .
Government as we know it , however , rests entirely on this kind of sociopathy .
Rulers take what does not belong to them and dispose of it to suit themselves .
When the government has only recently placed itself in a position of domination over a group of people , the people recognize full well that the government ’s taking amounts to looting .
They pony up only because they are given the stark choice of “ your money or your life , ” and they want to go on living .
When a government has been entrenched in a society for a long time , however , its exactions become a “ fact of life , ” a matter of “ just how things are , ” and people tend to lose their awareness that obtaining something from the government amounts to receiving stolen property because the government , having nothing legitimately its own , can give only what it has unjustly wrenched from others .
Rulers , abetted by their kept intellectuals , go to great lengths to weave a cloak of legitimacy to disguise their theft , because by doing so they ease the difficulties of extracting wealth from the rightful owners .
In some cases , especially in societies with governments that attempt to justify their existence and their actions on “ democratic ” grounds , many people may be taken in by this ideological sleight of hand .
They may actually believe that “ we tax ourselves ” so that the rulers “ we choose ” can dispose of the loot in ways that “ we voted for , ” failing to appreciate the gulf that separates this pristine ideological vision from the sordid facts on the ground .
Once this sort of thinking becomes pervasive , however , it serves to sanctify specific forms of predation without any clear limit .
People come to believe , or at least they work hard at convincing themselves , that anything the government might stand ready to give them , they thereby have a perfect right to receive .
At this point , all contact with genuine morality has been lost , and because a society of sociopaths cannot remain viable in the long haul , the nation that embarks on this course has set sail toward its own ruin .
I thought about this matter for the umpteenth time when I read an October 15 , 2006 , Washington Post story by Gilbert M. Gaul , Dan Morgan , and Sarah Cohen , “ Aid Is a Bumper Crop for Farmers . ”
The story concerns the widespread practice of farmers ’ receiving , first , subsidies to purchase crop insurance , then payments from that insurance when their crops fall short , and then , on top of that payoff , additional government payments denominated “ disaster aid . ”
Many farmers routinely collect large amounts of money from the public treasury by means of this double - dipping — altogether they ’ve extracted almost $ 24 billion from taxpayers to fund crop-insurance and disaster - aid programs since 2000 .
The reporters interviewed several farmers and others not only about the workings of these programs but also about their propriety .
Although none of the recipients quoted in the article exactly gloated about his serial commission of the offense , none chose simply to condemn it , either .
The prevailing attitude seems to be the one expressed by farmer Charles Fisher , of Tulare County , California : “ Whether it ’s right or wrong , if they are offering it , you ’re foolish to turn it down . ”
In that single sentence , Fisher has encapsulated the rotten core of the welfare state , and he has concisely expressed how such a state destroys the people ’s moral character .
The loot is there for the taking ; you ’re a fool not to take it , notwithstanding that your taking it may be wrong .
Financial gain trumps moral probity .
Do n’t be a chump ; take the money .
I do n’t know Charles Fisher , but if he is like a great many others who profit by despoiling their fellow man , with government acting as the facilitator of the crime , then I suspect that he is probably not the kind of man who would pocket his neighbor ’s wallet if he saw it fall to the ground unnoticed , and he is almost certainly not the kind of man who would wait beside the road to carry out an armed robbery of the first passer - by .
Yet he will steal from countless strangers — in effect , a little bit from everyone who pays federal taxes — “ whether it ’s right or wrong , ” simply to bulk up his income from farming .
( Needless to say , the so - called disaster payments rarely go to anyone who has suffered a genuine disaster ; like most of what the government does , this program is for the most part a sham from the get - go . )
It would be tempting to attribute this agri-plunder to some idiosyncratic moral defect caused by the farmers ’ spending too much time in the sun .
We might recall , for example , H. L. Mencken ’s trenchant description of the American farmer : “ No more grasping , selfish and dishonest mammal , indeed , is known to students of the Anthropoidea . ”
Unfortunately , however , the farmers are morally the same as countless others ; they are simply more politically successful than most of the others .
Sad to say , for every specific form of farmer swag , the government must open the door to a thousand other sorts of booty completely unrelated to agriculture .
The moral rot is comprehensive , not confined to a few bad apples , and it defiles businessmen , doctors , lawyers , clergymen , students , retirees , and countless others along with the farmers .
Virtually everybody has checked his morality along with his pistol at the entrance to the legislature .
" The state , ” Frdric Bastiat told us long ago , “ is the great fiction by which everybody tries to live at the expense of everybody else . "
If only the great man could see us now .
Even he might be amazed , and appalled , by the heights to which this futile quest has been raised .
In fact , this hoary fantasy arguably has become the central truth about government in our time .
I make these observations not because I hold myself to be an especially upright man ; far from it .
Yet one need not have earned an A + in moral rectitude to understand that , however one may assess the morality of modern government ’s hypertrophied taking from Peter and giving to Paul , this activity bears a deadly fruit .
Because it creates such widespread and powerful incentives for people to engage in government - facilitated predation , instead of production , it diverts great energies , intelligence , and other resources to the pursuit of privilege — to what the public choice analysts call “ rent seeking . ”
As more and more such diversion occurs , the society falls farther and farther below the full realization of its potential to create genuine wealth .
Eventually , everybody will be fighting to seize and consume the seed corn , and none will remain for planting next year ’s crop .
There ’s a natural , unavoidable outcome of such action .
Ask any farmer .
The Best of Robert Higgs

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
I do n't know about you , but I can't take seriously anyone who takes either the Republican Party or Democratic Party seriously -- in part because neither party takes you and me seriously ; in part because both are bought and paid for by corporate America and special interests .
And neither party gives a damn about the middle class .
Our country 's middle class is not just collateral damage in what has become all - out class warfare .
Political , business and academic elites are waging an outright war on working men and women and their families , and there is no chance the American middle class will survive this assault if the dominant forces unleashed over the past five years continue unchecked .
They 've accomplished this through large campaign contributions , armies of lobbyists that have swamped Washington , and control of political and economic think tanks and media .
Lobbyists , in fact , are the arms dealers in the war on the middle class , brokering money , influence and information between their clients our elected officials .
Yet in my entire career , I 've literally never heard anyone in Congress argue that lobbyists are bad for America .
In 1968 there were only 63 lobbyists in Washington .
Today , there are more than 34,000 , and lobbyists now outnumber our elected representatives and their staffs by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
According to the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity , from 1998 through 2004 , lobbyists spent nearly $ 12 billion to not only influence legislation , but in many cases to write the language of the laws and regulations .
Individual firms , corporations and national organizations spent a record $ 2.14 billion on lobbying members of Congress and 220 other federal agencies in 2004 , according to PoliticalMoneyLine .
That 's nearly $ 6 million a day spent to influence our leaders .
We really do have the best government money can buy .
But as I discuss in my new book , " War on the Middle Class , " what if we all resolved that we would not permit either the Republicans or Democrats to waste their time and ours with wedge issues ?
Both parties love to excite their bases by focusing on wedge issues like gay marriage , the pledge of allegiance , school prayer , judicial appointments , gun control , stem cell research and welfare reform .
Each of these wedge issues is important in varying degrees to large numbers of us , but none of them rises to the level of urgency or the requirement of immediate change in public policy .
These issues are raised by both political parties to distract and divert public attention from the profound issues -- like educating our youth , economic inequality and the war against radical Islamic terrorists -- that affect our daily lives and the American way of life .
Imagine the consternation in Washington if both parties had to contend with a national electorate whose political affiliation had dramatically changed within a matter of weeks or months .
In both Republican and Democratic administrations , Congress has passed and sustained billions of dollars in royalty payments and subsidies to big oil companies ; pushed through a corporate - written , consumer - crippling bankruptcy law ; embraced the death of the estate tax ; approved every free trade deal brought to a vote ; and supported illegal immigration for the sake of cheap labor .
The party strategists and savants are telling us that fewer Americans will turn out to the polls than ever before , disgusted by a disgraced former congressman .
But we do n't have to wait for the midterm elections to begin to engage in our new political life .
There 's something all of us could do that would have an immediate impact and send a powerful message to both corporation - dominated political parties and to our elected officials in Washington .
Our so - called representatives in both parties have been working against the interests of the middle class for so long that they take our votes for granted , or they take advantage of the fact that a sizable number of us do n't vote at all .
So what if a majority of us decided once and for all to walk into our town and city halls all over the country and change our party affiliation from Republican or Democrat to independent ?
What if that sizable number of us who do n't vote at all decided to register as independents ?
For the first time in decades , working middle - class Americans might just get the attention of our elected officials in Washington .
Our middle class has suffered in silence for far too long , and it cannot afford to suffer or be silent much longer .
Hardworking Americans have not spoken out about their increasingly marginalized role in this society , and as a consequence they 've all but lost their voice .
Without that strong , clear and vibrant voice , all the major decisions about America and our future will be made by the elites of government , big business and the dominant special interests .
Those elites treasure your silence , as it enables them to claim America 's future for their own .
I sincerely hope that we will find the resolve to face these challenges to our way of life , and we do so soon .
George Bernard Shaw said , " It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid . "
I 'm stupid enough to be absolutely sincere in the hope that middle - class America will awake soon and take action .
漫 画 「ゴルゴ13」において、デューク東郷への報酬は「スイス銀行」のプライベート口座に振り込まれる。仕事の依頼を受ける場面で、「スイス銀行の俺の口座に振り込んでくれ」というデューク東郷の台詞を良く見かける。 その 「スイス銀行」、果たして実在するのだろうか？
もし、実在するのなら自分の口座を作ってみたい。そして、「電気料金はスイス銀行の俺の口座から引き落としてくれ」って言ってみたい。
という訳でスイスの銀行事情に詳しい、M&Zビジネス翻訳センターの牧野代表に電話でお話を伺った。牧野さんの会社は金融関係の翻訳業を主業務としているが、付加業務としてスイス銀行の紹介も行っているのだ。
（text by 住 正徳） スイス銀行は実在するのか ？
今回は電話取材で す
住 「『スイス銀行』についてお伺いしたいのですが、そもそも『スイス銀行』という銀行は実在するのでしょうか？ 」 牧野さん「『スイス銀行』という名称の銀行はありません。広い意味で解釈すると『スイスにある銀行』という事になると思いますが、映画や小説で登場する『スイス銀行』は『スイスのプライベート銀行』という事になると思います」
スイスの街並 み
映画や小説、そして『ゴルゴ13』に登場する「スイス銀行」とは、スイスにあるプライベート銀行の事だったのだ。では何故、スイスのプライベート銀行（以下、スイス銀行）が映画や小説にしばし登場するのだろうか？
「 スイス銀行の俺の口座に20万ドル振り込んでくれ」とデューク東郷
牧野さん 「大きな特徴として、顧客の個人情報に関して厳しい秘密保持の義務がある、というものが挙げられます。銀行がそれを破った場合、刑事罰が与えられるほどです 」
顧客の秘密が厳守される。その特性の影響でスパイ物などに登場する機会が多いのだ。しかし、スイス銀行には更に注目すべき特徴があるという。 牧野さん「スイス銀行では、安全で確実な資産管理が実現されます。これこそが一番の特色だと言えますね 」
まず、スイス銀行には不良債権がない。集めた預金を企業に融資してその金利で稼ぐ収益体勢を取る日本の銀行に対し、スイス銀行は融資を一切行わない。ではどうやって収益を上げているのか。預金者の資産運用を成功させ、それに対する手数料で稼いでいるのだ。
更に、スイス銀行にはペイオフがない。つまり預金の元本がきちんと保証されているのだ。そして、金利も日本の銀行より高い。通貨によっては10倍近く違う場合もあるという。
いい事尽くめだ、スイス銀行。これは早速口座を開設してお金を預けるべきだろう。
牧野さんから口座開設までの手続きを伺う。
マッターホルン スイス銀行に口座をつくるには ？
「 スイス銀行の番号預金口座に振り込んだ30万ドルは確認していただけたかな？」と聞かれるデューク東郷
住 「では、スイス銀行に口座を作るにはどうしたらいいのでしょうか？ 」 牧野さん「まず、私たちの様な業者と連絡を取って、条件にあった銀行を選別してもらいます。その後は銀行からお客様に直接連絡があるので、あとは銀行と諸条件を詰めていきます。日本語で対応してくれる銀行もありますので、その辺は心配しなくても大丈夫です 」
意外に簡単そうじゃないか、スイス銀行。
僕が初めて銀行口座を作ったのは大学時代、恵比寿でアルバイトを始めた時にバイト先から口座を作る様に言われ、三和銀行（当時）の東恵比寿支店に100円で口座を開設した。通帳とキャッシュカードをもらい、少し大人になった様な気持ちになったのを覚えている。あれから20年近くの歳月が経ち、三和銀行は三菱東京UFJ銀行に変わったが、公共料金等の引き落としは未だにその口座から引き落とされている。
そんな慣れ親しんだ口座からスイス銀行に乗り換える時がやって来た。
更に詳しく牧野さんに聞く。
住 「スイス銀行には通帳はあるのでしょうか？ 」 牧野さん「そういったものはないですね。ただ、毎月報告書が送られて来ます 」 住「 キャッシュカードは？ ATMからカードで引き落としたり出来ますか？ 」 牧野さん「それもないですね。そういう目的でお金を預けている訳ではなく、皆さん資産運用という意図でスイス銀行を利用していますから 」
スイス銀行から生活費の引き落としをしている様な人はいないのだ。
「 報酬の50万ドルだ！」と、時にはキャッシュで受け取る事もある
牧野さん 「
そもそもスイス銀行に口座を作るには、最低でも3000万円はないと無理です 」
住 「さ、さ、3000 万円ですか？ 」 牧野さん 「ええ。それが最低レベルで、銀行によっては5000万円とか1億円とかさまざまです。そして、スイス銀行に預けるお金はあくまでも資産運用の目的ですから、そこに全財産を預ける様な人はいません。つまりスイス銀行に1億円預けても、まだお金を持っている人、そういう人がスイス銀行の顧客です 」
三和銀行は100円で開設出来たのに。1億円って。
「 電気料金はスイス銀行の俺の口座から引き落としてくれ」って言ってみる。
そんな僕の夢は一瞬で散ってしまいました。
UFJ 銀行の俺の口座から引き落としてくれ スイス銀行に口座を開く場合、牧野さんの様に紹介してくれる業者があるのだが、口座開設時に手数料を取る会社が多数ある。牧野さん曰く、そういう業者には頼まない方が賢明だという。口座開設だけで手数料を取る銀行は存在せず、良心的なコンサルタントも口座開設だけで手数料を取ったりはしないということです。 取材協力：M＆Zビジネス翻訳センター

NAME
Perl : : Critic - Critique
Perl source code for best - practices
SYNOPSIS
use Perl : : Critic ; my $ file = shift ; my $ critic = Perl : : Critic -> new ( ) ; my @violations = $ critic -> critique ( $ file ) ; print @violations ;
DESCRIPTION
Perl : : Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding standards to Perl source code .
Essentially , it is a static source code analysis engine .
Perl : : Critic is distributed with a number of Perl : : Critic : : Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding guidelines .
Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conway 's book Perl Best Practices .
However , Perl : : Critic is not limited to PBP and will even support Policies that contradict Conway .
You can enable , disable , and customize those Polices through the Perl : : Critic interface .
You can also create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes .
For a convenient command - line interface to Perl : : Critic , see the documentation for perlcritic .
If you want to integrate Perl : : Critic with your build process , Test : : Perl : : Critic provides an interface that is suitable for test scripts .
For the ultimate convenience ( at the expense of some flexibility ) see the criticism pragma .
Win32 and ActivePerl users can find PPM distributions of Perl : : Critic at http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/.
CONSTRUCTOR
new ( - profile => $ FILE , - severity => $ N , - include => \@PATTERNS , - exclude => \@PATTERNS , - top = N , - force => 1 )>
Returns a reference to a new Perl : : Critic object .
Most arguments are just passed directly into Perl : : Critic : : Config , but I have described them here as well .
All arguments are optional key - value pairs as follows : - profile is a path to a configuration file .
If $ FILE is not defined , Perl : : Critic : : Config attempts to find a . perlcriticrc configuration file in the current directory , and then in your home directory .
Alternatively , you can set the PERLCRITIC environment variable to point to a file in another location .
If a configuration file can't be found , or if $ FILE is an empty string , then all Policies will be loaded with their default configuration .
See " CONFIGURATION " for more information .
- severity is the minimum severity level .
Only Policy modules that have a severity greater than $ N will be loaded .
Severity values are integers ranging from 1 ( least severe ) to 5 ( most severe ) .
The default is 5 .
For a given - profile , decreasing the - severity will usually result in more Policy violations .
Users can redefine the severity level for any Policy in their . perlcriticrc file .
See " CONFIGURATION " for more information .
- include is a reference to a list of string @PATTERNS .
Policy modules that match at least one m/$PATTERN / imx will always be loaded , irrespective of the severity settings .
For example : my $ critic = Perl : : Critic -> new ( - include => [ ' layout ' ] - severity => 4 ) ; This would cause Perl : : Critic to load all the CodeLayout ::* Policy modules even though they have a severity level that is less than 4 .
You can use - include in conjunction with the - exclude option .
Note that - exclude takes precedence over - include when a Policy matches both patterns .
- exclude is a reference to a list of string @PATTERNS .
Policy modules that match at least one m/$PATTERN / imx will not be loaded , irrespective of the severity settings .
For example : my $ critic = Perl : : Critic -> new ( - exclude => [ ' strict ' ] - severity => 1 ) ; This would cause Perl : : Critic to not load the RequireUseStrict and ProhibitNoStrict Policy modules even though they have a severity level that is greater than 1 .
You can use - exclude in conjunction with the - include option .
Note that - exclude takes precedence over - include when a Policy matches both patterns .
- top is the maximum number of Violations to return when ranked by their severity levels .
Violations are still returned in the order that they occur within the file .
This must be a positive integer - force controls whether Perl : : Critic observes the magical " ## no critic " pseudo - pragmas in your code .
If set to a true value , Perl : : Critic will analyze all code .
If set to a false value ( which is the default ) Perl : : Critic will ignore code that is tagged with these comments .
See " BENDING THE RULES " for more information .
- config is a reference to a Perl : : Critic : : Config object .
If you have created your own Config object for some reason , you can pass it in here instead of having Perl : : Critic create one for you .
Using the - config option causes all the other options to be silently ignored .
METHODS
critique ( $ source_code )
Runs the $ source_code through the Perl : : Critic engine using all the Policies that have been loaded into this engine .
If $ source_code is a scalar reference , then it is treated as string of actual Perl code .
If $ source_code is a reference to an instance of PPI :: Document , then that instance is used directly .
Otherwise , it is treated as a path to a local file containing Perl code .
This method Returns a list of Perl : : Critic : : Violation objects for each violation of the loaded Policies .
The list is sorted in the order that the Violations appear in the code .
If there are no violations , this method returns an empty list .
add_policy ( - policy => $ policy_name , - config => \%config_hash )
Creates a Policy object and loads it into this Critic .
If the object cannot be instantiated , it will throw a warning and return a false value .
Otherwise , it returns a reference to this Critic .
- policy is the name of a Perl : : Critic : : Policy subclass module .
The ' Perl : : Critic : : Policy ' portion of the name can be omitted for brevity .
This argument is required .
- config is an optional reference to a hash of Policy configuration parameters .
Note that this is not the same thing as a Perl : : Critic : : Config object .
The contents of this hash reference will be passed into to the constructor of the Policy module .
See the documentation in the relevant Policy module for a description of the arguments it supports .
policies ()
Returns a list containing references to all the Policy objects that have been loaded into this engine .
Objects will be in the order that they were loaded .
config ()
Returns the Perl : : Critic :: Config object that was created for or given to this Critic .
FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
For those folks who prefer to have a functional interface ,
The critique method can be exported on request and called as a static function .
If the first argument is a hashref , its contents are used to construct a new Perl : : Critic object internally .
The keys of that hash should be the same as those supported by the Perl : : Critic : : new method .
Here are some examples :
use Perl : : Critic qw( critique ) ; # Use default parameters ... @violations = critique ( $ some_file ) ; # Use custom parameters ... @violations = critique ( {- severity => 2} , $ some_file ) ;
None of the other object - methods are currently supported as static functions .
Sorry .
CONFIGURATION
The default configuration file is called . perlcriticrc .
Perl : : Critic will look for this file in the current directory first , and then in your home directory .
Alternatively , you can set the PERLCRITIC environment variable to explicitly point to a different file in another location .
If none of these files exist , and the - profile option is not given to the constructor , then all the modules that are found in the Perl : : Critic : : Policy namespace will be loaded with their default configuration .
The format of the configuration file is a series of INI - style sections that contain key - value pairs separated by '= ' .
Comments should start with ' # ' and can be placed on a separate line or after the name - value pairs if you desire .
The general recipe is a series of blocks like this :
[ Perl : : Critic : : Policy : : Category : : PolicyName ] severity = 1 arg1 = value1 arg2 = value2
Perl : : Critic :: Policy :: Category :: PolicyName is the full name of a module that implements the policy .
The Policy modules distributed with Perl : : Critic have been grouped into categories according to the table of contents in Damian Conway 's book Perl Best Practices .
For brevity , you can omit the ' Perl : : Critic : : Policy ' part of the module name .
severity is the level of importance you wish to assign to the Policy .
All Policy modules are defined with a default severity value ranging from 1 ( least severe ) to 5 ( most severe ) .
However , you may disagree with the default severity and choose to give it a higher or lower severity , based on your own coding philosophy .
The remaining key - value pairs are configuration parameters that will be passed into the constructor for that Policy .
The constructors for most Policy objects do not support arguments , and those that do should have reasonable defaults .
See the documentation on the appropriate Policy module for more details .
Instead of redefining the severity for a given Policy , you can completely disable a Policy by prepending a ' -' to the name of the module in your configuration file .
In this manner , the Policy will never be loaded , regardless of the - severity given to the Perl : : Critic constructor .
A simple configuration might look like this :
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#
I think these are really important , so always load them [ TestingAndDebugging : : RequireUseStrict ] severity = 5 [ TestingAndDebugging :: RequireUseWarnings ] severity = 5 #--------------------------------------------------------------
#
I think these are less important , so only load when asked [ Variables : : ProhibitPackageVars ] severity = 2 [ ControlStructures :: ProhibitPostfixControls ] allow = if unless # My custom configuration severity =
2 #--------------------------------------------------------------
#
I do not agree with these at all , so never load them [- NamingConventions : : ProhibitMixedCaseVars ]
[- NamingConventions : : ProhibitMixedCaseSubs ]
#--------------------------------------------------------------
#
For all other Policies , I accept the default severity , # so no additional configuration is required for them .
A few sample configuration files are included in this distribution under the t/ samples directory .
The perlcriticrc.none file demonstrates how to disable Policy modules .
The perlcriticrc.levels file demonstrates how to redefine the severity level for any given Policy module .
The perlcriticrc.pbp file configures Perl : : Critic to load only Policies described in Damian Conway 's book " Perl Best Practice . "
THE POLICIES
A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl : : Critic .
They are described briefly in the companion document Perl : : Critic : : PolicySummary and in more detail in the individual modules themselves .
BENDING THE RULES
Perl : : Critic takes a hard - line approach to your code : either you comply or you do n't .
In the real world , it is not always practical ( or even possible ) to fully comply with coding standards .
In such cases , it is wise to show that you are knowingly violating the standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason ( DGR ) for doing so .
To help with those situations , you can direct Perl : : Critic to ignore certain lines or blocks of code by using pseudo - pragmas :
require ' LegacyLibaray1.pl ' ; ## no critic require ' LegacyLibrary 2.pl ' ; ## no critic for my $ element ( @list ) { ## no critic $ foo = " " ; # Violates ' ProhibitEmptyQuotes ' $ barf = bar ( ) if $ foo ; # Violates ' ProhibitPostfixControls '
# Some more evil code ... ## use critic # Some good code ... do_something ($_ ) ; }
The " ## no critic " comments direct Perl : : Critic to ignore the remaining lines of code until the end of the current block , or until a " ## use critic " comment is found ( whichever comes first ) .
If the " ## no critic " comment is on the same line as a code statement , then only that line of code is overlooked .
To direct perlcritic to ignore the " ## no critic " comments , use the - force option .
A bare " ## no critic " comment disables all the active Policies .
If you wish to disable only specific Policies , add a list of Policy names as arguments just as you would for the " no strict " or " no warnings " pragmas .
For example , this would disable the ProhibitEmptyQuotes and ProhibitPostfixControls policies until the end of the block or until the next " ## use critic " comment ( whichever comes first ) :
## no critic ( EmptyQuotes , PostfixControls ) $ foo = " " ; # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions :: ProhibitEmptyQuotes $ barf = bar( ) if $ foo ; # Now exempt ControlStructures : : ProhibitPostfixControls $ long_int = 10000000000 ; # Still subjected to ValuesAndExpression :: RequireNumberSeparators
Since the Policy names are matched against the arguments as regular expressions , you can abbreviate the Policy names or disable an entire family of Policies in one shot like this :
## no critic ( NamingConventions ) my $ camelHumpVar = ' foo ' ; # Now exempt from NamingConventions :: ProhibitMixedCaseVars sub camelHumpSub {} # Now exempt from NamingConventions :: ProhibitMixedCaseSubs
The argument list must be enclosed in parens and must contain one or more comma-separated barewords ( e.g. do n't use quotes ) .
The < " ## no critic " > pragmas can be nested , and Policies named by an inner pragma will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer pragma .
Use this feature wisely .
" ## no critic " should be used in the smallest possible scope , or only on individual lines of code .
And you should always be as specific as possible about which policies you want to disable ( i.e. never use a bare " ## no critic " ) .
If Perl : : Critic complains about your code , try and find a compliant solution before resorting to this feature .
IMPORTANT CHANGES
Perl - Critic is evolving rapidly .
As such , some of the interfaces have changed in ways that are not backward - compatible .
If you have been using an older version of Perl - Critic and / or you have been developing custom Policy modules , please read this section carefully .
VERSION 0.16
Starting in version 0.16 , you can add a list Policy names as arguments to the " ## no critic " pseudo - pragma .
This feature allows you to disable specific policies .
So if you have been in the habit of adding additional words after " no critic " , then those words might cause unexpected results .
If you want to append other stuff to the " ## no critic " comment , then terminate the pseudo - pragma with a semi-colon , and then start another comment .
For example :
# This may not work as expected .
$ email = 'foo@bar.com ' ; ## no critic for literal ' @ ' # This will work .
$ email = 'foo@bar.com ' ; ## no critic ; # for literal ' @ ' # This is even better .
$ email = 'foo@bar.com ' ; ## no critic ( RequireInterpolation ) ;
VERSION 0.14
Starting in version 0.14 , the interface to Perl : : Critic : : Violation changed .
This will also break any custom Policy modules that you might have written for earlier modules .
See DEVELOPER .pod for an up - to - date guide on creating Policy modules .
The notion of " priority " was also replaced with " severity " in version 0.14 .
Consequently , the default behavior of Perl : : Critic is to only load the most " severe " Policy modules , rather than loading all of them .
This decision was based on user - feedback suggesting that Perl - Critic should be less " critical " for new users , and should steer them toward gradually increasing the strictness as they adopt better coding practices .
VERSION 0.11
Starting in version 0.11 , the internal mechanics of Perl - Critic were rewritten so that only one traversal of the PPI document tree is required .
Unfortunately , this will break any custom Policy modules that you might have written for earlier versions .
Converting your policies to work with the new version is pretty easy and actually results in cleaner code .
See DEVELOPER .pod for an up - to - date guide on creating Policy modules .
Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective .
The goal of Perl : : Critic is to help you write code that conforms with a set of best practices .
Our primary goal is not to dictate what those practices are , but rather , to implement the practices discovered by others .
Ultimately , you make the rules -- Perl : : Critic is merely a tool for encouraging consistency .
If there is a policy that you think is important or that we have overlooked , we would be very grateful for contributions , or you can simply load your own private set of policies into Perl : : Critic .
EXTENDING THE CRITIC
The modular design of Perl : : Critic is intended to facilitate the addition of new Policies .
You 'll need to have some understanding of PPI , but most Policy modules are pretty straightforward and only require about 20 lines of code .
Please see the Perl : : Critic :: DEVELOPER file included in this distribution for a step - by - step demonstration of how to create new Policy modules .
If you develop any new Policy modules , feel free to send them to < thaljef@cpan.org > and I 'll be happy to put them into the Perl : : Critic distribution .
Or if you 'd like to work on the Perl : : Critic project directly , check out our repository at http://perlcritic.tigris.org.

Earlier analysis ( see the " The Optimal Size of a Terrorist Network " for more ) indicates that the disruption of al Qaeda network mega-hub in Afghanistan has put strict limits on the size of the surviving virtual network elements .
This size limitation may represent a barrier to attacks on the US , but is likely well within the capabilities of what is necessary for limited regional attacks .
However , new innovations in group dynamics and the emergence of new unaffiliated guerrilla networks in Iraq may provide a method for regaining strategic capability .
The Bazaar
The decentralized , and seemingly chaotic guerrilla war in Iraq demonstrates a pattern that will likely serve as a model for next generation terrorists .
This pattern shows a level of learning , activity , and success similar to what we see in the open source software community .
I call this pattern the bazaar .
The bazaar solves the problem : how do small , potentially antagonistic networks combine to conduct war ?
Lessons from Eric Raymond 's " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " provides a starting point for further analysis .
Here are the factors that apply ( from the perspective of the guerrillas ) :
Release early and often .
Try new forms of attacks against different types of targets early and often .
Do n’t wait for a perfect plan .
Try new forms of attacks against different types of targets early and often .
Do n’t wait for a perfect plan .
Given a large enough pool of co-developers , any difficult problem will be seen as obvious by someone , and solved .
Eventually some participant of the bazaar will find a way to disrupt a particularly difficult target .
All you need to do is copy the process they used .

They will innovate on your plans , swarm on weaknesses you identify , and protect you by creating system noise .

Scaling the Bazaar
The bazaar dynamic -- replete with stigmergic learning and entrepreneurial ventures -- is vibrant enough to keep Iraq in a state of chaos .
The statistics speak for themselves .
However , can the bazaar be exported to regional nations or strategic targets ?
Can it serve as a post Afghanistan ( post al Qaeda ) model for global guerrilla warfare ?
Yes .

This program plays tic - tac - toe .
Did you guess that already ?
Well , you could n't guess how bizarre a tic - tac - toe game can be until you 've seen this program !
It plays tic - tac - toe on itself .
The code is written as a tic - tac - toe grid ; moves are carried out within the cource code .
As if that were n't enough , this program gets better over time as it plays , by producing improved copies of its own source code !
This initial compile line is :
cc - DP=putchar - DN = " P ( 10 ) " - DQ = " P( 34 ) " - DF = " S ( &X ) " - DJ= " z [ 4 ] " - DK = " J [ 14 ] " \ - DH= " w [ ]

The program , when run , reproduces itself with both the player 's move ( X ) and the computer 's move ( 0 ) added .
Recompile this program ( using the same compile line ) and repeat until the game is finished .

Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe have separated .
The couple 's rep released a statement to TMZ Monday morning that says " We are saddened to announce that Reese & Ryan have decided to formally separate .
They remain committed to their family and we ask that you please respect their privacy and the safety of their children at this time . "
Sources tell TMZ Witherspoon has contacted celebrity divorce lawyer Robert Kaufman , who has represented Jennifer Aniston , Roseanne and Lisa Marie Presley .
Sources say Witherspoon spoke with Kaufman about divorcing Ryan Phillippe , her husband of seven years .
The couple has two children .
They met at Witherspoon 's 21st birthday party .
As for why Witherspoon contacted Kaufman , we 're told it was not triggered by one event .
Rather , one connected source says it was " cumulative . "
Police are investigating a disgruntled eBayer who took online revenge after paying £ 375 for a laptop which , he said , did not work .
The buyer recovered the hard drive from the malfunctioning notebook , finding it full of personal details , allegedly including access to email accounts , 90 voyeuristic leg shots taken on the London Underground and gay porn .
He posted the material on a website , naming and shaming Barnet 19 - year - old Amir Tofangsazan as the seller .
Clearly , someone does n't see the funny side .
A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said Barnet police are investigating a complaint made on 29 May at Fulham police station regarding improper use of a public electronic communications network .
She added : " The allegation follows from a civil dispute .
No arrests have been made and inquiries continue . "
At time of writing the site had clocked up almost 950,000 hits .
A dismayed Amir told the Daily Mail the website had made his life a " living hell " , and that his family had received threats .
He said : " The laptop was n't even broken .
It was in working order .
The last few days have been a nightmare , some of my friends have seen it and my father is very angry . "
Amir said he had not received any " polite requests " for a refund .
On his revenge site the buyer counters : " This site is 100 per cent genuine , I swear I 'm not making anything up . "
Amir told the Daily Mail : " I will obviously be trying to get the website taken down as soon as possible . "
In the meantime , the site is available here . ®
Bootnote
The buyer has been named as Thomas Sawyer , a 23 - year - old student from Exeter .
He offers to pull the site sown voluntarily in exchange for a refund .
Meanwhile , The Daily Mail reports that Amir allegedly pulled a similar scam on Newport Pagnell woman Debbie McInerney , who says she paid him £ 147 for an iPod which never arrived .
Amir said : " The police are investigating the iPod case and I can't comment on it . "
Yesterday marked the 10th anniversary of Venture Capital blogging .
How do I know ?
Because my first post on VentureBlog was on March 5 , 2003 ( a pithy little post entitled " I 'm a VC .
Who the hell are you ? " -- no , it was n't a precursors to my post on Narcissistic Personality Disorder , it was a post about starting your VC presentation with team bios ) and before VentureBlog VCs pretty much kept mum .
A lot has changed since 2003 .
Now there is barely a venture capital firm out there that does n't have at least one blog or blogger .
At a minimum , every VC firm has at least one nano - blogger who shares his or her wisdom in 140 characters or fewer .
It is hard to imagine that blogging was an innovation for the venture capital industry ten years ago .
But it was .
When I entered the venture business , no one would have thought of blogging .
After all , how could you give away all your best VC secrets ?
The venture industry was a black box and the VCs liked it that way .
But that 's not how we saw it .
Truth be told , VentureBlog was the brain child of Andrew Anker .
Andrew and I worked together at August Capital in the early 2000's , along with Naval Ravikant .
We were all deeply ensconced in the emergence of social media .
Andrew approached Naval and me and suggested that we start a VC blog .
We discussed the fact that VCs rarely talk about what they do or how they do it .
But we could not come up with a good reason why that was .
As far as we could tell , there were n't any real secrets to be had .
So we decided to do the unthinkable and actually write about Venture Capital .
The beauty of being the first bloggers in an industry is that you have a ton to write about .
The world was our oyster .
We could talk about how best to pitch a VC .
We could talk about those technologies that excited us .
We could talk about the many conferences we attended .
No matter what we wrote about , we were the first VCs to discuss it .
And entrepreneurs were clamoring for information about venture capital .
Not surprisingly , the value of this conversation we were having with entrepreneurs was not lost on others in the venture industry .
And soon VC blogs started popping up everywhere we turned .
There is little question that this marketplace of ideas was incredibly valuable to entrepreneurs .
What was once a black box became a glass box .
Venture investors started writing about everything -- how they analyzed businesses , how they assessed teams , how they derived valuations .
What 's more , VCs started writing not only about the industries in which they were interested , but the very companies they found compelling .
It was a brave new world .
So much so that it was front page news for the venture capital industry -- the Venture Capital Journal ran a cover story in January of 2005 entitled " My Life as a Blogger " accompanied by my smiling mug .
Ridiculous but true .
Now that ten years have passed , one has to ask if we VC bloggers have learned anything ?
Is it all just navel - gazing ?
Or is there something to this blogging stuff ?
The answer is a resounding " yes . "
It is often navel - gazing , but there 's something to it .
Those of us who have spent the last decade or so blogging have gotten a lot of value out of it .
In particular , I find that I learn a ton by articulating a particular point of view , I learn even more engaging in a conversation with entrepreneurs about that particular point of view , and I am able to generate a bunch of attention by actually having a point of view I 'm willing to articulate .
The combination is powerful and valuable .
I often find myself espousing the belief that entrepreneurs should not bother writing a business plan .
Business plans are static tomes that are almost assuredly outdated the second they are completed .
So why bother ?
The one reason is to better understand and articulate your business .
Some entrepreneurs find the act of memorializing their business in a document to be clarifying .
The same is true of blogging .
If you really want to fully appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of a point of view , articulate it .
I have found that the process of writing about a particular topic can be highly elucidating .
Sometimes I get it really right and sometimes I got it really wrong , but I always have a deeper understanding of the topic when I 've finished writing about it .
The same is true of the conversation that surrounds a well - articulated blog post .
At the outset of blogging , all of that conversation took place in the comments section of the blog itself , or in the posts on other related blogs .
That conversation now extends into the social web .
Commentary on my blog posts appears on Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter , providing me with an even broader discussion of the relative merits of my points of view .
I quickly learn what resonates with my readers and what does not .
Lastly , blogging has become an incredible megaphone .
Over the years , millions of people have read what I have to say about Venture Capital and entrepreneurship .
What 's more , blogging has given me the ability to connect directly with my readers .
My point of view is not filtered or interpreted by others -- I get to speak for myself .
In combination with the powerful amplification of social platforms like Facebook and Twitter , VentureBlog has proven a valuable tool for me and my firm to rise above the noise .
I had no idea ten years ago that VentureBlog would prove a catalyst for a whole industry of bloggers .
But I am thrilled that it has .
Not only has blogging provided us venture capitalists with the opportunity to demystify an enigmatic industry .
But , more importantly , it has given entrepreneurs an invaluable resource to assist them in the incredibly challenging task of company creation .
With any luck VentureBlog and the many VC blogs that followed will continue to flourish for years to come .
Liz Longhurst won support from MPs for her campaign
Mother 's reaction
The government has announced plans to make the possession of violent porn punishable by three years in jail .
It follows a campaign by Berkshire woman Liz Longhurst whose daughter Jane , a Brighton schoolteacher , was strangled by Graham Coutts .
Mrs Longhurst 's campaign was backed by MPs and a 50,000 - signature petition .
Hidden body
In November last year the petition won cross-party support when it was presented to the House of Commons and was backed publicly by the solicitor general , Harriet Harman MP .
Since her daughter 's death Mrs Longhurst , 74 , from Reading , has fought a long campaign to ban the possession of images of sexual violence .
Mrs Longhurst said : " My daughter Sue and myself are very pleased that after 30 months of intensive campaigning we have persuaded the government to take action against these horrific internet sites , which can have such a corrupting influence and glorify extreme sexual violence . "
Jane Longhurst , 31 , was found dead on Wiggonholt Common , near Pulborough , West Sussex , on 19 April 2003 .
She had been strangled with a pair of tights and her body kept in storage for weeks before it was found .
In 2004 , musician Coutts , 36 , of Waterloo Street , Hove , West Sussex , was jailed for life for her murder but on appeal the minimum term he was ordered to serve was reduced from 30 to 26 years .
Such material has no place in our society
Home Office minister Vernon Coaker
Trial jurors had been told of his obsession with strangulation and how he looked at internet sites connected with the fetish .
It is already a crime to make or publish such images but proposed legislation will outlaw possession of images such as " material featuring violence that is , or appears to be , life - threatening or is likely to result in serious and disabling injury " .
Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker MP said : " Such material has no place in our society but the advent of the internet has meant that this material is more easily available and means existing controls are being by - passed - we must move to tackle this . "
Mrs Longhurst said legislation , which would apply to all websites , would mean her daughter 's death had not been " entirely in vain " .
Reading West MP Martin Salter , who backed the campaign , said : " This campaign has taken a huge amount of time and effort but it has struck a chord right across the country .
Graham Coutts was said to have been addicted to violent porn
" It is great news that the Government has not only listened but has responded to calls to outlaw access to sickening internet images , which can so easily send vulnerable people over the edge . "
The new law will not target those who accidentally come into contact with obscene pornography or affect mainstream entertainment industry working within current obscenity laws .
But the proposed legislation has drawn opposition from anti-censorship groups and organisations who represent people involved in sadomasochist activities .
Shaun Gabb , director of the anti-censorship organisation the Libertarian Alliance , said : " If you are criminalising possession then you are giving police inquisitorial powers to come into your house and see what you 've got , now we did n't have this in the past . "
This year five Law Lords sent Coutts ' case back to the Court of Appeal to " invite that court to quash the conviction " .
It was argued that jurors in the original trial should have been offered the option of manslaughter as well as a murder verdict .
Watching TV used to be the embodiment of mindlessness .
But now , deciding how and what to view is a surprisingly complex task , as a series of industry - transforming deals presents consumers with a host of new viewing options .
Each approach requires a different device , and each charges viewers in a different way .
The upshot :
It is easier than ...
“ Hello , I am with ABC polls , ” a suggested script began .
Some attendees complained that the script seemed deceptive , Ms. Marshner said in an interview afterward .
She said that such disguised calls were a common campaign tactic , that it was just a suggested script and that she never recommended answering a direct question with a lie .
Tony Perkins , president of the Family Research Council , who played host to the conference , said he was “ upset ” to learn of her instructions and condemned any deception .
The Rev. Barry W. Lynn , executive director of the liberal group Americans United for Separation of Church and State , called the tactic “ disgraceful ” and “ a desecration of the church . ”
Several organizers at the event lamented that opposition to same - sex marriage , a major catalyst for Christian conservative turnout two years ago , had lost some of its emotional resonance .
Massachusetts remains the only state to recognize same - sex marriage .
Sixteen states have passed constitutional amendments banning such unions , and eight courts have ruled against the idea .
“ Sometimes success brings complacency , ” Mr. Perkins said .
To revive some of the emotions around the issue , several organizers said they were taking up the argument that legal recognition of same - sex marriages would cramp the free expression of religious groups who consider such unions a sin  an idea much discussed at the conference .
“ That is an issue that was n’t around two years ago and one that is absolutely moving to the very forefront , ” said the Rev. Donald Wildmon , founder of the American Family Association , a conservative Christian broadcaster and advocacy group .
Although that idea may seem far - fetched to many liberal or secular - minded voters , legal scholars across the political spectrum agree that authorizing same - sex marriages could present legal questions for some religious groups .
A Roman Catholic group in Massachusetts , for example , recently stopped offering children for adoption rather than provide them to gay couples .
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- In May 2003 U.S. President George W. Bush touched down on the deck of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in a Navy jet inscribed with the words " Commander in Chief " on the cockpit .
Standing underneath a banner reading " Mission Accomplished , " he declared the U.S. and its allies had " prevailed " in Iraq .
Almost three - and - a - half years later , with Iraq seemingly locked in a perpetual cycle of violence , Bush is facing growing calls from military leaders and his own political advisors to hit the " mission abort " button instead .
In August John Abizaid , commander of the U.S. Central Command in Iraq , told a Senate committee Iraq was heading towards " civil war . "
This month the chief of the British armed forces , General Sir Richard Dannatt , suggested the presence of allied troops was " exacerbating " security problems in Iraq .
Meanwhile a leaked copy of a report by the Congress - appointed Iraq Study Group , chaired by James Baker , the former Secretary of State to George Bush Senior , this week indicated its recommendations could include the large - scale withdrawal of American troops and possibly inviting Iran and Syria -- two countries previously denounced by Bush -- to help in stabilizing the country .
But the most damaging blow to Bush 's presidency may yet be dealt by the American public itself .
With mid-term elections next month , the president 's popularity ratings are at an all - time low .
A CNN poll this week found that 64 percent of Americans now believe going to war was a mistake .
( Full story )
If those statistics translate into votes , Bush may well face an uncomfortable final two years in office hounded by a Democrat - controlled Congress .
Yet while many influential figures agree that the time has come for a change of policy in Iraq , the precise details of what such a shift would involve remain unclear .
And although Baker has refused to comment on the exact recommendations the Iraq Study Group will put forward , he has warned there is no " magic bullet " to end the conflict .
For veteran statesmen such as Baker , the parallels with another era-defining American war must also be striking .
In the late 1960s the U.S. military found itself fighting an unwinnable conflict , enduring mounting casualties against a growing chorus of dissent at home -- in Vietnam .
On Wednesday Bush himself acknowledged parallels between the current situation in Iraq and the 1968 Tet Offensive -- widely considered to be the point when American public opinion turned against the war .
The U.S. finally extracted itself from southeast Asia in 1973 , but only following a pragmatic shift in its conduct of the war .
Under President Richard Nixon , American troops were gradually withdrawn and replaced by Vietnamese soldiers .
Nixon , advised by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , also adopted a more conciliatory policy of " detente " towards Washington 's ideological enemies , the Soviet Union and China , ultimately leading to the diplomatic breakthrough that allowed Nixon to claim he had secured " peace with honor . "
" What I would imagine America will probably do is what they did before which is to slowly start withdrawing its troops , " historian Dominic Sandbrook told CNN .
" George Bush already talks a lot about training up people in Iraq just like Nixon did in Vietnam .
What Vietnam teaches us is that sometimes there is no easy answer , there is no strategy for success --
You can get into something and there is no way out . "
As recently as August , Bush reiterated his administration 's commitment to wage war in Iraq until it had achieved its goals , saying victory would " be a powerful triumph in the ideological struggle of the 21st century ...
People will look to a democratic Iraq as inspiration that freedom can succeed in the Middle East , and as evidence that the side of freedom is the winning side . "
But the Iraq Study Group 's report , due before the end of the year , increasingly looks like just the excuse the beleaguered president needs to adopt a more Nixonian approach to foreign policy .
Such a move would also mark the end of the illusion that the conflict in Iraq can be ended by anything as clean - cut as " victory , " " freedom " or " democracy . "
Vietnam may hold one more lesson for the U.S. however .
If its exit strategy from Iraq follows the same course , there is also the danger that the government in Baghdad , on which Washington and its allies have spent so much time , money and blood , may go the same way as the South Vietnamese regime , which collapsed two years after Nixon 's " honorable peace . "
" The obvious abiding lesson is do n't get into these situations in the first place -- do n't break something you can't then fix , " said Sandbrook .
" Vietnam was a good example of that and I do n't think they 've learnt that lesson . "
If the groundswell of support for these sentiments is any indication , Rauch may soon find himself the unwitting figurehead for an Introverts ' Rights Revolution .
We decided to have a few words with this author , who has clearly tapped into something important .
Rauch is a correspondent for The Atlantic and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution .
His book , Gay Marriage : Why It Is Good for Gays , Good for Straights , and Good for America , was published in 2004 .
I spoke with him in early January .

Did anything in particular inspire you to write an article about this ?
An especially trying plane ride seated next to an extrovert , for example ?
I do n't think it was any specific incident .
The idea was rolling around in my head for a while .
To some extent , it was the result of being partnered with an extrovert and realizing that this was a daily source of tension .
So I started organizing my thoughts on the subject .
Another motivation was , basically , that I thought it would be funny .
It 's interesting that you 've found it a source of tension to be paired with an extrovert .
I 've read that introvert - extrovert pairings work well because the person who does n't like to make small talk can just let the other person do it for them .

That 's true .
It does work very well in some situations .
But for an introvert it also makes for a constant — I guess you might call it " brain pressure . "
That 's a better phrase than " tension , " because tension implies conflict and it's not that .
It 's just that my partner Michael 's default mode of being is to talk and interact all the time , whereas mine is to talk as little as possible .
We 've been together since 1996 and we 've spent much of that time just learning how not to drive each other completely insane .
Part of my motivation for writing this piece was to pass along some of what I 've learned .
I was also hoping Michael would read it , which he did .
Did it help ?
By the time the piece was published he 'd probably heard it all from me before .
But it does n't hurt to go on the record .
If he were a writer he could do the companion piece — " How to Care for Your Extrovert . "
Exactly .
But of course my view , as I say in the article , is that it 's much easier for introverts to understand these things than extroverts .
Extroverts really have a hard time " getting " it .
And even when they do get it , they still have a hard time modifying their behavior .
You wrote that for a long time you did n't even realize you were an introvert .
What caused it to finally dawn on you ?
From about the age of eighteen or nineteen , when I went to college , I realized that it was just not my idea of fun to party .
In fact , I could n't see why anyone would want to — I get so monumentally bored at parties .
So I realized that I had this fundamental difference with a lot of other people .
I did n't put a name on it until a few years ago when a friend of mine , who reads a lot of Jung , informed me that he's an introvert and that , " by the way , Jonathan , you 're an introvert , too . "
He explained what that means and suddenly a lightbulb went on and things fell into place .
Small Biz 101 : No one starts with a masterpiece RyanC 42 comments Latest by liz
Recap
In case you ’re new to the Small Biz 101 series , it ’s an in - the - trenches style guide to how to start your own web company , based on my experience starting DropSend and Carson Workshops .
In my first two articles , How to get started and Cash flow , I covered some of the basics of how to get your company started and how to manage your cash flow .
The biggest hurdle
In this article , I ’d like to focus on something that I believe holds people back from starting their own company or launching a new product or service .
What is this hurdle ?
It ’s the belief that you have to know exactly what you ’re doing from day # 1 .
Let me explain .
Think about successful companies like Ford , GE , Dyson , Google , Yahoo ! , Microsoft , Flickr , Hershey , Dell , Sun , etc .
The common misconception is that the founders of these companies knew exactly what they were doing , where they were going and how to be successful when they started .
This could n’t be further from the truth .
No one actually knows what they ’re doing
Every successful business has a dirty little secret :
They did n’t know if they were going to be successful when they started .
They probably did their homework , researched the market and had a bit of experience .
But there were no guarantees
I just finished a book about Google called The Search , by John Battelle .
What I learned from the book is that it ’s easy to look at a company like Google and say " Larry and Sergey are so impressive .
They had a vision to change the world and they did it .
I could never be like that . "
The truth is , they had no idea if they were going to succeed when they started .
What if Larry had said to Sergey , " Hmmm , I do n’t know Sergey .
Surely somebody has already figured out this search thing - and they probably know what they ’re doing !
We ’re just a couple of college kids so let ’s just play it safe and get good jobs at a stable company . "
This is all very similar to when you realise that your parents do n’t know everything .
All the sudden it hits you that there are no black and white rules and that you ’ve got to start figuring things out for yourself .
Starting a company is exactly the same .
All those people and businesses that you look up to and respect - they ’re just like you .
They do n’t have some special magic expertise that helps them make good decisions - they have to figure it out for themselves and hope they make the right call .
Leonardo and the Mona Lisa
I think a great example of my point is da Vinci ’s masterpiece , La Gioconda , also known as the Mona Lisa .
When he sat down to paint it , he had no idea that it would become one of the world ’s most famous paintings .
What if he had waited until he was sure he was going to paint a masterpiece ?
The answer is that he probably would ’ve never started .
So now what ?
Where is the practical advice ?
To put it plainly :
Get used to being uncomfortable and not knowing how things will turn out .
It ’s totally normal and it ’s a good sign that you ’re pushing yourself .
When you get nervous about starting your own company , or launching that new product , just remember that even the best of the best felt nervous and uncomfortable when they started .
Just like you , they took a gamble and hoped for the best , with no guarantees of success .
The sooner you ’re OK with feeling scared , the sooner you can get on with executing your ideas .
Next Time
As usual , let me know your opinions on what I ’ve said .
See you next time …

Gmail has an interesting quirk where you can add a plus sign (+ ) after your Gmail address , and it 'll still get to your inbox .
It 's called , and it essentially gives you an unlimited number of e-mail addresses to play with .
Here 's how it works : say your address is , and you want to automatically label all work e-mails .
Add a plus sign and a phrase to make itand set up a filter to label it ( to access your filters go toand create a filter for messages addressed to .
Then add the label ) .
More real world examples : :
Be sure to use plus - addressing for every form you fill out online and give each site a different plus address .
Example :
You could usefor nytimes.comfor freestuff.com
Then you can tell which site has given your e-mail address to spammers , and automatically send them to the trash . : I 've talked about that above . :
If you receive periodic updates about your bank account balance or are subscribed to a lot of mailing lists that you do n't check often , then you can send that sort of mail to the archives and bypass your Inbox .
Example :
For the mailing list , you could giveas your address , and assign a filter that will archive mail to that address automatically .
Then you can just check in once in a while on the archive if you want to catch up . :
Several commentors have indicated that this is not a Gmail specific trick .
kl says Fastmail has enabled this feature as well .
caliban10 reports that a lot of sites reject addresses with a plus sign .
You might use other services like Mailinator for disposable addresses instead .
pbinder recommends using services like SpamGourmet , which redirects mail to your real address .

Turkey 's date with destiny , October 3 - the same day , coincidentally , that Germany was reunited in 1990 - was set last year when the then 15 - member EU was finalising its historic 10 - country enlargement .
It has been a very long time coming : Turkey has been a stalwart member of Nato since 1952 and was first recognised as a potential member of the European club as long ago as 1963 , only a few years after the creation of the EEC .
Britain is a keen advocate of its EU membership , as is the US .
Both see the secular Muslim democracy as a key regional ally , a beacon for Islamic and Arab countries and proof that a " clash of civilisations " with the west is not inevitable .
But mounting anti-Turkish feeling in several European countries and last summer 's shock rejections of the new EU constitution in France and the Netherlands - part of a wider political and economic malaise - have created grave doubts .
Hence this week 's alarm call by Jack Straw , Britain 's foreign secretary , who is now in the hot seat of the EU 's rotating presidency , that it is vital to stick to the October 3 start date even if , as is widely expected , the actual negotiations drag on for many years .
The immediate problem is the vexed question of Cyprus , one of last May 's new entrants .
The hope had been that a long - standing UN drive to reunite the divided island would bear fruit before it joined .
But since it did not ( though more because of the Greek than the Turkish side ) and because Ankara is refusing to recognise the Nicosia government ( which for the EU legally represents the entire country ) , the launch of accession talks is in jeopardy .
Recognition is extremely difficult because without a comprehensive peace settlement it would undermine Turkey 's own 30 - year military presence and the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .
But by flaunting its position at this highly delicate moment , Turkey has given ammunition to its enemies .
Chief amongst these is France , where polls show much of the anti-Turkish prejudice expressed by the former president and author of the constitution , Valery Giscard d'Estaing , whose circumlocutions about " cultural differences " are only slightly less offensive than the cruder view of another clever Frenchman , Voltaire : the 18th - century thinker called the Turks " a reminder to Christians to atone for their sins " .
But there is an even bigger obstacle looming in Germany - assuming Angela Merkel 's centre - right CDU wins this month 's election :
Ms Merkel wants Turkey - which supplied so many of the gastarbeiter who created the German economic miracle of the 1960s - to be offered only a " privileged partnership " , not the full membership that has awaited all other candidates , from Estonia to Bulgaria , at the end of their negotiations .
Another key opponent is Austria , where it sometimes seems that Ottoman janissaries are still besieging Vienna as they did back in the 17th century .
Its chancellor , Wolfgang Schussel , also favours a halfway house and " open-ended " negotiations for the Turks .
The problem is that offering something different only for Turkey would appear to prove the resentful charge that the EU is a " Christian club " and risk a dangerous anti-European , and perhaps fundamentalist , backlash .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Turkish prime minister , has warned that he will " walk away for good " if the talks do not go ahead on schedule .
If they do start on time , it will be a very big deal indeed : no country that has begun negotiations on joining the EU has failed eventually to make the grade .
Although actual membership could be 10 or 15 years away , by then there will be more than 80 million Turks , probably outnumbering Germans .
And with voting power tied to population size , Ankara will be as important a player as Berlin , Paris and London - a key reason for the mounting opposition .
Another is the fear of large numbers of poor Turkish migrant workers flooding western European labour markets , though restrictions could be imposed for a transition period .
Turkey and its supporters are understandably worried , though they have a strong case when they argue that the magnet of EU membership has already generated huge advances under Mr Erdogan 's conservative , moderate Islamist government .
The country 's old Midnight Express image has faded and torture has been banned .
There are now Kurdish language broadcasts , and the grip of the powerful military , keepers of the Ataturk flame , has been weakened .
The economy is in good shape after years of crisis and inflation under the generals .
It is an increasingly attractive market for foreign investment .
Not everything is perfect .
Implementation of some new laws has been patchy , and some worry about minority rights .
Until recently there was greater openness on the ever - neuralgic question of the Armenian genocide of the first world war .
That , however , has faded , and there is now embarrassment about the case of the internationally renowned novelist Orhan Pamuk , facing charges of " belittling Turkishness " over his brave comments about that dark period .
Hectic diplomacy is likely across Europe over the coming days , perhaps going down to the wire on the eve of October 3 .
There will be brinkmanship and haggling over the precise terms of the negotiations , and attempts to square the circle of Ankara 's non-recognition of Cyprus .
Obscure and complex it may all be , but the stakes are very high .
As Abdullah Gul , the Turkish foreign minister , put it : " The last 100 metres of the marathon should be run very carefully . "
Now all that he needed to identify undecidable problems was a method for predicting in advance which programs would get stuck in infinite loops .
But that would require examining them with another program , and how would you know that it would n't get stuck without vetting it with a third program , ad infinitum ?
Like a novel about a novelist writing a novel , the dream of mathematical infallibility went spinning down the rabbit hole .
In " The Man Who Knew Too Much , " Leavitt is faced with the task of giving a new shine to a life that has been scrutinized several times before .
Turing 's mother , Sara , wrote her own account shortly after his death , and in 1983 Andrew Hodges provided the definitive biography , with " Alan Turing : The Enigma . "
Inspired by Hodges , Hugh Whitemore turned the story into a play , " Breaking the Code , " with Derek Jacobi in the starring role .
What made Turing 's story compelling enough for Broadway happened after his groundbreaking work at Cambridge .
Hooked on the idea of mechanical problem - solvers , he helped design the machinery that deciphered the Germans ' battle - front communications , an important factor in the Allied victory .
After the war he helped develop the first modern digital computers and made his mark as a leading advocate of the notion that the brain is a computer and machines can think .
A solitary , introspective man , he was quietly working at the University of Manchester when he was arrested for being a homosexual and forced to undergo a hormonal " cure . "
Two years later he was found dead with that apple , an apparent suicide committed by a man who had had a thing for Snow White .
Bringing the talents of a celebrated gay novelist like Leavitt to Turing 's sad tale would strike any editor as a promising combination -- a way to introduce this important thinker to a wider world .
I was never able to get all the way through Hodges 's formidable account , but " The Man Who Knew Too Much " can be read in a few afternoons .
While the book is a skillful , literate compression , as I made my way toward the end I never felt that Leavitt succeeded in inhabiting the story , making the fantastic world of Turing as captivating as that of the fictional Jonah Boyd .
The author certainly can't be accused of shirking the mathematics .
Turing 's proof and his work on cryptanalysis are described at an impressively fine grain -- so fine that I sometimes wished Leavitt would step back and switch to a wide - angle lens .
It 's so easy to get lost in the thicket .

I love the words Page Six used to describe Orlando " snacking " on Claire Danes .
Even though we just reported that his long time on and off girlfriend Kate Bosworth said all is going well between the two , we have heard Orlando gets very flirtatious when Kate 's not around .
He was seen getting cozy with Sienna Miller , Kirsten Dunst and now Claire Danes .
Page Six reports :
ORLANDO Bloom snacked on Claire Danes ' lovely neck during a dirty dancing session on Saturday night .
The hookup happened on the dance floor at the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation party at the Althorp ( Earl Spencer 's ) estate in Northamptonshire , England .
We 're told the " Lord of the Rings " hunk made his move after boogeying over to Danes during a performance by the Black Eyed Peas .
" He was kissing her neck and grinding against her , " reports our snitch .
" He did n't seem to care who saw it . "
We hope this story is exaggerated since Orlando and Kate seemed to look so cute together less than 2 weeks ago in London .
Besides , Claire was n't looking her best at the event .
I 'm usually a fan of hers and her style , but what 's with that dress ?
Oh yeah , and her boyfriend Billy Crudup would probably be upset to hear about Orlando snacking on his woman .

UNIX web hosting refers to the hosting services and system architectures provided on UNIX platform to open source companies .
Hosting means a service offered by company to allocate some disk space to physically place all website related information on a server to enduringly stay in the internet .
UNIX web hosting is an operating system which has the capability of providing a user website with security which cannot be penetrated by any means .
UNIX hosting is entirely compatible with the latest craze among all the programming languages , PHP .
UNIX hosting provides reliability and has very easy usage , with quicker problem solving capabilities .
UNIX is one of the most famous operating systems next to Windows and Apple ’s Macintosh .
UNIX web hosting has several advantages in comparison to Windows hosting , but at the same time there are certain downsides to it , as well .
UNIX was developed during the 1970s , at AT&T 's Bell Laboratories , and has greatly evolved in due course of time .
Free BSD and OpenBSD are the two most popular flavors of UNIX environment .
Both these versions are highly stable and secure .
OpenBSD boasts of being the most secure open source operating systems throughout the world .
Above all , it is free and maintenance cost of the web servers running on UNIX environment is also on the lower side .
UNIX offers support to all the common scripting languages like Shell , C/C++ , Python , Perl , PHP and Java .
However , these days the latest web servers developed on UNIX environment also offer support to Ruby - on - Rails and all other technological developments .
As far as database support is concerned , the popular UNIX hosting providers usually support MS SQL and MySQL databases .
However , the UNIX web hosting service providers may not support all the databases .
Therefore , it is important that you enquire about this aspect and pick a web host that support the database you intend to use .
The most important aspects to be kept in mind which selecting UNIX web hosting services and which have enormous impact on by UNIX operating system are :
Performance Price Stability Features
Due to the benefits particularly in these four areas , UNIX web hosting is the mostly opted by many users around the world .
However , Windows is trying to bridge the gap between the services provided by both the web hosting service providers .
A good UNIX web hosting provider must ensure that the customers get all the necessary resources and a good control panel to manage their website with great ease .
A good UNIX web host will never let you make out that you ’re making use of UNIX hosting , while the poor hosts do n’t give enough resources , thereby causing discontentment amongst the users .
Ideally a UNIX web hosting plan must include all the features offered by a shared Windows web hosting plan , and there must never be any difference between UNIX website hosting and Windows hosting plan .
One will always get the added advantage in terms of pricing , if you pick UNIX web hosting services , and the reliability and flexibility of the web server hosted on UNIX platform is always higher .
Therefore , if you do n’t have any business requirements that can be exclusively accomplished only on UNIX hosting environment , UNIX hosting can be a better bet .
Moreover , if you happen to be a developer , UNIX hosting environment will give you the choice of making changes to the codes and also getting complete access to the root level of the web server .
Last but definitely not the least , Windows hosting can’t match the offerings of UNIX hosting environment , while vice - versa does n’t hold true in majority of the cases .
Hence , this gives an unfair advantage to UNIX hosting over Windows hosting environment .
Imagine that you have an oil well that contains enough oil to supply annually three times the amount you would ever want to use in a year .
Suppose that one of your main current uses of oil is to generate electric power for your ranch .
Would you want to buy electric power from someone else , power that is generated by burning some other fuel , or , possibly , made by a nuclear reactor ?
It ’s a trick question .
You ca n’t answer it without comparing two crucial numbers : the cost of the oil you use to generate power and the price you would pay for the alternate form of electricity .
If , for example , the cost to you of generating your own power were 7 cents per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) and the cost to you of buying electric power were 9 cents per kWh , then , all other things equal , you would want to make your own .
If , on the other hand , these numbers were reversed , then , all other things equal , you would want to buy your electric power .
But why not use your own ?
Why buy it from someone else ?
The answer is : opportunity cost .
The opportunity cost of the oil you use is the value of the highest - valued alternate use of the oil .
Even though you could use the oil yourself , you also could choose to sell it .
And if you could get a high enough price for it , then it might well be cheaper for you to sell the oil and buy electric power made from some other fuel .
Many people , when they hear the term “ opportunity cost , ” think of a concept that they learned in an economics class years ago but did n’t think mattered much .
In fact , “ opportunity cost ” is a powerful concept in economics that can explain a lot of behavior we see around us  from why high - income people almost never use the bus ( due to the high opportunity cost of their time , which actually makes the bus very expensive relative to airplanes ) to why hotel rooms in Manhattan are so much smaller than rooms in Houston ( due to the high opportunity cost of land in Manhattan compared to Houston . )
In fact , the concept of opportunity cost is so powerful that it leads to an alternate explanation of the behavior of Iran ’s government in recent years .
When the Iranian government announces that it wants uranium enrichment in order to have nuclear power , many people scoff at the idea .
“ Why , ” they say , “ would the Iranians want nuclear power ?
Look at all the oil they have . ”
Here ’s the way the U.S. Joint Economic Committee put it in the opening sentence of a March 2006 report [ .pdf ] :
“ Iran ’s vast oil and gas resources undermine the Iranian regime ’s claim that its nuclear program is needed for domestic energy generation . ”
But these oil and gas resources do n’t undermine the regime ’s claim at all , as the concept of opportunity cost makes clear .
Now it ’s possible that the Iranian government is lying : it is , after all , a government , and governments around the world often tell lies .
But it ’s also possible that the Iranian government is telling the truth .
And opportunity cost is the relevant concept that helps us see how .
Just as in the example above , Iran may find its oil less valuable in generating power than in selling on the world market .
The numbers for Iran are similar to the hypothetical numbers I gave above .
In 2005 , Iran produced 4.2 million barrels per day and exported two - thirds of its barrels , or 2.7 million barrels per day .
That Iran would want to consider exporting even more is especially easy to understand when you consider that world oil prices this year have averaged more than $ 60 a barrel , which is , adjusted for inflation , about double the world price as recently as 2003 .
Iran ’s opportunity cost for oil has risen .
None of this is to justify the Iranian government ’s building nuclear power plants for peaceful uses .
Socialism in the energy industry is a bad idea whether practiced by the U.S. government , the Russian government , or the Iranian government .
But the above reasoning can explain why the Iranian government might want to produce nuclear power for peaceful uses .
Again , I emphasize that I do n’t know enough about the situation to know what the Iranian government ’s motive is for wanting to go more nuclear .
But my point is a narrower one : you ca n’t simply , as the U.S. Joint Economic Committee did , observe two facts  that the Iranian government wants more nuclear production and that Iran is a net exporter of oil to the world  and conclude that , of course , Iran ’s goal is to have nuclear weapons .
The concept of opportunity cost explains why .

Hollywood , where the star system was invented , is not wholly dependent on celebrities : the list of biggest - grossing movies in history is dominated by movies like “ Shrek 2 , ” “ ET : The Extra - Terrestrial ” and the “ Star Wars ” series , which were not star - driven .
But the industry still places an enormous importance on superstar power based on a straightforward fact :
On average , movies that have big names starring in them make more money at the box office than movies that do not .
Movie industry specialists argue that , in the complicated world of Hollywood economics , stars bring many different kinds of benefits .
They are easier to market , they help sell more tickets at home and overseas and they help drive home - video sales , which are a bigger and bigger slice of studio revenue .
“ If the stars ’ job is to increase output , by drawing crowds into the theaters or selling DVD ’s , it is not working as well as it had worked in the past , ” said Harold L. Vogel , author of a book called “ Entertainment Industry Economics : A Guide for Financial Analysis . ”
But , he added : “ This is a hiatus .
We have gone through 25 years where new distribution for films — videocassettes , cable and DVD ’s — added new revenue potential .
That meant less resistance to stars ’ salary demands . ”
Even studio chiefs will acknowledge that a star does not guarantee success .
“ Bewitched , ” starring Nicole Kidman , cost an estimated $ 85 million and had taken in only about $ 62 million at the American box office by late 2005 .
Yet there is a bedrock belief that the winning formula consists of the right star in the right movie .
“ If you pay a star a great deal of money for a film that people do n’t want to see , then it wo n’t work , ” said Sidney Sheinberg , the former president of MCA Universal .
“ It is always a question of whether you are dealing with a project that is enhanced by a star or are you dealing with a project where you are looking for the star to make it happen , and sometimes it works and sometimes it does n’t . ”
Anita Elberse , an associate professor at the Harvard Business School , tried to measure the average effect of a star by analyzing casting announcements on the price of stocks on the Hollywood Exchange ( www.hsx.com), a simulated market where hundreds of thousands of users trade stocks in individual movies based on their expected box - office revenue .
Prices on this exchange have been found to be fairly good predictors of a film ’s box - office success .
Ms. Elberse found , for instance , that the announcement in 2002 that Mr. Cruise had dropped out of “ Cold Mountain ” — he had been expected to play the lead — reduced the movie ’s expected gross by $ 10 million .
The announcement that Mr. Cruise was in talks to play a leading role in “ The Last Samurai ” lifted the movie ’s expected gross by $ 28 million .
Combing through 12,000 casting announcements between November of 2001 and December of 2004 , related to 600 movie stars and 500 movies , Ms. Elberse found stars , on average , were worth $ 3 million in theatrical revenue .
Last week , I was contacted by a small company that I 'll call Unlocko .
Unlocko sells software that " unlocks " mobile phones so owners can select different cellular providers on the same handset .
The company had received a cease - and - desist letter from a large mobile phone provider , which I 'll call CellPhoneCo .
Like most U.S. cellular providers , CellPhoneCo electronically locks the handsets it sells so the phones can only be used with CellPhoneCo 's service .
CellPhoneCo claims that the sale of unlocking software is illegal .
The financial motive behind this claim is obvious .
Companies have been using the razor blade business model to guarantee a steady stream of revenue ever since , well , the razor blade .
Cell phone companies sell you a phone at a discount , and then make up the difference by requiring you to sign a multi - year contract promising to pay monthly fees for mobile phone service or to fork over a hefty termination penalty if you break the deal .
But many customers , particularly those who travel internationally , want more choice .
They may be perfectly happy paying their service provider the usual monthly fee to use their GSM phone in the United States , but in Europe they want to use the same phone with a European carrier that wo n't charge for roaming or long distance .
Or they might find that their usual carrier does n't have reliable service at their summer house , and they want to use a different provider while vacationing .
Or customers might want to take the same phone to a different carrier after their service contract ends .
As a result , a burgeoning market has developed for unlocking software that allows customers to modify their phones to accept signals from the service provider of their choice .
Here , CellPhoneCo is making a novel argument : that it can stop a business with which it has no contractual relationship from selling software that customers might use for these purposes .
Does CellPhoneCo have a legal right to squelch unlocking software ?
To lock out the unlockers , CellPhoneCo is turning to a provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act intended to prevent people from disabling technology that protects games , songs and movies from illegal duplication .
The DMCA says that you can't distribute tools that break – or circumvent – technological measures that control access to copyright works .
But CellPhoneCo is n't asserting that Unlocko's program copies any copyright - protected software or content .
Its claim is more subtle .
Unlocko's software reprograms your mobile phone so it bypasses the " secret handshake " CellPhoneCo's locking software requires before the phone will operate .
After " circumventing " the handshake requirement , the phone – like virtually any modern piece of electronics – runs software installed on its internal chip .
Therefore , CellPhoneCo claims , Unlocko's program unlawfully circumvents a technological measure controlling access to the phone 's copyright - protected software .
But other resourceful manufacturers have tried similar tactics to lock customers into aftermarket goods and services , and failed in the end .
For example , printer company Lexmark wanted its customers to buy its brand name refill cartridges instead of cheaper generic ones .
It programmed the printer software to require a " secret handshake " from the cartridge before it would operate .
When competitors figured out how to make their cartridges work in Lexmark printers regardless , the company sued , claiming that the competitors violated the DMCA because software on the generic cartridge chip was circumventing the secret handshake and accessing the copyright - protected software in the printer .
In the trial court , Lexmark won , perhaps inspiring the Chamberlain Group , a garage door company , to file a similar case against a competitor that sold universal garage door openers .
In that case , however , the trial court rejected ( .pdf ) Chamberlain 's DMCA argument .
The court decided that Chamberlain had no legal right to control how its customers open their own garage doors .
This view probably influenced the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , which reviewed the Lexmark decision , because it later reversed ( . pdf ) the trial court , explaining that printer owners had an unfettered right to run software installed on their printers .
A court should view CellPhoneCo's DMCA argument the same way .
It 's true that by tying customers into CellPhoneCo 's service , the company can provide cheaper phones .
But CellPhoneCo is legally entitled to receive its expected future revenue under its service contract with the customer , regardless of what service the customer uses .
Meanwhile , customer choice means mobile users can select the best service now , while breeding competition that will improve both price and quality for all users .
Most importantly , CellPhoneCo should n't be able to stop Unlocko , a company with which it has no contractual relationship , from making a product that fosters consumer choice and competition .
In the physical world , we instinctively understand that the law does n't forbid you from installing generic parts in your Honda , and that the Maytag repairman is n't the only person allowed to service your washing machine .
CellPhoneCo hopes to use the law to create an unbreakable bond between selling phones and selling wireless service .
If courts protect anti-competitive business practices , customers wo n't simply be making contractual promises not to buy from other vendors – other vendors wo n't even exist .
We literally wo n't know what we 're missing .

Writing software on a consulting basis can often be a losing proposition for developers or clients or both .
There are too many things that can go wrong , and that ultimately translates into loss of time and money .
The “ 15 % rule ” we ’ve come up with is intended to create a win - win situation for both parties ( or at least make it fair for everyone ) .
Clients generally get what they want , and development shops make a fair profit .
It ’s not a perfect solution , but so far it seems to be working for us .
This may come as a surprise to some , but we make very little money selling software licenses .
The vast majority of our revenue comes through consulting services –writing code for hire .
Having now done this for several years , we ’ve learned some hard lessons .
On a few projects the lessons were so hard we actually lost money .
A few months ago I put together somewhat of a manifesto - type document intended to address the difficulties we ’ve faced in developing software for clients .
I ’m pleased to say that it ’s made a noticeable difference so far for us .
My hope is that this blog entry will be read by others who develop software on a consulting basis , so that they can learn these lessons the easy way rather than the way we learned them .
What follows in this article is a summary of one of the main principles we now follow in developing software –the 15 % rule .
If you ’d like , you ’re welcome to read the full “ Our Approach to Software Development ” document .
For the impatient , the 15 % rule goes like this …
Before undertaking a development project we create a statement of work ( which acts as a contract and a specification ) that outlines what we ’ll do , how many hours it will require , and how much it will cost the client .
As part of the contract we commit to invest up to the amount of time outlined in the document plus 15 % .
That is , if the statement of work says that the project will take us 100 hours to complete , we ’ll spend up to 115 hours ( but no more ) .
As to where - fores and why - tos on how this works , read on .
Those that have developed software for hire know that the end product almost never ends up exactly as the client had pictured .
There are invariably tweaks that will need to be made ( that may or may not have been discussed up front ) in order to get the thing to at least resemble what the client has in mind .
And , yes , this can happen even if you spend hours upon hours fine tuning the specification to reflect the client ’s wishes .
Additionally , technical issues can crop up that were n’t anticipated by the programming team .
In theory , the better the programming team the less likely this should be , but it does n’t always end up that way ( Microsoft ’s Vista operating system is a sterling example ) .
These two factors , among others , equate to the risk that is inherent in the project .
Something is n’t going to go right , and that will almost always mean someone pays or loses more money than originally anticipated .
The question is , who should be responsible to account for those extra dollars ?
Up until relatively recently , we would shoulder almost all of the risk in our projects .
If the app did n’t do what the client had in mind , or if unforeseen technical issues cropped up , it generally came out of our pockets .
For the most part it was n’t a huge problem , but always seemed to have at least some effect ( the extreme cases obviously being when we lost money on a project ) .
This seems kind of unfair , does n’t it ?
The risk inherent to the project is n’t necessarily the fault of either party .
It ’s just there .
We did n’t put it there , and neither did the client .
As such , it should n’t be the case that one party shoulders it all .
That ’s where the 15 % rule comes in .
The 15 % rule allows both parties to share the risk .
By following this rule , we ’re acknowledging that something probably wo n’t go as either party intended , so we need a buffer to handle the stuff that spills over .
By capping it at a specific amount , though , we ’re also ensuring that the buffer is n’t so big that it devours the profits of the developers .
For the most part , the clients with whom we ’ve used the 15 % rule are just fine with it .
It is a pretty reasonable arrangement , after all .
We have had the occasional party that squirms and wiggles about it , but , in the end , they ’ve gone along with it and I think everyone has benefited as a result .

Cops employed by the town of Hudson , Ohio are harassing drivers at " sobriety checkpoints " throughout the county this summer rather than confining themselves to their own jurisdiction .
Sgt. John Lowman modestly brushed aside such ambitious tyranny : " We have a really good town [ here in Hudson ] — good resources , " he told the Akron Beacon Journal .
" It ’s nice to be able to use those resources to help out the rest of the county . "
Nice try , Sarge .
You can imply all you like that this anti-Constitutional fascism helps the serfs of Summit County , but your victims know better .
What you really mean is that you ’re aiding and abetting the county ’s various governments as they steal more of our money and freedom .
The cops perpetrate this theft via old - fashioned highway robbery .
They set up roadblocks that detain all drivers unlucky enough to have chosen said route .
The Beacon Journal explains : " Officers stand in line between cones on the road and approach each motorist ’s window .
Officers check the motorist ’s license , seat - belt use and possibility of drug or alcohol impairment .
If a problem is suspected the officer can send the motorist to the diversion area .
Otherwise , the driver is permitted to leave . "
" Permitted to leave . "
Wow .
These checkpoints are n’t " popular with the public , " Lowman " acknowledged " to the Beacon , " but he believes they are necessary . "
Indeed .
They condition formerly free Americans to bow and scrape in the hopes that the government ’s bully boys release them to continue peacefully about their business .
And despite snagging only 7 " drunk " drivers over three nights , the checkpoints replenish Leviathan ’s coffers because they enable cops to catch and fine folks with unfastened seatbelts and expired licenses .
( Lowman claims the take is " very minimal . "
We have only his word on this : stats on the loot from the last two categories are n’t available .
Naturally .
If they were , they might prove that " protecting " us from " dangerous " drivers is just another excuse for fleecing the sheeple . )
And it ’s discounted cash , too : Hudson ’s totalitarianism was funded in part by a federal grant of $ 130,000 in 2004 and another " $ 150,000 for education , overtime pay and the checkpoints " in 2005 .
Nationwide , " almost 3000 police agencies — including 821 in Ohio — are involved . "
A cynic might conclude that cops love overtime pay almost as much as donuts .
I hope we all agree that checkpoints are a hallmark of police states , whether the excuse offered is drunk drivers on the roads or terrorists at the airports .
So let ’s turn instead to Lowman ’s assertion that he and his fellow cops " help " us .
Nor is he alone : politicians , bureaucrats and even private do - gooders constantly prattle about " helping " us .
We ’ll even take it at face value .
We ’ll assume they actually believe that forcing us to behave as they think we should — and that stealing our money , imprisoning , or even killing us when we do n’t — " helps " us .
Why , then , does this notion grate ?
Perhaps because a free man wants to be served , not helped .
We " help " those who are inferior to us in some way by doing what we think best for them .
Parents help children , teachers supposedly help students , doctors help patients as much as the Feds and the American Medical Association ( AMA ) allow .
In each case , the more mature or better - informed person assesses the less mature or ignorant individual and does not what the inferior prefers but what the superior deems appropriate .
Sometimes the authority decides correctly .
But often he ’s wrong .
Serving , on the other hand , describes the interaction between two equals .
Entrepreneurs serve us .
So do spouses in a loving marriage .
The patronizing attitude , " I know best , and you ’ll do what I say , " is blessedly absent .
Instead , one actor attempts to discern the other ’s desire and then fulfills it without voicing judgement .
Acme Supermarket has n’t yet tried to stop me from piling my cart with Double - Stuffed Oreos and Doritos .
Rather than haranguing me on trans - fat and healthy living , the cashier quickly scans my junk food , thanks me , and even bags everything for my convenience .
Her smiling service helps me far more than the checkpoints ’ arrogant cops ever could .
Christians ought to be especially sensitive to this distinction .
We are called to serve one another in love ( Gal. 5:13 ) .
In Almighty God alone do we find a " very present help " ( Ps. 46:1 ) .
It is meet and right that we do : " For as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are My ways higher than your ways , and My thoughts than your thoughts . "
( Is. 55:9 ) Our infinitely superior Creator helps us , something we fallen human beings cannot do for each other .
We can merely serve .
Unless we work for Leviathan , of course .
The beast ’s tin badges apparently confer divine powers .

· Doubts remain until more tests can be carried out · Millions could benefit if recovery can be explained
A man who claims to be the first in the world whose immune system has been able to beat the HIV virus was facing mounting pressure yesterday to submit to further vital medical tests .
Health experts ,
Aids campaigners and gay rights activists urged Andrew Stimpson to come forward following claims that he has been able to rid his body of the virus after taking little more than vitamins .
Activists say that if the claims are true , the phenomenon could potentially bring countless benefits to millions of people infected with HIV .
There are more than 53,000 in the UK alone .
Mr Stimpson , 25 , twice tested positive at the Victoria Clinic for Sexual Health in west London in August 2002 .
A test 14 months later appeared to be negative .
But the heath trust concerned , Chelsea and Westminster , yesterday said Mr Stimpson had so far " declined " to undergo further tests .
It is understood that he was first asked to do so immediately after last year 's negative test result .
A spokeswoman said : " I can confirm that he has a positive and a negative test .
I can't confirm that he 's shaken it off , that he 's been cured .
We urge him , for the sake of himself and the HIV community , to come in and get tested .
Though Mr Stimpson insists he will " do anything I can " , associates said yesterday that he had gone away to rest and escape the media spotlight .
Campaigners are annoyed that having not yet undergone the vital tests , Mr Stimpson nevertheless signed contracts with the News of The World and the Mail on Sunday , both of which published his claims yesterday .
They also sounded a note of caution , noting that disclosures in his case arose not from medical research or peer review but from legal correspondence relating to an action Mr Stimpson was pursuing against the health trust .
He had feared the positive results might have been wrong and had sought compensation .
The trust 's contention that both sets of blood tests were accurate emerged as it tried to defend itself from litigation .
Mr Stimpson , who lives in London with his partner , who is HIV positive , said : " There are 34.9 million people with HIV globally and I am just one person who managed to control it , to survive from it and to get rid of it from my body .
For me that is unbelievable - it is a miracle .
I think I 'm one of the luckiest people alive .
" I was just taking daily supplements to keep myself as healthy as possible so as not to get full - blown Aids . "
But Annabel Kanabus , director of the Aids charity , Avert , said he must match words with deeds .
" He must come forward .
Organisations such as ours will be inundated this week .
There is enough confusion surrounding the issue of HIV .
We do n't need any more . "
She said the sequence of events is troubling .
" He was told in October that he would not be paid by the trust so he goes to the newspapers .
I think he should have gone straight to his doctors . "
Peter Tatchell , of the campaign group Outrage , said Mr Stimpson must " cooperate with the medical authorities for the greater benefit of everyone who has HIV " .
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National Aids Trust , added : " Without further tests it is impossible to draw any conclusions for people living with HIV .
The virus is extremely complex and there are many unknowns about how it operates and how people 's bodies react to it . "
Mr Stimpson , who works in a sandwich bar , moved to London four years ago from Largs in Ayrshire .
He took as confirmation of his cure a letter from the NHS Litigation Authority .
Edwina Azimi , the authority 's case manager , is reported to have denied any false diagnosis , hailing the results as " exceptional and medically remarkable " .
She said : " You have recovered from a positive antibody result to a negative result . "
She said there is " particular interest in these rare circumstances " .
Whether doctors formally referred the matter to the Health Protection Agency , which monitors the spread of infection throughout the UK , is unclear .
Such a referral would be expected to take place in a case of such apparent significance .
Experts stress the potential benefits a genuine case could have for the development of treatments and vaccines .
But they also warned that the complexities of HIV make any one of a number of scenarios possible in this case .
Tests usually indicate antibodies rather than the virus .
They are usually accurate but one of the number of tests he has undergone may have been wrong .
In any event a test for the virus itself is more conclusive .
Dr Patrick Dixon , founder of the international Aids agency ASET said a few people have immune systems capable of preventing HIV from becoming established .
" It would not be surprising if we find a tiny number of people who have the capability to destroy the infection .
It is possible this individual has something special about his genetic code . "
But he added : " The answer may turn out to be very complex .
We must not jump to conclusions . "
FAQ : HIV virus
Have there been any documented cases of people beating the HIV virus without medication ?
With previous claims of so - called miracle cures , questions have been raised over the testing process or inaccurate labelling of samples .
However , there are anomalies .
In Kenya , tests on prostitutes showed that their " T cells " , which help produce antibodies to HIV , had been exposed to the virus .
Yet there was no evidence of HIV in blood or antibody tests
How widespread is HIV ?
Up to 5 m cases are being diagnosed around the world each year .
It is estimated that 53,000 people are living with HIV in Britain , and a third of them are yet to be diagnosed
How are people tested ?
Initial blood tests err on the side of caution to ensure infected people are not " missed " .
There are occasionally false positives .
First and follow - up tests to confirm diagnosis look for antibodies to HIV , which provide evidence that the body is fighting the virus .
A third batch of tests help doctors gauge how far the infection has advanced
How are people treated ?
Usually using a combination of antiretroviral drugs , although there is growing concern about the virus adapting to resist them

Seymour Hersh , writing in the New Yorker in the past few months , claims that hawks in the Pentagon believe that a taste of shock and awe would divide the secularists and reformers from the theocrats in Iran and that would inevitably lead to a collapse of the Iranian regime , and democracy will flourish .
Former presidential security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , on the other hand , predicts that an attack would rally the Iranians behind the Islamic republic and inevitably increase the anti-American mood in the region and beyond .
Brzezinski told the Washington Post : " I think of war with Iran as the ending of America 's present role in the world .
Iraq may have been a preview of that , but it 's still redeemable if we get out fast .
In a war with Iran , we 'll get dragged down for 20 or 30 years .
The world will condemn us . "
No doubt Australia wo n't .
Going on our record , we can pretty much guarantee that , at the very least , we will be cheering the Americans on as they lay into the Iranian branch of the axis of evil .
And , " all the way " , in the case of Iran , is going to be gruesome .
Christopher de Bellaigue , a Briton who lives in Tehran , points out , writing for Harpers magazine , that the Tehran Research Reactor , the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre , the Nuclear Research Centre for Agriculture and Medicine in Karaj and the sole , almost completed nuclear reactor are all in or near cities .
He says that an attack on these sites by some coalition of the willing would not divide the people from their theocratic rulers , but would drive them closer together .
Any attack will not be seen as an attack on the regime , but as an assault on the nation because Iran , unlike Iraq , is a real nation with thousands of years of history in its consciousness .
While an Iranian bomb is not imminent , an American presidential election is .
Hersh quotes a former intelligence official as saying that the Bush Administration sees the whole area — presumably from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan — as a huge war zone and the Administration and its neocon advisers and strategists believe that " this is the last hurrah — we 've got four years and want to come out of this saying that we won the war on terrorism " .
De Bellaigue reckons that the reform movement in Iran that glowed dimly during the presidency of Mohammed Khatami was flawed by the timidity of its leaders and followers .
And , when George Bush made his axis of evil speech and invaded Iraq , it gave the mullahs all the excuse they needed for cracking down on the democrats .
De Bellaigue believes that any further threats against Iran will see dissenters " smashed with an iron fist " .
John Howard says that the war on terrorism will go on for another generation at least .
If we join in an invasion of Iran , we may assume that he is being optimistic .

As if shopping for new flat - panel , high - definition television is not hard enough , Mitsubishi is scheduled to announce this week that it has developed commercial television that uses colored lasers to display bright , deep images on large , thin , lightweight screens -- surpassing images seen on film .
The television sets , which Mitsubishi is calling the first of their kind , are expected to reach stores sometime late next year .
At the heart of the first generation of this new television is an existing rear - projection technology called digital light processing .
In the past , this technology , developed by Texas Instruments , used white - light mercury lamps as the television 's light source .
With laser television , separate red , green and blue lasers are used in conjunction with an HDTV chip , said Frank DeMartin , vice president for marketing and product development at Mitsubishi .
He and Mitsubishi engineers said this provided a new look in large - screen units , signaling a move to lighter , slimmer profiles for rear - projection television .
In terms of performance , Mr. DeMartin said , laser television promises a greater range and intensity of colors .
He said the new sets would be made with compact , sculptured cabinets and remain relatively light because the screens would be advanced plastics rather than the glass common in plasma television flat - panel units .
The screens will be so lightweight that the need for frames will be significantly lessened , Mr. DeMartin added .
This will give the television a cleaner , practically all - screen look .
Variadic Templates for GCC

November 1 , 2006 : Version 1.5 of the variadic templates implementation in GCC is now available for download .
This version introduces several bug fixes , new features , and one syntax change , including :
The syntax for determining the length of a parameter pack has changed .
Instead of sizeof ( Args ... ) we now use sizeof ... ( Args ) , which should be less confusing .
One can now expand parameter packs in base classes and initializers of those base classes , e.g. , template struct myclass : public Mixins ... { myclass ( const Mixins& ... mixins ) : Mixins ( mixins ) ... { } } ;
One can now expand parameter packs in a throw specifier .
One can now expand parameter packs in initializer list . , e.g. , template void foo ( const Values& ... values ) { boost : : any array [ sizeof ... ( Values ) ] = { values ... } ; // ... }
: Version 1.5 of the variadic templates implementation in GCC is now available for download .
This version introduces several bug fixes , new features , and one syntax change , including :
Introduction
Variadic templates allow a C++ template to accept an arbitrary number of " extra " template arguments .
When used with class templates , we can write templates like tuple ( a generalized pair ) , or arbitrary - level compile - time vectors for template metaprogramming .
Variadic templates also work in conjunction with function templates , so that function templates can take an arbitrary number of function arguments .
In this sense , variadic templates provide the same capabilities as C's variadic functions , but in a type - safe manner .
For instance , one can implement a simple , type - safe printf with the following code :
void printf ( const char* s ) { while ( * s ) { if ( *s == ' % ' && *++s != '% ' ) throw std::runtime_error(" invalid format string : missing arguments " ) ; std::cout << *s++ ; } } template void printf ( const char* s , const T& value , const Args& ... args ) { while ( * s ) { if ( *s == ' % ' && *++s != '%' ) { std:: cout << value ; return printf ( ++s , args ... ) ; } std::cout << *s++ ; } throw std::runtime_error(" extra arguments provided to printf " ) ; }
Motivation
Variadic templates solve some serious limitations in current implementations of certain facilities of the C++ Library Extensions Technical Report ( TR1 ) .
The function object and tuple facilities , for instance , are only barely implementable in current C++.
The implementations are very repetitive , requiring the same code to be copied multiple times ( each copy supports a different number of arguments ) .
The need to compile all of these copies can actually be quite taxing .
The following chart shows compilation times for the GNU TR1 implementation as we increase the number of supported parameters from 1 to 40 .
With variadic templates , compilation takes less than a second , and supports any number of arguments .
The code is 50 k smaller , much clearer , and does not need to make use of any hideous preprocessor metaprogramming tricks .
Documentation
We hope that variadic templates will be included in the upcoming revision of the ISO C++ standard , dubbed C++0 x .
The following documents describe variadic templates in more detail .
We welcome your feedback !
Give the compiler a spin , or just read through the proposals and tell us what you think !

As well as screwdrivers , ingenious dental daredevils confessed to jamming knives , scissors and needles between their teeth , the BBC reports .
At the less lethal end of spectrum , people admitted to deploying keys , paper clips , matchsticks , earrings , nail files , pencils , cards , and forks to pick the bits from between their yellowing gnashers .
British Dental Health Foundation chief executive Dr Nigel Carter is the man with the unenviable task of educating Brits in the way of the floss .
He said : " A screwdriver is hardly the most flexible of items and I do n't think people realise the damage this could do to their gums .
" The idea of someone picking their teeth with a screwdriver may sound amusing for a moment but it is actually a big worry that so many people are happy to use whatever is closest to hand to remove food from between their teeth . "
A shocking 23 per cent of those surveyed eschewed any kind of food removal routine whatsoever , preferring to suffer rotting death breath to risking a case of " McGowan Mouth " by nipping out to the toolshed . ®
Seaside は Squeak上で動作する継続ベースの Webアプリケーションフレームワーク です。
WWW はステートレスな世界なので 、Webアプリケーションの作成には情報の永続化に関する悩みがつきものです。しかし継続( Continuation ) を使うことでプログラマ側にはステートフルな顔を見せる一方、クライアント側には相変わらずステートレスなアプリケーションの構築が可能です。
Seaside はプログラマにとって は HTTP リクエスト/レスポンス をいくら跨ろうと継続された処理を提供するので、Webアプリケーションの作成がコレまでの常識を覆すほどサクサクできます。
このシリーズは 、A Seaside tutorialさんを元に進めた、猫自身のチュートリアル・メモになります。
Seasideのインストール Seaside の日本語版を梅沢さんが作ってくれてます。
SeasideJ インストール済みイメージも配布されているのでこれを利用するのがお手軽です。
Hello world と表示してみる。 それでは、まず単純 に Hello , world と表示す る Webアプリケーションを作ってみましょう 。Seaside で Webアプリケーションを作るには、WAComponant のサブクラスを作るところから始めます。
WAComponent subclass : # HelloComponent instanceVariableNames : '' classVariableNames : '' poolDictionaries : '' category : ' MySeasideTutorial ' こうして作った WAComponent のサブクラスは VisualComponent になります。このコンポーネントは Seaside から #renderContentOn : メッセージが送られたときに引数で渡された
WAHtmlRenderer を使って 画面を表示する責務を持ちます。 この renderer を使うと 、XHTML で のレンダリングが可能ですが、今回はシンプルにプレーンテキストで
' Hello , world ' と表示するだけにしておきましょう。というわけで実装してみましょう。プレーンテキストのレンダリングには text : メッセージを送ります。 renderContentOn : html html text : ' Hello , world ' これ でHello , world コンポーネントは完成です。しかしまだ
、Seasideにアプリケーションとして登録されていません。登録には #registerAsApplication メッセージを使います 。Workspace で HelloComponent registerAsApplication : ' helloweb ' を実行しましょう。これで コンフィグペー ジ
http://localhost:9090/seaside/config
に helloweb というリンクが出来たハズです。ここをクリックすれば晴れてWebApplicationとしてHelloComponentが公開されたというわけです。
少しHTMLらしくする プレーンテキストでは何なので、すこしHTMLらしくしてみます。 HelloComponent >> #renderContentOn : メソッドをちょっと書き換えます。 renderContentOn : html html heading : ' Hello , World ' level : 1. html paragraph : 'よ うこそ！ この Hello , World は Squeak上の継続サーバ Seaside で作られています。 ' コードから想像されるそのまんまの通り、<h1>要素と < p >要素 がレンダリングされます。HTML要素をネストさせたいときは、ブロックを使います。例えば、
< h1 > Hello , World </ h1 > < p>ようこそ、Seaside の世界へ！ この Hello , World は < em > Squeak </ em > 上の継続サーバ < em > Seaside</em>で作られています。</p>
と言う HTML が欲しい時はこんな感じにします。 renderContentOn : html html heading : ' Hello , World ' level : 1. html paragraph : [ html text : 'よ うこそ！ この Hello , World は '. html emphasis : ' Squeak ' .
html text : ' 上の継続サーバ '. html emphasis : ' Seaside ' .
html text : ' で作られています。 ']
Larry Wall - Present Continuous , Future Perfect
Introduction - Where Perl Draws Ideas From
Good morning .
Many time I have shown this picture in many of my talks .
Perl derives from many sources , these are probably the four biggest ones .
You should not take this picture to mean that Linguistics is the opposite of common sense .
( laughter )
But there are many computer scientists who have complained that it should be more like engineering and less like an art and I disagree , but that 's OK .
But Perl also draws ideas from many other sciences - Ecology , Math , Sociology , etc. , etc. , etc .
I have given talks about those too , but I 'm not gonna do that today .
Also Joel 's ideas from the science of Golf .
The Biology of Perl ... there 's lots of different aspects of that , that Perl has borrowed metaphors from , which we could also talk about .
You can feel free to ask me about any of these things later .
And you know what the Harvard Law is .
That says that under controlled conditions of water , temperature , light , food - the organism will do as it damn well pleases ( laughter ) .
How Perl Entered the Unix Universe ( 2:06 )
Anyway , speaking of paleontology , I dug up this fossil .
It 's kind of a dinosaur egg .
And when Perl was first starting out this was how people saw the universe .
If you were a Unix programmer you either programmed in C or shell .
And there really was n't much in between .
There were these little languages that we used on top of shell , but that was the big divide .
The big revelation that hatched Perl , as it were , was that this opened up into a two - dimensional space .
And C was good at something I like to call manipulexity , that is the manipulation of complex things .
While shell was good at something else which I call whipuptitude , the aptitude for whipping things up .
So Perl was hatched .
As a small egg .
That was Perl 1 .
And it was designed from the very beginning to evolve .
The fact that we put sigils in front of the variables meant that the namespaces were protected from new keywords .
And that was intentional , so we could evolve the language fairly rapidly without impacting .
And it evolved ...
And it evolved ...
And finally we got to Perl 5 .
And ... So ... Perhaps the Perl 6 slogan should be " All Your Paradigms Are Belong To Us " .
We 'll get to that .
Why Perl Evolved As It Did ( 3:54 )
So we had these five successful organisms .
If you look at the Perl culture right now , it is very healthy , very vibrant ...
Lots of stuff going on .
Nobody can keep track of it all .
Why ?
Well , there are evolutionary reasons , psychological reasons , linguistic reasons , anthropological reasons , and , of course , sometimes there is just no good reason .
So I 'd like to start off with my own irrationalities .
I do n't think syntax should dangle in the wind .
I 'm with Aristotle .
I think things should have a beginning , a middle , and an end .
Which means I like K&R bracketing .
I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there , with no end .
I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction .
That 's because I dislike abstraction and I think I 'm ordinary .
( laughter ) I might be wrong about that , but I do n't know .
I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful .
You have to hold both of those .
Ugly things can be beautiful .
And beautiful can get ugly very fast .
You know , take Lisp .
You know , it 's the most beautiful language in the world .
At least up until Haskell came along .
( laughter )
But , you know , every program in Lisp is just ugly .
I do n't figure how that works .
I think visual metaphors are very important .
How it looks .
Different things should look different .
Similar things should look similar .
A language designer simultaneously has to care what other people think , and has to not care what other people think .
Otherwise you go crazy .
Well , crazier .
( laughter )
And finally , I think God has free will .
And therefore he created programmers with free will and that they ought to be given choices .
Irrationalities in Other Languages ( 5:54 )
Now , I 'm not the only language designer with irrationalities .
You can think of some languages to go with some of these things .
" We 've got to start over from scratch " - Well , that 's almost any academic language you find .
" English phrases " - We 'll that 's Cobol .
You know , cargo cult English .
( laughter )
" Text processing does n't matter much " - Fortran .
" Simple languages produce simple solutions " - C .
" If I wanted it fast , I 'd write it in C " - That 's almost a direct quote from the original awk page .
" I thought of a way to do it so it must be right " -
That 's obviously PHP .
( laughter and applause )
" You can build anything with NAND gates " - Any language designed by an electrical engineer .
( laughter )
" This is a very high level language , who cares about bits ? " -
The entire scope of fourth generation languages fell into this ... problem .
" Users care about elegance " - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall into this .
You know , Eiffel .
" The specification is good enough " - Ada .
" Abstraction equals usability " - Scheme .
Things like that .
" The common kernel should be as small as possible " - Forth .
" Let 's make this easy for the computer " - Lisp. ( laughter )
" Most programs are designed top - down " - Pascal . ( laughter )
" Everything is a vector " - APL .
" Everything is an object " - Smalltalk and its children .
( whispered : ) Ruby .
( laughter )
" Everything is a hypothesis " - Prolog . ( laughter )
" Everything is a function " - Haskell . ( laughter )
" Programmers should never have been given free will " - Obviously , Python . ( laughter )
So my psychological conjecture is that normal people , if they perceive that a computer language is forcing them to learn theory , they wo n't like it .
In other words , hide the fancy stuff .
It can be there , just hide it .
Linguistics ( 8:22 )
Going from psychology to linguistics , I think that Perl succeeds primarily because it does behave like a natural language .
Some of the things that underlying deep principles rather than cargo culting in phrases like Cobol did , we try to aim for deep principles of linguistics .
With a natural language you learn as you go .
You know , you learn it once and use it many times .
So , you should optimize for expressiveness and not for ease of learnability .
Learnability is OK , but expressiveness is more important .
Competence :
We do not expect a fifty year old to speak with the same level of confidence as a five year old .
And that 's OK .
You can talk baby talk .
There are multiple ways to say the same thing .
There is no shame in borrowing words .
Unless you 're French .
( laughter )
Back to dimensionality .
When you are saying something linguistically , it 's like taking a trip .
You know , when you take a trip from California to Netanya , you do n't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north .
It 's not orthogonal .
There are little bits at the beginning .
Then you take bigger hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end .
Language works the same way , it 's fractal .
There is little orthogonality .
At least apparently ; you can have orthogonal views of it , there are orthogonal subsets .
But there are multiple orthogonal subsets .
At first glance it just looks like a network , and you have to navigate the geography .
More natural language things , which we 'll probably skip over most of them , but they have corresponding things in Perl .
Natural language develops , without an overriding theory .
Your peers enforce your style .
The language does not enforce your style .
Design is distributed .
Dialects will diverge , so you should plan for it .
It 's useful to take things from multiple languages and jam them all into one language .
You may have noticed some of that in Perl .
And finally , a language without a culture is dead .
It 's not just an intellectual exercise to design a language .
You have to have the culture to go with it .
Which leads us to my anthropology ideas , which is that Perl culture is just as important as the language itself because the culture can fix the language but not vice versa .
Anthropology ( 11:10 )
Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe .
We allow people to have their own little fiefdoms , where they are the ruler and can beat up on their followers .
We try to let people share with each other .
We try to capture knowledge .
Both of those things are why we have the CPAN , Comprehensive Perl Archive Network , which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software in the world .
( laughter ) .
And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too .
We try to make Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that .
We 've always tried to hook up Perl with everything .
In kind of a humble sort of way .
And finally it 's culture of fun .
At least we try to make it that way .
And that 's why I give weird talks .
Other Sciences ( 12:14 )
What about the hard sciences ?
You know there is physics , especially quantum physics .
That 's pretty hard .
( laughter )
Chemistry might be a hard science if you think of it as physics .
And we are not so sure .
Golf is pretty hard though .
Now , I 've often shown this waterfall chart , and many of you have probably seen it .
If you turn it into a fractal feedback loop and if you run it the other direction , then you have extreme programming .
But the point is , you 're racing around like this , in a strange attractor of some sort or other .
But how do you know you 're done ?
You know , other than the tests tell you you 're done .
But are the tests right ?
Who knows ?
Well , we all who have studied sciences have seen these potential energy curves .
Now , if you 're an economist you turn this upside down and you have hill - climbing algorithms .
But it 's just the same thing .
The ball wants to roll downhill .
Are we optimal ?
No .
Is it optimal now ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
We could be in a false minimum .
Now , we 're happy where we are , but we do n't yet know that we might be happier over there .
It takes a certain amount of energy to climb over the hill and take a peek .
You can do it that way ( go over the peak ) , or you can find sneaky ways to get through ( tunnel through ) .
Arguably , this is the Parrot approach .
And this is the Pugs approach .
But however you get there , it 's the Promised Land .
I think you guys know something about the Promised Land . ( laughter ) .
You know , if you go back here , here is Jacob and Caleb wanting to sneak into the land , and here 's the Children of Israel wanting to spend forty years in the desert .
( laughter )
Hopefully we can get Perl 6 out in less than forty years .
( laughter )
But if that 's how long it takes , we 're still gonna get there .
Fan Mail ( 14:42 )
Q : " Dear Larry , I love Perl .
It has saved my company , my crew , my sanity and my marriage .
After Perl I can't imagine going back to any other language .
I dream in Perl , I tell everyone else about Perl .
How can you improve on perfection ?
Signed , Happy in Haifa . "
A : " Dear Happy , You need to recognize that Perl can be good in some dimensions and not so good in other dimensions .
You also need to recognize that there will be some pain in climbing over or tunneling through the barrier to the true minimum . "
Now Perl 5 has a few false minima .
Syntax , semantics , pragmatics , ( laughter ) , discourse structure , implementation , documentation , culture ...
Other than that Perl 5 is not too bad .
Q : " Dear Larry , You have often talked about the waterbed theory of linguistic complexity , and beauty times brains equals a constant .
Is n't it true that improving Perl in some areas will automatically make it worse in other areas ?
Signed , Terrified in Tel - Aviv . "
A : " Dear Terrified , ... No. " ( laughter )
You see , you can make some things so they are n't any worse .
For instance , we changed all the sigils to be more consistent , and they 're just the same length , they 're just different .
And you can make some things much better .
Instead of having to write all this gobbledygook to dereference references in Perl 5 you can just do it straight left to right in Perl 6 .
Or there 's even more shortcuts , so multidimensional arrays and constant hash subscripts get their own notation , so it 's even clearer , at least once you 've learned it .
Again , we 're optimizing for expressiveness , not necessarily learnability .
Q : " Dear Larry , I 've heard a disturbing rumor that Perl 6 is turning into Java , or Python , or ( whispered : ) Ruby , or something .
What 's the point of using Perl if it 's just another object - oriented language ?
Why are we changing the arrow operator to the dot operator ?
Signed , Nervous in Netanya . "
A : " Dear Nervous , First of all , we can do object orientation better without making other things worse .
As I said .
Now , we 're changing from arrow to dot , because ... because ...
Well , just ' cuz I said so ! "
You know , actually , we do have some good reasons - it 's shorter , it 's the industry standard , I wanted the arrow for something else , and I wanted the dot as a secondary sigil .
Now we can have it for attributes that have accessors .
I also wanted the unary dot for topical type calls , with an assumed object on the left and finally , because I said so .
Darn it .
Future Perfect ( 17:25 )
So , let 's go from the Present Contiunous , imperfect though it may be , to the Future Perfect , to at least Perfecter .
Now , when we started off this Perl 6 adventure , we announced - " The community is going to rewrite Perl 6 .
It 's gonna rewrite the language , the culture , the development , everything . "
So we opened it up , and I expected maybe twenty RFC 's for changes .
We got three hundred and sixty one .
And they were all over the map .
They contradicted each other , they had some really bogus solutions , and they all suffered from the same problem , which is : each of them assumed that this was the only change you are going to make to Perl 5 .
And otherwise everything else will be the same .
Well , that 's not how you do a redesign .
If you do a redesign that way , you end up with a mishmash .
So , one of the things I discovered , for instance , is that the First Law of Language Design is that " Everyone wants the colon " for their particular syntax .
And they can't all have it because it 's contradictory .
So the Second Law of Language Redesign is " Larry gets the colon for whatever he wants " .
( laughter )
I have to take a Winnie the Pooh approach .
This was just way too much information for one person .
You know , even somebody as smart as Audrey could not comprehend all of this at once .
And I 'm stupider than Audrey , at least in some ways .
So I took the ways in which I am stupid as a sort of a model of what Perl programmers like .
So I figured if I could n't understand something very easily it probably would n't be very understandable to anybody else , so I would be very careful about introducing that sort of a feature .
You know , we call it the " Bear of Very Little Brain approach " .
It works for me because that 's the only thing I can do .
Right at the beginning we said , " There is never time to do it right , but there is always time to do it over " .
So we 're just gonna take the time to do it right .
You 've heard this saying " Good , Fast , Cheap .
Pick two . " .
Well , this is Open Source .
We have to do it cheap .
Therefore , it reduces to a problem of " Good or Fast .
Pick one . "
We chose Good .
We did not choose Fast .
You may have noticed this .
( laughter ) Considering we announced Perl 6 five and half years ago .
We 're still going to do it right .
As long as it's a converging process , we 'll get there .
It is really simple .
Just keep everything good and throw out everything bad ... that 's easier said than done .
Goals and Meta -Goals ( 20:33 )
So our goals , which we 'll cover in the rest of our time here :
Simplification
Power
Object orientation
Functional programming
Pattern matching
Declarative programming
Lots of buzzword compatibility
But behind those are some meta - goals .
Pick defaults that allow for evolution :
We found out the problem for Perl 5 .
It allowed for evolution .
It put object orientation completely orthogonal ... orthogonally - I 'm an English speaker and I can't even say the word - into the language .
It 's wonderfully orthogonal but it's too orthogonal because it does n't set up any good defaults , and everyone does it differently and nothing can interoperate .
So in Perl 6 we 'll pick good a default object orientated way to do things , but allow for evolution .
Declarative multiculturalism : Multiculturalism is a very sort of postmodern idea .
Multiculturalism is great as long as you know that you are in a multicultural situation .
Perl 6 is not going to be a single language .
You start off with standard Perl 6 at the top , and every time you say " use " or declare a macro or something you are changing into a different language , a different culture .
As long as you declare it , all is fair if you predeclare .
Context dependency : I do n't really have time to explain that .
Better encapsulation : But also ex-capsulation .
You should n't have to worry about the innards of a module , but there are ways in which the innards of a module should n't have to worry about the outside world .
Unless it wants to .
Not just modules , but any kind of scoping mechanism .
Any kind of lexical scope , package scope ...
There are lots of different scopes .
Different ways to isolate things dimensionally .
DWIMmery : That 's " Do What I Mean " - ery .
When we design a dwimming feature in Perl 6 , we try to put it in one spot and then reuse it everywhere , so you know which table to look up to find out for instance how a smart match operator works .
No arbitrary limits round two :
Perl started off with the idea that strings should grow infinitely , if you have memory .
Just let 's get rid of those arbitrary limits that plagued Unix utilities in the early years .
Perl 6 is taking this in a number of different dimensions than just how long your strings are .
No arbitrary limits - you ought to be able to program very abstractly , you ought to be able to program very concretely - that 's just one dimension .
Behind that is another yet more - meta - goal , and that is we want to manage complexity in the future so that you people who are interested in changing Perl to do what you want can do that .
And there 's a meta - meta , a meta - meta - meta goal , which is , of course , to enjoy life .
Now when you 're young , " enjoy life " means , " I enjoy life " .
When you start getting a little older like me , the way you enjoy life is by helping other people enjoy life .
And there 's a balance in there .
Simplifications ( 24:00 )
So let 's un - meta - meta - meta .
Which of course means we 're back to bikeshed painting here so all of you people who are not interested in Perl at all can go to sleep now .
I do n't hear anyone snoring .
( I caught a cold before I came so this is an American cold not an Israeli cold .
Do n't worry about that . )
We made many simplifications , which we will go through here .
In Perl 5 it started off without nested data structures , because it was just a scripting language , so we sort of waved our hands and rationalized how these weird sigils were , but they were inconsistent .
We 've made them consistent : if it 's an array it always has an at on the front , if it 's a hash it always has a percent , regardless of how you use it .
And this gives us referential transparency .
I 've mentioned the constant subscripts , we 've stolen angle brackets for constant subscripts so they 're very visually distinct .
Rather than having a weird rule that if you have a bareword inside curlies , we now give it a separate construct , and there 's just lots of ways in which this clarifies your intent .
So , inside curlies is now always an expression , no special rules .
We 're trying to get rid of all these special rules .
A my variable in Perl 5 extends to the end of its closing block - except that if a my variable is declared , blah blah , blah , ... it only extends , blah , blah , blah ... and only for some times ....
My eyes glaze over .
If I were Damian I would put gibberish in there .
In Perl 6 the rules are going to be a little bit simpler : it extends to the end of the enclosing block and no further .
Rule 2 : There is no Rule 2 .
There 's no more double parsing .
Perl 5 was always looking for the end of the string , and then trying to figure out what was in the string , which is a mistake .
There 's no problem with having an expression containing quotes inside a double - quote string , even though it 's the same type of quote .
It knows what it 's looking for at that particular time .
Now , Perl 5 , Perl 5 would blow up on this pattern , and the reason it would blow up on it , actually it should probably have a /x on the end .
But leave that aside .
How many can see the problem there ?
See , the slash - well , maybe you can't see it .
Now you really can't see it !
The slash in the comment there matches the beginning slash .
So Perl 5 thinks that 's the end of the regular expression , and gets very confused .
That 's fixed in Perl 6 , because of this one - pass parsing .
When you 're in a comment , it knows it 's in a comment .
Simpler precedence .
We reduced the number of precedence levels a little bit - by one or two .
It went from 24 to 22 or something .
Regularizations ( 27:49 )
There are fewer gotchas .
You know , you had to put parens some places you did n't expect to .
We had to unify the relational and equality precedence levels so that we could do chained equality operators the way mathematicians like to do .
Perl 5 is just all full of these strange gobbledygooky variables which we all know and love - and hate .
So the error variables are now unified into a single error variable .
These variables have been deprecated forever , they 're gone !
These weird things that just drive syntax highlighters nuts ( laughter ) now actually have more regular names .
The star there , $ * GID , that 's what we call a secondary sigil , what that just says is this is in the global namespace .
So we know that that 's a global variable for the entire process .
Similarly for uids .
A lot of these things ought to have been object properties of some object or other such as a file handle , and that has a global name .
In Perl 5 there was this list of names that just magically was the same variable in every package , and you had to memorize that .
You do n't have to memorize that anymore because we have this star notation which says which things are globals .
You can leave the star out and it will find the global one anyway , but you do n't have to keep track of it .
Likewise , STDIN and its friends were these mysterious everywhere - variables , and we even managed to shorten them while we were making them more regular .
Now , people are always saying , you know I program in C and I like to be able to leave the curlies off of my expression .
Why can't we make the curlies optional ?
And that 's always gone back to my irrationality of not liking dangling syntax .
But I 'm kind of glad now that I never made those optional , because it turns out that if you keep the curlies mandatory you can make the parentheses optional on the expressions .
And it removes a lot of the visual clutter .
Makes it less like Lisp. ( laughter )
And those blocks , because the curlies are mandatory around a block , those blocks are all now logically closures .
Especially if they use lexical variables outside , as this closure does .
That 's how you write in Perl 5 , but in Perl 6 you do n't have to say the " sub " .
Any block that 's like this is just automatically a closure .
( Unless it 's a hash constructor . )
Now , another regularization was , in C and Perl and many C - derived languages you do n't know which blocks require a semicolon on the end and which ones do n't require a semicolon on the end , you just have to memorize it .
Or just put semicolons everywhere and people think you 're stupid .
( laughter )
In Perl 6 we 've regularized that : any line - ending curly has an implicit semicolon on the end , so you just do n't have to worry about it .
Things which were special cases in Perl 5 now just naturally fall out of these rules .
( Aside : Gaal likes these . )
Now this is just a little bit different ; the comma there is now required after the curly or it would think it was the end of the list .
But that 's a small price to pay for the regularization that we now have .
Likewise , map was a special case in Perl 5 ; it is not a special case .
sort was a special syntactic case .
And instead of $ a and $ b being magical variables that you should avoid , we now have a placeholder syntax that works just the same only it 's generalized .
And it just says we have two parameters to this closure , they happen to be named a and b , and they will be passed in that order .
And we always get the question saying , well , what if gets too complicated , how will I keep track of the alphabetical order ?
That 's not what it 's for !
If it gets that complicated you should use a regular parameter list .
So , when you see something like a for loop , which is like foreach in Perl , that actually is logically a closure , a subroutine on the end there .
It has an implicit parameter , $ _ , so it still works just the same way you think of it in Perl 5 .
But you could pass , using one of these explicit placeholder variables - that means exactly the same thing : I have one parameter .
Print it .
33:28
Or we have another notation , which we call the pointy sub , which is another way of declaring a block with parameters .
Now , if you know Ruby - it puts the parameter names inside vertical bars - I did n't like that .
I like the way this reads , because you say " for " list and then bind it to this formal parameter for that block and print it .
It 's a lambda .
It 's just sort of unsigned or something .
( laughter )
34:00
So , because we 're just binding to a formal parameter list , it 's just like you passed a sub as the last argument , only it reads a lot nicer .
And because it 's a formal parameter list you can have more than one parameter .
We can have two parameters , so it takes the list two at a time .
Or three at a time !
No , the next slide 's not four at a time .
You can take two arrays in parallel , and this each and the semicolon there is a way of piping two arrays in a single construct , and they 're piping constructs , which I do n't have time to talk about , but that 's essentially a multi- dimensional list .
It knows to take that , in parallel , so this allows you to read two arrays in parallel .
But on the other hand that looks a little bit , with the semicolons in there , like C's for loop , if you ignore the each , there 's a little confusion there , so instead of using " for " which is a leftover from C , we 've changed that keyword to " loop " .
But the three arguments still work the same way as they do in C , so you still have the generalized loop .
But having a different keyword is great there , because ... we have this funny idiom for an infinite loop in Perl 5 ; we got it from C [ " for ( ; ; ) " ] .
In Perl 6 you just say " loop " navigate .
Now this would be like the control loop for a cruise missile , and when we speak of bombing out of the loop we mean it literally .
[ Laugh ]
35:48
Perl 5 had this problem with " do " loops because they were n't real loops - they were a " do " block followed by a statement modifier , and people kept wanting to use loop control it them .
Well , we can fix that .
" loop " now is a real loop .
And it allows a modifier on it but still behaves as a real loop .
And so , do goes off to have other duties , and you can write a loop that tests at the end and it is a real loop .
And this is just one of many many many things that confused new Perl 5 programmers .
And if you go and visit Perl Monks , and read through all the questions that people ask , you know , in about 9 out of 10 of them , you could , we could - we do n't , because people get very tired of it , people already get tired of our hyping Perl 6 .
You could go through about 9 out of 10 of them , and say " This is going to be fixed in Perl 6 " , " This situation wo n't arise in Perl 6 " , " We 've regularized that " .
And yet it 's still Perl , it 's Perl underneath , it 's got a different syntactic sugar on the top .
Got rid of typeglobs .
Instead of using typeglobs for aliasing , we have a new mystery operator , which I 'll get to later , and there it is on the second line ( wow ! that was quick ! ) .
We 'll talk about , not only about the simplifications , but these new powerful things and we can only cover a few of them .
We 've got full type signatures now , on variables , in parameter lists , and they behave just as you would expect them to .
Presuming you know what to expect .
37:53
There are also some lowercase ones , which are native types , rather than object types which are uppercase .
Just by convention uppercase types are object - oriented types , whereas if I say my int Array , I mean a packed array of ints , or a packed bit array .
So we can now talk about , optionally , very compact storage , and the VM is free to optimize this greatly .
So we have the capacity of doing some things and using a lot less memory than Perl 5 does .
So these types are very useful , particularly with arrays - they can be packed .
Perl 5 , another place where it was too orthogonal - we defined parameter passing to just come in as an array .
You know arrays , subroutines - they 're just orthogonal .
You just happen to have one called @_ , which your parameters come in , and it was wonderfully orthogonal , and people built all sorts of stuff on top of it , and it 's another place where we are changing .
So instead of having these weird prototype pills , in Perl 6 you can just say " I 'm expecting an array as the first argument " and then put the rest of the arguments into what we call this slurpy array , because slurps the rest of the arguments .
So 1 , 2 and 3 end up in args because we do n't enclose them up there .
That 's all well and good , but we 'd like to unify these things .
I said these RFCs proposed many different solutions .
The hard design goal was to find the unifying concepts underneath all these RFCs and to treat the underline diseases rather than the symptoms . [ 40:00 ]
So , we unified our argument passing which is a form of binding , with an operator which is used for binding - :=.
That does exactly the same thing as passing this list into the argument list .
There 's no copying involved it just changes the names , so you can swap two names .
We left equals ( = ) completely untouched because we think Perl 5 programmers will rise up and revolt if we change that .
Another powerful thing is the thing called hyper-operators .
You know if you add two arrays together in Perl 5 - what do you get ?
Well , you end up with the length of the two arrays added .
Well , guess what ?
It does that in Perl 6 , by default , because it still makes the scalar / list context distinction , so it 's a little bit smart about that .
However , you can explicitly say : " I do n't want to do it as in Perl , what I really mean by that plus (+ ) is add each element of @a to the corresponding element of @b and producing a list . "
And for those explicit parallel operations we have what we call the hyper - operator - it's a meta operator , like assignment operators and some more things which modifies this operator to do a different operation .
So , not only can you do that , but you can also have a scalar on one side - it 's a little bit smart .
So it just adds one to each element of @a and return that .
Or you can do it in place , just increment each element of @a .
[ Question from the audience : " How do you type it ? " ]
How do you type it ?
With your keyboard ?
Do you use vi or Emacs ?
In vi it's Ctrl+K >>.
You can also write it with two regular greater - than 's ( " > > " ) .
We 're getting to the age of Unicode , and we want to make Unicode programming possible , so we 're trying to shove people a little bit in that direction .
So the actual operators we 're encouraging people to use are all in the Latin - 1 range , so this is in the Latin - 1 range .
But everything has an ASCII workaround to the Unicode , so it 's not a big problem .
42:48 .
Likewise , if you turn them inside out - the french quotes - you can use the regular angle brackets , and yes , we did change here - docs so it does not conflict , then that 's the equivalent of " qw " .
This qw interpolates , with single - angles it does not interpolate - that is the exact " qw " .
We have properties which you can put on variables and onto values .
These are generalizations of things that were special code in Perl 5 , but now we have general mechanisms to do the same things , they 're actually done using a mix - in mechanism like Ruby .
Smart match operators is , like Damian say , equal - tilda ( " = ~ " ) on steroids .
Instead of just allowing a regular expression on the right side it allows basically anything , and it figures out that this wants to do a numeric comparison , this wants to do a string comparison , this wants to compare two arrays , this wants to do a lookup in the hash ; this wants to call the closure on the right passing in the left argument , and it will tell if you if $x can quack .
Now that looks a little strange because you can just say " $ x.can ( ' quack ' ) " .
Why would you do it this way ?
Well , you 'll see .
You can get match classes which will tell you whether this is a mammal , or whether it does the mammal interface .
And another thing is against junctions .
If any of you has seen Damian 's quantum superpositions , this is just his any of 1 , 2 , 3 .
But we stole the short bit operator operations , because we think in Perl people do n't actually use 2 - bit operations that often - they now have something that is regularized differently .
But now you can write this , and just means that it matches as 1 or 2 , or 3 .
Junctions are used for smart operations , but they can be used anywhere .
Another thing we 've done is - people always wanted the switch statement - so we now have a switch statement .
But instead of saying " switch " and " case " which is talking about the constructs , we do it more like a natural language , where we have words that sound like it's in English .
" given " one of these , when I have one or two or three , then argle , when B then bargle .
[ Question from the audience : does it break by default ? ]
Yes it breaks by default .
If you want to fall into the next test , you would say " continue " , and if you want to go into the body of the next test , as is the default in C , you 'll need to use " goto " ... we try to discourage that .
But you do n't have to say case , case , case , and all those fall through all these things , because we have these junctional things .
And these are what we call topicalizers , and that 's another natural linguistic thing , but this is unified with the ~~ operator .
The smart match is the same semantics under here , that 's why we said we try to unify things .
So a topicalizer is anything that says $ _ , and so when you 're looping through an array , each element is set to $ _ and when is just doing the smart match against that .
And , by the way , $ _ is a lexical variable in Perl 6 .
47:08
any block that sets $ _ , and that includes exception handlers .
This catch - it 's just a funny way to set $ _ - from this block .
And then there 's a regular switch inside - we do n't have special catch syntax like many other languages .
It just naturally falls out with a little tweak .
Which is , other languages tend to put the " catch " outside of the block , and then you lose visibility to any of the lexical variables that were in the block .
I do n't refer to $x or $y here , but if I did , I could see it from inside the " catch " block there , which is inside the try .
But the fact is , another advantage of putting it inside , is that it can turn its outer block into a try block .
So we do n't actually need that " try " , it 's redundant .
We just write it like that - close it up .
That is still a try - block , the sub is behaving as a try block , because it has a " catch " block in it .
48:27
There are many kinds of " catch " - like blocks that will capture control at various locations : when you 're entering or leaving a block , when you 're doing the next , the first time through this block ; there 's a keep and an undo block which is like a " leave " block except that it 's transactional - it knows when the block is exiting successfully or unsuccessfully , so you can do transactional processing with it .
" pre " and " post " blocks are for design by contract .
But they 're all the same thing - they 're all just " begin " blocks .
And " begin " blocks are all just properties on the blocks that they are .
Object Orientation
Moving on to object orientation ... [ 49:15 ]
We 'll talk about some of these things .
The syntax rather than setting run-time variable like " @ISA " , is probably still doing things like that underneath , running bits of codes , but it looks declarative .
And that 's important , and the default declarations just map naturally to your typical object - oriented vocabulary .
So if you say the " dog is a mammal " , that 's how you write it .
And you say " it has a tail " - " has " !
We still use methods .
Now this dot there allows us to auto - write our accessors for the attrs [ = attributes ] that have accessors .
So you do n't have to write those .
Here 's a complete class , you can write it either this way if it 's an entire file .
Or you can write a class as a block with the block notation which is the more standard notation .
And those are supposed to be the same thing .
If it 's an inner class , it will be installed on a different place .
50:30
So , as I mentioned , it auto - generates not only the accessors but also the constructor method , or defaults to a generic one that it can use .
So I can say " Give me a new dog with a tail and legs " , and you do n't have to write those methods .
Or the corresponding INIT methods which we call " build methods " , which you can write if you want to , but you do n't have to , if you just want the default .
Private variables , simply do n't have the dot as a secondary sigil .
We got tired of saying " secondary sigil " , because we have a lot of them and they 're very useful for indicating weird namespaces .
It 's " Weird things should look weird " is one of the principles in Perl 6 , and the attributes are a little bit weird so they look a little bit weird .
The dot means that I 'm autogenerating an accessor .
If you leave that out , there is n't an accessor , and it 's a private variable .
It 's lexically scoped to the class , and it can't be seen outside .
And you have to use the accessors outside .
And we have a way to specifying , finalizing , or not , on an application - wide basis , that we 'll hopefully make that efficient without closing or finalizing classes prematurely .
Multi-methods are another important aspect which I really do n't have time to get in to , but the entire Perl 6 run - time system is built on methods , so you can overload any of the built - in operators with more specific types and it will just find your version .
52:25
Delegation is supported , the natural syntax .
Inner classes - you know about those , we talked about those .
Roles are our idea of interfaces , but it 's more than just interfaces .
If any of you read the Smalltalks trait paper - it 's more than just traits , but it 's closely modelled on it .
The idea is that it's an interface with a default implementation that you can pull in at compile - time and it will figure out if there are any method collisions .
We can also do run -time mixins .
The problems with mixins is they overlay the previous definitions and you can hide things and not realize it .
Whereas with roles - at compile time , if you pulled them in , and say what roles this objects fullfills , it can figure out if there 's a conflict and warn you .
Which is a good .
53:23
We support not only types , but constrained sub - types with subset notation , so we can say $x is an Int between 0 to 15 , define odd numbers , define Japanese strings , define what a paddit is ?
If that 's not on your list I 'm sorry .
You can redefine subsets using a role , and these are assertions that the values of these types have to fullfill , the where clauses .
And again , that 's just a smart match operation on the right .
Functional Programming
Moving away from Object orientation , we have put a lot of thought into also supporting Functional programming .
We 're supporting many different paradigms to the extent that it 's not exclusive to the other paradigms .
So we can do continuations , and currying and lazy lists , etc .
Pugs is written in Haskell currently , though we 'll re-host the compiler in Perl 6 really soon .
And Parrot already supports continuations - that 's the low - level VM .
Continuations - if you know what they are - I do n't need to explain them .
If you do n't know what they are - you do n't want to know .
But basically they are like backtracking points in a regular expression , only without the regular expression .
It 's like the cat without the cat .
And they will be hidden from mere mortals , you 'd have to use a big uppercase thing to get it , so you 'd know you 're doing something weird .
55:14
Currying is idea from Haskell and other languages , only we make it explicit , rather than doing it implicitly .
And we say , take a function , and assume that the $x argument is 1 , or assume that the $y argument is 2 , and that gives us functions with more limited functionality , and hopefully gives the optimizer a chance to optimize some of that .
Lazy lists - in Perl 6 , scalars are not lazy , but lists are lazy , by default - you can tweak that .
This means that the list in the for loop can be an infinite list , it does n't have to generate all those integers , it just runs until the loop exits .
0 , 1 , 2 , 3 .
You can do fancier thing if you 're into PDL - type programming - mapping one thing to another .
Argument lists - because we have argument lists and we have multiple dispatch , we can do a trick ... this is pretty much a transcription of something you 'll probably see in Audrey 's Haskell talk later .
This is quick sort , and basically it says : if you pass a null list , return a null list .
And if it does n't mathc that , it matches a list which has a head and a tail .
Partition them into a list that 's greater than the head and a list that 's less than the head , and return the sorted sublist , with the pivot in the middle .
And that 's all it is .
It 's very powerful to be able to do that signature matching .
And we are also planning to do this signature matching embedded in our regular expression rule engine , matching against things that are not strings , but look more like argument lists .
57:20
Regular Expressions
Now , the thing I really wanted to get to , which we think will influence the world outside of Perl is we saw how everyone borrowed Perl 5 compatible regular expressions , and we figured - well , you know , they 're a really big mess , and we 're sorry , but we 're changing them now , now that you 've just borrowed them .
So everyone is gonna go from PCRE to P6RE or something like that .
There 's a lot of cruft that we inherited from the UNIX culture and we added more cruft , and we 're cleaning it up .
So in Perl 5 we made the mistake of interpreting regular expressions as strings , which means we had to do weird things like back - references are \ 1 on the left , but they 're $ 1 on the right , even though it means the same thing .
In Perl 6 , because it 's just a language , ( an embedded language ) $ 1 is the back - reference .
It does not automatically interpolate this $ 1 from what it was before .
You can also get it translated to Euros I guess .
In Perl 5 , if you wanted to interpolate a string , but did not want it to be treated as a regular expression , you had to do this weird quotemeta thing .
In Perl 6 , that is the default , if you interpolate a string it matches it literally , which is why you can match the back - reference $ 1 literally .
The same is true of arrays .
This is an array of literal strings that just match an alternation , or you can look up , by the longest token rule , the longest key in this hash that just matches this bit of string .
And that is used heavily in the Perl 6 parser - or will be .
In Perl 5 if you put a bare variable , it treated it as a regular expression .
Well that 's literal now , so we changed the default around .
If you want something treated as a regular expression , as an embedded regular expression , interpolated , then we have this new notation , which can interpolate a single rule or an alternation of rules , or again , look up a token key and then call up to another rule , and this allows us to build recursive grammars .
60:11
In Perl 5 , the problem is that it was completely irrational how the meta- characters worked .
Parens might or might not capture : that does grouping without capture , that calls a closure , that calls an indirect rule .
The square brackets are under utilized .
So are the curlies .
And the angle brackets were unused so I stole them .
They are now meta-characters .
We just do n't have enough bracketing characters in ASCII .
Which is why we stole the French brackets .
In Perl 6 it 's very consistent .
Parens capture , brackets group , braces call a closure ; meta - syntactics always with angle brackets .
Use of whitespace is encouraged - in fact , there is no /x modifier anymore .
That is now the default , the mandatory default .
61:13
Postfix bottom - up (? ) modifiers are bad , because you have to go all the way to the end , and it changes the meaning of what 's before , so we pulled them out front .
And we have a consistent , what we call an adverbial notation , the colon on the front .
It 's basically a named argument , that colon ( FILL IN ) a named argument to the substitution function .
These trailing switches are gone .
Things which are modal and change the meaning of " . " , " ^ " and " $ " - now they have separate tokens , so if you want to match interior newlines within a string , you double the " ^ " or the " $ " . " . " now always matches any character , and if you want the old default meaning , you actually say , I want to match " not a newline " . "
" matches a newline so " \N " , following the pattern we 've already established , matches a character which is not a newline .
62:15
Whitespace is the default .
We no longer need a switch that says interpolate the right hand side as an expression , because we can interpolate expressions .
As I said , everywhere , curlies mean a closure , even in a string .
And we have the new modifiers - some of which are familiar and some of which are not : look for overlapping or exhaust all the possiblities - pretend you 're prolog , I guess .
Find third match , do the first three matches , do auto - whitespace matching , or do n't do auto - whitespace matching .
And of course the most important one is : " I do n't understand all of this new stuff , just give me a Perl 5 regular expression here . "
And it will do that too .
The meta-syntax - instead of trying to guess what horizontal whitespace is , you just say " \h " that 's horizontal whitespace , including Unicode whitespace .
And we have vertical whitespace , which I suppose include vertical tab , whatever that is .
Alpha - if you say " A - Z " and want to match Alphas it 's probably wrong , for most of Europe and anywhere that is not the U.S. .
Now we tend to use named rules to match character classes , and this tends to free up the square brackets for other uses .
So if you actually want to match a character class , you put it in the this angle brackets padded notation , so we sort have de-Huffmanized it .
Or you can make it readable .
The negation is doing set addition and subtraction , so this just says the set of all characters with those subtracted out .
Or you can say like this - it 's a lot more readable .
In Perl 5 , we had this gobbleygock , you can just see that it 's a lot clearer .
And again , we got rid of those switches and now you can read the expression left to right and know what it means .
Simplified a lot of the really crufty meta-syntactic things .
The null match is now illegal .
That prevents a class of errors where you say " a|b|c " and forgot to put the next thing , and suddenly it matches the null string and you do n't know why .
Or even worse if the null is on the front .
Also there 's the situation where you say " // " , you do n't know in Perl 5 whether it means match the null string , or match the previous match .
You have to be explicit about that , and it 's readable and prevents a class of errors .
Newline is logical newline , so if you mounted a Windows partition on your UNIX box and say " match a newline " - it figures out the right thing .
65:48
Assertions are now more readable , either positive or negative assertions .
Slightly de-Huffmanized , the back - tracking control now can be applied to any preceding token - the same way a quantifier can .
The conditional syntax looks a lot less like LISP .
Here 's how you match a conditional now in Perl 6 : basically if it's this then do that , if it 's this then do that - that 's how you read this .
The colons are being a back - tracking control .
Only the double one says if you back - track over this back - track out of the entire alternative set .
Now if you wrote that in Perl 5 , it would have to look like this , which as you can see is a lot worse .
Especially all the trailing parens there .
Of course , if you did n't use the /x modifier there to use whitespace , you 'd have to write it like this .
I 'm sure you all agree that 's a slight improvement .
Buy you do n't even have to keep track of your captures here - you just say : " Give me the previous one " .
So it 's a pattern - action pattern - action and each of them stands independently .
Now , that 's not all - we have full grammars .
So you want to match a floating point number - here 's the grammar for it .
Now it looks much more like YaCC or BNF that it does like regular expressions , does n't it ?
We do n't even call them regular expressions anymore , we call them rules .
And they just build a parse tree for you , and using the names of these things you can parse a number .
And then you say " give me the sign " , " give me the mantissa " , " give me the exponent " , " give me the sign of the exponent " , and it 's all nested nicely just as a data structure .
You can even use the constant subscript notation , like that , and because you get tired of seeing those slashes , you can even get rid of them .
But we got another problem here which is you might use digits in more than one place , and how you differentiate them .
Well you can bind them to different names .
And then after you did that , you can just say - well return the integer part of the mantissa and the fractional part of the mantissa .
69:00
Now , if you say evaluate something , that 's really going to do something underneath like take the Perl 6 grammar as the top rule , and then parse this thing , and compile that , and run it .
And a grammar is just a strange kind of class , and these rules are just funny kind of methods , and since if you can overwrite methods , why not overwrite rules .
So let 's take the Perl grammar , and derive a grammar from it , and we 'll call it " Rubbish " ...
I mean " Rubyish " .
I will redefine identifiers to allow an optional " ? " or " ! " on the end .
And off we go .
And install it as your current grammar using a " use " statement or something , and suddenly you 're programming in Rubyish .
And this is how natural languages evolve , they just make little changes to the grammar and the dictionary all the time .
It 's also how people learn language .
You learn the simple thing and then you learn other things in terms of those things .
It 's also how Audrey is defining Pugs .
He takes this syntactic sugar , and de-sugars it into this is defined in terms of that , and this is defined in terms of that , until at the low level there 's just a small number of primitives .
Now , we had some of this " an A is just a B " in Perl 5 , we could say , " an object is just a blessed reference " , " a class is just a package " , " a method is just a subroutine " .
Sometimes we got confused because we used the same keywords for all of these things .
The same things carries over to Perl 6 .
Though in some cases , we changed the keyword , but it 's still the same thing semantically underneath .
So we can still do a lot of this define one thing in terms of another .
An object attribute is just a weirdly scoped variable .
A class attribute - well maybe that 's not true anymore .
A grammar is kinda like a class , a grammar rule is like a method ... types are properties that are interpreted as contracts , attributes just bind a list , hyper - operators - you can define all of these things just in terms of lower level things .
A control structure is just a subroutine that can call closures - that 's an important one .
All control flow to exit a block is just a strange kind of exception , and you know Perl 6 is just a new version of Perl .
And that 's the talk .
I guess I have gone into your break time by 5 minutes so I do n't have time for questions , but I 'll be here all the rest of the time and feel free to ask me anything .

The Happiness of Nations " As economies get richer , they can afford to question the need for further riches .
In a country where people are starving , economic growth remains regarded as a vital objective to overcome hunger and other poverty problems . "
Traditionally , economists and others measure a nation 's progress and prosperity by looking at Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , that is , the total output of good and services a country produces for its own inhabitants or for sale to other nations .
There is a growing tendency , however , for economists to consider another measure , Gross National Happiness .
" For the wealthy countries of the world , though not the developing countries , our instinct is that it would be a mistake in the twenty - first century to focus excessively on ways to raise the level or growth rate of GDP , " write David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald in Happiness and the Human Development Index : The Paradox of Australia ( NBER Working Paper No. 11416 ) .
" The industrialized countries should ... use a broader conception of well - being than the height of a pile of dollars . "
As economies get richer , they can afford to question the need for further riches .
In a country where people are starving , economic growth remains regarded as a vital objective to overcome hunger and other poverty problems .
One of the best - known attempts to move away from a simple reliance on GDP as a measure of welfare is the Human Development Index ( HDI ) of the United Nations .
Published every year , the HDI is a score that amalgamates three indicators : lifespan , educational attainment , and adjusted real income .
In this paper , Blanchflower and Oswald question the soundness of this measure when the 2004 Human Development Report places Australia at third in the world , ahead of all the other English - speaking countries .
The top - ten countries , in order according to that index , are : Norway , Sweden , Australia , Canada , Netherlands , Belgium , Iceland , United States , Japan , and Ireland .
The HDI , the authors note , is a mechanical criterion .
" It does not capture the contentment or psychological state of individuals , " that is , their mental well being .
" Emotion surely ought to play a role in a measure of human well being , " they write .
Their goal is not to establish that the HDI measure of human well being is incorrect .
Rather , their stated goal is to improve upon the traditional narrow economic focus on real income and growth .
In that regard , they draw on recent academic literature exploring the " economics of happiness , " studies that make use of how people in different countries rate their own happiness or well being .
The authors suspect that HDI data and subjective well - being data could play complementary roles .
Using new data on approximately 50,000 randomly sampled individuals from 35 nations in 2002 , Blanchflower and Oswald show that Australians have some of the lowest levels of job satisfaction in the world .
Only Japan , Taiwan , and six East European nations ( including Russia ) do worse in this regard .
Moreover , in a sub-sample of English - speaking nations where the common language should help such subjective measures to be more reliable , Australia performs poorly on a range of four other happiness indicators .
The authors note that comparisons of people 's answers regarding happiness in one country to answers to the same questions in another country is " probably hazardous " because of different languages and cultures that may cause biases in such happiness surveys .
In the " world league table " on happiness , Australia performs respectably in these four categories outside of job satisfaction .
Ranking the 35 nations by all five categories , Australians place their happiness level at 5.39 on a scale that runs from a low of one to a high of seven , making it the twelfth happiest country in this sample .
By comparison , Austria has a value of 5.54 , Brazil 5.42 , Switzerland 5.51 , and the United States 5.52 .
Happiness measures , Blanchflower and Oswald add , " can tell politicians and others how citizens value the different effects upon well - being of diverse influences such as unemployment , the divorce rate , real income , friendship , traffic jams , crime , health , and much else .
If we can learn to exploit the power of statistical happiness equations , it should be possible to make public policy choices in a more coherent way than before . "
Some recent findings from statistical happiness research include the following , the authors note in their paper : 1 . For a person , money does buy a reasonable amount of happiness .
But it is useful to keep this in perspective .
Very loosely , for the typical individual , a doubling of salary makes a lot less difference than life events like marriage .
2 . Nations as a whole , at least in the West , do not seem to get happier as they get richer .
3 . Happiness is U - shaped in age - that is , it falls off for a while , then stabilizes , and rises later in life .
Women report higher well - being than men .
Two of the biggest negatives in life are unemployment and divorce .
More educated people report higher levels of happiness , even after taking account of income .
4 . At least in industrial countries such as France , Britain , and Australia , the structure of a happiness equation looks the same .
5 . There is adaptation .
Good and bad life events wear off - at least partially - as people get used to them .
6 . Comparisons matter a great deal .
Reported well being depends on a person 's wage relative to an average or " comparison " wage .
Wage inequality depresses reported happiness in a region or nation .
But the effect is not large -- David R. Francis

Cultural Note
Protecting Us From Ourselves , Part 943
I have read a number of things about the Whoopi Goldberg disclaimer — called an ‘ introduction ’ for some reason — on the new Looney Tunes DVD collection .
I only saw the introduction — ‘ disclaimer ’ would be a better term — yesterday , because Santa left a copy of the collection for Nicole .
For two and a half minutes , Ms. Goldberg tells us that these cartoons are great .
However .
However , the Looney Tunes and their irreverent brand of humor are products of their time .
Unfortunately , at that time , racial and ethnic differences were caricatured in ways that may have embarrassed and even hurt people of color , women , and ethnic groups .
Now , nobody intended it , but that ’s what happened .
Now , some of the cartoons here reflect some of the prejudices that were commonplace in American society .
Especially when it came to the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities .
Now , these jokes were wrong then and they are wrong today .
But removing these inexcusable images and jokes from this collection would be the same as saying they never existed .
So they are presented here to accurately reflect a part of our history that cannot and should not be ignored .
Ms. Goldberg goes on to pat Warner Brothers on the back for how progressive its polices really were back then , woof woof woof .
You can see the video ( in iPod video format , which should be playable by any computer with Quicktime 7 or the most recent version of iTunes ) here .
I have mixed feelings about this disclaimer .
If this is what ’s needed for companies to be able to release cultural products from the past which are now regarded as entartete Kunst , so be it .
Big companies like Time Warner live in stark terror of being accused of even seeming to be discriminatory in any way , probably because it ’s almost totally impossible to defend oneself or one ’s company against such charges .
Time Warner is attempting to do so preemptively , by hiring famous black person Whoopi Goldberg as their aplologist .
If they could n’t do this , they would n’t release the cartoons at all .
If this works , it might be possible one day to again see Disney ’s Song of the South .
But at the same time I ’m personally offended by this disclaimer , because it seems to carry with it the implication that I , Tino , need this warning : that without it , I might think that it is suddenly okay to make fun of ethnic groups .
Because certainly there ’s nothing else in the culture that would indicate otherwise .
Cough .
I must say that the only ethnic group I ’ve seen made fun of on the discs so far is hillbillies .
I ’m sure , though , that there ’s ten seconds somewhere on these four DVDs of a porter or bellman drawn to look like a monkey saying ‘ Yazzuh , Mistuh Fudd , I ’se sho nuff seen dat rabbit what yo lookin ’ fo ! ’ or some such : and for that I have to listen to Whoopi Goldberg for two minutes and thirty seconds every time I put one of the discs in .
And I think that this has helped me locate the origin of most of the discontentment I feel and write about here :
In too many of my daily interactions , I am given no credit for not being a child / moron / criminal / racist / jackass / scam artist / drunk / junkie/etc . —
I ’m assumed to be all of these things until I prove otherwise , and then that proof is only accepted grudgingly , and with suspicion .
And I ’m tired of it .
It ’s not just me , of course , but the fact that you are also not given credit for not being a child / criminal / etc. is not my problem .
But we have reordered , and we seem to be continuing to reorder , our society to primarily serve the needs of people who do n’t really contribute to it .
Children are nice , but they ’re not in a position to make any meaningful contribution to society for twenty years or so : this is why we do n’t let them vote .
Criminals by definition do not make a contribution to society , but take from it .
And morons — which I mean to include real drooling idiots as well as people who cannot figure out that just because Bugs Bunny made fun of the Japanese in 1942 does not mean that we still have anything against those fine people — will only sporadically be useful to anyone else .
And yet things are arranged primarily for them !
If only there were some setting on the DVD player where I could affirm that I am willing to take on the risk of Bad Mojo myself , and that would allow me to skip not only the Whoopi Goldberg variations , but the threats that inform me that this is one of those rare DVDs that may not be legally copied and distributed to all and sundry .
If only there were a chain of convenience stores with signs on the door that said ‘ WE CARD UNDER 21 because after all those are the people we ’re trying to protect from themselves and all ’ instead of ‘ WE CARD UNDER 30 ’ , meaning that they fully intend to inconvenience a lot of legal adults lest they sell beer to a few particularly mature - looking 20 - year - olds .
If only there were n’t even any need to put signs on the doors of establishments that would rather that your children not have fits on the floor : why on Earth is n’t ‘ behave yourself ’ just understood to be the rule everywhere ?
All of this might be acceptable if it produced a new golden age , but I cannot help but notice that teenagers still drink ( in increasing numbers , actually , depending on whose statistics you believe ) , that people still pirate movies and music , and that plenty of people are still racists .
Perhaps it ’s time to think about a different approach , rather than just continuing to ratchet up the surveillance , threats , and lectures another notch .

US senators ' personal stock portfolios outperformed the market by an average of 12 per cent a year in the five years to 1998 , according to a new study .
" The results clearly support the notion that members of the Senate trade with a substantial informational advantage over ordinary investors , " says the author of the report , Professor Alan Ziobrowski of the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University .
He admits to being " very surprised " by his findings , which were based on 6,000 financial disclosure filings and are due to be published in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis .
" The results suggest that senators knew when to buy their common stocks and when to sell . "
First - time Senators did especially well , with their stocks outperforming by 20 per cent a year on average - a result that very few professional fund managers would be able to achieve .
" It could be argued that the junior senators most recently came out of private industry , so may have better connections .
Seniority was definitely a factor in returns , " says Prof Ziobrowski .
There was no difference in performance between Democrats and Republicans .
A separate study in 2000 , covering 66,465 US households from 1991 to 1996 showed that the average household 's portfolio underperformed the market by 1.44 per cent a year , on average .
Corporate insiders ( defined as senior executives ) usually outperform by about 5 per cent .
The Ziobrowski study notes that the politicians ' timing of transactions is uncanny .
Most stocks bought by senators had shown little movement before the purchase .
But after the stock was bought , it outperformed the market by 28.6 per cent on average in the following calender year .
Returns on sell transactions are equally intriguing .
Stocks sold by senators performed in line with the market the year following the sale .
When adjusted by the size of stocks , the total portfolio returns outperformed by 12 per cent a year on average .
The study used a total market index as the benchmark for comparison .
The study took eight years to complete because there was no database of information and the documents had to be gathered and examined manually .
Stocks held in blind trusts are not included in the disclosure documents .
Physical space matters .
It ’s easier to be productive , creative and happy at work in a colourful , organic , playful environment than in a grey , linear , boring one .
And I ’m not talking about the outside of the building .
Many companies have buildings that are sleek , modern , architectural glass - steel - and - cement sculptures on the outside – and cubicle wastelands on the inside .
These companies need to remember that most employees tend to work inside the building .
With that in mind , here ’s some eye candy from 10 different innovative , well - designed workplaces .
( Also check out my post on 12 Ways to Pimp Your Office ) .
Pixar
Could you sit in grey cubicles and come up with stuff like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo ?
Naaaaah …
And that ’s why Pixar ’s offices look more like this :
The last picture shows a row of little huts , each of which is an office .
The pictures are from this cool photo tour of the Pixar HQ .
Kathy Sierra ’s trailer
Kathy Sierra , who writes one of the best blogs in existence , created her home office in a vintage trailer .
What a great way to create a fun , different home office .
Kathy talks about it here .
Red Bull London
Here are some pictures from Red Bull ’s London office .
Shiny !
The last picture shows a slide that people can use to go between floors .
Yee -hah !
There are many more pictures here .
Mindlab
Who says government offices must be boring .
Mindlab at the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs in Copenhagen , Denmark is a meeting facility available to all employees .
The heart of it is an egg - shaped meeting room inside which all the walls are whiteboards – you can write on any surface in there .
This was designed by Bosch & Fjord .
The Happy At Work Project
We ( = The Happy At Work Project ) wanted something simple , fun , flexible and practical for our office .
The central piece is a high desk where three people can comfortably work side by side .
You can stand or sit on high office chairs .
Up to 8 people can meet around it .
Everything you see there is from IKEA , and setting up the whole office with workspaces for 3 people cost us about 1000 euros .
While it ’s not as fancy as some of the other offices shown here , it works great and it shows how much you can do for almost no money –
In just one room we have workplaces , meeting space and plenty of floor space for workshop exercises or plain old fun .
Conference bike
This has got to be the coolest idea in a long time .
7 people pedal along , one steers .
It ’s the conference bike and I want one !!
While it ’s not a workplace , it would make a great meeting room !!
Menlo Innovations
Menlo Innovations is a software development company in Ann Arbor Michigan .
They do all their programming work using eXtreme Programming , and while their offices are n’t particularly fancy to look at , they are ideally suited to the work they do .
Being situated in a nice area of town , they can even take meetings outside on the sidewalk .
Again , this shows that creating a fun , innovaticve office environment does n’t require a huge budget – just a little common sense , creativity and a willingness to risk doing something different .
What If ? Innovation
What If ?
Innovation were celebrated as the UK ’s happiest workplace in both 2004 and 2005 .
I visited their London HQ last week for a grand tour , and here are some of the highlights :
Looking in the window on the combined reception and meeting space .
A great idea that creates a hub for everyone in the company .
Praise for employees is written across the walls and ceiling in the hub area .
Spider cow and a meeting room .
VW Phaeton plant
But what about industry ?
You could never create , say , a really cool car assembly plant could you ?
Sure you could .
Check out the Volkswagen Phaeton plant in Dresden , Germany :
Who says a factory has to be ugly and dirty ?
That plant is simply beautiful !
The photos were taken from this photo tour where you can see many more cool pictures .
There ’s also more at the plant ’s website .
Google
Yes , yes , I know – using Google here is almost too predictable .
But they get it , dammit !
Their HQ , the Googleplex is seriously cool and creative .
The upshot
The physical workspace is one of the most ignored , yet most important factors in creating good workplaces .
None of the ideas shown here will apply to every company , but most companies could stand to improve a little .
It does n’t have to cost a lot of money but it does take a little creativity and courage .
What could your workplace learn from some of the designs shown here ?
UPDATE : Having this post on reddit , digg and lifehacker at the same time was too much for my server and mysql crashed – I apologize .
I ’ll look into fixing this , so it wo n’t be a problem in the future .
I ’ve also created a flickr set with all the images of cool workplaces .

" So , someone can take over the device , or load a virus on it covertly . "
D'Aguanno hid attacker software code in a noughts and crosses game that , if downloaded and played on a BlackBerry , secretly invaded the network linked to the handled device .
An " attack vector " described by D'Aguanno during a presentation at a recent DefCon hackers conference in Las Vegas was to email BlackBerry users a link and trick them into downloading the malicious software cloaked in the game .
The devices , made by Research In Motion in Canada , would then act as doorways that let hackers slip behind fire walls and seek out unprotected computers in a company 's network , according to D'Aguanno .
" One of the biggest hurdles for an actual attacker is to get themselves on the internal network , " D'Aguanno said .
" Going head - on is usually not the smart way to go because of beefy fire walls and all that .
" But , if you get yourself inside the network , there are vulnerable machines , the defenses are n't as formidable because they rely on the outer walls . "
D'Aguanno said that the potential for the BBProxy version released on Monday to be used maliciously was " nil " and that it was intended to show network administrators that the threat of attack via BlackBerry devices was real .
" The general thinking around the BlackBerry and handheld devices as a whole needs to be reformed , " D'Aguanno said .
" You need to secure the rest of your network from malicious attacks from that medium . "
Another possible form of attack was " blackjacking , " or hijacking legitimate users '
BlackBerry devices and replacing them on the network with rogue devices , D'Aguanno said .
The components of business enterprise computer servers that support mobile data devices should be isolated instead of being linked in ways that allow unfettered access to entire networks , he advised .
Downloading of third - party applications to BlackBerry or similar devices should be prevented , according to D'Aguanno .
" It is kind of a new playground , as far as a way into a network , " D'Aguanno said , adding he knew of no successful hacker attacks via BlackBerry .
" I have a BlackBerry .
I think they are great things , but you have to treat them like any untrusted computer with access to your network . "

In case your not a regular Squash - ee or else have n't picked it up along the way , my tiny , tiny little niche area of authority that I 've been fortunate to build a business on is the Australian technology media .
So it always warms the cockles of me heart when an Aussie IT journo ( which is Aussie / Brit slang for journalist btw ) breaks a story big enough to warrant them significant attention in the big , worldwide blogosphere .
I kinda feel like a parent who 's kid just hit a home run ( in Australia of course , that would translate to hitting a six ) .
Tonight , one particular Australian tech hack is at the very centre of the blogosphere 's hot story of the moment .
Although , the jury is still out on whether he's hit a homer or if he 's taken a wild air swing .
That journalist is David Richards , who penned the now infamous 60 % Of Windows Vista Code To Be Rewritten story .
Today , he updated his story with quotes from the marketing director of Acer Australa who " confirmed independently of SmartHouse Magazine that Microsoft is having major problems with its Vista operating system " .
However , Microsoft blogger and evangelist Robert Scoble wants Richards sacked .
Whenever you see a story that says 60 % of any OS is gonna be rewritten you should demand that the journalist who wrote that be immediately and publicly fired .
Totally 100 % incompetent .
Did NOT do their homework .
Dave Winer gives Richards " zero credence " and Alec Saunders also weighed in on the " hogwash " call .
But then Richards has also had people back him including Stowe Boyd and
Steve Gillmor who wrote to Scoble :
Stop calling for the head of a reporter or an editor or both about the 60 % code story .
Are you so sure that 's untrue ?
Or put it another way–are you so sure anyone except maybe Bill really knows how much code has to be rewritten , or thrown away , to meet a January deadline which most likely will also slip ?
For those of you who are trying to work out how much credence you want to assign the SmartHouse story , I thought , I 'd fill you in on who David Richards is , because it makes this little drama even the more delectable .
Firstly , the Scobleizer is n't going to be happy to hear , that it 's highly unlikely that Richards is going to be sacked , on account of the fact that he'd have to sack himself .
Richards is CEO and editorial director of 4Square Media , the publisher of the Smarthouse magazine and website .
So you can be pretty safe to assume that in this instance , Richards was journalist , editor and publisher .
So if you want to point your spears at anyone , there 's only one person you need go looking for .
Without a doubt , Richards is the most notorious and controversial technology journalist in Australia and it wo n't surprise anyone down under in the tech media or IT industries that he 's managed to get himself embroiled in this kind of saga .
First things , first .
Richards is a real , bona fide journalist .
He 's not an amateur blogger .
He 's not a techie , who took up a writing .
He 's got a Fleet Street background and was responsible for one of the most , important investigative journalism works ever published in Australia when his expose on the Painters and Dockers union uncovered extensive corruption and sparked a historical Royal Commission .
This ain't no tinpot IT product scoop , we 're talking about .
This is about as close as we 've gotten in Australia to a Watergate scandal .
Richards is also a successful entrepreneur .
He started a PR company , Weston Communications , which he built up and sold and following that he founded a publishing company DWR Media , which he flogged to US publisher Penton Media for up to $ US8 million ( Penton would about 2 years later offload the division for a pittance ) .
Along the way , though , he 's ticked a lot of people off .
He 's brash , pushy and thrives on controversy .
He always seems to be suing someone , or else being sued .
In the past few months , he 's been accused on plagiarism , attacked for conflicts of interest and laid a big , steelcapped boot into one of the world 's biggest PR companies .
He does , however , know a lot of people .
However , in his reporting , he constantly flies dangerously close to the wind ( a lot of reporters with track records for breaking news do though ) .
So would Richards report this story without checking facts or seeking out confirmation .
Absolutely .
Would he write this kind of report , if he did n't think it was true .
I do n't think so .
Would he sensationalise it ?
Yes .
Would he have access to a " Microsoft insider " who you would really trust with this level of information .
It 's possible .
Would I believe everything I ever read or hear from Richards .
No .
Would it surprise me if this story was , at least in part , true .
Absolutely not .
So what does Squash reckon ?
I think it 's mathematically impossible that Microsoft will be changing anything near 60 per cent of Vista code before release .
I think it 's more likely that Richard 's source has heard something along the lines that 60 per cent of code will need to be reviewed .
Is Microsoft stuggling with Vista ?
Abso - farking - lutely .
Not hitting that pre-Christmas deadline is one of , if not the BIGGEST screw - ups in Microsoft history .
You cannot possibly underestimate how much angst this is going to cause Microsoft 's hardware partners .
You cannot possibly underestimate how much this is going to ruin Microsoft 's Vista marketing plans .
With this delay , Microsoft has pretty much single - handedly ruined Christmas for the PC industry .
The single - biggest season for PC sales will flop because nobody is going to buy a PC when a new OS is just around the corner .
I 'm sure Microsoft and its PC partners will offer free Vista upgrades to people who buy Christmas PCs but that 's not going to be enough .
Hell , do you want to go through that upgrade process when you can wait a couple of months and have it pre-installed .
No way !
Which means Microsoft is n't going to be able to do any pre-launch marketing or else it 's hardware partners will tear them to shreds .
All this at a time , when Microsoft is under more competitive pressure than it 's ever been before .
If ever PC makers needed a reason to offer alternative operating systems to Windows , this will be it !
Christmas - time Linux PCs ?
Guaranteed .
And stand by for Apple to crank up the marketing like never before .
This is an opportunity they simply will be salivating over .
So , for Microsoft to have delayed this one , there has to be major issues .
All of which re-affirms everything I 've learnt in dealing with David for the last ten years .
Take everything he says with a grain of salt , but do listen , because more often than not somewhere in amongst the barrage , there 's nuggets of truth and sometimes they 're gold .

「キー入力がやたら速かったり，記憶力がよかったり，機械的な作業を間違わずにできたりすることは，優秀な技術者になるのを妨げるかもしれない」。永和システムマネジメントの角谷信太郎氏は2006年2月10日，東京・目黒で開催された開発者向けカンファレンス「
Developers Summit 2006（デブサミ2006）」の講演でこう語った。技術者には，単調な仕事をコンピュータにより自動化する「プロジェクト・オートメーション（PA）」の考え方が必須だという。
角谷氏は，オブジェクト指向やソフトウエア設計に造詣の深かった故
石井勝氏が，技術者の必須項目として挙げていた2項目をまず紹介。石井氏が挙げる「同じことを2度しない（Only and Only OnceあるいはDRY ：Do n't Repeat Yourself ） 」 「必ずやる作業は自動化できないかと考える」の2項目を追求する
“ 態度 ” こそが重要だと述べた。つま り「 PAとは態度である 」（角谷氏）。
ただ， 「自動化したいときに自動化できるかどうか」は，普段の鍛錬すなわち“素振り”にかかっている点を指摘。スターロジック代表取締役の羽生章洋氏が「レジのレシートを使った，普段からのERモデル作成トレーニング」を推奨していることを挙げ，「いきなりホームランを打とうとしても無理。普段からの素振りが重要」だとした。素振りの内容としては，書籍「達人プログラマー——ソフトウェア開発に不可欠な基礎知識
バージョン管理/ユニットテスト/自動化」（アスキー発行）に書かれている「ビルド・マネジメント」「リリース・マネジメント 」「リポジトリ・マネージメント」を挙げた。
角谷氏は ，PAとプロジェクトを円滑に進めるための「プロジェクト・ファシリテーション（PF，参考記事）」との関連についても触れた。PAは単なる自動化というよりは，事故が起こった場合の対処を含めた“自働化”であることを説明。機械的な作業をコンピュータに任せることで，人に対して「これやっとけ」と言うのではなく，人間にしかできない作業をさせられるようになるとした。つまり「PAはPFをファシリテート（促進）する」（角谷氏）。PFが「人と人とのインタラクション」であるのに対し，PAは「人とコンピュータとのインタラクション」であり，表裏一体だという。
角谷氏は 「プロジェクトは何のためにあるのか」についても考察。結論は 「 “ 価値 ” あ る “ 動作可能 な ” ソフトウエアを提供し続けること」であると主張した。この“ 公理”
の前では開発プロセスの違いは誤差程度のものだという。また，この公理を踏まえたうえで，「設計は人の仕事」であり，「製造＝ビルドはコンピュータの仕事」であると指摘した。「設計成果物がソースコード，設計検証物がテストコード」であり「ビルド成果物がリリース可能なバイナリ」である。人とコンピュータがコラボレートして「価値ある動作可能なソフトウエア」を提供するわけだ。ただし，自動化はやりすぎるときりがないため，深追いは禁物だとも指摘した。
最後に角谷氏は，アーキテクチャについて触れた。「アーキテクチャは設計のうちでみんなが大切だと思うもの」であり「特定の個人がアーキテクトだというのは間違いで，全プログラマがアーキテクトになるべき」だという。これを同氏は「PAはプログラマ全員が責任を持つ」と表現して締めくくった。
The lines were painted around the car 's tyres
Nasser Khan returned to his car to find the line had been painted while he was away - and a ticket issued .
The incident in Salford was caught on camera by an office worker .
Mr Khan also says that the painting equipment damaged his tyres .
Salford City Council said it would look into Mr Khan 's claims .
The gap in the line had been left after recent roadworks , and had not initially been painted because a car was parked there overnight .
Mr Khan , 28 , a marketing consultant , said : " I thought I was lucky to get the space but I did n't think I would get a ticket because it was a legitimate parking area .
" I could n't believe they painted the line underneath my vehicle .
Mr Khan 's ticket was cancelled after he contacted the council
" Luckily I had a note on my windscreen from the guys in the nearby office which explained what had happened , otherwise I would have driven off unaware . "
He added : " I took the car to a garage and I was told the tyres were unroadworthy .
I could have had a blow - out at any time . "
Design engineer Geoff Blackburn watched the incident from his office .
Mr Blackburn said : " We saw a group of workmen and two traffic wardens surround the car for several minutes .
" One of the workmen came back and crouched under the car to paint the yellow line , and then the traffic warden issued the ticket . "
Mr Khan said the parking ticket had since been quashed by Salford City Council .
A council spokesman said : " This ticket was cancelled promptly as soon as the driver made us fully aware of the circumstances in which it was issued .
" If he feels he has a further complaint to make then he will have to produce evidence so we can investigate his claims . "

Why I Am Not a Libertarian
I thought about entitling this essay " Two Cheers For Libertarianism . "
On civil liberties matters , I am perfectly libertarian ; in fact , I have just delivered a briefing paper on the pervasiveness doctrine to the Cato Institute , and hope to write more for them on topics such as anonymity and mandatory ratings systems .
But there are other libertarian positions , such as that against anti-discrimination laws , which shock the conscience ; like Hayek , I believe that there are things worth doing that the free market cannot do .
Here then , is an attempt to outline what is good about libertarianism , and then contrast what does n't make sense .
The conclusion I draw is that like most human belief systems , libertarianism mixes practicality with some idealism unrelated to human nature .
Therefore , as much as I sympathize with most of the diagnoses and some of the prescriptions , I am not a libertarian .
Big government v. little government
When I was a child , someone asked me what my favorite color was , and I replied " Blue . "
A day later , I went to the store and selected a red bicycle , to replace the worn out red bike in the garage .
I realized that the color I thought I favored was not the one I actually selected .
In preparing this essay , I had a similar insight about government .
Though I have been quick to say that there are things the free market cannot do , that must be done by government , I have made choices in my own life that led me away from government regulation as much as possible .
I left a regulated profession for an unregulated one .
It matters to me that the government does not attempt to tell software developers how to write code .
Though I believe that government - backed unions served an important purpose in securing advances for American workers , I am also happy that as an employer I do not have to deal with the Teamsters ( " We say the word , and not a line of code moves in this facility ! " ) .
I have rebelled in my life against government actions such as the Vietnam war .
Every time I take a close look at any process owned by the government , wther it is immigration or the air traffic control system , I am horrified by the inefficient way it is handled .
And , as a civil libertarian , I have been a plaintiff in the Communications Decency Act case to invalidate an Internet censorship law passed by Congress and backed by the President .
Confidence in government is at an all time low ; most people believe that the government is inept at almost any project , whether that project consists of curing poverty , reforming health care , fostering the arts , or launching the space shuttle Challenger .
Nevertheless , as libertarians are quick to point out , most traditional liberals and conservatives believe in a role for big government somewhere :
Conservatives want to be your daddy , telling you what to do and what not to do .
Liberals want to be your mommy , feeding you , tucking you in , and wiping your nose .
-- David Boaz , Libertarianism : A Primer
Conservatives , in other words , want the government to intervene in matters of private morality such as sex , sexual preference , abortion and pornography .
Conversely , they want the government to stay away from regulating business and markets .
Liberals want the opposite : perfect freedom of action in the moral sphere , and a vigilant , interventive government in the business sphere .
Looked at this way , libertarians are the only consistent party : they want the government small and far away for all purposes ; they do n't want it involved in what we can read or see at the movies , nor do they want it telling us we must hire black people or can't hire children .
A classic example of big - government thinking is Professor Catharine Mackinnon , a Marxist and anti-pornography feminist who believes that government perpetuates sexism and pornography , yet drafts ordinances that would ban as pornography any work depicting violence against women .
She thus calls upon government to intervene in our lives to do the opposite of what she believes it now does , without being able to explain how we should bring about the revolution in the minds of men required to accomplish her goals .
It seems clear that in the minds of most big - government types there is a dichotomy : there is the real government , the one we perceive with our senses and distrust , and there is the fantasy government , the one we all believe we could have if we just worked a little harder , voted in larger numbers , turned the rascals out , and perhaps made some changes to our laws .
Somehow , we fail to perceive any inconsistency between the two versions of government ; perhaps this failure is based in our own need for self - deception , much like the unbridgeable gap between the " ought " and the " is " which Hume pointed out .
Libertarians , then , are better diagnosticians than most of us when they say that the odds are infinitesmally small that we can have a better big government , much like a doctor counselling you not to depend too much on the cancer going into remission .
Libertarianism and the Tragedy of the Commons
The tragedy of the commons is a first - rate device for testing the efficiency of any human proposal for governing ourselves .
The tragedy of the commons is essentially a parable with a moral , like an Aesop 's Fable .
In the parable , we all live in a village that shares a commons on which we , farmers all , graze our sheep .
The moral of the story is that left to our own devices , we will each decide to add one sheep too many to the commons , destroying it for ourselves and for future generations .
The short term benefit to each of us of an additional sheep outweighs the intangible gain of preserving the commons for our grandchildren .
David Boaz gives us the libertarian take on the " tragedy of the commons " :
When resources -- such as a common grazing area , forest or lake -- are " owned " by everyone , they are effectively owned by no - one .
No one has an incentive to maintain the value of the asset or use it on a sustainable basis .
In other words , the libertarian answer to the tragedy of the commons is to eliminate the commons .
No commons , no tragedy .
If the commons was owned by a single individual who charged everyone else grazing fees , he would be more committed to preserving it for the future than a village of farmers .
But why is this necessarily so ?
I could argue the converse , that a village acting collectively is more likely to avoid short - term thinking than one man responsible only to himself .
Hume made the point that in most moral philosophizing , we carry on talking about the " is " until , suddenly , in mid-paragraph , we encounter an " ought " .
There is no real - world bridge from the " is " to the " ought " ; all such bridges are fantasies based on optimism and self - deception .
Where libertarianism crosses this chasm is when it passes from selfishness to enlightened self - interest .
A human being who owns the Pennekamp coral reef in Key Largo is entitled to break up the reefs and sell the pieces to gift shops ( in the absence of a government expressing the will of the majority and telling him he can 't . )
He ought to realize that there is more gain in selling tickets to Pennekamp over many generations -- that way , it will support his children and grandchildren as well .
But most human beings , left in complete freedom to act , will select the short - term gain .
This is what the Prisoner 's Dilemma teaches : we will select betrayal over cooperation because it grants an immediate benefit more tangible to us than the repetitive , long - term benefits of cooperation .
Individuals and groups
An apparent paradox of libertarianism is that humans can be trusted individually but not in groups .
A democratic government consists of humans acting as a group .
The government carries out the will of the group .
In Rousseau 's terms , it carries out not only the will of the majority , but in a sense , even of the dissenting minority , who despite their disagreement with the particular action , endorse the majority will by continuing to participate in the society .
Libertarians believe , therefore , that we are singularly inept as a group .
Assuming for a moment that the proposition is true -- there is a lot of evidence for it -- a cynic would propose that the reason we are collectively incompetent is that we are individually incompetent as well .
Libertarians , however , are optimists .
I cannot fault them for this ; I have written elsewhere about the importance of optimism in any human scheme , even to the point of self - deception .
Nonetheless , libertarians assume , as most people do , that there is a way out of any given dilemma ; their self - deception may consist of believing that what we cannot accomplish collectively , we can more effectively do individually .
Let 's take a look again at the Pennekamp reef example .
Testing the proposition that commons should not exist because they will always be mismanaged , let 's try a thought experiment .
Who would you rather have manage the Pennekamp coral reef so that it will remain alive , clean and available for future generations : fifty randomly picked people , or one ?
Libertarians would say that fifty people , if they were acting as a government , will inevitably destroy Pennekamp , while one person , following a profit motive , is more likely to regard it as being in his self - interest to preserve it for the long term .
But I think there is substantial reason to look at this the other way .
Any one person you pick from the street may wish to break up the coral and sell it to souvenir shops , make a quick million and retire .
If you randomly pick fifty people , chances are much greater that most of them will appreciate the benefits of preserving Pennekamp for the future .
Thus , acting collectively has a smoothing effect : recognizing that we really do share some agreements as a culture which we may call values , the more of us we involve in the Pennekamp decision - making the more likely it is that we will make a decision reflecting these common values .
In fact , in the classic tragedy of the commons , the tragedy happens because the villagers are not deciding collectively how many sheep to add .
The tragedy happens because each individual using the commons has the right to think selfishly - - exactly as an individual who owned the land might do .
" Public " v. " private " motives
A libertarian might , I suppose , respond that I am on a false trail here .
It is not the issue of the many versus the one ; it is the issue of government versus private enterprise .
Looked at this way , fifty people acting as a government will ruin Pennekamp , while fifty acting as a corporate board of directors will not .
Correspondingly , one person acting as a government will ruin Pennekamp , while one person acting as Pennekamp 's private owner will not .
It is not the number of actors that is relevant , but the motive .
I suppose that this argument would go as follows : when we try to act in the public interest , we always make a hash of things .
When we acknowledge that only selfishness works , that it is the fuel that drives all human endeavor , only then can we create efficient forms of human interaction .
I believe that libertarians are right about this up to a significant point .
Like most human belief systems , libertarianism must fight the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the reality of fuzzy thinking .
Because things fall apart , because we are constantly dealing with a fuzzy , unknowable and changing reality , because human values are not absolutes and it sometimes require some illogic to arrive at the destinations of the heart , all human belief structures are of necessity incomplete .
Our optimism and self - deception usually does not permit us to acknowledge this .
A belief system is always part building and part blueprint , a combination of the is and the ought .
The building may be a small shack , and the blueprint a tower extending out of sight into the sky .
In the case of libertarianism , the building 's foundation is the failure of government ; but the blueprint soaring away into the cerulean blue is the idea that selfishness is the key to long term thinking and enlightened behavior .
Libertarians are right that most supply and demand decisions are best made by a free marketplace .
As I have said elsewhere , I too am a capitalist .
I believe that Hayek was right about government planning versus free markets .
But what libertarians do not acknowledge is that there are a subset of decisions , mostly about commons -- which I define as anything which has a non-economic value to us as a group -- which can not be left to the marketplace .
Even Hayek acknowledged this :
[ T ]he price system becomes similarly ineffective when the damage caused to others by certain uses of property cannot effectively be charged to the owner of that property .
In all these instances there is a divergence between the items which enter into private calculation and those which affect social welfare ; and whenever this divergence becomes important , some method other than competition may have to be found to supply the services in question .
Garrett Hardin had n't yet coined the phrase " tragedy of the commons " when Hayek wrote , but this is exactly what is under discussion here .
Hayek goes on to give examples : the building of roads , creation of signs on those roads , avoidance of harmful effects of deforestation and of pollution are all matters which cannot be trusted to the marketplace .
" In such instances , " Hayek says , " we must find some substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism . "
Bringing this home to our Pennekamp example : breaking up the coral reef will harm the fishermen who fish the peripheries of the reef ; it will harm the tourism operators who bring people to nearby resorts ; and it will harm all of us who believe that our lives are better because there are coral reefs in the world .
Trying to transform non-economic values into economic ones creates an auction in which we must pay Pennekamp 's owner more for to preserve the reef than the market will pay him to destroy it ; but then are we not back at government intervention ?
There is no distinction between the government acting as a collector of funds to subsidize the reef owner and the unhappy spectacle of paying farmers not to plant wheat .
And if we are postulating a market in which enough of us must want to write checks directly to the reef owner to incent him not to ruin the reef , then , in my opinion , we are making an argument for the existence of commons and of governments .
Because otherwise we are left without a coral reef .
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Libertarians are fond of talking about " spontaneous order " .
For example , the common law is an example of a complex structure of practical rules developed by people over the centuries , before government took over the job of making the laws .
The stock and bond markets do n't exist because of laws and regulations , but in spite of them ; businesspeople spontaneously created these markets for convenience ' sake .
Your ability to use a credit card anywhere in the world is a result not of government rules but of " spontaneous order " .
There is a lot of truth in this ; most of the progress we have made is the result of just letting people work out convenient schemes while forbidding the use of force .
In that sense , the libertarian free market scheme mirrors nature , where complex structures build up over time , and then die off if surrounding conditions change so that they are no longer warranted .
Life is a battle against the Second Law of Thermodynamics , seeking to build up structures and resist decay .
Does the Second Law have its equivalent in the business world ?
And should it ?
It does and should .
If by 2100 , IBM becomes a fifteen person company making hand - tooled working replicas of the RS - 6000 , that is the way of the world .
Government intervention to prop up a failing company is a short - term way to preserve jobs while saddling the market with old or inferior products .
As Charles Murray points out , the best way for the government to create jobs might be to prohibit the use of farm equipment .
Most of us , other than hardcore Luddites , do n't really want this .
Most people , instead , are comfortable with the idea of a form of natural selection in the marketplace .
Over the past few decades , for example , we have bled manufacturing jobs and proliferated software jobs . .
Companies do n't only end when they go bankrupt ; they may disappear after being merged or divided into pieces .
In fact , a dangerous moment for many privately held companies , like other property , comes at the death of an owner , when the assets are divided according to the individual 's will .
Again , we think of this as normal , if sometimes regrettable .
The American system of inheritance has been described as a democratizing force , as opposed to the medieval European doctrine , which kept the estate together in the hands of the oldest son .
As a business owner , I would not support any law that limited my right to sell or divide my company ; though I believe many such actions are immoral in their effect on my employees , I do n't want government involved in making them .
Law and morality should not be coextensive .
But do I really want the same set of rules to apply to Pennekamp Reef ?
Libertarians would have me believe that it will be cleaner , healthier , stocked with more fish , generally better taken care of , if privately owned .
But ownership includes the right to divide it into lots and sell them .
Some lot owners may decide to preserve their portion of the reef , while others may decide to dynamite theirs , release foreign fish species , or release pollutants -- and each small owner would have a perfect right to do so under libertarian theory .
But Pennekamp
Reef is not really a sub - divideable entity ; until science perfects Star Trek - type force fields , actions taken on any section of the reef affect the whole thing .
If Pennekamp Reef is subdivided , I believe it will die much faster than it will in the hands of government .
David Boaz does n't agree ; in fact , he thinks the oceans should be privatized , though he never says how :
One of the biggest environmental problems today is the depletion of ocean fisheries , a clear example of the tragedy of the commons for which a privatization solution is urgently needed .
The idea of a private ocean boggles the imagination even more than that of a privately owned coral reef .
For the answer , we have to look to Charles Murray , whose What It Means to be a Libertarian takes a less dogmatic view .
Murray acknowledges -- as Boaz apparently does not -- that there is a small but irreducible class of truly public goods , which must be managed by government .
He defines these as " nonexclusive " , meaning there is no way to subdivide them , and " jointly consumable " , which means that they can be used by one person without diminishing availability to another .
The example Murray gives is clean air , which cannot be divided into parcels , but which can be breathed by one person without denying it to another .
I think Pennekamp Reef fits Murray 's definition of a public good ; you can't subdivide it , meaning that foreign species or pollution released on one portion of it will invade the rest , and it is jointly consumable , meaning that one diver or fisherman using it does not deny it to another .
Libertarian Theory and Social Darwinism
This leads us to my major argument against libertarianism : part of its doctrine is intellectually dishonest .
This is not to say libertarians are liars ; the best way to deceive anyone else is to deceive yourself first .
And libertarians have no corner on the market in deceptive reasoning ; other belief systems are fond of it too .
If , as their system implies , libertarians really want to leave the consensual human world of interaction free to imitate the process of natural selection , why wo n't they just say so ?
An honest if repellent argument would go something like the following :
" Nature does n't prop us species that no longer make the grade due to changed circumstances .
Most of us agree that government should n't prop up businesses that can no longer compete , due to wasteful ways or outdated technology .
So why do we feel that government should create a safety net for people who can no longer pull their weight ? "
Ebenezer Scrooge at least was honest : " Let them die and decrease the surplus population . "
Libertarians ( and traditional conservatives , who want big government only in other areas ) instead argue that the free market approach will miraculously eliminate poverty .
Among the arguments you can find in Boaz 's book ( and in Newt Gingrich's ) : private charity will step up to the plate for the truly needy .
Deprived of a culture of dependency , many others will discover that they can , after all , pull their own economic weight in our society .
An end to government intervention will result in a heady rush of job creation , benefiting the bottom layers of society .
And so forth .
All of these statements are true , to an extent .
Some people will be taken care of private charity .
Some will discover that they can work after all .
Some who formerly could n't find jobs will get them as the economy expands and unemployment decreases .
And some will be worse off or will die .
In order to conduct an honest dialog , we would need to focus on the latter class and ask how many ?
How many will constitute acceptable losses ?
Ten million ?
One thousand ?
One ?
None ?
In fact , both private business and government make such decisions every day .
Suppose you could make a perfectly safe automobile , but it would cost one million dollars .
Few people would buy it .
So we find the compromise point at which people feel that there is enough safety and a low enough price that they are comfortable taking their chances .
In this context , Ford 's execrated decision to continue manufacturing the Pinto with the risky fuel tank becomes a normal , if unfortunate , cost - benefit analysis : it was less expensive to pay a few wrongful death judgments than to redesign the car .
If you are proposing to redesign the society in which we live , that 's fine ; it certainly needs some changes .
Just tell me what the costs are .
But do n't tell me that its free .
I have rarely met a libertarian or a conservative who would acknowledge that their plan for society would also cost a few lives ( though they believe the status quo costs many ) .
Even Murray deflects away from this issue .
He acknowledges that " what becomes of those who are helpless , or luckless , or perhaps simply feckless , must deeply concern any human being worthy of the name . "
But , right on the heels of this insight -- which I am certain is not shared by many who call themselves conservative or libertarian -- he says : " There can be no such thing as a society free of human suffering . "
No matter what social and economic system is put in place , some proportion of children will be neglected , some adults will be desperately lonely , some people will suffer terrible accidents and diseases that leave them incapacitated , and some people will live in squalor .
Fair enough ; any realistic proposal must acknowledge this , though dogmatic libertarianism apparently does not .
But Murray gets squeamish when it comes to the question of how much suffering is a worthy exchange for the greater liberty he envisions .
" I do not consider reducing poverty the top priority of a civilized society , " Murray says .
" Protecting human freedom is . "
Again , this is an acceptable goal ; but Murray has just described a transaction ( trading some amount of security for some amount of liberty ) without describing the cost .
Are n't we entitled to know the cost in order to make the decision ?
Murray also skirts the issue in his discussion of health insurance .
While acknowledging that this is an area where reasonable people may differ -- some almost - libertarians want to reform but not end government involvement in health care -- Murray concludes that " [ o ] n balance ... we would be better off if the government stayed out of the health care business altogether . "
What about the people who are left out ?
Who do n't or perhaps cannot buy catastrophic health insurance ?
Who do n't have enough money to pay even for routine medical care ?
He has asked the right question , but provides no answer .
We really neede to know two things :
How many of them are there ?
And how many will die or become extremely ill if we get government out of the health care business ?
Virtually every type of government decision makes someone happier and someone else unhappier ; but health care falls more than most into the category of decisions that literally mean life or death for someone .
So , once again , in order to determine that the net gain is worth it , do n't I first need to know the cost in lives ?
By the way , we need this data irrespective of the wisdom of the decision we are considering reversing .
Let 's look for a second at rent control / rent stabilization in New York City .
On the one hand , I have benefited from living in rent stabilized apartments ( I do not live in one now ) .
On the other hand , I would never wish to be a landlord in New York City , because of the stifling regulations you have to deal with .
So let 's assume for a moment that the whole program , instituted during World War II , was a gross mistake .
Nevertheless , we went ahead and made it .
Before correcting it , should n't we know how many people we will make homeless ?
Presumably , there are some .
Most rent stabilized tenants will pay higher prices , or find cheaper housing elsewhere , even if it means leaving New York .
But some number will live on the streets .
In figuring out how to right the wrong imposed on landlords , should n't we nevertheless know if we are going to render just one person homeless , or one million ?
Murray does n't answer his own question about the costs of ending government involvement in health care .
Instead , he tells us that without government , doctors are more charitable , and will pick up some number of the uninsured at reduced fees .
Some , but how many ?
Do n't we need to know ?
Or would n't it be more honest to say " Unregulated is better , and whatever losses are needed in order to get there are acceptable " ?
Libertarianism , Compassion and Race
I will never stop arguing that certain actions must be taken based on compassion , even if they cannot be logically justified ; logic untempered by compassion is no more human than compassion unaltered by logic .
Libertarianism , as a belief system , is completely logical but rather horrifying in its premise that laws against racial discrimination are an interference in individual liberty .
If I open a coffee shop , the Libertarian argument goes , I should be completely free to decide who enters my property .
If I have this right , then I am free to exclude black people .
Libertarians like to add that I would be stupid to make such a decision , as the restaurant next door , serving a larger and more diverse clientele , will probably be more profitable .
In analyzing such laws , we might distinguish , as Libertarians do not , between laws which level the playing field ( you must serve anyone who enters ) and laws which promote particular groups ( you must hire at least ten percent black waiters ) .
Many people who support the former oppose the latter .
Perfect consistency can lead to perfectly horrifying systems ; there is an argument that it always does .
The Cambodian killing fields were a completely logical place , as long as you accept the basic premise .
Human systems are a composite of logic , custom , common sense and ( one hopes ) compassion .
We have lived with it for more than two hundred years , so it may seem natural in retrospect , but there is nothing simple and logical about our system of senators and representatives , our three divisions of government , or the respective powers of each .
It is a human system , cobbled together with a little logic and a lot of instinct , and some compassion for the minority whose rights were protected by the prohibition of an establishment of religion .
We are not called upon to justify the details of every disposition we make ; we can live with inconsistencies where grand goals are served , and have always done so .
For example , Professor Catharine Mackinnon calls attention to a fundamental conflict between the First Amendment and the Fifth : the latter promotes equality , and the former is construed to protect speech that denies equality .
She points out that equality trumps speech in the marketplace ( I cannot pin up a Playboy centerfold over my cubicle for fear of offending a coworker ) while speech trumps equality everywhere else ( I can sell all the Playboy magazines I want in my candy store or keep them in my home , though it offends the sensibility of my peers ) .
The answer is that we are not called upon to reconcile all clashing schemes on the most detailed level , where greater goals are served .
In the example which concerns Mackinnon , society has decided that equality of opportunity in the marketplace appropriately trumps the right to free speech there , but nowhere else .
Libertarians would agree that the employer has a right to ban such speech -- under the libertarian scheme , I can require my workers to be all white or all male , or to declare Tuesday to be Wednesday , or wear their underwear on the outside , to steal a page from Woody Allen .
If they do n't want to do so , let them find another job ; and if I am too restrictive or crazy , I wo n't be able to find workers .
So , according to libertarians , the state is not really infringing the worker 's right to the centerfold , since the worker has no right to do anything in the workplace the employer disapproves .
It is appropriating only the right of the employer to permit the employee to post the centerfold .
It is acting in the employers ' stead , making the rule that society expects the employer to make .
Certainly this is a restriction on his freedom of action , as is a law saying he cannot beat his workers .
But , up until now , libertarians have been arguing Millian liberty , that we should all be free to do whatever does not harm anyone else .
Here , they seem to be crossing over into an absolute freedom based on property rights whichincludes a qualified right to harm others in the use of one 's own property .
Libertarians are here on the horns of the dilemma I described above .
One consistent and realistic , if repugnant , position would be , " Freedom of association is everything , and it trumps equality , no matter what the consequences . "
But libertarians always seem to draw back from those last five words .
Instead , they resort to the good hearts of private humans , and claim that we will reach the same goal of equality faster , better and cheaper by leaving people to their own devices .
Murray points out that antidicrimination laws were not needed to allow Irish and Jews access to opportunity and social status in the earlier years of this century .
I am an employer .
I do not wish to be forced to hire anyone who cannot do the job - - nor do I feel that I am forced to do so by current law .
I do not want or need the right to post a sign on my door saying that no blacks need apply .
I myself , as a Jew , could not feel equal in a society in which a store could post a sign saying " No Jews or dogs permitted . "
I feel perfectly equal in a society in which someone can publish a book saying that " No Jews or dogs should be permitted . "
The latter is speech , but the placard banning me from a store is action .
I had the experience once of living in a neighborhood in Paris where I could n't get my hair cut .
One barber told me he was booked for the rest of the week , while another across the street simply let me sit in his shop for an hour , while he took customers who had come in after me .
I believe this was action , not speech .
A libertarian would say that the barber 's property right extends to refusing to cut the hair of anyone for any reason .
Note , however , that the employer uses public goods -- the air , municipal water , police , garbage collection .
If he has property rights enabling him to deny service to anyone , why is it so much different if the government denies him service based on his failure to comply with certain rules ?
He can always move elsewhere .
If hate was pervasive , individual property rights could be used ( and have been used , at certain times and places in thsi country ) to deny an entire group access to the free market entirely -- no access to credit , no ability to rent a storefront or to buy goods from anyone , or even groceries for one 's family .
I think the true test of the libertarian scheme is whether an impoverished but talented individual from a disfavored group could get a start in it .
If the rest of the individuals could legally band together to starve him to death , as they could do under the libertarian theory of property rights , we have gone far beyond Mill 's theory of liberty , to a monstrous selfishness , a tyranny of the individual over society .
Laws against racial discrimination are effectively an action of the heart .
They are legal under our constitution , they are morally right , and they constitute one of the infringements on perfect personal liberty that I am happy to see .
This is one of those areas where I do not believe the free market would ever solve the problem .
Conclusion
I have painted myself into a corner : big government does n't work , and though the free market is the perfect solution to problems of supply and demand , there are certain areas of human aspiration which are best served by commons , common interests , common actions .
Therefore , there are certain zones in which the free market is just as inept as big government .
All of which is another way of saying that humans are inept at managing their destiny - - a proposition for which I see significant evidence every time I read a newspaper , take a subway , or have a conversation .
So , should we give up ?
No ; we can , motivated by the foolish but sustaining optimism that has always kept us alive , realistically work for the best accomodation of bad systems -- hoping that the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts , as it is with the best of human endeavors .
Let 's use the free market where possible , and government where necessary .
When I paddle my kayak in Hither Hills State Park in Montauk , I 'm glad it belongs to all of us .
I just got back from the US after Hack Day and I ’ve been away a while and I ’d forgotten what a wreck my flat had become in the build - up to Future of Web Apps .
Anyway , I ’d been recently introduced to the OSX time - lapse app Gawker and I sort of wondered whether making a bit of a performance out of the whole thing might be a suitable self - motivator !
And it totally was !
Here ’s the result – two hours of post - work cleaning in sixty seconds !
And now with added Hoff !
Why do n’t you have a go too ?
I love the idea of a whole Internet full of performance cleaning .
There ’s a slightly higher quality version in Quicktime of the whole thing here : Cleaning my flat in sixty seconds .
Even in Sunni - dominated Anbar Province , where insurgents are carrying out a vicious guerrilla war against foreign troops , a handful of leaders are asking American commanders to rein in Iraqi paramilitary units .
Sheiks in Falluja often complain to American officers there of harassment , raids or indiscriminate shooting by Iraqi forces .
A year ago , the party of Tariq al - Hashemi , a hard - line Sunni Arab who is one of Iraq ’s two vice presidents , was calling for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops .
“ The situation is different now , ” Mr. Hashemi said .
“ I do n’t want the Americans to say bye - bye .
Tomorrow , if they were to leave the country , there would be a security vacuum , and that would lead inevitably to civil war . ”
Zalmay Khalilzad , the American ambassador to Iraq , has been at the forefront of American efforts to bring Sunni Arabs into the political process .
Part of that strategy is to crack down on Shiite militias and push for amnesty for some guerrillas .
This month the American military has stepped up operations against the Mahdi Army , a volatile Shiite militia , and the top American commander , Gen. George W. Casey Jr. , said last Wednesday that the Americans would hunt down “ death squads ” that are a driving force behind the rising bloodshed .
Some Shiite leaders deride the American policy toward Sunnis as appeasement .
“ This strategy will destroy their goal of establishing democracy in Iraq , ” said Abbas al - Bayati , a prominent Shiite legislator .
“ Compromising with the insurgency will encourage the insurgents to do more and more violence in the region . ”
Investigations into possible wrongdoing by American troops in two major cases — the deaths of 24 civilians in Haditha last November , and the rape and murder of a 14 - year - old girl and the killing of her family in Mahmudiya in March — have ignited anger among Sunnis , but not nearly to the same degree as they might have in 2004 , when the Abu Ghraib prisoner scandal emerged .
But back then , Iraq had not crept to the brink of full - scale civil war .
every once in a while I have something to say
Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea
A frequently occurring idea for IP tunneling applications is to run a protocol like PPP , which encapsulates IP packets in a format suited for a stream transport ( like a modem line ) , over a TCP - based connection .
This would be an easy solution for encrypting tunnels by running PPP over SSH , for which several recommendations already exist ( one in the Linux HOWTO base , one on my own website , and surely several others ) .
It would also be an easy way to compress arbitrary IP traffic , while datagram based compression has hard to overcome efficiency limits .
Unfortunately , it does n't work well .
Long delays and frequent connection aborts are to be expected .
Here is why .
TCP 's retransmission algorithm
TCP divides the data stream into segments which are sent as individual IP datagrams .
The segments carry a sequence number which numbers the bytes in the stream , and an acknowledge number which tells the other side the last received sequence number .
[ RFC793 ]
Since IP datagrams may be lost , duplicated or reordered , the sequence numbers are used to reassemble the stream .
The acknowledge number tells the sender , indirectly , if a segment was lost : when an acknowledge for a recently sent segment does not arrive in a certain amount of time , the sender assumes a lost packet and re-sends that segment .
Many other protocols using a similar approach , designed mostly for use over lines with relatively fixed bandwidth , have the " certain amount of time " fixed or configurable .
In the Internet however , parameters like bandwidth , delay and loss rate are vastly different from one connection to another and even changing over time on a single connection .
A fixed timeout in the seconds range would be inappropriate on a fast LAN and likewise inappropriate on a congested international link .
In fact , it would increase the congestion and lead to an effect known as " meltdown " .
For this reason , TCP uses adaptive timeouts for all timing - related parameters .
They start at conservative estimates and change dynamically with every received segment .
The actual algorithms used are described in [ RFC2001 ] .
The details are not important here but one critical property : when a segment timeouts , the following timeout is increased ( exponentially , in fact , because that has been shown to avoid the meltdown effect ) .
Stacking TCPs
The TCP timeout policy works fine in the Internet over a vast range of different connection characteristics .
Because TCP tries very hard not to break connections , the timeout can increase up to the range of several minutes .
This is just what is sensible for unattended bulk data transfer .
( For interactive applications , such slow connections are of course undesirable and likely the user will terminate them . )
This optimization for reliability breaks when stacking one TCP connection on top of another , which was never anticipated by the TCP designers .
But it happens when running PPP over SSH or another TCP - based protocol , because the PPP - encapsulated IP datagrams likely carry TCP - based payload , like this :
Note that the upper and the lower layer TCP have different timers .
When an upper layer connection starts fast , its timers are fast too .
Now it can happen that the lower connection has slower timers , perhaps as a leftover from a period with a slow or unreliable base connection .
Imagine what happens when , in this situation , the base connection starts losing packets .
The lower layer TCP queues up a retransmission and increases its timeouts .
Since the connection is blocked for this amount of time , the upper layer ( i.e. payload ) TCP wo n't get a timely ACK , and will also queue a retransmission .
Because the timeout is still less than the lower layer timeout , the upper layer will queue up more retransmissions faster than the lower layer can process them .
This makes the upper layer connection stall very quickly and every retransmission just adds to the problem - an internal meltdown effect .
TCPs reliability provisions backfire here .
The upper layer retransmissions are completely unnecessary , since the carrier guarantees delivery - but the upper layer TCP can't know this , because TCP always assumes an unreliable carrier .
Practical experience
The whole problem was the original incentive to start the CIPE project , because I used a PPP over SSH solution for some time and it proved to be fairly unusable .
At that time it had to run over an optical link which suffered frequent packet loss , sometimes 10 - 20 % over an extended period of time .
With plain TCP , this was just bearable ( because the link was not congested ) , but with the stacked protocols , connections would get really slow and then break very frequently .
This is the detailed reason why CIPE uses a datagram carrier .
( The choice for UDP , instead of another IP - level protocol like IPsec does , is for several reasons : this allows to distinguish tunnels by their port number , and it adds the ability to run over SOCKS . )
The datagram carrier has exactly the same characteristics as plain IP , for which TCP was designed to run over .
A few weeks ago I had lunch with the now famous " Mark Jen " .
I never knew Mark while we were at Microsoft , even though we both worked in the same group .
Funny how large groups at Microsoft can get ... We had a great Google style lunch at a sunny table in Mountain View .
I was too dense to notice that Mark was doing research for his blog .
One thing he said got me thinking ...
Something that many have said over the years , that Microsoft " knows how to ship software " .
Being a 16 year Microsoft veteran , a Distinguished Engineer , key architect and code writer for windows , architect of the largest source code control and build system ever attempted , I deeply believed that Microsoft knows how to ship software .
We know how to build it , test it , localize it , manufacture it , charge lots of $ $$ for it , etc .
Mark and I talked about this briefly at lunch that day , and I have been thinking about it from time to time since ... I am not sure I believe anymore , that Microsoft " knows how to ship software " .
When a Microsoft engineer fixes a minor defect , makes something faster or better , makes an API more functional and complete , how do they " ship " that software to me ?
I know the answer and so do you ...
The software sits in a source code control system for a minimum of two years ( significantly longer for some of the early Longhorn code ) .
At some point , the product that the fix is a part of will " ship " meaning that CD 's will be pressed and delivered to customers and OEM's .
In best case scenarios , the software will reach end users a few months after the Release To Manufacturing ( RTM ) date .
In many cases , particularly for users working in large corporations , they wo n't see the software for a year or more post RTM ... Consider the .NET framework for a second .
Suppose you wrote something innocent like a screen saver , written in C# based on the .NET framework .
How would you as an ISV " ship your software " ?
You can't .
Not unless you sign up to ship Microsoft 's software as well .
You see , the .NET Framework is n't widely deployed .
It is present on a small fraction of machines in the world .
Microsoft built the software , tested it , released it to manufacturing .
They " shipped it " , but it will take years for it to be deployed widely enough for you , the ISV to be able to take advantage of it .
If you want to use .NET , you need to ship Microsoft 's software for them .
Is n't this an odd state of affairs ?
Microsoft is supposed to be the one that " knows how to ship software " , but you are the one doing all the heavy lifting .
You are the one that has to ship their software the last mile , install it on end user machines , ensure their machines still work after you perform this platform level surgery .
When an Amazon engineer fixes a minor defect , makes something faster or better , makes an API more functional and complete , how do they " ship " that software to me ?
What is the lag time between the engineer completing the work , and the software reaching its intended customers ?
A good friend of mine investigated a performance problem one morning , he saw an obvious defect and fixed it .
His code was trivial , it was tested during the day , and rolled out that evening .
By the next morning millions of users had benefited from his work .
Not a single customer had to download a bag of bits , answer any silly questions , prove that they are not software thieves , reboot their computers , etc .
The software was shipped to them , and they did n't have to lift a finger .
Now that 's what I call shipping software .
I would argue that Microsoft used to know how to ship software , but the world has changed ...
The companies that " know how to ship software " are the ones to watch .
They have embraced the network , deeply understand the concept of " software as a service " , and know how to deliver incredible value to their customers efficiently and quickly .
GM Microbes Invade North America
While the attention of the world is focused on genetically modified ( GM ) crops , GM microbes have been released for at least six years with little or no public awareness or debate .
Prof. Joe Cummins reports .
Excerpt from Water Carnival - the images of organisms discovered in Mae - Wan Ho 's laboratory within a quantum jazz soundscape .
Download the full video from the online store .
A number of GM microbes are being widely deployed since their first release six years ago .
Sinorhizobium meliloti is a bacterium added to soil or inoculated into seeds to enhance nodule formation and nitrogen fixation in the roots of legumes .
It was released for commercial production in 1997 .
The other commercial GM microbes are designated as bio-pesticides .
These include GM Agrobacterium radiobacter k1026 , used to prevent crown gall disease in fruit and vegetable plants , and Pseudomonas fluorescens modified with a number of different Cry delta - endotoxin genes from different subspecies of Bacillus thruingiensis ( Bt ) .
The modified P. fluorescens cultures are killed by heat pasteurization and provides a persistent biopesticide preparation that degrades much slower in sunlight than Bt .
Neither the people selling nor those using the preparations are necessarily aware that the microbes are genetically modified , however .
Even organic farmers may be using them inadvertently .
The legume symbiont , Sinorhizobium meliloti , is tremendously important for fixing nitrogen from the air into plant roots and the soil .
Legumes signal to the bacterium by exuding flavonoids from their roots , activating the expression of nodulation genes in the bacterium , resulting in the production of Nod factors that regulate the formation of nitrogen fixing root nodules [ 1 ] .
The S. meliloti genome has been fully sequenced .
It is unusual in containing three chromosomes ( or a chromosome and two very large plasmids ) , all of them contributing to the symbiosis with the plant roots [ 2 ] .
The genetically modified commercial strain ( RMBPC - 2 ) has genes added that regulate nitrogenase enzyme ( for nitrogen fixation ) along with genes that increase the organic acid delivered from the plant to the nodule bacterium .
It also has the antibiotic resistance marker genes for streptomycin and spectinomycin [ 3 ] .
The commercial release was permitted in spite of concerns about the impact of the GM microbe on the environment .
Evidence supporting the initial concerns has accumulated but that has not dampened the use of the GM microbe .
For example , a recent review reports that GM S. meliloti strains persisted in the soil for six years , even in the absence of the legume hosts .
Horizontal gene transfer to other soil bacteria and microevolution of plasmids was observed [ 4 ] .
Other studies showed that a soil micro arthropod ingested GM S. meliloti , and a GM E. coli in the arthropod gut facilitated gene transfer to a range of bacteria [ 5 ] .
There is little doubt that the antibiotic resistance markers for streptomycin and spectinomycin will be transferred to soil bacteria and to a range of animal pathogens .
For example , the resistance genes for streptomycin could be observed to transfer from their insertion as transgenes in plant chloroplast to infecting bacterium Actinobacter sp. [ 6 ] when homologous gene sequences were present .
The antibiotics spectinomycin and streptomycin are used extensively in human and animal medicine .
Spectinomycin is used to treat human gonorrhea [ 7 ] and bovine pneumonia [ 8 ] .
Streptomycin is used to treat human tuberculosis [ 9 ] and Menieres disease [ 10 ] and as a pesticide on fruits and vegetables [ 11 ] .
Thus , the commercial release of GM Sinorhizobium meliloti has resulted in the establishment of the GM microbe in the soil in millions of acres of cropland , where it can spread antibiotic resistance genes for antibiotics that are extensively in use in medicine and agriculture .
Agrobacterium radiobacter k1026 [ 12 ] is a bio-pesticide derived from A. radiobacter k84 , a natural bacterium used to control the crown gall disease of fruits and ornamental trees and shrubs .
Crown gall disease is due to the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens that causes tumors to form on the plant stems , and is the most common vector employed in plant genetic engineering .
GM Agrobacterium radiobacter releases a chemical warfare agent bacteriocin ( agrocin ) against A. tumefaciens .
Bacteriocin is a novel nucleic acid derivative that prevents the crown gall tumors from forming in the infected plants .
The GM A. radiobacter has an engineered deletion in the genes controlling plasmid transfer so that the male bacterium cannot transfer its plasmid , but it can act as a female to receive a plasmid transfer .
However , recent research suggests that retrotransfer of genetic material can occur from female recipient to male donor bacterium [ 13 ] .
Pseudomonas flourescens strains modified with Cry delta endotoxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis are killed before being marketed [ 14 ] .
The killed GM bacteria are more persistent than are the conventionall B. thuringiensis sprays .
The main fallacy in the approval of these biopesticides is to suppose that bacteria cannot enjoy sex ( conjugation ) after death , they do .
Soil bacteria are also easily transformed with cell lysates ( squashed dead cells ) and function in their genetically modified form in soil microcosms [ 15 ] .
P. fluorescens and A. tumefacians are both transformed in soil [ 16 ] .
Soil Pseudomonas and Actinobacter can also take up genes from transgenic plants [ 17 ] .
So , the combination of transgenic crops and GM biopesticides can create genetic combinations capable of devastating the soil microflora and microfauna .
In conclusion , GM microbes have begun to be ubiquitous invaders of the North America ecosystem .
This massive invasion took place with little or no public awareness and input , and with very little monitoring of the impact of the invasion .
The environmental risk assessments of the commercial microbes were rudimentary and frequently erroneous .
We may have a bio - weapons equivalent of a time bomb on our hands .

" I 'd like to thank the Class Marshals for inviting me here today .
The last time I was invited to Harvard it cost me $ 110,000 , so you 'll forgive me if I 'm a bit suspicious .
I 'd like to announce up front that I have one goal this afternoon : to be half as funny as tomorrow 's Commencement Speaker , Moral Philosopher and Economist , Amartya Sen .
Must get more laughs than seminal wage / price theoretician .
Students of the Harvard Class of 2000 , fifteen years ago I sat where you sit now and I thought exactly what you are now thinking :
What 's going to happen to me ?
Will I find my place in the world ?
Am I really graduating a virgin ?
I still have 24 hours and my roommate 's Mom is hot .
I swear she was checking me out .
Being here today is very special for me .
I miss this place .
I especially miss Harvard Square - it 's so unique .
Nowhere else in the world will you find a man with a turban wearing a Red Sox jacket and working in a lesbian bookstore .
Hey , I 'm just glad my dad 's working .
It 's particularly sweet for me to be here today because when I graduated , I wanted very badly to be a Class Day Speaker .
Unfortunately , my speech was rejected .
So , if you 'll indulge me , I 'd like to read a portion of that speech from fifteen years ago :
" Fellow students , as we sit here today listening to that classic Ah - ha tune which will definitely stand the test of time , I would like to make several predictions about what the future will hold : " I believe that one day a simple Governor from a small Southern state will rise to the highest office in the land .
He will lack political skill , but will lead on the sheer strength of his moral authority . "
" I believe that Justice will prevail and , one day , the Berlin Wall will crumble , uniting East and West Berlin forever under Communist rule . "
" I believe that one day , a high speed network of interconnected computers will spring up world - wide , so enriching people that they will lose their interest in idle chit chat and pornography . "
And finally , I believe that one day I will have a television show on a major network , seen by millions of people a night , which I will use to re-enact crimes and help catch at - large criminals . "
And then there 's some stuff about the death of Wall Street which I do n't think we need to get into ....
The point is that , although you see me as a celebrity , a member of the cultural elite , a kind of demigod , I was actually a student here once much like you .
I came here in the fall of 1981 and lived in Holworthy .
I was , without exaggeration , the ugliest picture in the Freshman Face book .
When Harvard asked me for a picture the previous summer , I thought it was just for their records , so I literally jogged in the August heat to a passport photo office and sat for a morgue photo .
To make matters worse , when the Face Book came out they put my picture next to Catherine Oxenberg , a stunning blonde actress who was accepted to the class of ' 85 but decided to defer admission so she could join the cast of " Dynasty . "
My photo would have looked bad on any page , but next to Catherine Oxenberg , I looked like a mackerel that had been in a car accident .
You see , in those days I was six feet four inches tall and I weighed 150 pounds .
Recently , I had some structural engineers run those numbers into a computer model and , according to the computer , I collapsed in 1987 , killing hundreds in Taiwan .
After freshman year I moved to Mather House .
Mather House , incidentally , was designed by the same firm that built Hitler 's bunker .
In fact , if Hitler had conducted the war from Mather House , he'd have shot himself a year earlier .
1985 seems like a long time ago now .
When I had my Class Day , you students would have been seven years old .
Seven years old .
Do you know what that means ?
Back then I could have beaten any of you in a fight .
And I mean bad .
It would be no contest .
If any one here has a time machine , seriously , let 's get it on , I will whip your seven - year - old butt .
When I was here , they sold diapers at the Coop that said " Harvard Class of 2000 . "
At the time , it was kind of a joke , but now I realize you wore those diapers .
How embarrassing for you .
A lot has happened in fifteen years .
When you think about it , we come from completely different worlds .
When I graduated , we watched movies starring Tom Cruise and listened to music by Madonna .
I come from a time when we huddled around our TV sets and watched " The Cosby Show " on NBC , never imagining that there would one day be a show called " Cosby " on CBS .
In 1985 we drove cars with driver 's side airbags , but if you told us that one day there 'd be passenger side airbags , we'd have burned you for witchcraft .
But of course , I think there is some common ground between us .
I remember well the great uncertainty of this day .
Many of you are justifiably nervous about leaving the safe , comfortable world of Harvard Yard and hurling yourself headlong into the cold , harsh world of Harvard Grad School , a plum job at your father 's firm , or a year abroad with a gold Amex card and then a plum job in your father 's firm .
But let me assure you that the knowledge you 've gained here at Harvard is a precious gift that will never leave you .
Take it from me , your education is yours to keep forever .
Why , many of you have read the Merchant of Florence , and that will inspire you when you travel to the island of Spain .
Your knowledge of that problem they had with those people in Russia , or that guy in South America - you know , that guy - will enrich you for the rest of your life .
There is also sadness today , a feeling of loss that you 're leaving Harvard forever .
Well , let me assure you that you never really leave Harvard .
The Harvard Fundraising Committee will be on your ass until the day you die .
Right now , a member of the Alumni Association is at the Mt. Auburn Cemetery shaking down the corpse of Henry Adams .
They heard he had a brass toe ring and they aims to get it .
Imagine :
These people just raised 2.5 billion dollars and they only got through the B's in the alumni directory .
Here 's how it works .
Your phone rings , usually after a big meal when you 're tired and most vulnerable .
A voice asks you for money .
Knowing they just raised 2.5 billion dollars you ask , " What do you need it for ? "
Then there 's a long pause and the voice on the other end of the line says , " We do n't need it , we just want it . "
It 's chilling .
What else can you expect ?
Let me see , by your applause , who here wrote a thesis .
( APPLAUSE )
A lot of hard work , a lot of your blood went into that thesis ... and no one is ever going to care .
I wrote a thesis : Literary Progeria in the works of Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner .
Let 's just say that , during my discussions with Pauly Shore , it does n't come up much .
For three years after graduation I kept my thesis in the glove compartment of my car so I could show it to a policeman in case I was pulled over .
( ACT OUT ) License , registration , cultural exploration of the Man Child in the Sound and the Fury .
So what can you expect out there in the real world ?
Let me tell you .
As you leave these gates and re-enter society , one thing is certain : Everyone out there is going to hate you .
Never tell anyone in a roadside diner that you went to Harvard .
In most situations the correct response to where did you to school is , " School ?
Why , I never had much in the way of book larnin ' and such . "
Then , get in your BMW and get the hell out of there .
You see , you 're in for a lifetime of " And you went to Harvard ? "
Accidentally give the wrong amount of change in a transaction and it's , " And you went to Harvard ? "
Ask the guy at the hardware store how these jumper cables work and hear , " And you went to Harvard ? "
Forget just once that your underwear goes inside your pants and it's " and you went to Harvard . "
Get your head stuck in your niece 's dollhouse because you wanted to see what it was like to be a giant and it 's " Uncle Conan , you went to Harvard ! ? "
But to really know what 's in store for you after Harvard , I have to tell you what happened to me after graduation .
I 'm going to tell you my story because , first of all , my perspective may give many of you hope , and , secondly , it 's an amazing rush to stand in front of six thousand people and talk about yourself .
After graduating in May , I moved to Los Angeles and got a three - week contract at a small cable show .
I got a $ 380 a month apartment and bought a 1977 Isuzu Opel , a car Isuzu only manufactured for a year because they found out that , technically , it 's not a car .
Here 's a quick tip , graduates : no four cylinder vehicle should have a racing stripe .
I worked at that show for over a year , feeling pretty good about myself , when one day they told me they were letting me go .
I was fired and , I had n't saved a lot of money .
I tried to get another job in television but I could n't find one .
So , with nowhere else to turn , I went to a temp agency and filled out a questionnaire .
I made damn sure they knew I had been to Harvard and that I expected the very best treatment .
And so , the next day , I was sent to the Santa Monica branch of Wilson 's House of Suede and Leather .
When you have a Harvard degree and you 're working at Wilson 's House of Suede and Leather , you are haunted by the ghostly images of your classmates who chose Graduate School .
You see their faces everywhere : in coffee cups , in fish tanks , and they 're always laughing at you as you stack suede shirts no man , in good conscience , would ever wear .
I tried a lot of things during this period : acting in corporate infomercials , serving drinks in a non-equity theatre , I even took a job entertaining at a seven year olds ' birthday party .
In desperate need of work , I put together some sketches and scored a job at the fledgling Fox Network as a writer and performer for a new show called " The Wilton North Report . "
I was finally on a network and really excited .
The producer told me the show was going to revolutionize television .
And , in a way , it did .
The show was so hated and did so badly that when , four weeks later , news of its cancellation was announced to the Fox affiliates , they burst into applause .
Eventually , though , I got a huge break .
I had submitted , along with my writing partner , a batch of sketches to Saturday Night Live and , after a year and a half , they read it and gave us a two week tryout .
The two weeks turned into two seasons and I felt successful .
Successful enough to write a TV pilot for an original sitcom and , when the network decided to make it , I left Saturday Night Live .
This TV show was going to be groundbreaking .
It was going to resurrect the career of TV's Batman , Adam West .
It was going to be a comedy without a laugh track or a studio audience .
It was going to change all the rules .
And here 's what happened :
When the pilot aired it was the second lowest - rated television show of all time .
It 's tied with a test pattern they show in Nova Scotia .
So , I was 28 and , once again , I had no job .
I had good writing credits in New York , but I was filled with disappointment and did n't know what to do next .
I started smelling suede on my fingertips .
And that 's when The Simpsons saved me .
I got a job there and started writing episodes about Springfield getting a Monorail and Homer going to College .
I was finally putting my Harvard education to good use , writing dialogue for a man who 's so stupid that in one episode he forgot to make his own heart beat .
Life was good .
And then , an insane , inexplicable opportunity came my way .
A chance to audition for host of the new Late Night Show .
I took the opportunity seriously but , at the same time , I had the relaxed confidence of someone who knew he had no real shot .
I could n't fear losing a great job I had never had .
And , I think that attitude made the difference .
I 'll never forget being in the Simpson 's recording basement that morning when the phone rang .
It was for me .
My car was blocking a fire lane .
But a week later I got another call : I got the job .
So , this was undeniably the it : the truly life - altering break I had always dreamed of .
And , I went to work .
I gathered all my funny friends and poured all my years of comedy experience into building that show over the summer , gathering the talent and figuring out the sensibility .
We debuted on September 13 , 1993 and I was happy with our effort .
I felt like I had seized the moment and put my very best foot forward .
And this is what the most respected and widely read television critic , Tom Shales , wrote in the Washington Post : " O'Brien is a living collage of annoying nervous habits .
He giggles and titters , jiggles about and fiddles with his cuffs .
He had dark , beady little eyes like a rabbit .
He 's one of the whitest white men ever .
O'Brien is a switch on the guest who wo n't leave : he 's the host who should never have come .
Let the Late show with Conan O'Brien become the late , Late Show and may the host return to Conan O'Blivion whence he came . "
There 's more but it gets kind of mean .
Needless to say , I took a lot of criticism , some of it deserved , some of it excessive .
And it hurt like you would n't believe .
But I 'm telling you all this for a reason .
I 've had a lot of success and I 've had a lot of failure .
I 've looked good and I 've looked bad .
I 've been praised and I 've been criticized .
But my mistakes have been necessary .
Except for Wilson 's House of Suede and Leather .
That was just stupid .
I 've dwelled on my failures today because , as graduates of Harvard , your biggest liability is your need to succeed .
Your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve .
Because success is a lot like a bright , white tuxedo .
You feel terrific when you get it , but then you 're desperately afraid of getting it dirty , of spoiling it in any way .
I left the cocoon of Harvard , I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live , I left the cocoon of The Simpsons .
And each time it was bruising and tumultuous .
And yet , every failure was freeing , and today I 'm as nostalgic for the bad as I am for the good .
So , that 's what I wish for all of you : the bad as well as the good .
Fall down , make a mess , break something occasionally .
And remember that the story is never over .
If it 's all right , I 'd like to read a little something from just this year : " Somehow , Conan O'Brien has transformed himself into the brightest star in the Late Night firmament .
His comedy is the gold standard and Conan himself is not only the quickest and most inventive wit of his generation , but quite possible the greatest host ever . "
Ladies and Gentlemen , Class of 2000 , I wrote that this morning , as proof that , when all else fails , there 's always delusion .
I 'll go now , to make bigger mistakes and to embarrass this fine institution even more .
But let me leave you with one last thought :
If you can laugh at yourself loud and hard every time you fall , people will think you 're drunk .
Thank you " .
Here are today ’s headlines in Belgium ’s ( only ) Sunday newspaper De Zondag .
Page One : “ No Sign of Revolt in Belgium Yet . ” Page Five : “ Violence Moves Towards Belgium . ”
It almost sounds like a weather forecast , anticipating the onslaught of a hurricane that is inevitably coming .
What is happening in France has been brewing in Old Europe for years .
The BBC speaks of “ youths ” venting their “ anger . ”
The BBC is wrong .
It is not anger that is driving the insurgents to take it out on the secularised welfare states of Old Europe .
It is hatred .
Hatred caused not by injustice suffered , but stemming from a sense of superiority .
The “ youths ” do not blame the French , they despise them .
Most observers in the mainstream media ( MSM ) provide an occidentocentric analysis of the facts .
They depict the “ youths ” as outsiders who want to be brought into Western society and have the same rights as the natives of Old Europe .
The MSM believe that the “ youths ” are being treated unjustly because they are not a functioning part of Western society .
They claim that , in spite of positive discrimination , subsidies , public services , schools , and all the provisions that have been made for immigrants over the years , access has been denied them .
This is the marxist rhetoric of the West that has been predominant in the media and the chattering classes since the 1960s .
But it does not fit the facts of the situation in Europe today .
To understand what is going on one cannot look at today ’s events from a Western perspective .
One has to think like the “ youths ” in order to understand them .
Not imagine oneself in their shoes , but imagine their minds in one ’s own head .
The important question is : how do these insurgents perceive their relationship with society in France ?
Unlike their fathers , who came to France from Muslim countries , accepting that , whilst remaining Muslims themselves , they had come to live in a non-Muslim country , the rioters see France as their country .
They were born here .
This land is their land .
And since they are Muslims , this land , or at least a part of it , is Muslim as well .
The society they live in is a homogeneous Islamic one .
For them that is society , there is no other .
Consequently there is also no question of their “ leaving ” that society to become part of another society , the putative Western one .
“ Society ” is the society they live in and from which they view and interpret what goes on around them .
To understand their language we must understand how they see us , where we fit in in their society .
Multiculturalism does not exist : it is always a matter of several cultures living side by side in defined territories , and the laws of one culture not applying in the territories of the others .
West Europeans cannot blame the Muslim “ youths ” for looking at the world the way they do .
Europe willingly opened the door to the Muslims , not just by allowing large - scale immigration on an unprecedented level , but also by encouraging the newcomers to retain their culture .
Several million Muslim immigrants allowed in at a speed and scale that was unique in history .
As Bat Ye’or wrote , “ even in the course of the European colonization , the emigration of Europeans to the colonies took place at an infinitely slower pace .
The number of European colonists , including their descendants , even after a maximum of one or two centuries , was incomparably lower than that of present - day Muslim immigrants in each of the countries of Europe after only three decades . ”
In the “ Resolution of Strasbourg , ” passed unanimously by the general assembly of the Parliamentary Association for Euro - Arab Cooperation on June 7 - 8 , 1975 , more than 200 Members of Parliament from Western European countries , representing all shades of the political spectrum ( except the far right ) , unanimously agreed to allow Arab immigrants to bring their culture and religion to Europe , to promote it and spread it .
The parliamentarians stressed “ the contribution that the European countries can still expect from Arab culture , notably in the area of human values ” and asked the European governments “ to accord the greatest priority to spreading Arab culture in Europe . ”
Today the forests of satellite dishes on the apartment blocks in the suburbs of Western European cities link the immigrants to the culture of their countries of origin , whose television programmes they watch day after day .
Dyab Abou Jahjah , the young and charismatic Brussels - based leader of the Arab European League , rejects assimilation and demands segregated schools and self - governing , Arab - speaking ghettos .
“ We reject integration when it leads to assimilation , ” Jahjah says : “ I do n’t believe in a host country .
We are at home here and whatever we consider our culture to be also belongs to our chosen country .
I ’m in my country , not the country of the [ Westerners ] . ”
The Western authorities quietly accepted this when they abandoned the suburbs to the immigrants a decade ago .
The attempt by the French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy , a second - generation immigrant himself ( though not from a Muslim country ) , to assert the authority of the French Republic over its lost territory has triggered the current civil warfare in France .
For the “ youths ” this is a declaration of war .
They are not in Sarkozy ’s country but in their own country , where the West promised they could retain their own cultural values and spread them .
Those media that tell us that the rioting “ youths ” want to be a part of our society and feel left out of it , are misrepresenting the facts .
As the insurgents see it , they are not a part of our society and they want us to keep out of theirs .
The violence in France is in no way comparable with that of the blacks in the U.S. in the 1960s .
The Paris correspondent of The New York Times who writes that this a “ variant of the same problem ” is either lying or does not know what he is talking about .
The violence in France is of the type one finds when one group wants to assert its authority and drive the others out of its territory .
American MSM who imply that there is a direct line from Rosa Parks , the black woman who refused to stand up for a white man on an American bus in 1955 , to the rabble that are now throwing molotov cocktails into French buses containing passengers , are misrepresenting the facts .
( The only comparison between America and France is that many of the bus drivers in the Parisian suburbs , like those in New Orleans , seem to be white women whose vulnerability attracts rioters and looters ) .
The French government is failing completely in the basic task of government : maintaining law and order so that each citizen can live and work in safety .
What is more , the government has abdicated .
The ministers are either pandering to the rioters ( Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin – despite the first name , he is a man , though clearly without balls ) or bluffing ( Interior Minister Sarkozy ) rather than using the instruments they have .
Perhaps they have a good excuse .
Maybe government is aware that in an outright urban war it would be outarmed and outnumbered .
Perhaps the rumour that the French authorities cannot rely on the army because fifteen percent of the soldiers are Muslims is true .
Perhaps the allegation of Maurice Dantec on Quebec television that large arsenals of sophisticated heavy weaponry are stacked away in the French suburbs is also true .
As a result , however , the insurgents are viewing the politicians and the pundits with contempt and amusement .
If there is “ anger ” of a kind , it is no more than infuriation at the , from their point of view , arrogant presumption of the French politicians that Muslims would even consider adopting , let alone abiding by rules that the French have set .
The Muslims resent the outsiders paternalizing them and interfering with their way of life in the suburbs of all Western Europe ’s major cities .
Their message is : get out of our way , get out of our territory , and : you act like you think you ’re the boss but we ’ll show you who really is .
It is imperative that Americans realise that Western Europe has ceased to be a continent of more or less likeminded cousins at the other side of the Atlantic .
Immigrants in Europe cannot be compared with immigrants in the U.S.
It is possible to share the same culture with someone from a different race , but not with someone from a fundamentally different religion .
The demographic data clearly show who is likely to win the impending European civil war .
As in the Netherlands , where more people are currently moving out of the country than into it , one can expect a French exodus in the near future .
Those who will be leaving France are those who fear that their future is looking bleak , and they are not the Muslims in the suburbs .
Do Not Elect Wealthy Politicians
Why do the people of democratic countries consistently elect wealthy people ( such as Kennedy and Bush family members ) into political offices , when rich politicians typically only represent the interests of themselves , other rich individuals , and companies ?
I think it has something to do with wealthy people having these three attributes :
1 ) The most obvious reason is that they are rich !
This enables them to spend money becoming and staying famous , doing philanthropy , and other mass campaigning efforts .
As a result , being a celebrity gets more votes .
2 ) Also , I believe this has something to do with rich people not needing to work for a living for long periods of time .
As a result , they can concentrate more on getting involved in politics and getting elected .
3 ) Finally , the rich know more rich , powerful , and influential people who can more easily support their political aspirations , especially if they have similar political goals ( this translates into less taxes and regulations for themselves and their businesses ) .
How can a wealthy person , who can hardly relate to the average person , represent the average working class ?
Well , they do not .
Then why do we continue to vote wealthy individuals into political offices ?
I recommend that we do not .
Instead , let us vote for people who are not rich or at least people who were not always rich and who can understand and relate more with the average person .
Or better yet , let us nominate and elect intellectual elites of society , such as a college professors who have formal education in politics , governments , economics , history , etc. and decades of political interest , who are better educated to govern people and countries .
It is time to allow great thinkers , instead of greedy selfish rich politicians , a chance in power to make the world a better place .

Graphical vi-vim Cheat Sheet and Tutorial
Learning vi or vim is not easy .
But it does n't have to be that difficult , either .
It is , in any case , faster , more powerful , and more productive than editing with any other editor , so you would do very well in investing the time and effort to learn it .
Being a vi lover myself , I came up with the idea of providing a graphical cheat sheet for those learning vi or vim , and I also found out it was a very good way to structure a tutorial .
Here are the results for your learning enjoyment ( or your colleagues ' ) .
By the way , I recently published the definitive article explaining why vi/vim editing is so much better than regular editing .
It should prove useful if you want to read it yourself , or if you want to point your skeptical friends to a description of why it makes sense , apart from being an entertaining read :
Why , oh why , do those #?@!
nutheads use vi ?.
Graphical cheat sheet
This is a single page describing the full vi/vim input model , the function of all keys , and all major features .
You can see it as a compressed vi/vim manual .
Click on the image below to access the full - size bitmap image , or download the vector - based , scalable SVG version ( zip - compressed - and be sure to view & print the SVG with the open source application Inkscape or the Adobe plug - in for Internet Explorer , Firefox breaks the layout for some reason , apart from rendering it with no anti-alias ! ) .
Graphical cheat sheet based tutorial
The tutorial above is structured in 7 lessons that cover the major commands in vi/vim .
They are structured so that you will learn the simplest and most useful first , and the more advanced ones afterwards .
Actually , using just the commands shown in lesson 1 , you can already start editing in vi/vim in a similar way to how you would on a regular editor .
Lesson 2 introduces the very powerful , and vi/vim - exclusive operators , and the rest of the lessons advance from there .
Each thumbnail links to a high - resolution bitmap version .
You can also download the full tutorial in a single zip file with all the bitmaps or a single zip file with all the SVGs ( see the note above about incorrect rendering on Firefox ) .
Notes
vim is an incredible editor by Bram Moolenaar , based on the original vi by Bill Joy , adding a ton of improvements over it .
Nowadays , you should choose vim over vi every time you can .
The cheat sheet and tutorial cover most important functions of vi's input model , leaving out the more advanced regular expressions / ex command line material .
This should be a very good beginning to becoming a vi/vim wizard .
With the single exception of the external filter feature ( " ! " ) , all functions shown are supported by ViEmu , my commercial add - in that provides advanced vi-vim emulation in Visual Studio .

This cheat sheet has proven to be pretty popular .

Apple 's notebook lines look set to spearhead the Mac maker 's shift to Intel processors next year , with the launch of updated PowerBooks and iBooks coming in the Q1 / Q2 2006 timeframe .
So claimed " extremely reliable sources " , cited by AppleInsider , though the report is short on detail .
Updated PowerBooks are likely to be announced first .
Expect a new 15 in widescreen model first , based to an extent on the current design but with much - reduced thickness .
The new 15 in PowerBook is said to be 20 - 25 per cent thinner than the one you can buy today .
That takes it down from 2.8 cm to between 2.1 and 2.2 cm .
The sources claim the updated 17in widescreen PowerBook will appear a few months later .
Alas , the report reckons there will be no replacements for the compact and Register - favoured 12in PowerBook G4 .
One ray of light is the anticipated widescreen iBook , which has been rumoured to be in the pipeline since April 2005 , when Taiwanese contract manufacturer sources said Apple had been out looking for a partner to produce the machine .
If AppleInsider 's sources are correct , it will be an Intel - based job , shipping in time for the April / May US education market buying spree , and equipped with a 13in widescreen display .
The sources suggest - though it's no great leap of the imagination given the recent iMac update - that the new iBook will incorporate a web cam .
The new PowerBooks may well do so too .
Apple announced in June 2005 that it would move to Intel processors from PowerPC technology during 2006 , with the first machines due on the market by June 2006 and the range completely ported over by the end of 2007 .
On the notebook side , Intel 's upcoming ' Yonah ' , not only its first 65nm notebook - oriented processor but also its first dual - core laptop chip , is due to begin shipping late 2005 with a formal debut in Q1 2006 , which puts it within the timeframe suggested by AppleInsider 's sources .
Reports last week suggested versions of Mac OS X for Intel and for PowerPC processors are both at parity , suggesting Apple is ready to ship the Intel release when it feels the time is right . ®

Not long ago I took a fishing trip with two friends .
We woke before dawn after only four hours of sleep and headed out on the road .
Fatigue set in quickly :
As heads bobbed and eyelids eased shut , we drifted onto the shoulder of the highway before jerking awake and coming safely to a stop .
As the 18 - wheelers barreled past us in the early morning light I could n't help but wonder :
Do truck drivers , and others in sleep - deprived occupations , experience similar fatigue ?
Or do their bodies learn to adapt to less sleep ?
Cynthia LaJambe , a chronobiologist at the Pennsylvania Transportation Institute , has conducted sleep research at Penn State and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research , and has seen the effects of sleep deprivation -- including fatigue , sadness , stress , anger and diminished performance -- first - hand .
" At Walter Reed we were particularly interested in the effects of lack of sleep on soldiers , " LaJambe said .
" In combat situations , they are often forced to go 36 or 48 hours without sleep .
Our tests conducted on soldiers over 72 and 86 hours showed that -- except for the rare individuals who seem genetically able to stay awake longer -- adapting in a short period to less sleep was n't possible . "
Researchers still are investigating whether people can adapt better over longer time periods .
In another study , conducted at Walter Reed and the University of Pennsylvania , LaJambe noted , among participants who slept from two to nine hours daily for eight days , those who slept nine hours performed the best on " psychomotor vigilance " tasks , which measure reaction time .
Those who slept three hours or less not only had progressively slower reaction times , but did not recover from the effects of sleep deprivation even after several days of sleeping longer hours .
At Penn State , LaJambe 's research focus has turned to long - haul trucking .
While truck drivers usually get more sleep than soldiers , she noted , they sometimes get only four to five hours sleep per night , compared to the eight hours recommended for healthy adults by the National Sleep Foundation .
Tired drivers are at risk not only for falling asleep , LaJambe said , but for what she calls lapses .
A " lapse , " as LaJambe described it , is a momentary shutdown of the prefrontal cortex causing a person to be temporarily unable to respond to stimuli -- in the case of driving , unable to operate the vehicle .
After a lapse , a person often feels as though they have been momentarily asleep , although technically they have not been .
Such incidents are more common than actually falling asleep , LaJambe said , and are particularly dangerous , " because even though people might think they can fight off dozing , this is something outside their control . "
The level of impairment caused by sleep deprivation can be equivalent to that caused by drunkenness , she added .
College students often experience lapses when pulling " all nighters " during exam periods .
New parents , too , quickly come to know the effects of significantly reduced sleep .
To avoid dozing off , or just to make more time for work , some people have tried a radical alternative .
Polyphasic , or Da Vinci , sleep ( so named for the great Renaissance master , who purportedly slept very little , in very short spurts ) , requires 15 - 20 minute naps every couple of hours , totaling between two and five hours of sleep per day .
Such fragmented sleep patterns inevitably take a toll on alertness , LaJambe said .
" Some people think they are adapting to being awake more , but are actually performing at a lower level .
They do n't realize it because the functional decline happens so gradually . "
In the short term , for those who have no choice but to stay awake , she said , " a short nap and a moderate amount of caffeine , like a cup of coffee , is still the best approach . "
But those naps should be kept under 20 minutes , LaJambe advised .
" Otherwise , sleep inertia sets in , and you 'll be groggy when you wake up . "
" In the end , " she noted , " there is no denying the effects of sleep deprivation .
And training the body to sleep less is not a viable option . "
Nothing matches a good night 's sleep .

What Else Can You Do With Version Control ?
If you 've been developing software for any length of time , you more than likely use some sort of version control to safely store copies of the files that you 're coding .
We all know by now how incredibly useful it is to be able to trace the history of code you 're working on , to be able to safely share it among multiple team members , and to be able to revert to a previous version in case of disaster .
There are literally hundreds of version control systems out there ; although we 're a .NET shop , my team has settled on the free Subversion as our tool of choice in this area .
But whatever tool you use - Subversion , Visual SourceSafe , Perforce , the new Visual Studio Team System version control - if you 're only storing your source code in your repository you 're missing out .
The key is to bring together three ingredients that are easy to obtain today :
Version control
Nightly ( or more frequent ) backups of your entire repository to a secure , distributed location
Cheap hard drive space
What can you do with this combination ?
In the rest of this article , I 'll give you five of my own favorite ideas .
The Dynamic Operations Manual
Our corporate operations manual , with details of such things as how to back up the e-mail server configuration , phone numbers for the hosting company , and so on , is a Word document stored in a folder in our repository .
Right alongside it are various tools and scripts that are referenced in the document .
When someone new comes on board who is expected to lend a hand in operations , it 's a matter of moments to give them access to that folder in the repository , at which point a single checkout operation puts all the documentation and tools they need right on their local hard drive .
If someone spots a problem or omission in the manual , we encourage them to fix it in their local copy and then check the changes right back into the master copy .
There 's no need to maintain a formal change log in the document ; we can always look at the version history to see who added what .
And of course there 's no risk .
If something is wrong , it 's easy to roll back to a previous version .
Naturally , you can apply the same principle to any set of tools or documentation you want to make easily available to people .
For example , think about putting your employee manual along with whatever else new hires need to see into version control , or the setup files for the standard set of company utilities that everyone always installs when they set up a new computer .
Install your version control client , sync up to the correct portion of the tree , and you 're ready to roll .
Interactive Specs
If you 've got a reasonably mature development shop , someone is writing specs for the code that you turn out .
And inevitably , those specs need to be updated as the code is written .
Priorities change , features get added and deleted , things get implemented differently than they 're written , developers sneak in nifty new features that get added to the spec .
Instead of letting the spec live as a document with revision marks , check it into your version control system and update it there .
Once developers and managers get used to having specs under version control , the next step is to transform them from documents into conversations .
The key here is a version control system that supports some sort of update notification .
Have all parties concerned sign up for notification when a new version of the spec is checked in .
Then , if the developer has a question or problem , they can annotate the problematic part of the spec and check it in .
The project manager gets notified that a new version is in the system and updates their local copy .
A diff will show the new content ( if this is n't an easy operation , you 're using the wrong system ) and the manager can set to work clarifying the spec and then check the fixed version back in .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
If everyone uses this system , you can save time just in not having to dig through e-mail archives to figure out who said what and who made design decisions .
It 's all right there in the spec 's own history .
Painless backups
Remember those distributed backups ?
It 's worth spending time and even a bit of money to make sure you have automated backups of the entire repository happening on a nightly basis .
In our case , we use Subversion 's hotcopy capability to make a full copy of the repository , then compress it and FTP it to an entirely different server in a different facility .
The net effect is that everything in the repository is not only saved with full history , but that full history is stored in two places .
It would take a pair of simultaneous hardware failures to wipe the information out .
So , you 've got this near - magical backup happening that is close to zero effort from the client point of view .
Encourage people to use it !
Set up a portion of the tree for each employee to use for their own stuff ( we 've got a " Sandbox " subtree , with folders for each user ) and tell them to dump into it anything that it would be a nuisance to recreate .
Spent an hour tweaking a configuration file for your anti-spam filter ?
Put it in the sandbox !
Working on an article ?
Sandbox it .
Pictures from the office party where the boss put the computer box on his head ?
Sandbox .
In addition to peace of mind backups ( that actually happen without the user needing to remember to do anything ) the sandbox is also a great way to move files around from machine to machine .
If you need to take a file home from the office , you can just toss it in to the sandbox folder , then connect to the version control server from your laptop or home computer and check it out again .
Enable Transparency
Depending on your company , this might be the most controversial suggestion - or the most important .
If you 're using a version control system with a free client , consider setting up a repository with a public face that 's visible to anyone on the Internet .
Then publicize its existence ( and the location of the client software needed to obtain read - only access to it ) and start filling it .
Filling it with what ?
Well , that 's up to you .
How transparent do you want to be to your customers and partners ( knowing , of course , that your competitors will also cruise by to have a look ) ?
Depending on your strategy , this repository might contain :
Trial versions of your software
Beta versions of the next release of the software
Planning documents , from short - term specifications to long - term vision documents
Company financial statements ( if you 're a public company )
Press releases
Contact information
The goal is simply to make it easy for people to synch up with what you 're doing - and what could be easier than moving a portion of your hard drive straight on to their computers ?
Lightweight Deployment
I mentioned this in a previous article , but it's one of our favorite techniques so I 'm going to bring it up again .
If your development tree mirrors exactly what you want on your production server ( or you can identify a subset of the development tree that should be deployed to the production server ) , you can use version control for deployment .
To do this , you 'll need to install a copy of your version control client on the production server .
When your tree is in a known good state and you 're ready to deploy , use Remote Desktop to connect to the server and get a copy of the latest version to the server .
Voila , instant deployment .
And What Else Can You Do ?
I hope these suggestions will get you to thinking about your version control repository as more than just a home for code .
Depending on the balance between your daily work and hard drive space , it 's quite possible to go even further .
For example , have you considered saving your e-mail forever ?
Or what about the basic development environment that takes you two days to set up ?
Brainstorm a bit and you 're likely to come up with even more creative ideas on your own .

Steve McConnell on diseconomies of scale in software development :
Project size is easily the most significant determinant of effort , cost and schedule [ for a software project ] .*
People naturally assume that a system that is 10 times as large as another system will require something like 10 times as much effort to build .
But the effort for a 1,000,000 LOC system is more than 10 times as large as the effort for a 100,000 LOC system .
[ Using software industry productivity averages ] , the 10,000 LOC system would require 13.5 staff months .
If effort increased linearly , a 100,000 LOC system would require 135 staff months .
But it actually requires 170 staff months .
Here 's the single most important decision you can make on your software project if you want it to be successful : keep it small .
Small may not accomplish much , but the odds of outright failure -- a disturbingly common outcome for most software projects -- is low .
I do n't think the inverted , non-linear relationship between size and productivity on software projects will come as a shock to anyone ; the guys at 37 signals have been banging their drum on the virtues of small for over a year now .
Is n't small the new big already ?
But what I really want to focus on here is how you measure a project 's size .
What 's big ?
What 's small ?
McConnell is using lines of code ( LOC ) as his go - to measurement .
Here 's a table that illustrates the relationship between project size and productivity :
Project Size Lines of code ( per year ) COCOMO average 10,000 LOC 2,000 - 25,000 3,200 100,000 LOC 1,000 - 20,000 2,600 1,000,000 LOC 700 - 10,000 2,000 10,000,000 LOC 300 - 5,000 1,600
Lines of code is a reasonable metric to determine project size , but it also has some problems , which are well - documented in the wikipedia entry on lines of code :
/* How many lines of code is this ?
*/ for ( i=0 ; i<100 ; ++i ) printf ( " hello " ) ;
For one thing , different languages vary widely in the number of lines of code they produce .
100 lines of Perl will probably accomplish a lot more than 100 lines of C .
So you have to be careful that you 're really comparing apples to apples .
Furthermore , skilled developers know that the less code you write , the fewer bugs you 've created -- so they naturally distrust any productivity metric that weights absolute lines of code .
And does code generation count ?
Even with all its problems , the LOC metric is still where you should start , according to McConnell :
My personal conclusion about using lines of code for software estimation is similar to Winston Churchill 's conclusion about democracy :
The LOC measure is a terrible way to measure software size , except that all the other ways to measure size are worse .
For most organizations , despite its problems , the LOC measure is the workhorse technique for measuring size of past projects and for creating early - in - the - project estimates of new projects .
The LOC measure is the lingua franca of software estimation , and it is normally a good place to start , as long as you keep its limitations in mind .
Your environment might be different enough from the common programming environments that lines of code are not highly correlated with project size .
If that 's true , find something that is more proportional to effort , count that , and base your size estimates on that instead .
Try to find something that 's easy to count , highly correlated with effort , and meaningful for use across multiple projects .
The wikipedia article features this chart of Windows operating system size , in lines of code , over time :
1993 Windows NT 3.1 6 million 1994 Windows NT 3.5 10 million 1996 Windows NT 4.0 16 million 2000 Windows 2000 29 million 2002 Windows XP 40 million 2007 Windows Vista ~ 50 million
If you 're wondering how much code the average programmer produces per day , I think you might be asking the wrong question .
Lines of code is certainly a key metric for determining project size , but it's also easily manipulated and misinterpreted .
It should never be the only data point used to make decisions ; it 's just one of many signposts on the road that helps you orient your project .
* what are the other most significant determinants ?
Number two is the type of software you 're developing , and personnel factors is a very close third .
Charles Stroup from 123MacMini and I have created a list of 10 applications every new Mac user should download .
These applications should help new Mac users get off the ground and running with OS X .
We tried our best to narrow the list down to the most essential applications .
Of course , this list could never include all the great applications available on the market , but these are 10 that we could not live without .
You can always find more software on MacUpdate .
MacUpdate is updated every day , listing the newest updates and releases of Macintosh software .
Apple also has a downloads section on their website offering the latest freeware , shareware , demos , and widgets .
Now , on to the list !

It also integrates seamlessly with many popular external text editors like BBEdit , TextWrangler and Smultron .
Fugu and Fetch are two other solid FTP clients that we suggest you take a look at .
Firefox
Safari is great but Firefox 's amazing archive of valuable extensions , themes , and toolbars makes it king of the web browsers .
Firefox has extended support for key shortcuts , such as switching between tabs , live bookmarks and version 1.5 ushers in a zippy browsing engine .
Firefox 's search function is also much more robust than Safari's .
Firefox coalesces form and functionality just as well as it's sister program , Thunderbird , does .
If Apple 's Mail does n't do it for you , Thunderbird most certainly will .
We also suggest that you take a look at Camino and Flock for alternative browsers .
iBackup
Hard drive failtures , accidental deletions and other mishaps can all be remedied with recent backups from a great program such as iBackup .
iBackup has the talent of backing up and restoring system and application preferences alongside the standard support for securing files and folders .
iBackup also gives you the option of a selective backup , or sync , that only backs up altered files .
All of this within the familiar domain of a Finder interface .
We also suggest you take a look at Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper !.
They are excellent programs for those seeking a simple one - stop backup solution .

StuffIt Expander
StuffIt Expander does one thing and does it well , for free at that .
It can decompress pretty much anything you can throw at it .
Mac OS
X already has the ability to decompress and archive .zip files .
StuffIt Expander takes this feature and adds the ability to quickly decompress files and folders in many compressed file formats , such as .rar , .sitx , .sit , .tar , .tgz , .zip and more .
Those looking for a complete archiving solution should look no further than StuffIt Expander Deluxe .
The deluxe version features a faster and more efficient compression algorithm and impressive Spotlight integration for searching inside of archived files .
TextWrangler 2
Bare Bone 's Software 's prized text editor , recently awarded the MacWorld 2005 Editors ' Choice Award , TextWrangler allows for easy editing of any file .
Easily recognized as the most comprehensive free text editor , TextWrangler features extensive FTP and SFTP support and can even perform Find Differences on a pair of files .

BBEdit adds professional web authoring and subversion server support to TextWrangler 's already impressive feature set .
Smultron is another free text editor as well .
VLC
You will occasionally find that Quicktime may not be able to play a file or two that you find online .
The standard installation of Quicktime lacks many key codecs required to play various video files such as AVIs .
VLC player solves that with a small footprint , fast player that aims to have high compatibility when it comes to playing file types .
It can successfully play just about everything you throw at it , except Windows Media .
VLC can even keep you entertained with its ability to stream files .
Windows Media Player
Unfortunately , you cannot traverse the internet without coming across some video encoded in the Windows Media format .
The only way to play these files is with the Windows Media Player .
Unlike Quicktime , which has been kept up - to - date for Windows users , Windows Media Player has a horrid interface and lacks much functionality .
However , a new application called Flip4Mac promises to give Quicktime the ability of playing Windows Media files .
It also allows you to import , export and play Windows Media within your favorite QuickTime applications .
Update : Microsoft now recommends the use of Flip4Mac to play WMV files on Macs .
Wie der Online - News - Dienst
The Register meldet , erlitt die Organisation zum Schutz der Rechte der niederländischen Unterhaltungsindustrie BREIN ( Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland ) vor einem Berufungsgericht eine Schlappe .
Das Gericht durchkreuzte den Versuch , von den Internet Service Providern ( ISP ) , unter anderem Wanadoo und Tiscali , die Identitäten von Filesharern zu erhalten .
Als Begründung befand das Gericht die Art und Weise der Datensammlung in Form von IP - Adressen und Dateinamen durch das US - Unternehmen MediaSentry als nicht mit dem europäischen Datenschutzrecht vereinbar .
So soll die Software MediaSentry nach Auffassung des Gerichtes zum einen nicht in der Lage sein , Rechtsverstöße eindeutig zu erkennen .
Zum anderen durchsucht sie die freigegebenen Inhalte auf der Festplatte der Verdächtigen , was nicht mit dem Schutz privater Daten vereinbar sei .
BREIN will die Entscheidung anfechten . ( rij )
In the past , passwords were cracked by randomly guessing at the correct string of characters in what 's known as a " brute force " attack .
In these assaults , the encrypted form of the password - the hash - is extracted from the target file or computer .
A randomly generated password is encrypted and its encrypted form is compared to the extracted hash .
If it does n't match , the process is repeated until a match is found - it 's a long and tedious process .
With rainbow tables , the encrypted form of most possible passwords are pre-computed and stored alongside the actual , clear - text password .
Users can simply look up virtually any hash in the massive index and match it to the corresponding password in seconds .
The tables can break password protection in many common file formats , including versions of Adobe 's PDF format ( the current version is immune to the attack ) , the default encryption on protected Microsoft Office documents ( 40 bit ) and even Windows password files .
" It 's a lot of ( storage ) space but the nice thing is it only needs to be done once , " says Pieter Zatko , a division scientist at BBN Technologies , a government contractor that conducts research for the US Department of Defence and other government agencies .
Mr Zatko is best known for writing the L0 phtcrack password cracking tool in the '90s .
It was used to crack Windows passwords with ease , something he hoped would change the way organisations managed their passwords .
Instead , L0 phtcrack was commercialised and became the industry - standard password auditor , much to Mr Zatko 's dismay .
" That was my problem with L0 phtcrack .
People were using it to audit their passwords , " he says .
" It was supposed to be a statement of ' understand your risks ' . "
It seems people have n't learnt from his work - passwords are still easy to crack .
Neohapsis , for example , uses rainbow tables for forensic investigations , cracking passwords when a client 's disgruntled ex-employees refuse to hand them over .
The tables can't be used to crack strongly encrypted passwords , but many computer users are lazy , using the same passwords over and over .
Thus , obtaining a trivial , easily cracked password could be the foothold a consultant - or a criminal attacker - needs to unravel a user 's full set of passwords .
" The scope of the password or pass - phrase problem is only increasing , " says Neohapsis ' Greg Shipley .
" We found a password on a document and that password was used on other documents ...
Unless a user is incredibly sophisticated , you crack one of them and there 's a good chance you 're going to get the rest of them . "
By attacking the low - hanging fruit of easily cracked document or file passwords , it 's possible to guess at more sensitive passwords , such as those used for email or remote network access .
" Anything that 's 40 - bit encrypted you can hit with a rainbow table , " Mr Stankevitz says .
Although 40 - bit is far from the strongest encryption available , it 's still in common use because of now - redundant US Government arms trafficking regulations , says Mr Zatko .
" For quite some time we had these stupid regulations .
Cryptography was considered a munition , so we were n't allowed to export anything that was greater than 40 - bit encryption , " he says .
It 's not just the good guys using rainbow tables , either .
" There are services online that you can upload your file to and they 'll decrypt it for you for $ 50 , no questions asked , " says Mr Stankevitz .
The ease with which miscreants can crack file or document passwords means using the same password for your VPN access and password protected files is a very bad idea .
Indeed , Mr Shipley says that a fairly comprehensive rainbow table set is now within reach of hobbyists and criminals alike , and certainly organised crime syndicates .
" You can get a terabyte or two of storage in the four figure range and you can get computer power in the four figure range , " he says .
" You can still do a lot at a hobbyist level , and if you 're dealing with organised crime rings they 'll have the budgets . "
In the meantime , the guys at Neohapsis has some advice for Microsoft Office users : change the encryption setting to 128 bit and use a 12 - character password .

Elderflower Kefir recipeFizzy Bubblig Kinder Champagne
June 13 , 2012
My packaging shows a slightly more explosive recipe than the one listed below .
Last year at this time I got into a bit of a kerfuffle with the local Pole Circle Police regarding the legality of foraging elderflower in the park .
Turns out these ill - informed armed guards were under the impression that foraging was illegal .
It was a typical win the battle , lose the war moment and facing imminent arrest and not much in the mood to lose the war that day , I did something very unusual for me in a threatening authority situation .
I shut the hell up and let the gendarmes finish their harassment shtick .
In order to further boost my burgeoning sense of moral superiority on this foraging issue in all future kerfuffles , I ’ve started a personal elder - planting campaign ; in the DemoGarden , in the park itself and nurturing little elders in nature .
This year I harvested enough of the powdery perfumey flowers from my own sources ( and the neighbour ’s ) to make 20 liters of syrup !
And they ’re all still blooming away .
My signature drink to make from elderflower syrup is a fermented , floral , lightly bubbled kefir .
To make 1 liter of Elderfower Kefir mix the syrup 1:4 with water and add a few spoons of your water kefir crystals .
Let the bottle sit on a sunny windowsill for 3 - 5 days .
Taste , and when it ’s a little sweeter than you would normally drink it , put strain out the kefir crystals ( the culture remains ) , bottle the liquid and keep in the fridge a few days .
Placing the bottles in the fridge for a week or so really gets the carbonation going without the drink becoming sour or yeasty .
It also prevents the bottles from exploding .
I have taken to using the Dutch milk bottles with screw tops .
They leak - which is great , because they do n’t explode .
The kefir crystals , like all SCOBY ’s , are a community of beasts .
I ’ve found that fermenting at changing temperatures makes for a tastier drink with a nicely textured bubble .
The shift from room temperature to the fridge is all the ( elderflower ) kefir needs .

Elder flower syrup recipe … basic stuff
June 6 , 2012
Elder Flower Syrup Recipe / Basic Stuff
( makes 3,5 - 4 liters of syrup )
You will need :
5 liter jar
3 kilos sugar plus 1 kilo for later
3 liters water
Elderflowers a’plenty , plucked , unwashed , bugs and all
The flowers :
Fill a 5 liter jar � - 2/3 - full with elder flowers .
Flowers only , no stems .
Absolutely unwashed , bugs and all .
Remove snails and birdshit , if applicable .
The syrup :
The minimal ratio is 1 kilo sugar : 1 liter water .
If possible , add more sugar .
Approximately 3 kilos white sugar
( or as much as will dissolve )
Approximately 3 liters water
( just warm enough to dissolve the sugar )
Pour the sugar , and then the water .
Stir until clear .
The time , the taste :
After 5 days , start tasting the syrup .
It should taste clearly of elder flower .
The entire kitchen should smell of elder flower and when you leave the kitchen you can still conjure the smell of elder flowers in your head .
If the flavour is too weak , let it sit a few more days .
Depending on the weather and kitchen conditions it may even ferment slightly , that is to say become lemony without the addition of lemon juice .
This is ok , if not desirable .
When you ’re ready to call it ready , wring the syrup out of the flowers and discard them .
Decant the syrup through a series of fine sieves and cloths to filter out Vitamine Beast .
Don�t worry if a bit of Vitamine Beast remains because � it will simply remain .
It is vitamine B12 , a cause for celebration .
Store bottled syrup in a cool and dark place , or refrigerate .
The preservation :
Elder flower syrup is a seasonal product .
Enjoy the yearly ritual of harvesting these flowers and getting completely dusted with pollen because it is a supreme joy .
The syrup should be used generously and given away freely as a floral sweetener when it is in season ( in NL , May � June ) .
Even when refrigerated , it does not preserve well for more than a month or two , and preservatives like ascorbic acid change the flavour considerably .
Though elder flower syrup can be reboiled with even more sugar to preserve it for a longer period , beware !
You are treading on dangerous territory .
Instead , why not avoid all preservation issues by simply using this flowery syrup in season and by giving it away to people you like or whom you want to like you .
Remember , the sugar is the preservative that keeps this mixture from transforming .
If you don�t like sweet things , dilute the finished syrup in the foods to which you add it .
If you are using elder flower syrup as a sweetener in a ferment ( e.g. elder flower kefir ) just let it ferment a little longer so that the beasts can eat up the sugar .
The sugar is not for you , it is for preservation process .
Use :
In general use elder flower syrup diluted at a ratio of 1:4 with water , or to taste .

Spontaneous salads neither sown nor stolen
May 6 , 2012
The lettuces in the DemoGarden have n’t even come up , yet this is the sort of salad that we ’ve been eating for the past 3 weeks .
All 18 of these vegetables grow spontaneously in our permaculture garden , most of them sown more than 3 years ago .
This bouquet - eating abundance is a testament to why we need to transform our cities into resplendent edible landscapes .
Ingredients : spinach , red orach , chard , smokey fennel , ramps leaves , ramps flowers , chives , chive buds / flowers , mystery speckled red lettuce , purple frills mustard , yellow mustard , raspberry leaf ( plucked by accident , tastes wonderful ) , broccoli shoots , mint , ground elder , sorrel .
Not pictured , garlic mustard ( alliaria petiolata ) .
We ’re dipping these amazing leaves into our own lapsang souchong kombucha vinaigrette , also fermented from wild yeasts .
Edible bouquets , we walk , we pluck .
We talk about how lucky we are .

When the wholesome , clean - cut actress went head to head with the scandal - plagued supermodel , perhaps the result was predictable .
Keira Knightley was the £ 1 million winner .
Hollywood 's hottest property has been chosen to replace Kate Moss as the face of Chanel 's Coco Mademoiselle perfume when her contract expires at the end of the year .
But if the corporate snub was a disappointment for Miss Moss , there was worse to come .
Miss Knightley , 21 , was voted the world 's sexiest woman in a men's magazine poll , while the 32 - year - old Croydon - born model only just scraped into the top 100 at number 87 .
The poll results appear in a 100 Sexiest Supplement , published free with the June edition of FHM .
Chanel had already dropped Miss Moss from its main fashion line in the wake of the cocaine scandal which engulfed her last September , but at that stage she continued to feature for Coco Mademoiselle .
The company refused to say whether the latest decision was connected to her troubled private life - she was photographed apparently snorting drugs - or her on - off relationship with rock star Pete Doherty , who is battling heroin and crack - cocaine addiction .
Miss Knightley 's career to date has remained refreshingly scandal - free , blighted only by her break up with her model boyfriend Jamie Dornan , who ironically is to star with Miss Moss in a Calvin Klein advert .
She is in demand in Hollywood after a string of successes , including Pride and Prejudice , for which she earned an Oscar nomination .
She is currently working on three films .
A Chanel spokesman said : " Keira 's elegance , beauty and modernity are but a few of the qualities that parallel the iconic faces featured in the legendary Chanel fragrance campaigns . "
He quoted Catherine Deneuve and Nicole Kidman as examples of previous choices .
The company 's artistic director Jacques Helleu also paid tribute to the new signing .
" Keira Knightley is a bright , young actress who has already made her mark in a diverse portfolio of films , " he said .
Two retired F.B.I. agents said today that they had rejected advisory roles on the disputed ABC mini-series , “ The Path to 9/11 , ” because of concerns about the program ’s accuracy .
One of the agents , Thomas E. Nicoletti , was hired by the producers of the mini-series in July 2005 to oversee its technical accuracy , but left after less than a month because of scenes he believed were misleading or just false .
“ There were some of the scenes that were total fiction , ” said Mr. Nicoletti , who served as a supervisory special agent and a member of the joint terrorism task force before retiring in 2003 .
“ I told them unless they were changing this , I could not have my name associated with it . ”
Chief among Mr. Nicoletti’s concerns were scenes that placed people at places they had not been present at and scenes that depicted events that were out of chronological order .
The father looked as if he might have once been a marine himself , a handsome man of perfect posture , with bristly silver hair , dressed smartly in a blue blazer and gray slacks .
The mother , blond , wore light - colored pants and an orange jacket .
Her glasses made her eyes seem bigger than they were .
They both looked calm , if a little lost , and gave off an aura of deep quiet .
As she walked by me she noticed that a tie had fallen as I was removing something from my carry - on bag and she stopped and pointed .
“ I think you dropped something , ” she said softly .
They stood at the window between Gates 43 and 45 and watched as a full Marine honor guard marched up the tarmac , coming to attention between the plane and a silver military hearse .
The unloading of their son ’s coffin from the cargo hold was very slow , and every time someone inside the terminal noticed and stopped to stare , someone else noticed and did the same , and this kept happening until about 20 people stood in silence watching out the window .
The mom leaned her elbows on the window ledge , supporting her chin and cheeks with both hands .
She remained perfectly still .
She stared for 10 or 15 long minutes and never moved .
The father stood nearby , rocking from foot to foot and pacing a bit .
They did not touch ; they did not say a word to each other .
Neither wore a wedding band .
Perhaps they were divorced , or simply isolated in their pain .
Standing nearby was a man wearing the T - shirt of a suburban fire and rescue department that he may have earned 20 years and 35 pounds ago .
He went over to the parents to chat , not knowing who they were , just one curious spectator to another .
But whatever he said to the mother caused her to turn and look at him in disbelief .
Her lips did n’t move , which only encouraged him to repeat it .
Her eyes widened and her chin tilted upward like a boxer who had taken a blow .
She stared at him and then looked back outside toward her son .
Down on the tarmac the white gloves of eight marines snapped their final salute as the doors of the hearse closed .
The P.A. system announced flights for Atlanta and Chicago .
Travelers rushed to business meetings or summer vacations .
The line for Auntie Anne ’s pretzels was as long as ever .
Except for a handful of us standing frozen at a respectful distance from the window , the war and its carnage might as well have been on another planet .
The disconnect between those who serve and those of us who are beneficiaries of their service has always felt great to me , but never greater than at that moment .
The mom and dad stepped away from the man in the T - shirt and to another window , still not touching , their movement synchronized by grief .
They waited until the marine in charge came back up from the runway to escort them to a government vehicle .
I went to my car and drove to work with no ambition for the day other than to be worthy .
Britney has scheduled a C - Section for her second child – to take place on little Sean Preston ’s birthday , September 14th .
She ’s also planning on calling the baby “ Jailynn ” in honor of her parents and her sister .
Britney Spears has apparently found a novel way for hubby Kevin Federline to keep track of all his kids ’ special moments .
Star magazine reports that Baby No. 2 ( Kevin ’s fourth spawn , counting two others with ex- girlfriend Shar Jackson ) will have the same birthday as their son Sean Preston Ã¢â‚¬â€  Sept. 14 Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the same name as Brit ’s parents .
The planned C-section will deliver a daughter whom Britney will name Jailynn in honor of her parents , Jamie and Lynn , and Brit ’s little sister , Jamie Lynn .
Got that , Kev ?
Now does n’t that take a special day away from her current child , who is already getting a sibling at the tender age of one ?
It seems like a pretty dumb move on Britney ’s part if it ’s true .
She ’s having a scheduled C - Section , so surely she could have gone a few days before or after Sean Preston ’s birthday .
The little guy deserves to have his own birthday .
Not only is he subject to Britney ’s poor ( but well - intentioned ) parenting , now he ’s getting his damn birthday downgraded too .
It just does n’t seem fair to either baby .
Here is Britney nurishing her unborn child with some Taco Bell .
Her companion seems to enjoy fast food as well .

The Freedom of Information
Act came into force 12 months ago and most public authorities say it is helping to create a culture of greater openness .
But the Act 's regulator has had over 2,300 complaints about the public sector improperly refusing to release information .
According to the Information Commissioner 's Office , over 1,000 of these complaints have been resolved either by negotiation , informal resolution or by formal decision notice .
Only 135 such notices have been issued so far .
The ICO has been criticised for a delay in dealing with complaints , generating a backlog of six months , according to some reports .
The ICO blames this partly on an initial surge of complaints , reflecting the initial wave of information requests made to public authorities at the start of 2005 .
But the ICO reports that it has learned much in the past year and it has recently instituted a series of new measures designed to help it deal more effectively with complaints .
These include setting up a new case reception unit , introducing a new complaints form , more active case management and extra staff , including more senior managers .
“ I am confident that with the changes we have made , along with our growing experience , we can accelerate case handling procedures and improve productivity , ” said Information Commissioner Richard Thomas .
“ Particularly complex cases do take longer to resolve , but increasing experience will continue to reduce the time this takes .
We have already closed over a third of all cases and our closure rate continues to improve .
We are also discussing increased resources with the Department for Constitutional Affairs which will help us to deliver further improvements to our service , ” he said .
The most common complaints relate to the general right of access to information held by public authorities ( where the complaint is that requested information has not been provided , in full or in part ) and to the length of time a public authority may take to comply with a request .
A survey carried out among 500 public authorities reveals that the majority believe the Act is beneficial and is helping to create a culture of greater openness in the public sector .
Increased openness and transparency , better records management , improved accountability and improved relationships with the public were all highlighted in the survey as benefits of the Act .
Three out of five respondents said that their organisation released more information to the public as a result of the Freedom of Information Act .
Two thirds of public authorities receiving information requests had turned one or more requests down , with 77 per cent of large authorities and 52 per cent of small to medium - sized authorities admitting to rejecting a request .
The most common reason for this , according to the survey , was because the request sought personal information on a staff member ( 53 per cent ) .
Other common reasons for rejection were commercial sensitivity ( 33 per cent ) or the fact that the data was available elsewhere ( 14 per cent ) .
Most authorities ( 76 per cent ) are planning further changes to their publication schemes or their filing and record management systems in the next year , in order to further comply with the Act .
“ Governmental culture is starting to change , ” said Mr Thomas .
“ There is still a long way to go but I am encouraged by the range and significant number of disclosures we have seen so far . ”

Oil Price History and Analysis
A discussion of crude oil prices , the relationship between prices and rig count and the outlook for the future of the petroleum industry .
Introduction
Like prices of other commodities the price of crude oil experiences wide price swings in times of shortage or oversupply .
The crude oil price cycle may extend over several years responding to changes in demand as well as OPEC and non-OPEC supply .
We will discuss the impact of geopolitical events , supply demand and stocks as well as NYMEX trading and the economy .
Throughout much of the twentieth century , the price of U.S. petroleum was heavily regulated through production or price controls .
In the post World War II era , U.S. oil prices at the wellhead averaged $ 28.52 per barrel adjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars .
In the absence of price controls , the U.S. price would have tracked the world price averaging near $ 30.54 .
Over the same post war period , the median for the domestic and the adjusted world price of crude oil was $ 20.53 in 2010 prices .
Adjusted for inflation , from 1947 to 2010 oil prices only exceeded $ 20.53 per barrel 50 percent of the time .
( See note in the box on right . )
Until March 28 , 2000 when OPEC adopted the $ 22 - $ 28 price band for the OPEC basket of crude , real oil prices only exceeded $ 30.00 per barrel in response to war or conflict in the Middle East .
With limited spare production capacity , OPEC abandoned its price band in 2005 and was powerless to stem a surge in oil prices , which was reminiscent of the late 1970s .
Crude Oil Prices 1947 - October 2011

The only very long term price series that exists is the U.S. average wellhead or first purchase price of crude .
When discussing long - term price behavior this presents a problem since the U.S. imposed price controls on domestic production from late 1973 to January 1981 .
In order to present a consistent series and also reflect the difference between international prices and U.S. prices we created a world oil price series that was consistent with the U.S. wellhead price adjusting the wellhead price by adding the difference between the refiners acquisition price of imported crude and the refiners average acquisition price of domestic crude .
The Long Term View
The very long - term view is similar .
Since 1869 , US crude oil prices adjusted for inflation averaged $ 23.67 per barrel in 2010 dollars compared to $ 24.58 for world oil prices .
Fifty percent of the time prices U.S. and world prices were below the median oil price of $ 24.58 per barrel .
If long - term history is a guide , those in the upstream segment of the crude oil industry should structure their business to be able to operate with a profit , below $ 24.58 per barrel half of the time .
The very long - term data and the post World War II data suggest a " normal " price far below the current price .
However , the rise of OPEC , which replaced the Texas Railroad Commission as the monitor of spare production capacity , together with increased interest in oil futures as an asset class introduced changes that support prices far higher than the historical " norm . ”
Crude Oil Prices 1869 - October 2011

The results are dramatically different if only post -1970 data are used .
In that case , U.S. crude oil had an average price of $ 34.77 per barrel .
The more relevant world oil price averaged $ 37.93 per barrel .
The median oil price for that period is $ 32.50 per barrel .
If oil prices revert to the mean this period is a little more appropriate for today 's analyst .
It follows the peak in U.S. oil production eliminating the effects of the Texas Railroad Commission which effectively controlled oil prices prior to 1970 .
It is a period when the Seven Sisters were no longer able to dominate oil production and prices and an era of greater influence for OPEC oil producers .
As we will see in the detail below , influence over the price of oil is not equivalent to control .
Prices in the mid $ 30s seem exceptionally low by today 's standards .
However , when the current President of the United States took office the price was $ 35.00 per barrel .
By the end of 2009 prices had doubled bringing the average for 2009 to $ 56.35 or $ 57.00 in 2010 $ .

Post World War II Pre-Embargo Period From 1948 through the end of the 1960s , crude oil prices ranged between $ 2.50 and $ 3.00 .
The price oil rose from $ 2.50 in 1948 to about $ 3.00 in 1957 .
When viewed in 2010 dollars , a different story emerges with crude oil prices fluctuating between $ 17 and $ 19 during most of the period .
The apparent 20 % price increase in nominal prices just kept up with inflation .
From 1958 to 1970 , prices were stable near $ 3.00 per barrel , but in real terms the price of crude oil declined from $ 19 to $ 14 per barrel .
Not only was price of crude lower when adjusted for inflation , but in 1971 and 1972 the international producer suffered the additional effect of a weaker US dollar .
OPEC was established in 1960 with five founding members : Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Venezuela .
Two of the representatives at the initial meetings previously studied the Texas Railroad Commission 's method of controlling price through limitations on production .
By the end of 1971 , six other nations had joined the group : Qatar , Indonesia , Libya , United Arab Emirates , Algeria and Nigeria .
From the foundation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries through 1972 , member countries experienced steady decline in the purchasing power of a barrel of oil .
Throughout the post war period exporting countries found increased demand for their crude oil but a 30 % decline in the purchasing power of a barrel of oil .
In March 1971 , the balance of power shifted .
That month the Texas Railroad Commission set proration at 100 percent for the first time .
This meant that Texas producers were no longer limited in the volume of oil that they could produce from their wells .
More important , it meant that the power to control crude oil prices shifted from the United States ( Texas , Oklahoma and Louisiana ) to OPEC .
By 1971 , there was no spare production capacity in the U.S. and therefore no tool to put an upper limit on prices .
A little more than two years later , OPEC through the unintended consequence of war obtained a glimpse of its power to influence prices .
It took over a decade from its formation for OPEC to realize the extent of its ability to influence the world market .

Middle East Supply Interruptions Yom Kippur War - Arab Oil Embargo *
In 1972 , the price of crude oil was below $ 3.50 per barrel .
The Yom Kippur War started with an attack on Israel by Syria and Egypt on October 5 , 1973 .
The United States and many countries in the western world showed support for Israel .
In reaction to the support of Israel , several Arab exporting nations joined by Iran imposed an embargo on the countries supporting Israel .
While these nations curtailed production by five million barrels per day , other countries were able to increase production by a million barrels .
The net loss of four million barrels per day extended through March of 1974 .
It represented 7 percent of the free world production .
By the end of 1974 , the nominal price of oil had quadrupled to more than $ 12.00 .
Any doubt that the ability to influence and in some cases control crude oil prices had passed from the United States to OPEC was removed as a consequence of the Oil Embargo .
The extreme sensitivity of prices to supply shortages , became all too apparent when prices increased 400 percent in six short months .
From 1974 to 1978 , the world crude oil price was relatively flat ranging from $ 12.52 per barrel to $ 14.57 per barrel .
When adjusted for inflation world oil prices were in a period of moderate decline .
during that period OPEC capacity and production was relatively flat near 30 million barrels per day .
In contrast , non-OPEC production increased from 25 million barrels per day to 31 million barrels per day .
* While commonly called the Arab Oil Embargo or the OPEC Oil Embargo , neither is technically correct .
Arab nations were joined by Persian Iran and founding OPEC member Venezuela did not join in the embargo .

Crises in Iran and Iraq
In 1979 and 1980 , events in Iran and Iraq led to another round of crude oil price increases .
The Iranian revolution resulted in the loss of 2.0 - 2.5 million barrels per day of oil production between November 1978 and June 1979 .
At one point production almost halted .
The Iranian revolution was the proximate cause of the highest price in post -WWII history .
However , revolution 's impact on prices would have been limited and of relatively short duration had it not been for subsequent events .
In fact , shortly after the revolution , Iranian production was up to four million barrels per day .
In September 1980 , Iran already weakened by the revolution was invaded by Iraq .
By November , the combined production of both countries was only a million barrels per day .
It was down 6.5 million barrels per day from a year before .
As a consequence , worldwide crude oil production was 10 percent lower than in 1979 .
The loss of production from the combined effects of the Iranian revolution and the Iraq - Iran War caused crude oil prices to more than double .
The nominal price went from $ 14 in 1978 to $ 35 per barrel in 1981 .
Over three decades later Iran 's production is only two - thirds of the level reached under the government of Reza Pahlavi , the former Shah of Iran .
Iraq 's production is now increasing , but remains a million barrels below its peak before the Iraq - Iran War .

US Oil Price Controls - Bad Policy ?
The rapid increase in crude prices from 1973 to 1981 would have been less was it not for United States energy policy during the post Embargo period .
The U.S. imposed price controls on domestically produced oil .
The obvious result of the price controls was that U.S. consumers of crude oil paid about 50 percent more for imports than domestic production and U.S. producers received less than world market price .
In effect , the domestic petroleum industry was subsidizing the U.S. consumer .
Did the policy achieve its goal ?
In the short - term , the recession induced by the 1973 - 1974 crude oil price spike was somewhat less severe because U.S. consumers faced lower prices than the rest of the world .
However , it had other effects as well .
In the absence of price controls , U.S. exploration and production would certainly have been significantly greater .
Higher petroleum prices faced by consumers would have resulted in lower rates of consumption : automobiles would have achieved higher miles per gallon sooner , homes and commercial buildings would have been better insulated and improvements in industrial energy efficiency would have been greater than they were during this period .
Fuel substitution away from petroleum to natural gas for electric power generation would have occurred earlier .
Consequently , the United States would have been less dependent on imports in 1979 - 1980 and the price increase in response to Iranian and Iraqi supply interruptions would have been significantly less .

OPEC Fails to Control Crude Oil Prices
OPEC has seldom been effective at controlling prices .
Often described as a cartel , OPEC does not fully satisfy the definition .
One of the primary requirements of a cartel is a mechanism to enforce member quotas .
An elderly Texas oil man posed a rhetorical question :
What is the difference between OPEC and the Texas Railroad Commission ?
His answer : OPEC does n't have any Texas Rangers !
The Texas Railroad Commission could control prices because the state could enforce cutbacks on producers .
The only enforcement mechanism that ever existed in OPEC is Saudi spare capacity and that power resides with a single member not the organization as a whole .
With enough spare capacity to be able to increase production sufficiently to offset the impact of lower prices on its own revenue , Saudi Arabia could enforce discipline by threatening to increase production enough to crash prices .
In reality even this was not an OPEC enforcement mechanism unless OPEC 's goals coincided with those of Saudi Arabia .
During the 1979 - 1980 period of rapidly increasing prices , Saudi Arabia 's oil minister Ahmed Yamani repeatedly warned other members of OPEC that high prices would lead to a reduction in demand .
His warnings fell on deaf ears .
Surging prices caused several reactions among consumers : better insulation in new homes , increased insulation in many older homes , more energy efficiency in industrial processes , and automobiles with higher efficiency .
These factors along with a global recession caused a reduction in demand which led to lower crude prices .
Unfortunately for OPEC only the global recession was temporary .
Nobody rushed to remove insulation from their homes or to replace energy efficient equipment and factories -- much of the reaction to the oil price increase of the end of the decade was permanent and would never respond to lower prices with increased consumption of oil .
Higher prices in the late 1970s also resulted in increased exploration and production outside of OPEC .
From 1980 to 1986 non-OPEC production increased 6 million barrels per day .
Despite lower oil prices during that period new discoveries made in the 1970s continued to come online .
OPEC was faced with lower demand and higher supply from outside the organization .
From 1982 to 1985 , OPEC attempted to set production quotas low enough to stabilize prices .
These attempts resulted in repeated failure , as various members of OPEC produced beyond their quotas .
During most of this period Saudi Arabia acted as the swing producer cutting its production in an attempt to stem the free fall in prices .
In August 1985 , the Saudis tired of this role .
They linked their oil price to the spot market for crude and by early 1986 increased production from two million barrels per day to five million .
Crude oil prices plummeted falling below $ 10 per barrel by mid-1986 .
Despite the fall in prices Saudi revenue remained about the same with higher volumes compensating for lower prices .
A December 1986 OPEC price accord set to target $ 18 per barrel , but it was already breaking down by January of 1987 and prices remained weak .
The price of crude oil spiked in 1990 with the lower production , uncertainty associated with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the ensuing Gulf War .
The world and particularly the Middle East had a much harsher view of Saddam Hussein invading Arab Kuwait than they did Persian Iran .
The proximity to the world 's largest oil producer helped to shape the reaction .

Following what became known as the Gulf War to liberate Kuwait , crude oil prices entered a period of steady decline .
In 1994 , the inflation adjusted oil price reached the lowest level since 1973 .
The price cycle then turned up .
The United States economy was strong and the Asian Pacific region was booming .
From 1990 to 1997 , world oil consumption increased 6.2 million barrels per day .
Asian consumption accounted for all but 300,000 barrels per day of that gain and contributed to a price recovery that extended into 1997 .
Declining Russian production contributed to the price recovery .
Between 1990 and 1996 Russian production declined more than five million barrels per day .

OPEC continued to have mixed success in controlling prices .
There were mistakes in timing of quota changes as well as the usual problems in maintaining production discipline among member countries .
The price increases came to a rapid end in 1997 and 1998 when the impact of the economic crisis in Asia was either ignored or underestimated by OPEC .
In December 1997 , OPEC increased its quota by 2.5 million barrels per day ( 10 percent ) to 27.5 million barrels per day effective January 1 , 1998 .
The rapid growth in Asian economies came to a halt .
In 1998 , Asian Pacific oil consumption declined for the first time since 1982 .
The combination of lower consumption and higher OPEC production sent prices into a downward spiral .
In response , OPEC cut quotas by 1.25 million barrels per day in April and another 1.335 million in July .
The price continued down through December 1998 .
Prices began to recover in early 1999 .
In April , OPEC reduced production by another 1.719 million barrels .
As usual not all of the quotas were observed , but between early 1998 and the middle of 1999 OPEC production dropped by about three million barrels per day .
The cuts were sufficient to move prices above $ 25 per barrel .
With minimal Y2 K problems and growing U.S. and world economies , the price continued to rise throughout 2000 to a post 1981 high .
In 2000 between April and October , three successive OPEC quota increases totaling 3.2 million barrels per day were not able to stem the price increase .
Prices finally started down following another quota increase of 500,000 effective November 1 , 2000 .

Russian production increases dominated non-OPEC production growth from 2000 to 2007 and was responsible for most of the non-OPEC increase since the turn of the century .
Once again it appeared that OPEC overshot the mark .
In 2001 , a weakened US economy and increases in non-OPEC production put downward pressure on prices .
In response OPEC once again entered into a series of reductions in member quotas cutting 3.5 million barrels by September 1 , 2001 .
In the absence of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , this would have been sufficient to moderate or even reverse the downward trend .
In the wake of the attack , crude oil prices plummeted .
Spot prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate were down 35 percent by the middle of November .
Under normal circumstances a drop in price of this magnitude would have resulted in another round of quota reductions .
Given the political climate OPEC delayed additional cuts until January 2002 .
It then reduced its quota by 1.5 million barrels per day and was joined by several non-OPEC producers including Russia which promised combined production cuts of an additional 462,500 barrels .
This had the desired effect with oil prices moving into the $ 25 range by March 2002 .
By midyear the non-OPEC members were restoring their production cuts but prices continued to rise as U.S. inventories reached a 20 - year low later in the year .
By year end oversupply was not a problem .
Problems in Venezuela led to a strike at PDVSA causing Venezuelan production to plummet .
In the wake of the strike Venezuela was never able to restore capacity to its previous level and is still about 900,000 barrels per day below its peak capacity of 3.5 million barrels per day .
OPEC increased quotas by 2.8 million barrels per day in January and February 2003 .
On March 19 , 2003 , just as some Venezuelan production was beginning to return , military action commenced in Iraq .
Meanwhile , inventories remained low in the U.S. and other OECD countries .
With an improving economy U.S. demand was increasing and Asian demand for crude oil was growing at a rapid pace .
The loss of production capacity in Iraq and Venezuela combined with increased OPEC production to meet growing international demand led to the erosion of excess oil production capacity .
In mid 2002 , there were more than six million barrels per day of excess production capacity and by mid-2003 the excess was below two million .
During much of 2004 and 2005 the spare capacity to produce oil was less than a million barrels per day .
A million barrels per day is not enough spare capacity to cover an interruption of supply from most OPEC producers .
In a world that consumes more than 80 million barrels per day of petroleum products that added a significant risk premium to crude oil price and was largely responsible for prices in excess of $ 40 - $ 50 per barrel .
Other major factors contributing to higher prices included a weak dollar and the rapid growth in Asian economies and their petroleum consumption .
The 2005 hurricanes and U.S. refinery problems associated with the conversion from MTBE to ethanol as a gasoline additive also contributed to higher prices .

Excess Crude Oil Production Capacity Click on graph for larger view
One of the most important factors determining price is the level of petroleum inventories in the U.S. and other consuming countries .
Until spare capacity became an issue inventory levels provided an excellent tool for short - term price forecasts .
Although not well publicized OPEC has for several years depended on a policy that amounts to world inventory management .
Its primary reason for cutting back on production in November 2006 and again in February 2007 was concern about growing OECD inventories .
Their focus is on total petroleum inventories including crude oil and petroleum products , which is a better indicator of prices that oil inventories alone .
World Events and Crude Oil Prices 2004 - 2007
In 2008 , after the beginning of the longest U.S. recession since the Great Depression the oil price continued to soar .
Spare capacity dipped below a million barrels per day and speculation in the crude oil futures market was exceptionally strong .
Trading on NYMEX closed at a record $ 145.29 on July 3 , 2008 .
In the face of recession and falling petroleum demand the price fell throughout the remainder of the year to the below $ 40 in December .
Following an OPEC cut of 4.2 million b/d in January 2009 prices rose steadily in the supported by rising demand in Asia .
In late February 2011 , prices jumped as a consequence of the loss of Libyan exports in the face of the Libyan civil war .
Concern about additional interruptions from unrest in other Middle East and North African producers continues to support the price while as of Mid-October 400,000 barrels per day of Libyan production was restored .
World Events and Crude Oil Prices 2007 - May 20 , 2011 Recessions and Oil Prices
Futures Market and Brent / NYMEX Divergence
While speculation in the futures market was certainly a component of price increases over the last decade , research has yet to provide incontrovertible evidence that it was a major driver of prices .
Over the last decade the number of futures contracts on NYMEX increased at over ten times the rate of increase of world petroleum consumption .
In recent years , the ICE Brent contracts grew at a higher rate than NYMEX .
A NYMEX futures contract is a contract to deliver 1,000 barrels of light sweet crude oil in a certain month to the buyer at Cushing , Oklahoma .
There is a direct link between futures prices and the cash price at Cushing .
We will illustrate with an example .
A producer of crude oil is offered $ 80 per barrel for 1,000 barrel of oil today .
The same producer sees that the futures contract for delivery next month is trading at $ 85 dollars .
Instead of selling at $ 80 to the refiner the producer could sell a futures contract for delivery next month at $ 85 , store the 1,000 barrels for a month and be $ 5 better off less the cost of a months storage .
The refiner needing the 1,000 barrels of crude today is then in the position that he must offer the producer something closer to the $ 85 NYMEX price to obtain the crude .
Historically , the price of NYMEX crude typically traded near the Brent price with a small premium .
Since late 2010 , Brent and NYMEX prices have diverged with West Texas Intermediate at Cushing , Oklahoma selling often selling more than $ 20 below Brent and other comparable crude oil .
While continually quoted in the U.S. media as the oil price , oil at Cushing is not currently representative of world oil prices .
The reason for the discount is high stocks of oil at Cushing with a limited number of refiners that can be served by pipelines out of Cushing .
Additional oil from Canada and the Bakken formation in North Dakota caused the local supply to exceed demand of the refiners served by pipelines out of Cushing .
This resulted in oil stocks to building to 1.5 - 2.0 times the normal level .
High stocks at Cushing depressed the local price , but not the price internationally .
A return to the normal price relationship with WTI at a modest premium to Brent awaits improved pipeline access between Cushing and the refineries on the gulf of Mexico .
Recessions and Oil Prices
It is worth noting that the three longest U.S. recessions since the Great Depression coincided with exceptionally high oil prices .
The first two lasted 16 months .
The first followed the 1973 Embargo started in November 1973 and the second in July 1981 .
The latest began in December 2007 and lasted 18 months .
Charts similar to the one at the right have been used to argue that price spikes and high oil prices cause recessions .
There is little doubt that price is a major factor .
The same graph makes an even more compelling argument that recessions cause low oil prices .
Regelschule im Ausnahmezustand Rudolf Maresch
Die permissive Gesellschaft erlebt einen Super - Gau , doch Lobbyistenverbände kochen wieder mal ihr eigenes Süppchen
„ Hurra , die Schule brennt ! “ Damals , 1969 , als Franz Seitz einen der überaus beliebten Pennäler - Filme auf diesen Titel taufte , war dies allenfalls ein Filmspaß , der Groß und Klein amüsierte .
Trotz aller Kritik schien die Schule , wenn man sie so herrlich persiflieren konnte , noch in Ordnung .
Dafür sorgten nicht zuletzt die überzeichneten Figuren , Theo Lingen als schrulliger Schulleiter Dr. Werner Taft , Peter Alexander , der den modernen Pauker Dr. Bach mimte , sowie der Sängerknabe Heintje , der diesmal für Hansi Kraus ins Rennen geschickt wurde .
Wenn Schüler so viel Schabernack mit so wunderlichen Gestalten wie ihrem Studienrat Dr. Knörz( erich ) treiben konnten , mussten die Zeiten , als Professor Unrat Schüler noch mit Rohrstock und dem Abfragen von Latein - Vokabeln seine Schüler quälte , der Vergangenheit angehören .
Zumal ein neuer Lehrertyp bereits vor den Schultoren stand , der sozialintegrative und partnerschaftliche Typ , der von Lehrerbildungsanstalten vom Frontalunterricht auf Gruppenarbeit , von Pauken auf Problembewältigung und von Tafel und Kreide auf Medienarbeit umgepolt worden war .
Aus selbigem Titel , mit einem zweiten „ Hurra ! “ aber in der Zeile , machte eine Dekade später „ Extrabreit “ einen Schülerhit .
Worüber die Hagener Band darin sang , klang weit weniger lustig : „ Stand close to each other / By the burning fire /
The sun shines in the sky /
The fire is burning / Out of Control / And I do n’t want to die ! ”
Die demokratische Offensive , die von Bildungsreformern post 68 aus der Taufe gehoben worden war , um den Muff der Nachkriegszeit aus den Klassenzimmern zu vertreiben , erlebte ihr erstes Waterloo .
Statt Demokratie und Teilhabe wollte der mündige Schüler vielmehr „ seiner “ Schule den Garaus machen .
Die 68er Erziehung erlebte er , ob berechtigt oder nicht , als Zwangskorsett .
„ We do n’t need no education .
Leave us kids alone “ , intonierte der Schülerchor in Roger Waters Rockopus “ The Wall ” .
Die Anti-Pädagogik , eine Art von Aufguss Rousseauscher Kulturromantik , hatte die Szenerie erobert .
Aufmüpfige Schüler erklärten der liberalen Gesellschaft den Ausstieg .
Und die 68er Erziehung erlebte ihre zweite große Pleite .
Keine blöden Parolen wie diese / Fickt das System !
Frank Spilker , Die Sterne
Schluss mit lustig
Ein Vierteljahrhundert später ist aus den Albernheiten einer Filmkomödie und den bösen Fantasien juveniler Deutschrocker blutiger Ernst und bittere Realität geworden .
Die Schule brennt .
Mancherorts sogar lichterloh .
Und zwar nicht erst seit dem 30 .
März 2006 , als ein Brandbrief des Lehrerkollegiums der Berliner Rütli - Schule vom „ Tagesspiegel “ publik gemacht wurde und die bundesdeutsche Öffentlichkeit aufgeschreckt hat ( Klassenkampf in Neukölln ) .
Auch schon viele Jahre zuvor , wie Insider längst wissen .
Die „ Lümmel “ von einst kennen keinen Spaß mehr , wenn sie gezielt mit Gegenständen auf ihre Lehrer zielen , im Klassenzimmer lauthals und ungeniert herumgrölen , sie mit unflätigen Kraftausdrücken provozieren , Klassenzimmer mit einfallslosen Parolen beschmieren oder einfach Stühle durch die Klassenzimmer werfen .
Und das obwohl oder gerade weil ihre Lehrer versuchen , sie in Gruppen arbeiten zu lassen , sie für Projekte interessieren möchten , Lob auch dann verteilen , wenn sie es gar nicht verdienen oder sich im Klassenzimmer partnerschaftlich geben .
Die Schüler meinen es verdammt ernst , sie handeln kühl , berechnend und „ knallhart “ , wie der gleichnamige Film von Detlef Buck über den Neuköllner Schul - und Lebensverhältnisse zeigt ( Neukölln ist überall ) .
Nirgendwo sonst ist in letzter Zeit das Erbe der 68er , ihr Versuch , junge Menschen zu mehr Demokratie und Toleranz , Weltoffenheit und Dialog zu erziehen , schonungsloser , authentischer und brutaler versenkt worden als in diesem Filmdrama .
Ghetto , Milieu und das Gesetz des Dschungels haben dem bildungsbürgerliche Idyll sozialromantisch veranlagter Erzieher längst ihren Stempel aufgedrückt und den Garaus gemacht .
Der Bürgerkrieg , den Hans - Magnus Enzensberger einst noch in unseren Großstädten ortete , ist in den Regelschulen angekommen .
Und zwar unter Aufsicht von Erwachsenen , die lieber wegschauen , wenn Schutzbefohlene traktiert werden , damit sie weiter ihre lieb gewonnenen Mythen und Ideale pflegen und hegen können .
„ Die Tendenz vieler Menschen ist ja “ , fasst Detlef Buck die Reaktion auf seinen Film resignierend zusammen , „ nicht hinzusehen , auch mein Film ‚ Knallhart ’ läuft bisher nicht gerade bombig , man will nicht hingucken " .
Den Film kann man ignorieren .
Seit dem 30 .
März kann hingegen keiner mehr sagen , er wisse von all dem nichts .
Ein echter Skandal
Nimmt man Bucks Urteil for granted , dann konnte es kaum verwundern , dass der Brandbrief des Kollegiums mit der Bitte , die Hauptschule in dieser Form „ perspektivisch aufzulösen ” , den verantwortlichen Schulsenator , den SPD - Politiker Klaus Böger , überrascht hat .
Nicht nur in Berlin , auch anderswo in der Republik wird die Lage an den Regelschulen , vor allem von Schulleitern und / oder Schulaufsichtsbehörden , in aller Regel vertuscht , verniedlicht oder bagatellisiert .
Statt massive Verfehlungen , Störungen oder Gewalttaten rigoros zu ahnden und anzuzeigen , werden sie lieber als dumme Jungenstreiche abgetan , selbst von Lehrern .
Häufig hört man dann , auch wir hätten uns damals ab und an gekloppt oder dem Lehrer „ den Vogel gezeigt “ .
Selbstverständlich hinter seinem Rücken .
Ob der Schulsenator von seinen untergeordneten Chargen bewusst nicht informiert worden ist oder ob er davon doch Kenntnis gehabt und bewusst auf Zeit gespielt hat , ist vom Schreibtisch aus nicht zu beurteilen .
Tatsache ist , dass der Brandbrief bereits Ende Februar ( manche Quellen sprechen vom 21 .
Februar , andere vom 28 .
Februar , wieder andere gar erst vom 2 . März ) verfasst und an die entsprechenden Stellen versandt worden .
Dort wurde er offensichtlich in der Hoffnung , dass die Dinge sich schon regeln und die Betroffenen stillhalten würden , einfach liegen gelassen .
Eine gängige Praxis , wie Beobachter der Szene längst wissen , um Vorfälle dieser Art buchstäblich „ unter den Teppich zu kehren “ .
Ein folgenschwerer Trugschluss , wie sich zum großen Pech der Behörde diesmal herausgestellt hat , der eigentliche Skandal in dieser Geschichte .
Der Versuch , die Dinge durch Stillschweigen und Nichtbeachtung zu regeln – dieser Schuss ging für die Behörden nach hinten los .
Sie haben die Geduld , die Verzweiflung und die Leidensfähigkeit der betroffenen Lehrerschaft offenbar total unterschätzt oder falsch interpretiert .
Und zwar so sehr , dass einige oder zumindest ein Mitglied des Kollegiums ihr oder sein Heil in der Öffentlichkeit gesucht und den Brief dem „ Tagesspiegel “ zugespielt haben .
Die weiße Fahne zu hissen und damit der Öffentlichkeit die eigene Ohnmacht , „ Rat - und Hilflosigkeit “ einzugestehen , ist alles andere als selbstverständlich .
Ein mutiger Schritt der Lehrer , der nicht hoch genug veranschlagt werden kann .
Dafür sollte den Verfassern baldmöglichst ein Verdienstorden für Zivilcourage verliehen werden , von wem auch immer .
Die Erregungs - und Zerredungs - Gesellschaft hebt an
Der Aufschrei und die Auf - und Erregung , der und die sich danach über das Land ergossen , war danach riesengroß .
Noch am selben Tag , als Bericht und Brief im „ Tagesspiegel “ erschienen , postierten sich Kamerateams mit Aufzeichnungsgeräten und Ü - Wagen vor dem Schultor .
Und die Kameras bekamen auch genau das , was sie sehen wollten : Fliegende Pflastersteine , „ martialisch posierende “ Kids in Kapuzenshirts und übergroßen Kängeruhosen , „ Wichser “ - Rufe und Stinkefinger , die sie den Reportern entgegenstreckten .
Auch der Schulsenator kam nicht umhin , ob dieser Medienpräsenz Flagge zu zeigen und Handlungskompetenz zu demonstrieren .
Eine Pressekonferenz jagte bald die andere , auf denen versucht wurde , die für ihn und seine Behörde äußerst brenzlige Situation zu de-eskalieren .
Wie von Geisterhand zauberte er urplötzlich einen Schulleiter für den jahrelang vakanten Posten an dieser Schule aus dem Hut .
Dazu noch zwei Psychologen und zwei Sozialarbeiter , um Schüler - und Lehrerschaft zu kurieren und , wie der Senator meinte , „ zivilisatorische Grundsätze durchzusetzen “ .
Wie man jetzt hört , will er , nachdem auch andere Schulen in Berlin Hilferufe lanciert haben , fünfzig neue Lehrerstellen ausschreiben .
Noch am Abend liefen Berichten über die Missstände als Hauptmeldung bei „ Heute “ und den „ Tagesthemen “ über den Schirm .
Tags drauf , nachdem auch die Qualitätszeitungen die Umstände zum Topthema erklärt hatten , gaben sich auch die Politiker sowie die Bundesbeauftragte für Integration , Maria Böhmer , gegenseitig die Klinke in die Hand .
Noch während sie mit den Betroffenen sprachen und ihre heillose Betroffenheit zum Besten gaben , flogen Schwämme aus dem Fenster und schallten Fäkalwörter über den Pausehof .
Offensichtlich gefiel es den Jugendlichen , vor all den Kameras die großen Macker zu spielen und für einige Tage im Zentrum der Medienöffentlichkeit zu stehen .
Business as usual könnte man meinen .
Alles wie gehabt .
Erfurt lässt grüßen .
Auch damals , als „ Steini “ Steinhauser seinen Amoklauf beendet hatte , bebte und eruptierte die deutsche Erregungs - Gesellschaft für kurze Zeit .
Seit letztem Donnerstag bekommt die Sensationsgier der Medien wieder neue Nahrung .
Für einige Zeit lassen sich Sendezeiten , Diskussionsrunden und Hochglanzzeiten mit einem Topthema füllen .
Seither werden wir von Wortmeldungen so genannter Experten , von schlauen Kommentaren und gegenseitigen Schuldzuweisungen regelrecht bombardiert .
Dabei den Überblick zu behalten , fällt alles andere als leicht .
Insgesamt viel Arbeit und Stoff für Christiansen , Maischberger und Co in der nächsten Woche .
Lobbygruppen formieren sich
Wie zu erwarten , gingen am Tag danach auch die verschiedenen Interessengruppen in Stellung , Lobbyistenverbände und Parteien verbreiteten ihre hinreichend bekannten Patentrezepte und suchten den Vorfall für ihre Zwecke zu instrumentalisieren :
Ein Teil der Lehrerverbände empfahl die sofortige Zusammenlegung von Haupt - und Realschule sowie die Ausweitung des Ganztagskonzepts .
Welche Realschule das mitmachen und welcher Schüler sich freiwillig mit Störenfrieden und Intensivtätern in eine Klasse setzen möchte , sagten sie nicht .
Auch nicht , ob es eine gute Lösung ist , die Hölle des Vormittags auch noch auf den Nachmittag auszudehnen .
Kickboxen zu erlernen , das kann man auch in Freizeitheimen .
Es spricht für die Qualität der pädagogischen Rezepte , dass man so was zu lehren für wichtig hält .
Um die Schüler zu motivieren , tut man wohl alles .
Auch wie man am besten zuschlägt oder den Gegner kampfunfähig macht .
Aber das muss man nicht unbedingt in der Schule lernen .
Bundesbeauftragte und alle anderen Sozialkritiker nahmen sofort „ die Perspektivlosigkeit der Jugendlichen “ aufs Korn .
Sie sprachen sich dafür aus , die „ Hauptschule zu stärken “ und den Schülern „ eine berufliche Perspektive “ zu geben .
Wo allerdings die Arbeitsplätze dafür herkommen sollten und welcher Betrieb oder Handwerker Steine werfende Jugendliche einstellen sollte , die bestenfalls das Handy bedienen können oder der Fäkalsprache mächtig sind , wussten sie natürlich nicht .
Wieder andere forderten sogleich , die Schulsozialarbeit an den Schulen zu verstärken .
Statt die Eltern in die Pflicht zu nehmen , ihnen mit Konsequenzen zu drohen , die selbstverständlich auch finanzielle Einbußen beinhalten , möchten sie dem Problem am liebsten mit einem
Heer von Schulpsychologen und Sozialarbeitern zu Leibe rücken und die Jugendlichen therapieren .
Offenbar ist ihnen entgangen , dass seit Jahren dieser „ Gesundheitsbereich “ ( Foucault lässt grüßen ) permanent und systematisch ausgeweitet worden ist .
Wer nur mal einen Blick in Schülerakten riskiert , wird darin einen Pack von Testergebnissen , Diagnosen und Beurteilungen finden , die von Psychologen und Betreuern , Ärzten oder Logopäden verfasst worden sind , ohne dass sich an der desolaten Situation für den Betroffenen , die Klasse oder die Schule etwas ändert .
Viele scheinen zu übersehen , dass die Expansion der Psycho - Szene , die seit den 1970er Jahren an den Schulen eingesetzt hat , eher Teil und Symptom des Problems ist , und nicht dessen Lösung .
Dazu braucht man sich nur die Statistiken ansehen , die über Legasthenie , Hyperaktivität und Diskalkulie in Umlauf sind .
In jeder Klasse sitzt mittlerweile ein Unzahl von Schülern , die einen „ Vermerk “ über irgendeinen „ Defekt “ in den Akten haben , der von Medizinern und Psychologen auf Verlangen von Eltern ausgestellt wird und die Schüler darin entschuldet , sich im Unterricht mehr anzustrengen .
Da die echten Fälle von den bloß vorgetäuschten zu unterscheiden , ist äußerst schwer .
Dass sich da Resignation breit macht , Mutlosigkeit und Ähnliches , dürfte kaum jemand verwundern .
Da geht es den Lehrern wie der Polizei , die zunächst die Verbrecher fängt , die der Richter am nächsten Tag freilassen wird .
Bei all diesem „ Psychologismus “ , der sich in den Schulen eingenistet hat , wird aber übersehen , dass Schulen keine Sozialstationen , Wohngemeinschaften oder Ersatzfamilien sind , in denen sich Schüler „ ausheulen “ können .
Wer mehr will , überfordert sie oder hat den Blick für das Wesentliche schlichtweg verloren .
Schule kann Eltern , Vater und Mutter nicht ersetzen .
Ihr Auftrag kann allenfalls sein , den Schülern Schlüsselqualifikationen wie Schreiben , Lesen und Rechnen beizubringen und individuelle Kompetenzen zu fördern und zu entwickeln .
Der Vorschlag Annette Schavans , weniger Toleranz zu zeigen und Lehrern Sozialarbeiter an die Seite zu stellen , klingt verführerisch , funktioniert in der Praxis aber kaum .
Dafür sind die Vorstellungen in aller Regel viel zu unterschiedlich .
Sozialarbeiter haben hauptsächlich das Wohl ihrer Schützlinge im Blick , während Lehrer auf den ganzen Verbund zu achten haben .
Das Interesse der Gruppe steht folglich meist gegen das des Individuums .
Zudem lehrt die Erfahrung , dass Schüler äußerst kreativ mit ihren Betreuern umgehen .
Überaus geschickt lavieren sie zwischen beiden Instanzen und spielen häufig die eine gegen den andere aus .
Zumindest weiß Innenminister Wolfgang Schäuble , dass „ Jugendliche letztlich nur eine Gesellschaft widerspiegeln , die es zunehmend versäumt , klare Grenzen zu ziehen , die wichtige Normen nicht entschieden vorlebt und durchsetzt . “
Da trifft er sicher einen ebenso wunden und wichtigen Punkt .
Nur , wie er die Eltern , die sich häufig weder für die schulische Situation ihrer Kinder noch für das interessieren , was sie in der Schule lernen , dazu bringen will , das zu ändern , dazu äußert er sich nicht .
Schuldzuweisungen auszusprechen oder Forderungen aufzustellen , ist aber bestimmt das letzte , was die Regelschulen in ihrer jetzigen Lage brauchen .
Dazu ist die Situation viel zu verfahren und prekär .
Was sie brauchen sind vielmehr Maßnahmen , die unkonventionell und auch unpopulär sind , damit sie ihren Auftrag erfüllen und ihre Ziele durchzusetzen kann .
Wir kommen später darauf zurück .
Spitze des Eisberges
Bei Lichte besehen ist Rütli nämlich nur die Spitze des Eisberges .
Im Prinzip ist Rütli , mehr oder weniger , überall .
Jeder weiß das , Politiker , Lehrer , Behörden .
Ein zweiter Brandbrief , der dem Spiegel zugespielt worden ist und auch vom Tagesspiegel zitiert wird , signalisiert das .
Dass ein Großteil der Schüler „ keinerlei Empfinden für allgemeine Werte , Normen und Grenzen “ hat , dass Gewaltvorfälle „ verbaler wie auch psychischer Art sowohl gegen Mitschüler als auch gegen Lehrer “ drastisch zugenommen haben , und dass Lehrer von „ teilweise menschenverachtendem und demütigendem Schülerverhalten “ berichten , finden wir auch anderswo , in Großstädten wie in Köln , Hamburg , München oder Frankfurt genauso wie in Kleinstädten oder auf dem flachen Land .
Und zwar überall dort verstärkt , wo bestimmte Ethnien dominieren oder wo man in den letzten Jahren aus finanziellen Gründen Kleinst - oder Teilhauptschulen aufgelöst hat und sie zu großen Hauptschulzentren zusammengefasst hat .
Ethnische Dominanz , die kulturelle Kluft , mangelhafte Sprachkenntnisse , und Macho - Gehabe vornehmlich bei jungen männlichen Migranten sind nur das eine und allenfalls ein Teil des Problems ; die Verrohung des Umgangs , mangelnder Respekt vor dem anderen , Einhalten und Akzeptieren von Mindestregeln des Anstands sowie die wachsende Verluderung von Sitten und Gepflogenheiten , die von Medien und Unterschichtenfernsehen , von ständig wechselnden Bezugspersonen und desolaten Familienverhältnissen unterstützt und gefördert werden , aber auch der mangelnde Wille , sich überhaupt anzustrengen und aus seinem Leben was machen zu wollen , aber das andere und übergeordnete Problem .
Wer darin nur ein kulturkritisches Lamento über die ach so schreckliche Jugend erblickt , die es zu allen Zeiten gegeben hat , über die Halbstarken in den 1950 ern genauso wie über die langhaarigen Kiffer der 1960er oder die dreckigen Sprüche der Punks der 1980er , sollte sich nicht täuschen .
Es geht längst nicht mehr gegen ein System oder um das Recht auf symbolische Ausdrucksformen .
Die Krise reicht viel , viel tiefer .
Auf dem Spiel steht das , was Frank Schirrmacher in seinem Buch „ Minimum “ das „ geistige “ , „ moralische “ oder „ soziale Kapital “ einer Gesellschaft nennt , um Mindeststandards also , die das ungehinderte Erlernen und Erfahren von Fähigkeiten und Fertigkeiten möglich machen und das einigermaßen reibungslose Zusammenleben unterschiedlicher Gruppen , Ethnien und Individuen sichern oder anleiten .
Gelingt es der Schule nicht , das Einhalten solcher Standards zu gewährleisten , kann sie , wie der Brandbrief richtig formuliert , ihre Türen schließen und sich auflösen .
Alles hinlänglich bekannt
Um zu erfahren , was tatsächlich Tag für Tag an den Regelschulen abgeht , muss man sich nur einige Zeitlang mit den Betroffenen an einen Tisch sitzen .
Gewiss nicht bei offiziellen Anlässen , bei Schul - oder Unterrichtsbesuchen , wo versierte Lehrer oder der verantwortliche Schulleiter Besuchern stets den roten Teppich ausrollen und das Engagement der Schule in höchsten Tönen gelobt wird .
Beispielsweise , wo Medienbeauftragte dem Besucher von der tollen Medienpädagogik berichten , die an dieser Schule verrichtet wird , wo der verantwortliche Leiter die höchst erfolgreiche Streitschlichterkultur schildert , die von den Schülern in Eigenverantwortung verrichtet wird und dazu führt , dass Gewalt an der Schule kaum noch eine Chance hat , oder wo Schüler dazu vergattert oder darauf trainiert werden , bei einer Vorführung die Vorzüge einer von Schülern selbst organisierten Unterrichtsarbeit zu zeigen .
Sondern vielmehr abseits des Unterrichts und außerhalb des Schulgebäudes .
Vorfälle der besonderen …
Unterhält man sich mit ihnen , dann bekommt man einen Einblick in die täglichen Angriffe und Demütigungen , Ehrverletzungen und Erniedrigungen , denen Schüler und Lehrer gleichermaßen sich ausgesetzt sehen , auch darüber , wie hilflos mitunter Schulleiter und Schulaufsicht reagieren oder auch reagieren müssen , weil ihnen die geeigneten Mittel fehlen , latente Störer in die Schranken zu verweisen oder Intensivtäter der Schule zu verweisen .
Dann hört man , dass Junglehrerinnen von Schülern schon mal gepackt und aus dem Fenster gehalten werden ; dass Toiletten verstopft , verwüstet und beschmiert werden ; dass Schüler von anderen Schülern bedroht , erpresst und getreten werden , im Pausehof , während des Stundenwechsels oder auf dem Schulweg ; dass Schüler ( auch bereits Grundschüler der zweiten Klasse ) Lehrerinnen sexuell „ anmachen “ , sich auf den Toiletten ausziehen oder verlangen , die Scham des anderen gezeigt zu bekommen ; dass Schüler mitten im Unterricht die Hosen herunterlassen , ihr Glied entblößen und zu masturbieren beginnen ; dass Lehrer als „ Scheiße “ , „ Arschloch “ und „ Wichser “ bezeichnet werden , die sich möglichst schnell „ verpissen sollten “ .
… und der allgemeinen Art
Ganz zu schweigen von ganz „ normalen “ und alltäglichen Verstößen gegen die Haus- , Schul - und Unterrichtsordnung wie das willkürliche Dazwischenrufen im Unterricht , das ungenierte Sich - Unterhalten mit dem Nachbarn , das Nichtmitbringen erforderlicher Unterrichtsmaterialien wie Stifte , Hefte und Zeichengeräte , die Nichteinhaltung von Terminen , das regelmäßige Nichtanfertigen von Hausaufgaben usw .
Hinlänglich bekannte Sanktionen , wie Ermahnen , Nachsitzen oder Aufsätze verfassen , fruchten in aller Regel kaum noch .
Nur die wenigsten lassen sich davon wirklich beeindrucken .
Zum einen betrachten manche den „ zusätzlichen Unterricht “ als willkommenen „ Freizeitausgleich “ .
Zumal es zuhause so trostlos ist , dass die Schule für die „ Nachsitzer “ wenigstens ein soziales Umfeld bietet , in dem man sich austoben kann ; zum anderen ist kaum einer in der Lage , einen Besinnungsaufsatz über ein erziehliches
Thema zu verfassen .
Haben sich frühere Schülergenerationen wenigstens noch die Mühe gemacht , Hausaufgaben im Bus oder vor Beginn der Schule von einem Kameraden abzuschreiben , hält das die gegenwärtige Schülerpopulation kaum noch für nötig .
Steht Schwimmen oder Sport auf dem Programm , zögern oftmals Eltern nicht , ihren Kindern Krankmeldungen auszustellen .
Vorhaltungen von Lehrern werden bisweilen dadurch gekontert , dass Eltern ihre Sprösslinge gegen die dreisten Anmaßungen des Lehrers unterstützen .
Häufig wird nicht der eigene Sohn oder Tochter , wie noch vor Jahrzehnten , für Verfehlungen verantwortlich gemacht , sondern der unterrichtende Lehrer , der sich in den Augen findiger Elternvertreter als unfähig zeigt , ihr Kind zur Arbeit zu motivieren .
Wer glaubt , dass das an veralteten Unterrichtsformen liegt oder an der mangelnden Fortbildungsfreudigkeit der Lehrer , der sollte mal für einige Zeit ( und nicht nur für ein paar Stunden ) in einer Schule hospitieren , die sich neuen Unterrichtsformen verschrieben hat .
Auch dort , in diesen privaten , meist „ Ausländer freien Zonen “ , wird der Beobachter bald sein blaues Wunder erleben und Berichte von blauäugigen Journalisten , die wieder mal die Vorzüge so genannter „ alternativer Unterrichtsarbeit “ anpreisen , nur noch mit Kopfschütteln wahrnehmen .
Bagatellisieren , verniedlichen , totschweigen
In aller Regel werden solche Vorfälle , die von „ ganz normalen “ Grund - und Hauptschulen berichtet werden , also von Schulen , die einen Ausländeranteil von unter einem Drittel haben , als „ Ausreißer “ oder „ Einzelfälle “ abgetan .
Schon Senator Böger , wir erinnern uns , hat das anfangs noch versucht .
Am liebsten würde man über all dies auch den Mantel des Schweigens breiten .
Weswegen diese Vorfälle auch von den Verantwortlichen , außer es handelt sich um einen der überaus spärlich gesäten mutigen Schulleiter , häufig bagatellisiert , verniedlicht oder einfach vertuscht werden .
Und zwar vor allem aus Angst , dass „ ihre “ Schule , wie es oft heißt , in der Öffentlichkeit „ schlecht dastehen würde “ und ihre Schulabgänger keine Arbeitsplätze finden würden .
Als vor einigen Wochen das bayerische Kultusministerium eine Umfrage über besonders krasse Fälle von Gewalt an den Schulen kursieren ließ , weigerte sich so mancher Schulleiter , diese den Behörden auch zu nennen .
Keine Vorfälle kreuzten deshalb auch einige der befragten Schulen an .
Presse , Funk und Fernsehen sind für Schulbehörden und Schulleitungen ein rotes Tuch .
Weshalb die Vertreter der Öffentlichkeit auch gefürchtet werden wie beim Teufel das Weihwasser .
Schulinterne Maßnahmenkataloge
Weil sie sich kaum noch zu helfen wissen , Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe einfach nötig ist ( als Qualitätskontrolle später ausgegeben ) , sind fast alle Schulen seit einiger Zeit dazu übergegangen , spezifische Hausordnungen und Regelkataloge zu erstellen , die Selbstverpflichtungen enthalten und Auskunft über Maßnahmen enthalten , die bei Verstößen angewendet werden .
Diese werden dann schön gedruckt und gut sichtbar in Pausehallen und Klassenzimmern aufgehängt .
Die Probleme stellen sich dann meist bei der Durchführung der Konsequenzen .
Einerseits sind sich viele Kollegien nicht einig .
Zu unterschiedlich sind die Vorstellungen , was Erziehung vermitteln will oder wie sie gehandhabt werden soll .
Hardlinern , die für konsequentes Handeln plädieren , stehen in aller Regel Kuschelpädagogen gegenüber , die ständig Verständnis für Dieses oder Jenes zeigen und stets Gründe finden , das Elternhaus , den Unterricht , das Umfeld , warum es zu diesen Verfehlungen gekommen ist .
Findige Schüler wissen das für sich auszunutzen und spielen die einen gegen die anderen aus .
Andererseits fehlt es aber auch schlichtweg an Mitteln , um Intensivtäter oder Schüler , die mit dem Schulstoff schlichtweg überfordert sind , der Schule zu verweisen oder sie an Schulen zu überweisen , die besser dafür geeignet sind .
Da kann die Schule beraten , bitten , betteln oder flehen – der Elternwille ist heilig .
Weigern sich Eltern konsequent , den angeratenen Schulwechsel zu vollziehen , ist die Regelschule hilflos .
Sie muss den Schüler weiter unterrichten und mitschleppen , wie qualvoll das auch immer für den Betroffenen oder für alle anderen ist .
Sammelstelle für alle
Der Zwang , ausnahmslos alle Schüler beaufsichtigen und unterrichten zu müssen , und zwar vollkommen gleichgültig , ob das qualitativ etwas bringt oder nicht , ist eines der Hauptprobleme , worunter die Regelschulen leiden .
Um an dieser Stelle Abhilfe zu schaffen und die Not zu lindern , braucht es vielmehr neue institutionelle Einrichtungen und Konzepte , um diese Jugendliche aufzufangen .
Und zwar frühzeitig und gegen den Willen der Eltern und nicht erst , wenn das Kind schon in den Brunnen gefallen ist .
Seitdem die Regelschule zur Sammelstelle aller Gescheiterten , Frustrierten und Faulenzer geworden ist , und realitätsblinde Erzieher dazu übergegangen sind , auch Behinderte und Lernschwache in die Regelschule zu integrieren , ächzt und kracht es an diesem Schultyp an allen Ecken und Enden .
Die Bandbreite der zu beschulenden Schüler ist einfach zu groß , als dass die Schule das noch erfüllen kann .
Zu einer solchen Sammelstelle und bloßen Aufbewahrungsanstalt haben sie aber auch bestimmte Pädagogen gemacht , die sich einen Hauch von Sozialromantik bewahrt haben und ständig das Umfeld statt die Täter zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen .
Ein schwieriges Elternhaus , traumatische Kindheitserlebnisse oder geistige Überforderung können keinesfalls als Freibrief für Gewalt , Aggression oder Vandalismus herhalten .
Für soziale Benachteiligung kann man nicht die anderen verantwortlich machen .
Die Opfer , Lehrer oder Schüler , können nichts dafür , dass jemand in einem schwierigen Umfeld aufgewachsen ist .
Hinzu kommt , dass auch die Gesellschaft eine überaus schlechte Adresse ist .
Sie hat nämlich keine .
An sie kann man sich nicht wenden , weder durch Anruf noch durch Brief .
Kultur des Wollens
Woran es in Deutschland oder überhaupt in Alteuropa mangelt , ist ein kreativer Umgang mit dem so genannten „ Münchhausen - Dilemma “ .
Es fehlt an einer Kultur des „ Sich - selbst - aus dem - Sumpf - ziehen - Wollens “ .
Das Sozialsystem fördert das Abwarten , das Nichtstun , das Warten auf den Messias , wofür der Staat steht , statt das Individuum zur Aktivität zu stimulieren .
In Ländern wie den USA , Kanada oder Australien , wo Einwanderung beispielsweise längst Normalität ist und zum Staatsverständnis dazugehört , weiß das ein Jeder .
Auch der Neuankömmling .
Er weiß , worauf er sich einlässt .
Hier muss es jeder selbst schaffen .
Strengt er sich nicht an oder steht nach Niederlagen oder Pleiten nicht wieder auf , landet er schnell auf der untersten Stufe der sozialen Leiter .
Weswegen es häufig zwei oder drei Generationen dauert , bis sich bescheidener Wohlstand einstellt .
In Alteuropa hingegen gibt es immer noch die Kultur der Rundumversorgung , die gefälligst der Staat zu verrichtet hat .
Er springt in aller Regel ein und subventioniert die Nichtanstrengung .
Die Berliner Ausländerbeauftragte der vorhergehenden Regierung hat das kürzlich in einem Interview mit der FAZ bestätigt .
Die Sozialhilfe ist einer der Hauptgründe für mangelnde Sprachkenntnisse und fehlenden Willen zur Integration .
Sie unterstützt die Bildung von Parallelgesellschaften .
Zwar fällt sie längst nicht mehr so üppig aus wie früher .
Verglichen mit anderen Ländern , ist Deutschland da immer noch ein Land der Seligen .
Immerhin reicht die Sozialhilfe dafür aus , dass Schüler sich die neuesten Handys , einen Fernseher im Kinderzimmer und einen Gigabyte starken MP3 - Player leisten können .
Wie immer sie sich diesen „ Luxus “ auch finanzieren .
Sanktionsmacht stärken
An der verfahrenen Situation werden deshalb auch die vielen „ Ms “ , mehr Lehrstellen , mehr Lehrerstellen und mehr Geld für Schulen , aber auch mehr Sozialarbeit , mehr Deutschkurse für Ausländer , mehr fördern und fordern , mehr Benimmunterricht , wenig helfen oder kaum für Abhilfe schaffen .
Alle diese Forderungen , die allenfalls den Apparat weiter aufblähen und ineffektiver machen , zielen an den tatsächlichen Problemen vorbei .
Und diese resultieren in der Hauptsache aus der wachsenden geistigen und moralischen Verwahrlosung vieler Jugendlichen , aber auch an der Unfähigkeit der Institution „ Schule “ , ihre Interessen und Ziele gegen die Widerstände Dritter durchzusetzen .
Will man nicht , dass die Polizei zum Dauergast in den Regelschulen wird oder Metalldetektoren und Videoüberwachung den Schulalltag prägen , wie dies in den USA längst der Fall ist , wird man über die Einführung und Einhaltung strikter Verbote , die von „ Null Toleranz “ - Strategien begleitet und unterstützt werden , nicht herumkommen .
Mit Vernunft , gutem Zureden oder vertrauensbildenden Maßnahmen ist Jugendlichen , die mit dem Gesetz des Dschungels aufgewachsen sind und allenfalls das Recht des Stärkeren anerkennen , nicht beizukommen .
Man muss nicht mehr alles aushalten .
Man muss einschüchtern , wo oder wen man nicht kurieren kann .
Wer hier zurückweicht oder zögert , hat bereits verloren .
Die Schmuse - und Pampers - Pädagogik ist ebenso fehlgeschlagen wie die Vorstellung einer Erziehung nach dem Willen des Kindes .
Handyverbot
Die Diskussionen , die derzeit geführt werden , sind allerdings wenig ermutigend .
Sie geben wenig Zuversicht , dass diese Trendumkehr gelingen könnte .
Die Debatte über ein mögliches Handyverbot an Schulen , ein dazu vergleichsweise geringfügiges Thema , hat das jüngst in aller Deutlichkeit gezeigt .
Kaum wagt es jemand von einem Verbot zu sprechen , geschweige nur darüber nachzudenken , treten sofort alle Beschwichtiger oder Bedenkenträger auf den Plan .
Das Problem , das sich an der Verbreitung von Snuff - Videos , Enthauptungen und drastischen Sexszenen auf Schülerhandys entzündet hat , werde nicht gelöst , so die Gegner , sondern nur in die Nachmittagsstunden verschoben .
Die Dürftigkeit eines solchen Arguments kommt den Befürwortern gar nicht erst in den Sinn .
Mit der gleichen Begründung könnte man auch das Rauchen an den Schulen wieder erlauben , denn auch hier führt ein Verbot allenfalls dazu , dass die Schüler ihre Bedürfnisse am Nachmittag stillen .
Andere wiederum weisen daraufhin , dass Lehrer keine Polizisten seien , die Schüler in den Taschen herumwühlen dürfen oder sollen .
Auf die simple Frage , was ein Handy am Vormittag in der Schule zu suchen hat , ob sich damit irgendwelche schulische oder unterrichtliche Fragen oder Themen lösen lassen , wissen sie keine Antwort .
Auch nicht darauf , warum ein Handy zur Grundausstattung oder Persönlichkeit eines Jugendlichen gehört .
Lobby für Störenfriede
Selbiges scheint sich zu wiederholen am Gesetzentwurf , den das bayerische Kultusministerium gerade vorgelegt hat .
Danach soll es künftig Regelschulen , erlaubt werden , latente Störer oder Täter nicht mehr nur für ein paar Tage vom Unterricht auszuschließen , sondern sogar bis zu vier Wochen .
In Extremfällen , mithin bei Jugendlichen , die Mitschüler oder Lehrer drangsalieren oder körperlich attackieren , soll sogar die Schulpflicht eines Vierzehnjährigen ganz beendet und die Berufsschulpflicht ausgesetzt werden .
Kaum ist der Entwurf auf dem Markt , melden sich auch schon die Widerständler .
Sozialverbände sprechen von einer „ bildungspolitischen Kapitulation “ , sie melden verfassungsrechtliche Bedenken an und sehen das Recht auf Bildung gefährdet .
Psychologen und Berater warnen davor , diese Täter auf der Straße stehen zu lassen und rufen die Gesellschaft ( wer immer das auch ist ) in die Pflicht .
Vom Grundrecht auf Bildung all der anderen , die unter dem Verhalten Unbotmäßiger leiden , spricht hingegen niemand .
Und auch nicht davon , dass Unruhestifter in der Schule gar nichts lernen , sondern nur ein Feld für ihr Imponiergehabe suchen .
Statt die Opfer vor den Tätern in Schutz zu nehmen , werden die Täter zu Opfern gemacht .
Und zwar auf Kosten der Opfer , die dadurch im Nachhinein ein zweites Mal zum Opfer werden .
Erfahrungen in New York mit gewalttätigen Schülern zeigen , dass hartes Durchgreifen sehr wohl etwas bringen kann , wenn kleinste Vergehen wie das Beschmieren von Wänden oder das Anzetteln einer Schlägerei mit drastischen Suspendierungen geahndet werden oder im Wiederholungsfall längere Ausschlüsse bis zur Streichung der Schulpflicht drohen .
Und damit auch das pädagogische Personal das versteht , muss „ Null Toleranz “ auch für es gelten , wenn Vorfälle nicht zur Anzeige gebracht oder Gewalt einfach ignoriert oder verschwiegen wird , damit „ der gute Ruf der Schule “ nicht leidet .
Bildung statt Erziehung
Zugegeben , das klingt alles nicht besonders ermutigend .
Ein Allheilmittel für eine Schubumkehr gibt es nicht .
Wird die Institution Schule jedoch von der Politik nicht nachhaltig und auf Dauer gestärkt , ihren Bildungs - und Erziehungsauftrag vehement gegen Störer , Täter und ihre Unterstützer durchzusetzen , dann wird es nur noch schlimmer .
Ausgrenzung statt Integration muss auch eine Devise sein .
Entzug der Schulpflicht zugunsten eines geordneten Betriebs an der Schule .
Man muss der Institution Schule den Rücken stärken , damit Erziehung überhaupt wieder möglich wird .
In den letzten Jahren ist man genau umgekehrt verfahren .
Man wollte erziehen und hat dabei den Bildungsauftrag vollkommen aus dem Auge verloren .
Ohne die strikte Einhaltung von Mindestregeln des Anstandes , des Respekts und der Rücksichtnahme können aber weder Erziehung noch Bildung funktionieren .
Wenn es harter und drastischer Maßnahmen dazu bedarf , um diesen Auftrag durchzusetzen , dann muss die Schule auch dazu in Stande versetzt werden .
Wobei das Votum einstimmig und ganz klar für die Lernwilligen gegen die Lernunwilligen ausfallen muss .
Die Täter und Störer müssen wissen , was sie riskieren , wenn sie mit ihrem Tun weiter fortfahren .
Die Schule muss über den Bereich , für den sie Verantwortung hat und Sorge trägt , wieder die Oberhoheit gewinnen .
Von den Eltern , die an der Misere zum Großteil mit schuldig sind , weil sie ihren Kindern weder Normen noch Regeln vermitteln , kann sie keine Hilfe erwarten .
Auch nicht von den Medien , die Erziehungsaufträge durch ihre Programme unterlaufen .
Kümmert sie sich auch noch um das , was draußen geschieht , hat sie schon verloren .
Ende der Permissivität
Findet die permissive Gesellschaft nicht den
Mut zum Aussprechen solcher „ Wahrheiten “ oder den
Mut zu solchen notwendigen Korrekturen , dann schafft sie sich über kurz oder lang selbst ab .
Verbote und klare Regeln sind nicht letzte , sondern notwendige Mittel , um soziale Ordnung aufrechtzuerhalten .
Institutionen sind , das kann man bei Arnold Gehlen nachlesen , Einrichtungen , die menschliche Instinkte reduzieren und den Menschen Stabilität und Verhaltenssicherheit geben .
Über all die Jahre ist das ein bisschen in Vergessenheit geraten .
Den „ Krieg “ , den Adorno einst gegen Gehlen gewonnen hat , gilt es nicht nur wieder zu führen , sondern auch wieder zu gewinnen .
Weshalb man heute besser Gehlen als Adorno studieren sollte , um ein Gespür dafür zu bekommen , was auf dem Spiel steht .
Den Wenigsten scheint das bewusst zu sein .
( Rudolf Maresch )
I 'm not typically a doom and gloom kind of guy - really , I 'm rather optimistic .
But this pending format release / war is simply the most ridiculous thing I 've seen in a long time .
The hype machine is entirely enthusiast - created and since that day I realized Steve Jobs could sell a fart provided he sued a public Mac forum for talking about it before its release , I began to understand the power of public mania .
There are a number of reasons why the new high definition DVD formats have already failed and I 'll gladly go over some of them in this article .
I am not a soothsayer , but I do study the industry - and at times , sit back and take assessment of what 's happening from both a consumer and manufacturer perspective .
Without any further ado , here are the reasons HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc will never turn into the dominant formats for digital media viewing :
Nobody likes false starts
With the debut of HD DVD at an underwhelming 720p / 1080i , coupled with a buggy interface and a transport that makes boiling water seem like a speedy event , the entrance of high definition DVD into the mainstream came out of the starting gate lame and hobbled .
For Toshiba to release a player that did n't support true HD at 1080 p ( even though the software does ) , and with no lossless audio format to accompany the video track , the high definition wave was more of a ripple .
Add to this the delay of HDMI 1.3 , lack of market penetration and supply , and a dearth amount of software titles and you have a very unimpressive product launch .
Format Wars Don't Sell Players
The only reason Sony's Playstation , Microsoft 's Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube can sell so well simultaneously is because of the prevalence of excellent software titles .
People want to buy the hardware just so they can play the software .
This is not a format war - it is choice , just like Chevy and Ford ( and just like the gaming systems , some people have one of each ) .
The high definition DVD formats , however are really just the same source material packaged in two different wrappers - not to provide choice , mind you , but because the two camps simply are too greedy to combine forces , and not innovative enough to drive two truly separate products successfully .
Take careful note - a format war is NOT competition , it is a hindrance and the bane of high definition DVDs .
HD DVD and Blu-ray are NOT Quantum Leaps in Technology Consumers came over in droves when CDs were released back in 1982 .
The new format offered not only a new digital media , but also a way to instantly access tracks across an entire " album " .
Convenience , not technology , drove this format to almost instant consumer adoption .
Fast forward a bit to 1997 when the first DVD player was released .
Again , convenience , not technology , drove people to the market en masse .
Unlike VHS tapes , the new DVD format was smaller , easily navigated and would not wear down over time like existing tape - based formats .
Heck , the concept of a shiny plastic disc was new - and quite frankly , it was the coolest thing to hit the technological shelf since solid state technology .
In comparison , the high definition DVD formats , save the color of the business side of the disc , look exactly the same … and consumer confusion will surely follow .
What do the new high definition DVD formats offer consumers over DVD ?
Technology and more storage .
Is this enough ?
Not on your life .
Consumers , most of whom rarely know how to properly configure their players or home theater systems , are perfectly content with their current DVD players ( and indeed some have just jumped on board to DVD in the last several years ) .
While the potential for more extras and alternate endings exists due to increased storage on the new media , there is no compelling reason for consumers to migrate over to the new high definition DVD formats in large numbers .
Studios are Conservative , Greedy and Unmotivated Studios are so conservative in their practices as to consistently miss out on market advances - even those that can make them money ( ie .
Why is a computer company running the world 's most successful online music store ? )
The studios are not jumping on board the high definition DVD bandwagon just yet - and you can see the lack of titles to prove it .
If the movie studios decided that HD DVD or Blu-ray ( or both ) was to be the next dominant format , it need only to flood the market with software titles and present a plan to roll back on DVD production over the next 10 years .
Even though this would grant them the secure format that they seem to want ( HD DVDs and Blu- ray discs promise to be much harder to rip or duplicate ) there is no indication in the industry that this is taking place or even in the works .
The studios are making money hand over fist with DVD they cannot seem to bring themselves to seriously initiate a new , unproven technology - even if it saves them from some other copyright headaches .
Add to this the fact that new titles are coming out at $ 30 a pop ( and this down from an initial $ 35 / title ) and you have a really hard sell for consumers who are used to $ 15 titles at Wal - mart and the large electronics chains .
Playstation3 Cannot Save the World
We have consistently heard it said that the Playstation3 will " jump start " the market by flooding it with millions of gaming systems capable of handling Blu-ray Disc software .
The problem with this theory is that the PS3 is not being marketed as a home theater component and , if current installations prove the rule , most will not be situated in the average consumer 's living room .
The result is that the PS3 will primarily be a * gasp * gaming system .
Maybe I have a more traditional group of parents in my association of friends , but , taking into account # 4 above , I do not think that Blu-ray will make any major leaps forward in market penetration as a home video format - at least not anytime soon .
History is bearing this out , as the HTPC market , though driven hard by such manufacturers as Microsoft , Dell and HP , has struggled to find a place in the living room .
Nearly every gaming system of the past : PS2 , Xbox , and even the legendary 3DO system have been touted as " set - top boxes " but in reality find themselves situated in more " gaming - centric " environments playing … you guessed it , games .
Those Who Ignore History …
For years we 've heard about the evils of MP3 and illegal downloading .
All the while the RIAA and music industry had two formats that could have prevented any illegal copying - at least for all but the most dedicated crackers : DVD - Audio and SACD .
These formats proved to be higher quality than CD , presented much enhanced copy protection schemes and were easily used as alternative formats to CD .
Yet both formats failed miserably to achieve any significant market penetration .
Why ?
Without an artificial " shove " from the record industry - which never materialized - technology alone is never enough to push a new format into the hands of consumers .
In terms of convenience and ease of use , DVD - Audio and SACD offered nothing to consumers .
In fact , they made listening to music more complex , since most hardware was unable to correctly decode and provide adequate bass management for the new formats .
Could these formats have succeeded ?
Absolutely .
If the recording industry had presented a plan to phase out CDs and the " format war " had been avoided ( simply by the industry picking one format over the other ) we would all be using DVD - Audio players and illegal downloadable music would be mostly confined to analogue rips or older music .
Is this a stretch ?
Perhaps , but only because history shows us that corporate greed causes most companies to miss the long term economical gains over a short term loss of licensing revenues .
People Want Technology that 's 15 Minutes Ahead of Its Time For many people , getting into HDTV is all about the widescreen and being able to see their DVDs with more clarity than ever before .
When Billy Bob comes home with his new high definition 720 p display , the difference between that and his older SD TV is amazing - at least when he 's watching DVDs .
You see , that 's the problem - and it's two - fold .
While most consumers are still getting into the HDTV craze , they 're already impressed .
And the difference between SD TV and HDTV is more amazing than the difference between 480 p DVDs and 1080i downrezzed high definition discs .
The other side of the coin is the lack of HD content available on TV - and this is a biggie .
While Billy Bob is impressed by his DVD player , he is dumbfounded by his cable TV - which actually looks worse than it did on his old set ( mostly because it 's bigger ) .
You see , nobody told Billy Bob that he'd have to get an antenna or subscribe to HD service from his cable / satellite provider .
He was also not told that most of his favorite shows ( Billy likes sitcoms and the Sci - Fi Channel ) are n't yet available in HD , regardless of technology or service provider .
As a result , many Americans are underwhelmed or feel like they got burned by HDTV .
The last thing they 're going to do is rush out and buy the next greatest thing .
Enthusiasts Are Getting Tired ( and Smarter )
While some home theater audio- and videophiles have the money and inclination to rush out and buy the latest and greatest toys as soon as they are available , many more are becoming more cautious .
Burned by 8 - track , laserdisc , SACD , and DVD - Audio ( and possibly soon non-HDCP HDTV ) - these war - weary consumers are going to think long and hard before jumping onto any new technological bandwagons .
This leaves a shrunken market of even the bleeding - edge consumers , and that means even less sales to early - adopters .
A Skeptical News Media Does n't Help I 'll admit it , we 're part of the " problem " ( though I 'd like to think we 're saving consumers from making the next big mistake ) .
An increasingly skeptical news media is n't buying into the hype of HD DVD and Blu-ray , especially not after wasting millions of editorial words on DVD - Audio and SACD , only to watch the software and technology dwindle into obscurity .
Even after almost 6 years , most consumers continue to proffer puzzled looks when these audio formats are mentioned .
The new DVD formats are getting plenty of press , mind you , but with the Toshiba flop and lack of software , the fact that the Emperor has no clothes ( at least not yet ) is hard to avoid .
and what if you forgot a paper in the car and wanna get it ?
lower the car again , then lift up once more .. when this parking is charged ( paid ) , this may double your payment ..
Also , the question came to my mind : is it really safe in case a fire breaks out in one of the parked cars ?
wow ..
I imagine the pillar will act as a bomb or , probably , a space shuttle ;)

Here 's a fun effect to create : grunge type .
It 's often used on movie posters ( think slasher flicks ) .
To create the effect , you need a very " busy " photo , something with lots of hard lines .
By using the Threshold adjustment , we 'll morph an ordinary photo into a properly distressed , grungy texture which we 'll place on top of some type or whatever else you might want .
We wo n't just plop the texture * onto * the type , mind you , I 'll show you how to copy it into a layer mask so you can do some fine - tuning and moving around , if you so desire .
Read on !
Type something
Step 1 : Pop open a new document .
In the Toolbox , set the top color chip to orange .
Step 2 : Press T to select the Type tool and set some type in a large , thick font ( try a nice slab , sans - serif like Impact ) .
For reasons which will become clear to you in a moment , I typed " FEAR and LOATHING in EAST TEXAS . "
Create a grungy texture
Step 3 : Open the Soon To Be A Grungy Texture photo .
I took this shot of logs at an East Texas sawmill recently .
( Spending a week in the slightly backwards , rather isolated piney woods of East Texas provided inspiration for the title above . )
Step 4 : Choose Image > Adjustments >
Threshold .
Drag the slider almost all the way to the left and click OK .
The black bits remaining onscreen will become the grungy texture .
NOTE : Experiment with the Threshold slider , though bear in mind that creating too much grunge will render text unreadable .
Step 5 : To create a selection around the new black texture bits , we 'll use the Magic Wand tool ( it 's made for selecting color ) .
Press W to select the Magic Wand and click inside one of the black areas of the photo .
You should now see tiny marching ants around that area of black .
To select the rest of the black texture bits , control - click ( PC : right - click ) inside the selection area and choose Similar from the contextual menu .
Step 6 : Now you should have marching selection ants surrounding all the black areas of the wood .
Copy them to the clipboard by pressing Command + C ( PC : Ctrl + C ) .
Bring the texture and type together
Step 7 : Back in the type document , create a layer mask by pressing the circle within a square icon at the bottom of the Layers Palette .
Step 8 : Option click the mask icon ( PC : Alt click ) and your type should disappear from view .
Do n't panic , this is because you 're viewing the mask that you have n't put anything into yet .
Paste in your new texture by pressing Command + V ( PC : Ctrl + V ) .
Press Command + D ( PC : Ctrl + D ) to deselect and make the marching ants go away .
Step 9 : Select the type thumbnail in the layers palette and your type will reappear with the new texture on top of it , like so :
Step 10 : If you want to move the texture around a bit , just click the little chain link icon between the layer thumbnail and the layer mask in the Layers Palette to unlock them .
This will let you move the mask independently of the type .
Step 11 : Click the layer mask thumbnail to select your texture , then use the Move tool to reposition it .
After I finished moving the texture around , I clicked once again between the layer thumbnails to bring back the little chainlink so the mask and type would stay together ( just in case I accidentally moved something ) .
For dramatic effect , I created a new layer below the type by Command clicking ( PC : Ctrl clicking ) the new layer icon ( circled below in red ) and filled it with black .
Here 's the final image , after I added a with a feathery edge :
That 's all there is to it !
By using a layer mask for this effect , we 've built in the ability to tweak the texture however you 'd like .
If too much of your type is covered up , just click the layer mask thumbnail , grab a paint brush and paint with white those areas the texture away .
Likewise , if you want more grunge just paint with black to add more texture ( be sure to experiment with different brushes too ) .
I hope this tutorial provides inspiration for creating some grungy type of your own .
Once you get the hang of this effect , you 'll look at photos in a whole new way , the " Oh that 'd make a * great * texture ! " way !
See you next time :)

The magic of invention
Lessons on creativity from the world of aviation , Teflon , and Velcro By Nathan P. Myhrvold * 83 Nathan P. Myhrvold * 83 , former chief technology officer at Microsoft and founder of Intellectual Ventures , a company that nurtures invention , received the 2005 James Madison Medal on Alumni Day , Feb. 26 .
This essay is adapted from the lecture he gave that day in Richardson Auditorium .
Invention is the origin of all technology : Everything new started as a spark in someone ’s head .
Without that breakthrough idea — without knowing how something can be done — you are at a fundamental disadvantage .
After you know something , it often seems obvious ; you say , “ God , why did n’t I think of that ? ”
After you have the invention , you can apply lots of cleverness to making something work , but up front you need to have that invention .
But , ironically , the world does not focus much effort on invention .
In fact , invention is a sideline or a hobby for virtually everyone who practices it .
Academic research is wonderful , but academics are n’t supposed to invent — they ’re supposed to learn new things about the world ; they ’re supposed to expand mankind ’s knowledge .
You can be a fantastic researcher without ever inventing something .
There are great academics who invent , but they do it on the side .
The same thing , ironically , is true of engineers .
Most engineers are paid to build something .
If you said , “ Hey , you can build your product without actually doing a new invention , ” most engineering managers would say , “ Great !
There is going to be no risk .
I hate when we have to solve a problem no one has solved before ! ”
So while engineers can be great inventors , very few people are motivated to do it full time .
The world does n’t support invention very well .
There is a systematic set of constraints :
What is the next product version ?
What suits my research ?
What can I get my graduate student to do ?
Most of all :
What can I get funded for ?
The great debate in design is whether form follows function .
But in much of life , form follows funding .
If you ca n’t get funded to invent , if people wo n’t take a chance , how are you going to get there ?
As a result , a huge amount of invention is done sub rosa — some of it by academics who really have a grant to do something else .
Very few companies support really radical things — because if it is really radical , almost by definition it is not somebody ’s business to do up front .
The world is focused very much on what you do after you have the idea .
If you go to a venture capitalist on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park , Calif. , and say , “ You know , I am sure I am going to have a good idea ! ” the meeting ends right there .
I like to think that if you really focus on invention we could have a whole lot more , and a whole lot better .
But what are the inspirations for invention ?
Where does invention come from ?
One of the most powerful ideas is to take inspiration from the natural world — to see something that nature has invented and use that as an inspiration directly for human invention .
It is a great idea — but it rarely happens .
There is one terrific example : Velcro .
In 1948 , Swiss biologist George de Mestral got some cockleburs stuck in his sock .
Many of us have had that happen .
But George was a little more curious than most of us about how these cockleburs stuck to his socks .
He looked at one under a microscope , and saw lots and lots of little hooks .
The hooks engage the fibers ; originally , they evolved to engage fibers in an animal ’s hide to catch a ride .
So de Mestral said , “ I can make hooks ! ” and came up with the idea of Velcro .
The other classic example is flying .
Mankind always has been fascinated with the graceful way birds soar .
Early in the history of aviation , birds provided direct , natural inspiration .
The primary proponent was the German inventor Otto Lilienthal , who built wonderful , birdlike gliders in Germany .
But it turns out that acting like a bird is n’t a good way to make a glider , and Otto flew and flew until he crashed .
In 1894 , a bicycle mechanic , Wilbur Wright , read about this , and he and his brother set out deliberately to invent the airplane .
They took a very different approach .
They were n’t interested in birds at all — they built the first practical wind tunnel .
It was by taking an approach that was utterly unlike a bird that they had some success .
The interesting thing is how deliberate the Wrights were .
In 1899 , they wrote to the Smithsonian Institution — that was back when the Smithsonian took requests — and said , “ We would like all of the literature you have on human or artificial flight . ”
Someone at the Smithsonian boxed up all these papers and sent them off .
And so Orville and Wilbur Wright said , “ OK , let ’s roll up our sleeves and learn how to fly . ”
It was n’t based on birds , but on a systematic approach of saying , “ Damn it ; there has got to be a way to achieve this ! ”
It took them four years .
I think that it is really remarkable when you consider that after four years of seriously working at it — on something that people had speculated about since Leonardo da Vinci ’s time — these guys invented the airplane .
Most great inventions actually come out of something like the Wrights ’ approach .
Someone gets a crazy idea and , of course , up front it is ludicrous .
The more important the idea , the more ludicrous it has to be when you set out .
I used to say at Microsoft Research that we wanted to hire researchers who were “ narrowly insane ” : insane , because they believed they could solve a problem no one else in the world could solve ; narrowly , because you wanted them to be pretty sensible in other ways .
This kind of dedicated approach to invention is something I think the world needs to support a lot more .
There is another big theory of invention : the “ happy accident ” theory , in which someone can come up with an interesting observation through a bit of serendipity .
Roy Plunkett , who invented Teflon , had been doing an experiment that involved putting some fluorine gas and other things into a tank .
He opened the stop cap to the tank , and nothing came out .
The tank was heavy , he shook it , and eventually he took a hacksaw and sawed it apart , and discovered that there was this waxy white substance in it .
It is a classic example of serendipity .
It is also a classic example of how not to manage invention .
Immediately after this , Plunkett was transferred and was never allowed to work on Teflon again at DuPont .
Happy accidents like Teflon do occur .
But very few great inventions are accidental — and even in those that are , the great thing is n’t the accident itself .
A whole lot of people could have made Roy Plunkett ’s discovery and just thrown the whole thing out .
The really great inventions that come from serendipity are the accidents waiting to happen .
There is a saying : Luck favors the prepared mind .
First you have to notice this thing , and then you have to be prepared to develop it .
And you have to have the right support .
From a technological perspective , this is the ideal time to be an inventor .
We have greater connectivity than we have ever had before , greater access to information and knowledge .
The world is a much smaller place now that the Internet can allow us to connect with each other .
That ’s a terrific stimulus .
And the pace of invention has never been faster .
All of these things lead me to believe that the 21st century is going to be an era of incredible and dynamic invention .
It ’s also a time , frankly , when we have to do it .
At the turn of the last century , about half of our workforce was on the farm .
By the 1960s it had dwindled to about 6 percent , and today , it ’s less than 3 percent .
American farms are the most efficient in the world , but agriculture as a major part of the workforce has come and gone .
So has manufacturing :
It was just getting going in 1900 and peaked at about a third of the economy in the 1950s ; today it is about 10 percent .
Most companies in America now do a lot of the design , but a huge amount of what they do is built overseas .
If we do n’t learn to invent , if we do n’t foster invention and innovation , it is not clear what we are going to do for a living .
Invention is the source of it all , yet it is strangely neglected .
Enough of it happens , and happens randomly , that it keeps us busy .
But if you focus on fostering it , it can really be done deliberately .
There are people who disagree with this .
Maybe you ca n’t always set out and succeed like the Wright brothers did .
After all , there probably were a lot of guys in 1899 who set out to invent something — but we only celebrate the people who got there .
But you sure can kill invention .
Creativity absolutely can be strangled .
It can be squelched ; it can be underfunded .
I think it is incumbent upon us to continue to push , in education and in business , to support it .
The economies of the 21st century are going to be driven by the magic of invention .

There was an interesting article in the NY Times this week on possible geo-engineering solutions to the global warming problem .
The story revolves around a paper that Paul Crutzen ( Nobel Prize winner for chemistry related to the CFC / ozone depletion link ) has written about deliberately adding sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere to increase the albedo and cool the planet – analogous to the natural effects of volcanoes .
The paper is being published in Climatic Change , but unusually , with a suite of commentary articles by other scientists .
This is because geo-engineering solutions do not have a good pedigree and , regardless of their merit or true potential , are often seized upon by people who for various reasons do not want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
However , these ideas keep popping up naturally since significant emission cuts continue to be seen as difficult to achieve , and so should be considered fairly .
After all , if there was a cheaper way to deal with the CO 2 problem , or even a way to buy time , should n’t we take it ?
First a little history [ Update : See Spencer Weart ’s essay on the history of climate modification ideas ] .
Geo-engineering ideas first reached the public in the 60s when there was still a lot of enthusiasm for technical fixes of the world ’s problems .
One example was suggested by the Soviets who wanted to melt the Arctic ( either using soot or nuclear devices ) in order to warm up their frozen North .
More recently , there was a proposal to dam the Straits of Gibraltar in order to prevent more saline Mediterranean Sea water ( because of the Aswan Dam ) from affecting the North Atlantic conveyor circulation ( no , it did n’t make sense to us either ) .
With such a pedigree , geo- engineering is generally seen as fringe entertainment at best , although some of the new ideas concerning atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration are being looked into seriously .
Edward Teller is the scientist most associated publicly with the idea of creating a stratospheric shield to prevent excessive global warming , though he built on an idea from Freeman Dyson ( who has subsequently become a bit of global warming contrarian ) * .
However , as Teller ’s collaborator Stanislaw Ulam once said after discussing some new ideas with him : “ Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities ; this is perhaps an indication they will not work ” .
And given Teller ’s estrangement from the scientific community in his later years , it was not likely that the concept would be taken very seriously , and indeed it has n’t been .
* Which in turn built on a idea from Budyko … ( see comment below ) .
But now Paul Crutzen has stepped into the fray .
He has a much more solid reputation amongst climate scientists than Teller , and thus his ideas will be taken more seriously .
I have n’t seen the new paper yet ( it ’s out in August ) but there are a number of questions that need to be addressed before any geo-engineering proposal combatting global warming should be thought of as anything more than an interesting idea .
First , the idea has to actually work , second , the side effects need to be minimal , and third , it has to be able to keep up with an increasing forcing from ever higher greenhouse gas levels , and fourth , it has to be cheaper than the simply reducing emissions at source .
These are formidable hurdles .
Would it work ?
In most of the cases under discussion the target is the global mean temperature , and so something that balances the global radiative forcing of greenhouse gas increases is likely to ‘ work ’ .
However , having no global mean forcing is not the same as having no climate change .
A world with higher GHGs and more stratospheric aerosols is not the same as a world with neither .
Thus there will be side effects .
For the stratospheric sulphate idea , these fall into two classes – changes to the physical climate as a function of the changes in heating profiles in solar and longwave radiation , and chemical and ecological effects from the addition of so much sulphur to the system .
Physically , one could expect a slight decrease in surface evaporation ( a ‘ dimming ’ effect ) and related changes to precipitation , a warming of the tropopause and lower stratosphere ( and changes in static stability ) , increased Eurasian ‘ winter warming ’ effects ( related to shifts in the wind patterns as are seen in the aftermath of volcanoes ) .
Chemically , there will be an increase in ozone depletion ( due to increases in heterogeneous surface chemistry in the stratosphere ) , increases in acid rain , possibly an increase in high cirrus cloud cover due to indirect effects of the sulphates on cloud lifetime .
Light characteristics ( the ratio of diffuse to direct sunlight ) will change , and the biosphere may react to that .
Dealing with the legal liability for these predictable consequences would promise to be a lively area of class action litigation … .
On the positive side , sunsets will probably be more colorful .
Could it keep up ?
GHGs ( particularly CO 2 ) are accumulating in the atmosphere and so even with constant present - day emissions , the problem will continue to get worse .
Any sulphates put in the stratosphere will only last a couple of years or so and need to be constantly updated to maintain concentrations .
Therefore the need for the stratospheric sulphates will continue to increase much faster than any growth of CO 2 emissions .
This ever - increasing demand , coupled with the impossibility of stopping once this path is embarked upon is possibly the biggest concern .
How expensive would it be ?
I will leave the detailed costing to others , but stemming from the last point , the cost will continue to rise indefinitely into the future unless this proposal is coupled with an concomitant effort to reduce CO 2 emissions ( and concentrations ) such that the need for the sulphates will diminish in time .
Crutzen ’s paper may well address these issues comprehensively ( and I look forward to seeing it ) but , in my opinion , the proposals are unlikely to gain much traction .
Maybe an analogy is useful to see why .
Think of the climate as a small boat on a rather choppy ocean .
Under normal circumstances the boat will rock to and fro , and there is a finite risk that the boat could be overturned by a rogue wave .
But now one of the passengers has decided to stand up and is deliberately rocking the boat ever more violently .
Someone suggests that this is likely to increase the chances of the boat capsizing .
Another passenger then proposes that with his knowledge of chaotic dynamics he can counterbalance the first passenger and indeed , counter the natural rocking caused by the waves .
But to do so he needs a huge array of sensors and enormous computational resources to be ready to react efficiently but still would n’t be able to guarantee absolute stability , and indeed , since the system is untested it might make things worse .
So is the answer to a known and increasing human influence on climate an ever more elaborate system to control the climate ?
Or should the person rocking the boat just sit down ?
Cruise liner outruns armed pirate boats By CNNRadio's Matt Cherry and Amanda Moyer
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Somalia Tour operators or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
A luxury cruise line will re-evaluate whether to offer future cruises off the coast of Somalia after pirates attempted to attack one of its ships early Saturday .
The pirates were in two small boats and were carrying machine guns and a rocket - propelled grenade when they attempted the attack on Seabourn Cruise Lines ' " Spirit " about 5:35 a.m. local time Saturday , Deborah Natansohn , president of the cruise line , told CNNRadio .
The ship was carrying 150 passengers and a crew of about 160 .
The ship , she said , immediately instituted its emergency response system .
" The occupants of those boats did not succeed in boarding the ship and eventually turned away ... our captain and crew did a terrific job taking responsive action . "
Passenger Mike Rogers of Vancouver , Canada , said the pirates were shooting and sending rockets at the boat .
( Watch how cruise ship outran pirates -- 1:28 ) " The captain tried to run one of the boats over , but they were small boats , about 25 feet long , " he told CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver .
" Each one had four or five people on it , and ( the captain ) said he was going to do anything to keep them from getting on board . "
The captain , however , did not hit the alarm button to alert passengers of the emergency , Rogers said .
" He announced it over the speakers because he was scared people would run up on deck , and he did n't want people on deck because they would have been shot . "
The cruise ship eventually outran the pirates ' boats , Natansohn said .
One person suffered minor injuries , she said without elaborating .
" There 's some minor damage done to the ship , " Rogers said .
" There 's no water right now , for instance , in some places , and I believe one of the grenades actually went off in one of the cabins , but everyone on board is fine . "
The ship is now en route to the Seychelles Islands , Natansohn said .
On Thursday , the United Nations ' World Food Program warned that hijackings off the coast of Somalia were restricting the delivery of needed food assistance to the country .
" The southern Somali coastline is one of the most dangerous in the world , " the WFP said on its Web site .
" In recent months , WFP 's operations in Somalia have been sabotaged by the hijackings of two vessels carrying relief food .
Ship owners are now demanding armed escorts to travel in these waters . "
Natansohn said efforts were under way Saturday to locate the pirates .
" We have notified U.S. , Canadian and Australian authorities because most of our passengers come from those three countries , as well as local authorities in Africa . "
" Seabourn ' Spirit ' has offered itineraries in that part of the world before , but we 'll obviously be looking at the incident to determine what to do in the future , " she said .
Rogers said , " We 're always looking for adventure , but this is probably a little more than we would normally look for . "

In effect , what Poincaré suggested was that anything without holes has to be a sphere .
The one qualification was that this “ anything ” had to be what mathematicians call compact , or closed , meaning that it has a finite extent : no matter how far you strike out in one direction or another , you can get only so far away before you start coming back , the way you can never get more than 12,500 miles from home on the Earth .
In the case of two dimensions , like the surface of a sphere or a doughnut , it is easy to see what Poincaré was talking about : imagine a rubber band stretched around an apple or a doughnut ; on the apple , the rubber band can be shrunk without limit , but on the doughnut it is stopped by the hole .
With three dimensions , it is harder to discern the overall shape of something ; we can not see where the holes might be .
“ We ca n’t draw pictures of 3 - D spaces , ” Dr. Morgan said , explaining that when we envision the surface of a sphere or an apple , we are really seeing a two - dimensional object embedded in three dimensions .
Indeed , astronomers are still arguing about the overall shape of the universe , wondering if its topology resembles a sphere , a bagel or something even more complicated .
Poincaré ’s conjecture was subsequently generalized to any number of dimensions , but in fact the three - dimensional version has turned out to be the most difficult of all cases to prove .
In 1960 Stephen Smale , now at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago , proved that it is true in five or more dimensions and was awarded a Fields Medal .
In 1983 , Michael Freedman , now at Microsoft , proved that it is true in four dimensions and also won a Fields .
“ You get a Fields Medal for just getting close to this conjecture , ” Dr. Morgan said .
In the late 1970 ’s , Dr. Thurston extended Poincaré ’s conjecture , showing that it was only a special case of a more powerful and general conjecture about three - dimensional geometry , namely that any space can be decomposed into a few basic shapes .
Mathematicians had known since the time of Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann , in the 19th century , that in two dimensions there are only three possible shapes : flat like a sheet of paper , closed like a sphere , or curved uniformly in two opposite directions like a saddle or the flare of a trumpet .
Dr. Thurston suggested that eight different shapes could be used to make up any three - dimensional space .

Why is it such a bad thing for governments to rely more on the " inflation tax " ?
As long as it is applied within the context of an inflation - targeting Fed , all the negatives of inflation can be contained .
That is , as long as the Fed sets a target inflation rate ( say , 15 % ) and then uses open market techniques to bring inflation into line by taking into consideration the new money , there 'll be no unexpected inflation , and therefore no inflation cost .
There are many advantages to the inflation tax , including : 1 ) Painless , free " collection . "
2 ) Progressivity ( those with the most accumulated assets pay the most . )
One of my ec 10 students wonders whether it is possible to defend inflation :
It is a provocative proposal .
I do n't know any economist who would endorse it , however .
To explain why , let me make four points : 1 . The inflation tax is not painless .
There are various inefficiencies that inflation causes , even if it is steady and predictable .
Those include the " shoeleather " costs of reduced real money balances , increased menu costs , spurious relative - price variability , and distortions in taxes due to the failure to have fully indexed tax laws .
These are discussed in more detail in the textbook .
2 .
The inflation tax is probably less progressive than one might at first think .
It is not a tax on all assets but only on non-interest - bearing assets , such as cash .
The rich are able to keep their most of their wealth in forms that can avoid the inflation tax .
( One exception is the rich in the underground economy ; the inflation tax may hit criminals particularly hard . ) 3 .
The inflation tax would raise only a modest amount of revenue .
Here is a rough calculation .
The monetary base is now about $ 800 billion .
So an inflation rate of 15 percent would raise a maximum of $ 120 billion per year , or about 1 percent of GDP .
That is an upper bound on the amount of tax revenue because , as inflation rose , the quantity of money demanded would fall , reducing the size of the tax base .
( This is a standard " Laffer curve " argument , applied to the inflation tax . ) 4 .
For reasons that are not fully understood , high inflation tends to be volatile inflation .
A stable and predictable 15 percent inflation seems possible as a matter of economic theory , but it is rarely if ever observed .
If we take this empirical regularity as a constraint , then choosing high inflation entails choosing volatile inflation , which increases uncertainty .
These are the reasons that most economists would be averse to a proposal of steady 15 percent inflation .
But has some economist done a detailed and convincing cost - benefit calculation , weighing all the pluses and minuses , to figure out the optimal inflation rate ?
Not to my knowledge .

What if everything in life were free ?
You 'd think we'd be happier .
But game designers know better :
We 'd be bored .
Economics is loosely defined as choice under scarcity .
After all , in the real world , there 's only so much to go around .
You can't always get what you want , and unfulfilled desires give rise to markets .
But in a game world , there 's no inherent reason for scarcity .
Game designers have given us plenty of utopias where we can have all the mithril we want , to buy whatever we want whenever we want it .
Problem is , those worlds turn out to be dull .
For example , the developers of Active Worlds made everything in the game free .
Players built enormous houses - in which there was nothing to do .
The game never quite caught on .
That 's why today 's newer massive synthetic worlds make life hard .
It 's why we have to scheme , fight , and occasionally beg for food , shelter , transportation , and great big flaming swords .
Games show us that scarcity can be fun .
The lessons of Game Economics 101 pop up in unexpected places .
To spice up life in Habitat , developers added money and pawn machines .
For a while , you could buy crystal balls at one machine and sell them for nearly twice as much at another .
Of course , someone coded his computer to run a character between sellers , quintupling the money supply overnight .
Can you say inflation ?
In the early days of Ultima Online , storage space was unlimited .
Eventually , a guy decided to hoard 10,000 shirts , utterly borking the market for cloth .
In Shadowbane , players became convinced that higher - ups moved the entire population to a new server sans money because the economy got so out of hand .
When gold farmers began to leach the precious metal out of EverQuest to sell elsewhere , Sony ordered eBay to close all currency auctions related to the game .
Within days , online auctions sprang up in even greater numbers elsewhere .
What we 're learning is that scarcity itself is an essential variable .
We just have n't needed to worry about it before .
Thanks to God , the Man , or whoever 's running this show , we 're used to taking scarcity for granted .
The emergence of virtual communities means that we have to make it explicit .
In the end , the best game economies are not radically different , just a little weird .
Yet one built - in , unavoidable limit remains : time .
Designers can control the abundance of all other resources , but the number of hours in the day is a constant .
Games make money by occupying time - grabbing eyeballs and holding on to them .
The point of economic policy in a game is n't to simulate reality ; it 's to make the synthetic scarcity so entertaining that the truly scarce good - players ' time - goes toward solving problems in the game , not in the outer world .

Diamonds have been usurped as the world 's hardest material , thanks to researchers in Germany , who have made a new material by compressing carbon - 60 molecules .
They have dubbed their new form of carbon " aggregated diamond nanorods " .
The University of Bayreuth team , led by Natalia Dubrovinskaia , have patented their breakthrough , which they expect will have many applications in industry .
A material 's hardness is measured in terms of its ' isothermal bulk modulus ' - that is to say , how a solid 's volume changes as pressure is applied , at a constant temperature .
Diamond has a modulus of 442 gigapascals , but the new material has a modulus of 491 gigapascals .
The new material is created by subjecting carbon - 60 to 200 times atmospheric pressure , while heating to 2500 Kelvin , the researchers say .
This creates the aggregated diamond nanorods - so called because the material is made of interlocking diamond rods , each around one micron long , and having a diameter of between five and 20nm .
The scientists , who are now looking for partners to commercialise their discovery , say more work is needed to determine exactly why this new material is so tough .
The research was published in Applied Physics Letters . ®
The computer game firm Nintendo today announced an eightfold rise in quarterly profits and raised its full - year earnings forecast , in a clear sign that its decision to court the new generation of " grey gamers " was paying off .
The Kyoto - based firm said impressive sales of its DS range of handheld game consoles and the popularity of new games aimed at older people with little or no experience of gaming had brought it operating profits of ¥ 28.8 bn ( £ 133 m ) in the three months to the end of June , up from ¥ 3.75 bn in the same quarter last year .
Sales rose 85 % to ¥ 130.9bn for the quarter and net income was up 10.2 % at ¥ 15.6bn .
Nintendo increased its operating profit forecast for the fiscal year through to March 2007 by 14 % to ¥ 125bn , and estimated that sales over the same period would reach ¥ 640bn .
The firm is hoping to repeat its success in handheld games with the launch in the final quarter of this year of its
Wii home - based console .
The machine will be competing against Sony 's highly anticipated PlayStation 3 , which is due for release in November , and Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , which has struggled to gain a foothold in Japan since it went on sale last year .
The Wii ( pronounced " we " ) is expected to cost no more than $ 250 ( £ 135 ) in the US , about half the expected price of the PS3 .
Nintendo has set a sales target of 6 m Wii consoles by March next year .
Financial analysts believe Nintendo's competitive pricing and its focus on middle - aged people who are put off by complex games could give it the edge in the $ 30 bn global video game market .
" I see a good chance that Nintendo will do even better than the revised target , " said Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management .
" It has been successful in turning non -game playing segments of the population into customers .
That 's where Sony is falling behind Nintendo .
As a pioneer of this strategy , Nintendo could go further . "
Nintendo managed to attract new gamers in their 40s and 50s with its Brain Training for Adults , a collection of puzzles and quizzes designed to give older gamers a daily mental workout , and Nintendogs , a virtual pet game .
It has just released an electronic version of sudoku , the numbers puzzle that has proved a huge hit with British newspaper readers .
The maker of Donkey Kong and Pokemon has also managed to retain the loyalty of younger gamers .
It has sold 3.82 m of its " New Super Mario Bros " game , the latest in its popular Mario Brothers series , and in June the game came top of the US video game charts for the second month in a row .
Nintendo said it had sold 4.54 m DS consoles in the quarter , up from 1.38 m in the same period a year ago .
The figure includes sales of the DS Lite , a smaller version of the handheld device with a brighter screen .
About 600,000 DS
Lites were sold in the US last month , almost double the number of any other console .
The firm aims to sell 17 m DS machines and 75 m software units through to March next year .
Sales could soon receive an extra boost as the DS console features as a hi-tech spying gadget in the British action film Stormbreaker , starring Alex Pettyfer and Ewan McGregor .
Nintendo shares closed up 1.4 % at ¥ 20,840 on the Tokyo stock exchange today .
The firm announced its earnings after the Japanese stock markets had closed .
What ’s a mobile casino ?
It ’s not a tiny gadget you put in your pocket or purse .
Instead , it ’s a smartphone which can deliver the cutting - edge technology features of your favourite casino app .
But is it that simple ?
Is any casino out there capable of giving players an outstanding experience on the go ?
Of course not !
Despite having hundreds of online casinos in the UK , many of which have their own mobile apps , you do n’t want to just register at any of these and deposit your money hoping to get lucky .
Before signing your name on the line , there are quite a few things to consider , such as bonuses and playthrough conditions , safety and payment options , mobile games – both in terms of quantity and quality , and so on .
If you are n’t prepared , and , unfortunately , many of the players are n’t , you risk falling into a number of traps , the least of which being settling for less , while the worst of it being unable to withdraw your deposit , bonus and winning and realising you have been playing at an unregulated casino .
That ’s why , you ’d better trust the experts and see what they have to say about mobile online casinos here before picking one .
In the meantime , we ’ll let you know what our top 3 picks are .
You ca n’t go wrong playing at these three :
3. Mr Green Casino
We ’re certain you ’ve heard of Mr Green just as we ’re certain it has all been good things .
Established in 2007 , the operator has received much love from the players .
But they also have got the awards to prove they are good for it .
In 2016 , for example , they received the prestigious IGA for “ Mobile Operator of the Year ” .
Though they may not have that many RNG variations as Ladbrokes and Leo Vegas , they compensate with an impressive number of live dealer games , powered by three different live casino suppliers – Evolution Gaming , Extreme Live Gaming and NetEnt , so we ’re certain we ’ll be seeing much more of them in the future .
2. Ladbrokes Casino
Ladbrokes has a history spanning over a century – they were established at the end of the 19th century – but their online casino is , of course , much more recent .
Despite their long history , they manage to stay on top of current iGaming affairs by offering an excellent app for everyone who ’d like to play their slots , blackjack and roulette tables on the go .
And we would n’t expect any less – they are , after all , powered by software pioneer Playtech .
The name of that giant alone is a testament to technological greatness and innovation .
1. Leo Vegas Casino
They are called King of Mobile for a reason .
Not only do they deliver the greatest game portfolio to you wherever you may be , but they offer you an enviable quality of performance .
This rather new operator , which was established in 2011 , virtually pushes technology into high gear constantly .
They strive to improve all the time and , thus , make sure you , the players , are not only spoilt for choice on the go but also pampered with entertainment of the highest quality every second of every day .
That ’s why it ’s no surprise that they keep getting more and more awards recognising their greatness .
As I said in the original story , I woul be posting and commenting on some of the designs as they came in , and posting them into my journal .
I have a few of these right now , and I 'm posting them so I can give some guidance to everyone on what is good and bad .
I 've had probably 15 or so " Real " designs submitted .
Half were ( ahem ) bad or just not at all what I 'm looking for .
What follows is a couple of them
They are n't necessarily the best , but each has a few things about it that I like that i thought was worth sharing to help give everyone guidance .
first I have a design from Sujay Thomas .
I like that this design is CSS .
I think the handling of the topic icons in the corner is a bit clumsy .
I think the margins are a bit excessive .
I think the bars on the left and right need a bit of work .
But I think the center column is clean , simple and very readable .
I do n't think that this design will win without some work : i think it might be to minimal for what I 'm looking for .
It 's also a bit high contrast for my tastes .
Next up I have Hallvar Helleseth 's design .
Now he is missing a lot of navigational elements , and I 'm not sure what the 0 - 1 - 2 thing is behind the topic icons , but the design itself is a dramatic departure from Slashdot today , and I respect that .
He tries something unique with the topic icons .
I 'm not sure that the earthtone color scheme is quite what I 'm looking for , but I give him huge props for going somewhere unique .
The ' More Slashdot ' button atop the page shows you some ideas for where he is going with navigational elements .
I think the left and right sides of the pages need a bit more differentiation , and there are a few missing elements that are n't properly classed , but this is another solid starting point .
I like the reflection on the logo .
Dan Theman 's Entry is just plain funny .
The final entry I will comment on today is a design from Philip Dhingra .
First off , it is worth noting that his entry is a jpg - far from the CSS that I hope to ultimately see winning .
His article space is clean and legible .
Good choice on the data formatting .
Moving the department line is interesting .
His handling of the topic icons is unique , and a nice way to get around the limitations the icons present .
He loses a few bits of information ( story section for example ) and explicitly labels the icons - I 'd prefer not to label the icons .
I want them to visually stand by themselves .
I 'm not sure about his left hand menu .
But hsi choice to put the user information in the upper right hand corner is solid .
It makes excellent use of the space .
Likewise , his clean handling on the right of the slashboxes is really cool .
Of the designs presented today , this is the most developed in terms of " Design " but the least developed in terms of " CSS " .
But I can't wait to see where this one goes .
a few random notes
so far nobody has tried a CSS expanding / contracting menu for the left hand side .
Given the huge amount of space the menu takes up , I 'm kind of surprised .
WRT the topic icons at the TOP of the page - I think that those are expendable .
WRT topic icons , tons of people suggested automated ways of converting them to pngs and such .
Others suggested contsts seperate from this one to convert them .
I 'm open to anything , but as I stated originally , I think working with the icons we have is the most sane plan .
But all my rules are flexibile here .
Most of the designs so far have really shrunk down the logo in the top left .
I think thats fair : it 's pretty huge right now and probably could use a trimming .
Get the readers to the articles faster .
I have a lot more designs in my inbox that I plan to post here and comment on during the upcoming days .
Women who do not cover up are similar to abandoned " meat " making them responsible for sexual attacks , a senior Islamic cleric has said .
Sheik Taj Aldin Alhilali has outraged female Muslim leaders with comments he made during a Ramadan sermon to 500 worshippers in Sydney last month , News Limited newspapers report .
" If you take out uncovered meat and place it outside on the street , or in the garden or in the park , or in the backyard without a cover , and the cats come and eat it ... whose fault is it , the cats or the uncovered meat ? " the sheik asked .
Ambassador claims shortly before invasion , Bush did n't know there were two sects of Islam Christian Avard

Latest : Raw acquires Republican campaign plan for summer recess ...]
Former Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith is claiming President George W. Bush was unaware that there were two major sects of Islam just two months before the President ordered troops to invade Iraq , RAW STORY has learned .
In his new book , The End of Iraq : How American Incompetence Created A War Without End , Galbraith , the son of the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith , claims that American leadership knew very little about the nature of Iraqi society and the problems it would face after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
A year after his  Axis of Evil speech before the U.S. Congress , President Bush met with three Iraqi Americans , one of whom became postwar Iraqs first representative to the United States .
The three described what they thought would be the political situation after the fall of Saddam Hussein .
During their conversation with the President , Galbraith claims , it became apparent to them that Bush was unfamiliar with the distinction between Sunnis and Shiites .
Galbraith reports that the three of them spent some time explaining to Bush that there are two different sects in Islam -- to which the President allegedly responded ,  I thought the Iraqis were Muslims ! 
Research by RAW STORY has confirmed a surprising lack of public statements from the president regarding the branches of Islam , but did uncover at least one mention of their existence .
A fact sheet released by the White House in December of 2001 does indeed use the term Sunni to describe a Lashkar - E - Tayyib , " the armed wing of the Pakistan - based religious organization , Markaz - ud - Dawa - wal - Irshad . "
Other mentions , not originating from the White House , were common in government documents and proceedings , as well as in media coverage of the middle east .
Other reports also place Bush announcing newfound knowledge of the differences between Muslim groups shortly before entering the Iraq war .
In an interview with RAW STORY , Ambassador Galbraith recounted this anecdote from his book to exemplify a culture of arrogance that pervaded the whole administration . 
 From the president and the vice president down through the neoconservatives at the Pentagon , there was a belief that Iraq was a blank slate on which the United States could impose its vision of a pluralistic democratic society ,  said Galbraith .
 The arrogance came in the form of a belief that this could be accomplished with minimal effort and planning by the United States and that it was not important to know something about Iraq . 
The Bush Administrations aims when it invaded Iraq in March 2003 were to bring it democracy and transform the Middle East .
Instead , Iraq has reverted to its three constituent components : a pro-western Kurdistan , an Iran - dominated Shiite theocracy in the south , and a chaotic Sunni Arab region in the center .
Galbraith argues that because the new Iraq was never a voluntary creation of its people -- but rather held together by force -- Americas ongoing attempt to preserve a unified nation is guaranteed to fail , especially since its divided into three different entities .
 You cant have a national unity government when there is no nation , no unity , and no government ,  said Galbraith .
 Rather than trying to preserve or hold together a unified Iraq , the U.S. must accept the reality of Iraqs breakup and work with the Shiites , Kurds , and Sunni Arabs to strengthen the already semi-independent regions . 
Galbraith further argues that the invasion of Iraq destabilized the Middle East while inadvertently strengthening Iran .
One of the administration 's intentions in invading Iraq was to undermine Iran , but instead , the Iraqi occupation has given Tehran one of its greatest strategic triumphs in the last four centuries .
Once considered to be Iraqs worst enemy , Iran has now created , financed and armed the Shiite Islamic movements within southern Iraq .
Since the Iraqi Parliamentary elections of 2005 , the Shiites have made considerable political gains and now have substantial influence over the countrys U.S. - created military , its police , and the central government in Baghdad .
In addition , Iraq is developing economic ties with Iran that Galbraith believes could soon link the two countries  strategic oil supplies .
Galbraith says that , thanks to George W. Bush , Iran today has no closer ally in the world than the Iraq of the Ayatollahs . 
As a result , he argues , sending U.S. forces into Iraq , has in effect , made them hostage to Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies and left the U.S. without a viable military option to halt Irans drive to obtain nuclear weapons .
A seasoned diplomat , Galbraith served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia , where he negotiated the 1995 Erdut Agreement that ended the Croatian war .
Galbraith fears the United States may have lost the war on the very day it took Baghdad .
 The American servicemen and women who took Baghdad were professionals -- disciplined , courteous , and task - oriented ,  said Galbraith .
 Unfortunately , their political masters were so focused on making the case for war , so keen to vanquish their political foes at home , felt certain that Iraqis would embrace American - style democracy , yet they were so blinded by their own ideology that they failed to plan for the most obvious tasks following military victory . 
Galbraith believes that the Bush Administrations effort will only leave the U.S. with an open - ended commitment in circumstances of uncontrollable turmoil .
In the end , he believes , Americas most important objective is to avoid a worsening civil war .
 There is no easy exit from Iraq ,  said Galbraith .
 The alternative , however is to continue the present strategy of trying to build national institutions - displaced in the 2003 invasion - but how can you do that where this now is no longer an existing nation ? 
Somebody is lying .
So wrote Terry Neal , a political reporter for the Washington Post reporter , on July 25 2005 .
He was writing about one of the strangest stories to engulf the White House since the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 .
It is the story of an official investigation into who leaked the name of a CIA operative to the media .
According to a 1982 law , that kind of leak would be illegal .
Two prominent names have emerged in the investigation of the leak as possibilities – Karl Rove , President George W. Bush ’s deputy chief of staff , and Lewis Libby , vice - president Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff .
The investigation appears now to be heading towards a rapid conclusion .
If the prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , finds that either Mr Rove or Mr Libby or both violated the law , they would face criminal charges , and the Bush administration would quickly find itself enmeshed in a scandal of such dimensions that are it is already being compared to the Nixon - era Watergate scandal . of the Nixon era .
According to recent public recent opinion polls , including an August 7 poll in one Newsweek magazine , the American people are are increasingly of the view that Mr Rove , whom the resident Mr Bush described as the “ architect ” of his 2004 re-election , may be guilty of unethical or illegal behaviour in connection with the leak .
For example , on August 7 , 2005 , Newsweek Newsweek magazine said that 45 per cent of those polled “ believe he is guilty of a serious crime . ”
Much is still not known about Mr Fitzgerald ’s this investigation – Mr Fitzgerald he has insisted on absolute secrecy – but what is known strongly suggests that the Bush administration is engaged in a two - front war : one to cover up its blunders in the lead - up build - up to the Iraq war based and the a build - up based on the on the mistaken assumption that Saddam Hussein ’s regime possessed “ weapons of mass destruction ” , and the other to protect the leaker .
and the other two to .
The two fronts wars are now unmistakeably linked .
Even though President Mr Bush asserted on May 29 , 2003 , after the war , that “ we found the weapons of mass destruction , ” it soon
It became painfully clear in the war ’s aftermath of the that that Iraq had no such weapons and that Mr Bush ’s the President ’s justification for war was stunningly wrong .
Therefore , it was “ no accident ” , as the Soviets used to say , no accident ” that when Joseph Wilson , a former US ambassador , Joseph Wilson wrote an op -ed a comment article in the New York Times on July 6 2003 accusing the administration of “ twisting ” the intelligence to justify the war , the White House fussed and fumed – and struck back .
Within days stories began to appear to appear in the media criticising and belittling Mr Wilson , which was bad enough , but and then , oddly , outing Valerie Plame , his CIA wife , by name .
a leak that which proved to be a big mistake .
In addition , The White House later vigorously denied that Mr Rove was “ involved ” in any way .
In Washington the outing of a CIA operative is no trifling matter , no ­partisan matter either , and within a few short months , the justice department was pressured into appointing appointed a public prosecutor .
Mr ­Fitzgerald , a hard - nosed ambitious prosecutor from Chicago , plunged into a series of interviews with senior officials , including the president and vice - president .
Mr Rove and Mr Libby were also ­interviewed .
In fact , in a sequence described as most unusual by that lawyers saw as highly unusual , Mr Rove was summoned to testify three times before the grand jury .
Most unusualunexpected , reporters suggested , wondered , for for someone uninvolvedthree times ? .
Mr Rove was also questioned twice by the FBI .
In recent weeks , speculation has grown rumours have swept through Washington that Mr Fitzgerald was investigating not just the identity of the leaker but also more serious charges of perjury and obstruction of justice .
What had been , up to then , kept so quiet so hush - hush suddenly surfaced as front page news and cocktail chatter , deeply embarrassing and potentially damaging to the administration .
and politically damaging to the President .
For
It turned out that Mr Rove and Mr Libby were “ involved ” in the leaking and the outing , White House denials notwithstanding , and and public opinion polls began to reflecting growing doubts about the honesty of the Bush president ’s ( and his administration .
s ) honesty and candor .
An obvious link was being drawn between a security breach , which would have been a problem , and the war in Iraq , which is proving to be a disaster .
Making matters worse , Complicating the matter ,
In a show Mr Fitzgerald ’s spooky show of legalistic machismo , Mr Fitzgerald pursued jailed Judith Miller , a New York Times reporter , for refusing to disclose her sources for a story that she never wrote did not end up writing about the Wilson - Plame affair , resulting in led to Ms Miller ’s imprisonment .
never wrote .
One A key lesson from the Watergate scandal is that sometimes the a cover - up can be worse than the crime .
In this case , a usually media - savvy White House , stung by criticism of its justification for war , lashed out at one critic and then took the inexplicable and foolish step of orchestrating the outing of his CIA wife , unintentionally triggering leading to a chain of events .
totally unintended .
It would have been so much better if the White House had simply acknowledged its blunder – and apologised .
The American people would almost surely have “ understood ” .

Governing Well Is the Best Revenge
I am not a libertarian .
Unlike Markos Moulitsas , I will not try to convince you that most of our fellow Democrats are libertarians , either .
If you ’re independent and skeptical enough to claim that label for yourself , you would n’t believe us , anyway .
After six years of getting burned by an administration and Congress that promised to tame government , then injected it with steroids , you deserve to hear a straight answer , and a few honest pledges that will actually be kept .
So let me start by leveling about the ways in which we may disagree .
I grew up in Idaho , perhaps the second most libertarian state in the Union ( behind Alaska ) , and part of the great libertarian Mountain West that Markos Moulitsas dreams about .
I spent much of my youth at county fairs asking cowboys with gun racks if they ’d like Democratic bumper stickers on their pickups .
Needless to say , I learned about rejection at an early age , and received an excellent , if unsolicited , tutorial in libertarian philosophy .
Growing up in the Rockies , a world away from Washington , I picked up a healthy skepticism of government , an independent streak , and a distaste for orthodoxy .
But to me , living in your own private Idaho was more a privilege and a luxury than a practical formula for how a country might run .
I took other lessons from those years in a state with the slogan , “ Idaho Is What America Was . ”
First , personal liberty and personal responsibility go hand in hand .
We wo n’t have more of one unless we insist on more of the other .
Government is not the first nor the most important agent of responsibility , but its example matters .
An irresponsible , unaccountable government of any size poses a far graver threat to individual freedom than a responsible , activist one .
Second , markets can be the most effective engine of individual opportunity , but only if they are honest ones , tempered in the public interest .
Third , government must be an engine of individual opportunity as well , or else it will end up imposing a crushing burden of privilege and bureaucracy .
As Rahm Emanuel and I write in our book , with its un-libertarian title , The Plan : Big Ideas for America :
Every citizen needs to understand and accept the essence of the American bargain : Each of us has to do his or her part .
While the rights of citizenship are explicit in our Constitution , the implicit responsibilities are every bit as crucial .
For our radical experiment in freedom to work , we must prize responsibilities as well as rights , and never presume to do for people what they can do for themselves .
These beliefs lead us to take stands that many libertarians will not agree with .
For example , I believe that every American owes our country a debt of service .
I believe that government is bound to fail any time it values responsibilities less than rights .
From my own experience in government , I even have come to believe that my hero George Orwell ’s vision no longer holds :
In a country like ours , the more likely threat to freedom is not government conspiracy , but government ineptitude and bureaucracy .
So , if you ’re looking for government to close up shop , do n’t vote Democratic .
Unlike George Bush and the Republican Congress , we ’ll give you accountable government that lives within its means .
But we want government to do something useful , not just sit there .
I ’ll leave it to the civil libertarians in my party to explain why our side is less likely to spy on your library books , read your e-mails , or infringe upon your constitutional rights .
My case for voting Democratic rests on three simple , comparative tests :
Which party can provide smaller , more efficient government ?
Which party takes the responsibilities of government and limited government seriously enough to actually deliver it ?
Which party believes in competition enough to wean the country from its dangerous addiction to corporate welfare and make free enterprise work ?
Smaller Government : Forget the sweet nothings that Republicans have whispered in your ears for decades .
The last 15 years have given us a perfect laboratory experiment to measure actual results .
Bill Clinton produced the first balanced budget and the first surpluses in 30 years .
He cut the size of the federal workforce by 400,000 , and imposed a level of spending restraint the federal government has n’t seen before or since .
As Cato bravely pointed out , George Bush did just the opposite , squandering surpluses , abandoning all restraint , and presiding over the sharpest increase in domestic spending since LBJ .
If the record is n’t enough , look at our agendas .
Going forward , Democrats are the ones insisting on restoring annual spending caps and pay - as - you - go - rules to put the teeth back in fiscal discipline .
The Bush White House and congressional Republicans continue to oppose it , and claim deficits do n’t matter .
We now have a quarter century of evidence to prove that Republican tax cuts will never shrink the size of government — on the contrary , they just delay the day of reckoning , and add interest .
Republicans are n’t starving the beast ; with their steady diet of annual tax “ cuts , ” they ’ve created a bigger , hungrier beast that eats more and makes government fatter .
Democrats , on the other hand , have learned that prudence is a prerequisite for progressivism .
Limited Government : Thomas Jefferson said , “ That government which governs least , governs best . ”
After six years , we can now postulate the Bush corollary : “ That government which governs worst , governs most . ”
Let ’s face it :
If you believe in the idea of limited government , you have to take government more seriously , not less .
Nations have certain irreducible needs — like protection from natural disaster , for example .
Do them well , and government need not grow in size or scope .
Screw them up , and you ’ll have to spend , meddle , and intrude a great deal more .
Just as important , the very essence of limited government is that it must be purposeful , performance - based , and mission - driven .
When the purpose is not clear and certain , the outcome and the cost will never be .
In the Clinton administration , hacks knew their place .
In the Bush administration and the Republican Congress , hacks know no bounds .
The Bush playbook — bribes , no - bid contracts , disdain for competence , and a penchant for botching reform — invites more government .
New Democrat answers like banning earmarks , closing the revolving door , and ending the incumbent protection racket by requiring competitive congressional districts , by contrast , will keep government in check .
That is the fundamental problem with the Bush administration and Washington conservatism .
The Bush White House has been a political project , not a governing one .
From Katrina to Iraq to its domestic agenda , the Bush crowd did n’t take governing seriously , and never even bothered to ask whether its ideas would work .
It should come as no surprise that they did n’t .
Ending Corporate Welfare : For all their talk about markets , Washington Republicans have institutionalized corporate welfare and special privilege .
Corporations are not the root of all evil , as some think .
But if we believe in competition , we should n’t be doling out taxpayer subsidies that distort the market , bloat the budget , and invite corruption all at the same time .
For years , New Democrats have been beating the same drum as the Cato Institute :
It is time to end corporate welfare as we know it .
We were right to reform the broken welfare system for single mothers , who responded heroically by going to work and welcoming their independence .
Ending corporate welfare will have the same impact on both the political and the business world .
We cannot compete in a world that is flat if we let every interest in Washington put its thumb on the scale .
If we level the playing field by abolishing unnecessary subsidies , we ’ll advance the general welfare and be in a much stronger position for the global competition ahead .
***
Democrats have a vision of liberty and responsibility that America could have used these last few years , and needs even more in the years to come .
We may not be Rocky Mountain libertarians .
But after the mess Bush has made , you have nowhere to go but up .

As the Middle East prepares to mark the 50th anniversary on Oct. 29 of the Suez Crisis that effectively ended European colonialism , a half century of U.S. hegemony in the region also appears to be coming to an end , according to a growing number of analysts .
The observation is based primarily on the serious damage done to Washington ’s position in the Middle East by its 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq , where more than 140,000 of its troops remain bogged down in what seems likely an increasingly futile effort both to crush a Sunni insurgency that it failed to anticipate and prevent a larger sectarian civil war .
In addition , however , the passivity  or obstinacy  of the administration of President George W. Bush in failing to revive any kind of Arab - Israeli peace process , particularly in the wake of last summer ’s war between Israel and Hezbollah or the ongoing deterioration of the Palestinian Authority , appears to have brought both Washington ’s image and influence in the region to an all - time low .
“ American foreign policy in the Middle East is approaching a very serious crisis , ” noted Zbigniew Brzezinski , national security adviser under former President Jimmy Carter , at a dinner this week in which he noted the imminence of the 1956 crisis that he said marked “ the beginning of [ Washington ’s ] domination of the region . ”
“ We are facing the possibility of literally being pushed out of the Middle East , ” he warned , suggesting that only a major change in U.S. policy , particularly regarding the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , can reverse the current trend .
While other analysts insist that Washington ’s status as the world ’s military hyperpower and its continued heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil  let alone its continued presence in Iraq  ensure its continued relevance to the region , the consensus among regional specialists here is that its ability to affect events there has indeed been substantially diminished .
“ The age of U.S. dominance in the Middle East has ended and a new era in the modern history of the region has begun , ” wrote Richard Haass , president of the influential Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) and a top Middle East adviser to the George H.W. Bush administration , in a remarkably downbeat article in the latest edition of Foreign Affairs journal .
“ The U.S. will continue to enjoy more influence than any outside power , but its influence will be reduced from what it once was , ” according to Haass , who sees the new era as being one “ in which outside actors have a relatively modest impact and local forces enjoy the upper hand  and in which the local actors gaining power are radicals committed to changing the status quo . ”
That this “ New Middle East , ” as Haass titled his article , should be dawning 50 years after the Suez Crisis is particularly poignant , according to longtime observers of the region who note that , more than any other event , it was Washington ’s role in the crisis that boosted its image as a force for liberation and positioned it as an honest broker between Arabs and Israel .
On Oct. 29 , 1956 , Israel invaded Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula and within a few days occupied the Suez Canal zone that had been recently nationalized by the government of Egyptian President Gamal Nasser .
Pursuant to a plan worked out in advance with the two European governments , Israel then invited Britain and France to send their forces to the area as a buffer .
When Nasser rejected their offer to do so , they invaded anyway .
U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower , who had not been informed of the three countries ’ plans in advance , responded by threatening to “ pull the plug ” on the British pound and even to remove the U.S. nuclear umbrella from all three countries if they did not cease fire and commit themselves to a speedy withdrawal , one that was completed by early 1957 .
To most historians , the crisis  and the humiliation inflicted on the invading powers  spelled the effective end of western European colonialism in the region and the advent of U.S. preeminence , a preeminence that was successively enhanced by the aftermath of the 1973 Arab - Israeli war , the 1978 Camp David accords , and the end of the Cold War a decade later .
“ Certainly , in terms of the prestige and image of the U.S. in the region , it goes without saying that Suez was the high point , ” according to Chris Toensing , editor of the Washington - based Middle East Report ( MER ) .
“ The U.S. was seen not only as country that had itself not only thrown off the yoke of colonialism , but was willing to stick its neck out to help other countries do so as well . ”
If that helped establish Washington ’s “ soft power ” in the region , it also demonstrated to Arabs that the U.S. not only had influence over Israel , but was prepared to use it , even over the objections of both Tel Aviv and the increasingly influential “ Israel Lobby ” in Washington .
“ It is the fact that we made Israel withdraw from Sinai that established us an honest broker [ between Israel and the Arabs ] , ” according to Richard Parker , a retired foreign service officer who served as U.S. ambassador to Algeria , Morocco , and Lebanon during the 1970s .
“ Since Sinai , that has always been our trump card in the region . ”
Fifty years later , however , both U.S. soft power and its status as an honest broker  the two greatest achievements of the Suez crisis  are at their lowest ebb and , in Toensing ’s words , “ sinking ever lower . ”
As of 2002 , when the U.S. acquiesced in Israel ’s military campaign against the Palestinian Intifada , disapproval of the United States skyrocketed across the Arab world , according to public opinion polls which showed an even greater deterioration after the 2003 Iraq invasion and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal the following year .
“ The U.S. has come to be seen as the quintessential colonial power , and , if anything , worse than the old [ European ] ones , because they were viewed as having an economic agenda  resource extraction  while the U.S. is seen as having both a resource - extraction and an ideological agenda , ” according to Toensing .
In addition , the Bush administration ’s failure to exercise any demonstrable pressure on Israel to seriously engage the Palestinians in a peace process , its transparent support for Israel ’s military offensive and bombing campaign in Lebanon last summer ’s war with Hezbollah , and its rejection to date of renewed Arab efforts to promote the 2002 Saudi peace plan in the wake of the Lebanon conflict have effectively destroyed the image of Washington as an honest broker .
“ Our strong point was always that we were the only power that could do anything with the Israelis , ” according to Parker .
“ We still have that influence , but the key is whether we ’re prepared to use it .
If not , it ’s going to waste away . ”

However , as Peter points out , the answer to this question is no where to be found in Google .
In 41 states , people accused or convicted of crimes have the legal right to rewrite history .
They can have their criminal records expunged , and in theory that means that all traces of their encounters with the justice system will disappear .
But enormous commercial databases are fast undoing the societal bargain of expungement , one that used to give people who had committed minor crimes a clean slate and a fresh start .
Most states seal at least some records of juvenile offenses .
Many states also allow adults arrested for or convicted of minor crimes like possessing marijuana , shoplifting or disorderly conduct to ask a judge , sometimes after a certain amount of time has passed without further trouble , to expunge their records .
If the judge agrees , the records are destroyed or sealed .
But real expungement is becoming significantly harder to accomplish in the electronic age .
Records once held only in paper form by law enforcement agencies , courts and corrections departments are now routinely digitized and sold in bulk to the private sector .
Some commercial databases now contain more than 100 million criminal records .
They are updated only fitfully , and expunged records now often turn up in criminal background checks ordered by employers and landlords .
I hear this one a lot : I want to start my own business , but my wife wo n’t let me because she thinks it ’s too risky .
There are variations using “ girlfriend ” or “ fiancée , ” but so far I ca n’t recall a single instance of a woman telling me her husband / boyfriend would n’t let her start a business , not to mention male - male and female - female relationships or those involving pets .
Certainly other situations are possible , but I ’ll just address the most common one and avoid getting lost in a quagmire of pronouns .
My wife wo n’t let me start my own business …
Would it help if you told her I said it was OK ?
Or perhaps you could get a note from your Mommy :
Dear Kim , Johnny has my permission to start his own business if that ’s what he really wants .
Love , Mom
Would that make it all better ?
Your wife wo n’t let you start your own business ?
What ’re you … six years old ?
Have you softened your will so much that you now live only by the voice of the collective : “ You will not start your own business .
Individuality is irrelevant .
Resistance is futile . ”
Your wife wo n’t let you ?
Are you a homo sapien or a wimpus maximus ?
Perhaps the reality of the situation is that your wife thinks you ’re incompetent , and if you were to start your own business , your family may go broke and lose all the nice stuff you ’ve acquired .
She ’s probably right .
After all , most new businesses do fail .
If this is the first business you ’re starting , it probably wo n’t work out too well in the long run .
Remember the scene in The Matrix when Neo tries to do his first superjump and smacks face - first into the ground .
What does it mean ?
“ Nothing , ” came the reply .
“ Everyone falls the first time . ”
But guess what … you know what happens after that ?
You get up and do it again .
You just keep going .
The world does n’t actually spin off its axis just because one business fails .
Well , some business failures cause quite a wobble ( Enron … cough cough ) , but the earth soon rights itself once again .
Even if there ’s a great prophecy about your first stab at business and it turns out you ’re The One , you ’re still probably going to fall flat on your face .
Even Bill Gates and Paul Allen threw in the towel with Traf - O - Data .
( Otherwise traffic lights everywhere would now be participating in DDOS attacks . )
Geeky enthusiasm will only get you so far .
Experience makes quite a difference .
So I ’d say your wife is right .
Your first business probably will tank .
Your first product wo n’t sell .
Your first web site will look like a college professor made it .
Everyone falls the first time .
But that does n’t mean you should n’t go for it anyway .
Nor does it mean you have to fulfill the part of the prophecy that says you have to die trying .
Did you know that it ’s possible to start a new business without risking your entire life savings ?
( I wish someone had explained that to me back in 1994 ! )
When I started this personal development business in October 2004 , I went right out and plunked down the hefty sum of $ 9 to register the domain name .
After that I required that every other dollar I wanted to spend on this business would come out of revenue .
Partly that was just to see if I could do it because starting a business on less than $ 10 cash might make for a good story someday ( hmmm … perhaps that day has finally come . )
I did n’t bother to get a DBA or business cards or cutesy stationary or have a cool logo made or anything like that .
Just the domain name .
I even got free web hosting by sharing a web server with another site .
I still have n’t spent a dime on marketing .
In truth I was taking a greater financial risk than just $ 9 because I sacrificed a lot of potential income – obviously I invested my time which could have been used to generate income elsewhere .
And I had other sources of income and savings to temporarily cover my personal expenses .
But I did n’t go into debt to do it , and I did n’t dip into savings for business expenses .
If this was my first business , I ’d probably be in serious trouble by this point , or I just would n’t be making money at all .
Instead I ’m actually enjoying a positive cashflow .
It ’s not making me rich yet , but it ’s reached the point where it should be relatively easy to sustain and grow .
This is n’t my first business though .
Technically it ’s my third .
First I ran a computer games business developing retail games for five years , then I switched to a shareware games model for six years – those were really two completely different businesses , although I kept the same company name throughout .
And then there ’s StevePavlina.com , which I think of more as a mission than a business , but it ’s still technically a business .
The first games business flopped completely .
The second one worked nicely , but I chose not to continue growing it .
And I expect StevePavlina.com will be the best of all , especially since it ’s a much better fit for my own strengths .
I would n’t be nearly so far along with this business if I did n’t already have a decade ’s worth of experience from my games business .
Even if your wife expects you to fail in business , did you know that it ’s perfectly OK to go out and prove her right ?
She ’d like that – it will build her self - esteem .
She gets to be right , and you gain experience .
And eventually that experience will make you right too .
It will just take a bit longer .
If you start a new business and it flops , you just have to do what Neo did .
Get your butt back up on top of that skyscraper and try again .
If you fall it ’s going to sting a bit , but it wo n’t kill you ( unless you happen to borrow money from the wrong people ) .
And pretty soon you ’ll be flying around , dodging bullets , wearing cool shades , and saying , “ Whoa ” a lot .
How many tries did it take you to learn to walk ?
When you fell the first time and cried your eyes out , did your Mommy grab you and say , “ That does it !
No more walking for you , mister !
You can just remain seated for life . ”
If you ask someone out on a date and get a rejection , does that mean you ’re sentenced to celibacy ?
If you endure some bad Chinese food , does that mean you should never enjoy fortune cookies again ?
If your five - year old daughter decides it would be fun to tear certain Christmas decorations to shreds and sprinkle the living room with Styrofoam rubble and pretend it ’s snow , does that mean – oh , never mind .
Your wife may be right , but that does n’t mean you need to let her stop you from starting your own business .
In truth you ’re just using it as an excuse to stop yourself .
You do n’t have to take a huge financial risk to start a business .
You do n’t even have to start one full - time .
But there are few things in life that will do as much for your own personal growth as the act of starting a business .
If you ’re seriously whipped though , I ’ll give you an extra secret that will allow you to get anything you want from your wife .
It ’s called a foot massage .
Master the art of the foot massage , and your wife will never stand in your way again .
Do n’t even ask .
Just grab a foot and go to it .
After 5 - 10 minutes , you can ask for anything you want with a 95 % chance of agreement .
And if you get that rare 5 % rejection , just gradually work your way up through the rest of her body , and try again once you ’ve squeezed all the resistance out of her .
Endorphins are your friends .
Lost a lot of money in stocks ?
Foot massage .
Accidentally wiped your digital wedding photos from the hard drive ?
Foot massage .
Told your wife you think she ’s looking older ?
Foot massage … performed orally .
It took me a good 10 years to become a master pedomasseur .
It ’s well worth the time to develop this skill though , especially if you expect to be with the same woman for many more years .
But even if you ’re new to foot massaging , I think your wife will find that even when it ’s bad , it ’s still pretty good .
Once you develop a reasonable degree of proficiency and can send your wife to la-la land in a matter of minutes , you need only remember the phrase , “ Honey , would you like a foot massage ? ”
Even when she ’s certain that you ’re up to no good , she ’ll be unable to resist such guaranteed pleasure .
Ten minutes later when the endorphins have taken her brain offline , you will pretty much own her .
This is far more efficient than any amount of verbal persuasion .
And it ’s a lot more enjoyable for your wife .
Words will only make a mess of things .
If your wife wo n’t let you start your own business , do n’t try to convince her of your glorious battle plan to go out and conquer the world .
She ’s right anyway – you ’re going to get pummeled to a pulp .
No amount of flowery verbiage and colorful bar graphs will convince her that she should listen to you instead of her intuition .
Just make her feet feel yummy , and you ’ll be free to suffer the slings and arrows of your own incompetence for years with her full support .
Eventually you ’ll become competent .
But I recommend you continue the foot massages anyway … just in case .
Now go grab a foot and start squeezing .
Whoa .
In - App Purchase Rules September 11 , 2020 ∞https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes
A summary of today ’s changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods :
Your app must use Apple ’s in - app- purchase ( IAP ) system for all purchases made in the app .
Unless they ’re purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app , in which case you are prohibited from using IAP .
Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines , newspapers , books , audio , music , or video , in which case , you are required to use IAP .
But if your app only “ reads ” previously purchased magazines , newspapers , books , audio , music , or video , and does n’t mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app , you do n’t need to use IAP .
Unless you offer account creation , in which case , you are required to use IAP .
Unless you only offer free account creation , in which case , you do n’t need to use IAP .
But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app , you are required to use IAP .
Except for accounts that were created outside the app , which can offer paid account upgrades and do n’t need to use IAP .
If you ’re selling “ experiences ” between people , you do n’t need to use IAP .
Unless those “ experiences ” include three or more people , or are n’t consumed live , in which case , you are required to use only IAP .
If your purchase is for services , features , or game items , you are required to use only IAP .
Unless you operate on multiple platforms , in which case , you can also offer purchasing outside the app .
But you ca n’t tell anyone about it .
Unless you get their contact info somewhere else , in which case , you can tell them about it , but not in the app .
You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people .
Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use , in which case , you still must use IAP , but you can include your own payment method as well .
Unless those groups are families , or unless those employees or students are somehow “ consumers ” , in which case , you must only use IAP .
Do I have that right ?
* * * How about an alternative that ’s clear , fair , reasonable , and consistently enforceable ?
Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app , as long as terms are clear and customers are n’t misled , and may or may not choose to implement in - app purchase based on its merits .
In one stroke , antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear , developer relations are significantly repaired , and Apple can go back to spending its time , resources , PR , and political capital on making their products better and customers happier .

Introducing Voice Boost 2 : Remaster your podcasts January 31 , 2020 ∞https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2
The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I ’m especially proud of that took over a year to build .
Voice Boost 2 is an all - new audio engine that includes professional - grade , mastering - quality loudness normalization .
When I first introduced Overcast in 2014 , Voice Boost was one of its headlining features : Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows .
This makes amateur - produced podcasts ( including many of my favorites ) more listenable in loud environments , like cars , where you ’d otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you ’d blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke .
Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost , but with dramatically more sophisticated methods , leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality .
Goals
When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing , it was a single configuration of Apple ’s AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts , regardless of their audio characteristics .
It was an effective but blunt tool , relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable .
Since then , I ’ve edited over 500 podcasts , learned a lot more about how to master them properly , and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing .
I set out to develop a better , smarter , and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I ’d learned , with these audio goals :
The effect should be much more subtle : mostly just consistent volume , plus slightly smoother tone .
It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level , modifying already - good audio as little as possible .
It should sound good , and consistent , regardless of the volume dynamics of its input .
Quality should be so good that I can even play high - quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts .
And these technical goals : Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost , it had to work as a streaming process , easily toggled on and off at will , without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead .
The code had to be pure C , with highly optimized and vectorized code , so it would n’t be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower - power devices as well .
I had to write every component from scratch , without using AudioUnits , because I wanted to understand and control everything , ensure the highest performance and sound quality , and avoid Apple ’s platform - specific API limits .
2
It had to be modular and easily customizable , like a channel strip in an audio editor , so I could adjust the processing during development and testing , offer user customization down the road , and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast - preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow ( which I ’ve been using for over a year ) .
3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice
Boost is mostly about high - quality volume analysis and loudness normalization , I went straight to the top , implementing the ITU BS.1770 –4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high - end audio editors .
Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast - standard perceptual loudness algorithm , at full quality , with no preprocessing .
Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to – 14 LUFS — a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn - by - turn navigation voices , so when you ’re listening to a podcast while driving , navigation interruptions are less jarring .
Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels , so Voice Boost 2 wo n’t overcompress them with aggressive processing — it ’ll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume .
A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion
This is about to get nerdier , but bear with me .
( Yes , nerdier than ITU broadcast - loudness standards . )
Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio , quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target .
But perceived loudness is n’t the peak of the incoming audio stream — it ’s more of an average .
Quiet - sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks .
When increasing the volume of digital audio , the biggest challenge is not “ clipping ” during the peaks — not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB .
( It ’s a negative scale .
This is also why the LUFS value above , which is closely related to the decibel scale used here , is negative . )
Here ’s the highest the signal should go , showing the individual audio samples ( green dots ) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio ( smooth green line ) :
It ’ll sound right as long as the audio does n’t cross above that top line ( 0 dB ) .
Increase the volume even slightly too far , and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there , losing the tops of their smooth curves :
And that sounds terrible .
But I ca n’t just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day — that ’s called a brickwall limiter — because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies , telling the DAC to add noise that was n’t really there .
Here , the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown :
The unclipped signal ( left ) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz , but a basic brickwall limiter ( right ) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies .
That ’s distortion .
( If this is interesting to you , learn more about audio sampling theory here . )
Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter , which looks … ahead ( 😎 ) at the audio coming down the pipeline , and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching , then back up again afterward , just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion , but so quickly that you do n’t notice .
4
After Voice Boost 2 ’s complete 32 - bit audio processing pipeline , the last stage is a lookahead limiter , configured such that it can’t clip , no matter what audio comes through .
This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality .
Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor , but over time , I ’ve kept reducing its strength as I ’ve found it less necessary .
Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward .
True - peak detection
There ’s one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against .
Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time ( green dots , again ) on a sound wave ( green line ) .
But the sampled points do n’t always land at the exact peaks of those waves :
The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value .
By this method , the top waveform peaks here would measure about – 6 dB and – 1.5 dB , respectively .
But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is – 1 dB !
A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it ’s not seeing the true peaks .
Voice Boost 2 ’s limiter performs true - peak detection , rather than simply measuring sample peaks , to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion .
Mastering - quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering - quality audio - processing pipeline that applies broadcast - standard loudness normalization , light compression and EQ , and a true - peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts , in real time , without sacrificing quality or battery life .
And it runs at less than 1 % CPU usage on an iPhone SE.5
I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates , but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone .
Now that it ’s available to everyone , I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback .
But as I ’ve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal , less customization has been necessary .
6
Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive , Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent .
It ’s not promoted more in the app or even labeled “ Voice Boost 2 ” .
It ’s still Voice Boost — just better now .
If I did my job well , you ’ll hardly notice it at all .
You ’ll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket .
But I ’ll know .
And the handful of you who really care will know .
And that ’s enough for me .
Voice Boost 2 is in today ’s update ( 2020.1 ) , along with these new features : AirPlay 2 : Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively , with full - blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost , on iOS 13.1 and above .

Low Power Mode for Mac laptops : making the case again January 13 , 2020 ∞https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux
In light of today ’s rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction , 1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS — and explain why now is the time .
Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits , trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life .
Software also plays a role , trying to keep everything background - updated , content - indexed , and photo - analyzed so it ’s ready for us when we want it , but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life .
Apple ’s customers do n’t usually have control over these balances , and they ’re usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities .
The sole exception , Low Power Mode on iOS , seems to be a huge hit : by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance , people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they ’ll need it .
2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode , too .
I believe so strongly in its potential because I ’ve been using it on my laptops ( in a way ) for years , and it ’s fantastic .
I ’ve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015 .
In 2018 , I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks , concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang - for - the - buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks .
3
Recently , as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes , the gains have become even more significant .
Here ’s some thermal testing from my 8 - core 16 - inch MacBook Pro : 16 - inch MacBook Pro ( Late 2019 , 2.4 GHz 8 - core i9 ) Power Temp .
Geekbench 5 single / multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90 °C 1260 / 7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31 W − 62 % 65 °C 669 / 5206 − 46 / 29 % 62 sec. +59 % With Turbo Boost disabled , peak CPU power consumption drops by 62 % , with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature .
This has two massive benefits :
The fans never audibly spin up .
When Turbo Boost is enabled , the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load .
Disable it , and it ’s almost impossible to get them to be audible .
When Turbo Boost is enabled , the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load .
Disable it , and it ’s almost impossible to get them to be audible .
It runs significantly cooler .
Turbo
Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap , and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty .
Disable it , and the laptop only gets moderately warm , not hot , and hands stay comfortably dry .
I have n’t done formal battery testing on the 16 - inch , since it ’s so difficult and time - consuming to do in a controlled way that ’s actually useful to people , but anecdotally , I ’m seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I ’ve seen with previous laptops : significantly longer battery life that I ’d estimate to be between 30 – 50 % .
This comes at a cost to performance , but :
It ’s not noticeable on most workloads .
Parallel workloads are affected far less than single - threaded tasks , and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized .
This is an 8 - core laptop that ’s competitive with my iMac Pro !
It ’s much faster than most people need ( myself included ) most of the time , so I can spare some performance to get other benefits .
A fast laptop is n’t very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type , the battery dies in the middle of a flight , or the loud fans ruin your audio recording .
When I really want to maximize performance , Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar , so switching between modes is easy .
The vast majority of the time I ’m using it , the 16 - inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled .
It ’s still fast enough to do everything I need ( including significant development with Xcode ) , while remaining silent and cool , with incredible battery life .
But soon , I bet I wo n’t be able to do this anymore .
Turbo Boost Switcher
Pro relies on a kernel extension that ’s grandfathered into Apple ’s latest security requirements , but it can never be updated — and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time , it warns that it ’ll be “ incompatible with a future version of macOS . ”
I suspect that this is the last year I ’ll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will , making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse .
Please , Apple , make this feature official : give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool , quiet , and long - lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed .

The 16 - inch MacBook Pro November 13 , 2019 ∞https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16
After my first day with the new 16 - inch MacBook Pro , I ’m very optimistic about it .
🎧
Hear more on today ’s Accidental Tech Podcast !
Two years ago , I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro , and the 16 - inch does n’t actually deliver most of it .
But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook :
The ports are unchanged .
We ’ll still need dongles .
But USB-C is gradually becoming more common , and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty .

But USB-C is gradually becoming more common , and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty .
The Touch Bar is n’t optional .
But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks , and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys .

The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences .
There ’s still no cable management , safety breakaway , or charging LED .
But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps .
There ’s still no cable management , safety breakaway , or charging LED .
But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps .
The headphone jack is still on the right ( wrong ) side , despite most single - sided headphone cables entering the left earcup .
But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time .
Addressing those would be nice , but as I wrote then , they paled in comparison to one huge issue : the butterfly keyboard .
The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches .
If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro , it should be this .
It ’s far more important than anything else on this list . [ … ]
The Magic Keyboard ’s scissor switches feel similar , but with a bit more travel , and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations . [ … ]
The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro : returning to the “ inverted - T ” arrow - key arrangement by making the left - and right - arrow keys half - height again .
This arrangement is much more natural and less error - prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “ T ” shape , a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row .
That ’s exactly what they ’ve done , and I could n’t be happier .
The new 16 - inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways , but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years .
They were fast , powerful , capable workstations … but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all .
Not anymore .
I ’m on cloud nine .
Look at this glorious keyboard !
An Esc key !
Inverted - T arrow keys !
A millimeter of key travel !
Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves !
And keystrokes will probably work , 100 % of the time , for years !
Five years ago , nobody would ’ve considered any of these noteworthy , and readers would ’ve suspected you were n’t of sound mind if you included them in a review .
Five years ago , laptop keyboards were fine .
Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had , they worked , and we never had to talk or think about them .
Today , finally , we begin heading back to that world .
The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly — it was a huge departure from everything else we ’d ever used , mostly not in good ways .
The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard , and I expect it to have a wide appeal , just as the Magic Keyboard does .
It has slightly less travel and spacing , but the overall feeling is very similar — and it ’s nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard .
I absolutely love it — not because it ’s the most amazing keyboard in the world , but because it ’s completely forgettable in the best possible way .
It just feels normal again .
There ’s a lot more to love about the 16 - inch MacBook Pro .
The screen and battery are bigger , but the size and weight barely increased .
It ’s almost as fast as my iMac Pro , and the new thermals can sustain higher performance .
The speakers and microphone got huge , unexpected improvements .
And I did n’t get everything I wanted .
But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do , and all of them are much less important than making the computer ’s primary input device functional , acceptable , and reliable .
Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less - urgent wishes .
The biggest change is that I finally do n’t feel like it ’s constantly fighting me .
Its design does n’t feel spiteful .
It ’s a computer that does n’t seem to hate being a computer .
I ’m not afraid to use it in the world , and I ’m not avoiding using it because it ’s unpleasant .
The butterfly keyboard was the opposite , it never got better , I never got used to it , and good riddance to it .
Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro , updated Mac Mini , and upcoming Mac Pro , the release of the 16 - inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac .
Apple has finally turned the ship around .
We have n’t had long enough to fully test it yet .
There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time — there usually are ( and always have been ) .
But frankly , it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015 .
Fortunately , upon initial usage , nothing bad really jumps out .
The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications .
It ’s a great computer , period , and it feels so good to be able to say that again .
For the first time in years , without any major exceptions , we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do .

Overcast summer update July 21 , 2019 ∞https://marco.org/2019/07/21/overcast-summer-update
Today ’s Overcast update ( 2019.6 ) brings some great new features .
But first , I need to set low expectations for iOS 13 , watchOS 6 , and macOS Catalina updates this fall .
Halfway through the summer , I ’ve made much less progress than expected , having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes , my own technical and design debts , and unusually rough betas .
Rather than shipping a big iOS update , a standalone Watch app , and a Mac app on day one , these will probably come incrementally over the next year .
Fortunately , I have n’t stopped improving the app in the meantime .
Per - podcast customization , longer clips
You can now set download - vs. - stream and auto - delete behavior per podcast , one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years .
( Sorry it took so long — it required a lot of server - side work for uninteresting reasons . )
I ’ve also raised the clip - sharing length limit to 90 seconds .
When I debuted this feature , I had to guess how it would be used and received , and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit .
In practice , that ’s sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought .
90 seconds should be better — most clips wo n’t need to be that long , but it ’ll be nice to have the headroom when you need it .
“ Suggestions for You ” replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter - powered social - recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014 , which made sense at the time : I did n’t have any popularity data to generate recommendations from , and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today .
But after five years , only 10 % of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast , and only 0.2 % of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations .
Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10 % of people who enabled it , but the other 90 % of Overcast ’s customers have n’t been getting personalized recommendations at all .
In the meantime , I ’ve accumulated five years of popularity data , so I tried writing my own recommendation engine .
It worked — and it ’s better .
Overcast now offers its own data - driven recommendation engine , and I ’ve removed Twitter integration entirely .
Podcasts in the new “ Suggestions for You ” section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to , and what else their subscribers subscribe to , which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks .
Most importantly , it works for all of Overcast ’s customers .

As always , Overcast is free in the App Store .
Give it a try .

Apple is Listening June 9 , 2019 ∞https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening
Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017 .
They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years , especially Macs .
It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user .
The “ trash can ” 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous “ cheese grater ” towers , aged quickly without critical upgrade paths , and suffered from high GPU - failure rates from its cooling solution — all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff .
Over the next few years , it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing , outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating , leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned .
I think Apple learned a small lesson from it , but they learned a much bigger one a few years later .
The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016 , and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar , sparse USB - C - only port offerings , high prices , and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism , mixed reviews , and high failure rates .
This one really hurt : while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest - end and most - specialized needs , the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac .
By the end of 2016 , in addition to the generally buggy , neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in , Apple had replaced its entire “ pro ” Mac lineup with controversial , limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple ’s industrial - design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers ’ needs .
The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore .
Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved .
Their newest designs felt punitive , rather than feeling like a celebration of computing .
Then , in April 2017 , out of nowhere , Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1
The follow - up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019 , and publicized the existence of a “ Pro Workflow Team ” of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software .
It sounded like they ’d gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening .
And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great .
2
The late - 2017 iMac Pro , which I ’m using to write this , is the best Mac I ’ve ever owned by far .
It ’s versatile , incredibly powerful , beautiful , and silent .
It ’s so good that I ’ll probably never really need a Mac Pro again , 3 and if this was the only new “ Mac Pro ” , I ’d be mostly fine with that .
The late - 2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful , punitive , neglected relic with a practical , powerful mini-Mac - Pro .
Apple could ’ve let it die , or replaced it with a tiny , no - port marvel of uselessness , but instead , they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it .
And the 2019 Mac Pro , finally unveiled last week , looks to be absolutely killer — it ’s the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro , which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010 .4
It ’s big , bulky , ludicrously fast , and almost obscenely upgradeable — exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be , and far better than any of us expected .
The new Mac Pro is , truly , a celebration of computing .
Even more importantly than any hardware releases , macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently .
For the first time in a decade , the Mac was a major focus of WWDC , with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software .
To be fair , this story has n’t ended yet .
The Mac Pro is n’t actually out yet ( and will be very expensive ) , they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation ( rumors are promising ) , and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story .
5
But I ’m optimistic for the first time in years .
It ’s hard to tell when Apple is listening .
They speak concisely , infrequently , and only when they ’re ready , saying absolutely nothing in the meantime , even when we ’re all screaming about a product line as if it ’s on fire .
They make great progress , but often with courageous losses that never get reversed , so an extended silence because we ’re stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix is n’t ready yet .
But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017 , and they could n’t be more clear now : Apple is listening again , they ’ve still got it , and the Mac is back .

Clip sharing with Overcast April 27 , 2019 ∞https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing
Sharing podcasts has never been easy , but I ’ve always tried to lead the way with Overcast , with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014 .
Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links , but today ’s social networks are more reliant on images and video , especially Instagram .
Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today .
I ’ve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts , but they were never available to everyone , or for every show .
So people mostly just have n’t shared podcast clips , understandably , because it has been too hard .
Not anymore .
▶️ ↩️
This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily , for all podcasts , for both podcasters and listeners to use .
With today ’s 2019.4 update1 , you can now share audio or video clips , up to a minute each , from any public podcast .
Simply tap the share button in the upper - right corner .
You can generate an audio clip , or portrait , landscape , or square video , using your current Overcast theme setting .
In order to help spread podcasts further , I did n’t want to be heavy - handed in the Overcast branding — not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows .
So the “ Shared with Overcast ” badge is optional , and if you ’d like , you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge .
Finally , I wanted to extend the same app - agnosticism to Overcast ’s share links .
While this design still needs a lot of modernization , I ’ve done a small refresh : Now , for non-logged - in visitors , Overcast ’s public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts .
It ’s important for me to promote other apps like this , and to make it easy even for other people ’s customers to benefit from Overcast ’s sharing features , because there are much bigger threats than letting other open - ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users .
For podcasting to remain open and free , we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary , locked - down services to exploit .
2
Conversely , the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content , functionality , and ease of use , the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling .
One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share .
Hopefully , Overcast ’s new clip - sharing feature changes that , and other apps build similar features soon .
So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments .
It ’ll help me , of course , but more importantly , it ’ll help your favorite shows gain listeners , and it ’ll strengthen the amazing , open , standards - based world of podcasting .

Overcast 5.1 with Instant Search January 28 , 2019 ∞https://marco.org/2019/01/28/overcast-instant-search
▶️ The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts , and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month .
Over 80 % of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching , with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name ( rather than searching for generic keywords , such as “ business ” ) .
Good search is a critical , differentiating feature of any podcast app .
I ’m not satisfied if the podcast you ’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one , displayed quickly , after typing the fewest characters possible .
I ’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data .
Instant Search is the next step in Overcast ’s search evolution .
It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type , even after only a single letter .
1
It ’s a dramatic , delightful improvement to a critical , frequently used feature .
This was a lot of fun to build , and I ’m proud of it .
See for yourself !
Overcast is free on the App Store .

Rather than try to be comprehensive , I focused on what matters most to me : size choice between the 11 ” and 12.9 ” , the Smart Keyboard Folio from my perspective as a frequent 10.5 ” Smart Keyboard user , the new Pencil , and why “ getting work done ” is n’t important to me .

The 2018 Mac Mini November 6 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review
Watch the video review I hardly ever think about my Mac Mini , but it serves a vital role for my family as our home - theater mixer , Plex server , ScanSnap server , Apple Photos backup , and Backblaze host for our NAS.1
Almost every port on the back is in use , and it runs 24/ 7 , reliably , in total silence .
Until last week , I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made .
And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update , I assumed the worst : if it came at all , it would be a tiny box with a slow , ultra - low - power processor and almost zero ports , optimizing for small size instead of versatility .
I do n’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update , which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better .
It seemed clear then , and for the following four years that it went without an update , that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard .
Not anymore .
The 2018 Mac Mini is real , and it ’s spectacular .
It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better , finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age .
Ports !
Glorious ports !
Number one — and this is a big one these days , especially for this product — is that it ’s not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini , including the generous assortment of ports .
If the previous one served a role for you , the new one can probably do it just as well , and probably better and faster , with minimal donglage .
2
It ’s the same size as the old one , which is the right tradeoff .
I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller , and many who do n’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance .
The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible , addressing lots of diverse and edge - case needs that the other Macs ca n’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs .
The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product , not a design statement .
( Although , even as someone tired of space - gray everything , I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color . )
The base price has increased to $ 800 , and that ’s not great .
It ’s partly justifiable because it ’s much higher - end than before — the processors are much better , the architecture is higher - end and includes big advances like the T2 , and all - SSD is standard — but it ’s still an expensive product in absolute terms .
Apple lent me a high - end configuration for review — 6 - core i7 , 32 GB RAM , 1 TB SSD — which would cost $ 2499 ( much of which is the SSD ) .
This would ’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago , but when it ’s specced up like this , it ’s targeting a much higher - end market than the previous model could .
Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros , the pricing is generally reasonable .
And this can truly be a pro desktop , with just one exception .
Benchmarks
The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is .
Granted , I ’m testing the fastest CPU offered , but damn .
Geekbench results are very strong .
The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single - core performance than every other Mac today (! ) at 5912 , and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12 - core 2013 Mac Pro .
“ Performance - competitive with pro Macs ” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update , but here we are .
As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years , Apple has found other ways to improve performance .
The T2 is great for lots of security reasons — I would n’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you ’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller .
This Mac Mini builds my app , Overcast , much faster than my maxed - out 13 - inch MacBook Pro , and about as quickly as my 10 - core iMac Pro !
Obviously , to achieve this result with only 6 cores , it ’s not maxing out the CPU 100 % of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it ’s incredibly fast as a development machine .
The Blackmagick Disk Speed
Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date , and a huge improvement over the four - year - old Mac Mini .
A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers , so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg .
This maxes out all CPU cores , so the results predictably scale with the core count : the 6 - core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4 - core MacBook Pro , but the 10 - core iMac Pro beat them both .
But if an app supports the T2 ’s hardware HEVC encoder , 3 it can go much faster .
And since every T2 so far performs identically , all T2 machines — from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro — encode HEVC this way at the same speed , and all in complete silence because they ’re barely touching the CPU .
I was n’t able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2 ’s hardware acceleration .
The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU .
It ’s fast enough for common tasks , but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU , you ’re better off going for an iMac or a 15 - inch MacBook Pro , or considering an eGPU setup .
Many Mac lines rely on Intel ’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs , and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU - GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs .
We often blame Intel ’s CPU roadmap ( or Apple ’s seeming indifference ) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines , but Intel ’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue .
This is Intel ’s fault , but it ’s Apple ’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers .
But that ’s it — aside from price , that ’s the only downside .
The GPU sucks .
Everything else is awesome .
If you do n’t need a strong GPU — and honestly , most Mac Mini use - cases do n’t — this is a solid pick for a general - purpose Mac , even at the base - level configuration .
Spec it up , and it ’s more like a mini-Mac Pro .
A few assorted notes , with apologies for stealing Gruber ’s format :
It ’s silent at idle .
The i7 ’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it ’s under heavy load : it ’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro , but quieter .
Interestingly , I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model ’s thermals , and could n’t get the fan to spin up audibly , no matter what I did .
Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3 .
This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5 K display , at full quality , without dual cables or other unreliable hacks .
We finally have 5 K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac !
Unfortunately , we still do n’t have any great standalone 5 K displays .
( The LG UltraFine is n’t . )
You can upgrade the RAM again !
I never would ’ve guessed this was coming , and I believe it ’s the first time in a long time that an Apple product ’s direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable .
I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible , since third - party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger - pointing , but if you need that , it ’s back .
( The security screws inside — TR6 ? — still need some i Fixit tools to get past . )
I Ca n’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome , I Ca n’t Even Say “ Again ” Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could ’ve been so much worse .
At many times in its past , it has seemed unloved , neglected , and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple ’s other headless desktop , the Mac Pro .
It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore , especially desktops .
Last year , with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro , Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction .
It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users , and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better .
We did n’t know until now whether the iMac Pro ’s greatness was a fluke .
But now we have another data point : the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible .
After this , I have faith that they ’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year .
The new Mac Mini is a great update , out of nowhere , to a product we thought would never be updated again .
Of course , with Apple ’s track record on the Mac Mini , it may never be updated after this .
This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again , or it ’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we ’ll all be hoarding them in a few years .
We ca n’t know yet .
But today , this is a great update , a wonderful all - arounder for lots of potential needs , and just a fantastic little computer .

Why it ’s hard to read the time on Infograph October 9 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/10/09/infograph-legibility
Quick , what time is it ?
If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch ’s new default Infograph face , you ’re not alone : John Gruber finds it “ far too busy ”
Jason Snell finds it “ pretty and packed with features ” , but misses hour numerals
Zac
Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility
David Smith wrote his own complications (! ) to improve contrast I ’ve configured mine acceptably , but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance :
Infograph , Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues :
The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands , often making the hands hard to locate .
This is avoidable with customization , although the defaults should be much more conservative .
It takes too much cognitive effort ( and therefore time ) to distinguish the current hour .
This is simply a flawed design .
It ’s faster and easier to read analog time with the 1 – 12 numerals displayed on a watch , but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines , dots , or other shapes as hour markers instead .
( Watch people call these “ indices ” . )
And it ’s absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles .
Here are some classics and modern takes : 1 Across a wide variety of brands , styles , and price points , a few key design principles are clear :
The hour markers for 12 ( and often 3/6/9 ) are more prominent .
The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings .
The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices .
These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated ( and minimize the chance of an off - by - one error ) , first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker , then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it ’s between .
Apple Watch ’s analog faces all fail to achieve these principles :
2
Color , Simple , Explorer Color , Simple , and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers , but Explorer ’s are a bit too far from its hour hand .
None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation .
While Explorer omits minute markings altogether , Simple bafflingly uses 30 - second markings in place of its minute track , making time - telling even harder .
I ’ve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings .
Activity Analog , Utility , and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog ’s hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand , and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands ’ contrast against the dial as they progress .
Utility ( when configured without numbers ) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices , but they ’re still too small and too far from its hour hand , and there ’s no differentiation for the 12 index .
Infograph is similar , but even worse : its hour indices are more faint , it uses 30 - second markings instead of minute markings , and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices .
( At least you can tell which way is up . )
Even with almost no complications , the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility .
When it ’s being used as Apple seems to intend , time - telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication , at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it ’s an analog face .
It ’s great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces , but most of them are short - lived novelties at best .
We ’re three years and four generations into the Apple Watch , and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of “ good ” faces .
If you want digital time with a good deal of complications , Modular is your only good choice ( or Infograph Modular on the Series 4 ) .3
If you want analog time with numerals , Utility is the only good option .
If you want indices instead of numerals — probably the most popular analog watch style in the world — I do n’t think there is a good option .
By now , we ’ve seen Apple ’s design range that they ’re willing to ship as Watch faces , and while it seems broad at first glance , it ’s actually pretty narrow .
And we ’re restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes , because other developers are n’t allowed to make custom Watch faces .
The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology .
It ’s a computer .
It can display anything .
With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back , any watch - face design from anyone could plausibly be built , enabling a range of creativity , style , and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own .
But they wo n’t let us .
In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming , they ’re instead being eroded , as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces .
Open this door , Apple .

Overcast 5 : Watch , Siri , search , and redesign !
September 17 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/09/17/overcast5
I apologize for the low battery level .
Busy day .
It all started with the watchOS volume widget .
You see , Overcast ’s previous Apple Watch app really sucked .
I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1 –4 , but I could n’t give people what they really wanted : Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone .
I briefly offered it through some bad hacks , but had to remove it .
Volume control on the Watch , which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods .
That ’s why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June , when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps .
After a very busy summer , standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast , and it ’s actually good this time !
It ’s not perfect : No cellular .
Apple has n’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS , and the bad ways would n’t be very useful .
Apple has n’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS , and the bad ways would n’t be very useful .
Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow .
Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time , but when ( and how quickly ) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life .
Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail .
Programmers like me can’t accept that something is just slow , so I ’ve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant .
Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they ’re asleep !
Auto - Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance .
1
You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode ( ≡+ ) , but in my testing , I never needed to .
Just pick up your Watch and go , and it ’ll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing , all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers .
The Overcast 5.0.1 update , due out in a few days , makes Watch transfers even more reliable .
( Sorry .
Found a better way after 5.0 was approved . )
And Watch - crown volume control !
Finally , the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch is n’t to delete it , letting the Now Playing app show up instead .
That ’s where the other half of my summer workload began .
The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization : just the color of the circle .
I could n’t make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast ’s thin - line aesthetic .
But that iOS 7 - era thin - line aesthetic looked dated , and I ’d wanted a design refresh for a while .
I decided to start modernizing the app ’s design , screen by screen .
I could n’t do it all in one summer , so I started with the screen that needed the most help : Now Playing .
The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4 .
The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area , a scrollable set of “ pages ” that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left , and the episode notes offscreen to the right .
Nobody ever found them .
I ’ve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and could n’t find them again , or saying how they ’d really like my app more if it offered speed controls .
The only indication in the interface was three “ page dots ” below the scrollable area , but that was n’t enough .
The new design maintains the same scrollable pages , but now as obvious , tactile cards .
In my testing , everyone figured these out immediately .
Put differently , it ’s like you ’re navigating this through a phone - shaped window in the middle :
This design is not only more discoverable , but it allows me to fit more controls on screen , and in more reachable areas .
Unlike the previous design , I can also fit the same controls on all devices , from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro.
Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that ’s nice , clean , and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult .
I think I ’ve finally found a good balance .
I ’ve given chapters ( when present ) their own card with durations and inline progress bars .
I ’ve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet , give it a proper UI for fast input , and show the remaining time in more useful ways :
There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well .
Some of the highlights : Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen , or go into a podcast ’s screen to search its entire archive .
your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen , or go into a podcast ’s screen to search its entire archive .
Refreshed the podcast screen a little .
( More to come . )
a little .
( More to come . )
Siri Shortcuts support , of course .
Plus smaller fixes and improvements : CarPlay performance is much better , especially for people with large collections .
Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency ( daily , weekly , etc. ) if it can be inferred .
Tap - to - load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once .
Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements .
Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5 , and as always , it ’s free .
Update your devices , then go get Overcast !

Low Power Mode on the Mac July 31 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode
Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets .
But sometimes you lose that lottery , as I did on my latest 8 - hour daytime flight .
Apple ’s “ Up to 10 hours ” claim does n’t apply to my work , 1 which is usually a mix of Xcode , web browsing , and social time - wasting , so I knew I ’d have to seriously conserve power .
Sometimes , you just need Low Power Mode : the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it , at the expense of full performance and background tasks .
There ’s no such feature on Mac laptops , but there should be .
It could : Disable the discrete GPU on 15 - inch models unless required for hardware reasons 2
Pause Photos syncing and analysis
Pause Spotlight indexing
Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups
Do n’t download or install software updates
Do n’t download new content in iTunes
Auto - dim the screen after a shorter time
Let third - party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work
And the big one : Reduce the processor ’s maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015 , I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third , but also boosted battery life by almost as much .
Since then , I ’ve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I ’m running on battery power , and it has been wonderful : I made it through that 8 - hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off .
Over the last few days , I ’ve run battery tests on my 2018 13 - inch MacBook Pro with the ( awesome ) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15 - inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta , which can disable Turbo Boost and / or set wattage limits on the CPU .
My test was based on the “ Heavy ” script from last time , but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast ’s current codebase ( which is larger and includes some Swift ) .
Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red : 15 - inch 2015 MacBook Pro ( 2.2 GHz quad - core i7 ) Battery life Geekbench single / multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963 / 13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06 +42 % 2796 / 9917 − 29 / 28 % 63.4s +44 % 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro ( 2.7 GHz quad - core i7 ) Battery life Geekbench single / multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412 / 18983 34.3s 28 W 3:28 +10 % 5401 / 16326 −0 / 14 % 37.4s +9 % 18 W 4:05 +29 % 5248 / 14133 −3 / 26 % 43.5s +27 % 12W 4:44 +50 % 4818 / 11835 −11 / 38 % 48.2s +41 % No Turbo 5:05 +61 % 3624 / 13324 −33 / 30 % 48.9s +43 % 6 W 6:24 +103 % 4065 / 7596 − 25 / 60 % 76.1s + 121 %
It ’s impressive how much faster this new 13 - inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements .
Dropping the wattage to 6W , the thermal limit of the fanless 12 - inch MacBook , interestingly ( but not surprisingly ) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12 - inch MacBook in Geekbench .
This is an extreme option , but one I ’d occasionally take if offered .
It roughly doubles compilation times , but also doubles the battery life .
This ratio holds for most other configurations : the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy - workload performance .
That ’s a trade - off I ’d gladly make when I need to maximize runtime .
The best bang - for - the - buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost .
Single - threaded performance hurts more than with wattage - limiting , but it ’s able to maintain better multi- threaded performance and more consistent thermals , and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss .
And Volta , which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling , requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension , which I really do n’t recommend .
Turbo Boost Switcher , which does n’t offer wattage control , works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling .
For now , I ’m going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life , and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need .
But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes , which would ultimately achieve even greater gains .

Overcast 4.2 : The privacy update April 27 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42
Overcast 4.2 is out now .
It enhances privacy in two major areas : Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014 .
They ’re fully functional , but they lack email addresses or passwords , so they ca n’t log into the website .
A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade , or from other devices you own .
Previously , the login screen pushed email logins .
But with four years of perspective , feedback , and usage data , I now think that ’s the wrong move .
Only a single - digit percentage of customers use the website , and the iCloud token - sync method solves cross - device logins for almost everyone .
Your personal data is n’t my business — it ’s a liability .
I want as little as possible .
I do n’t even log IP addresses anymore .
If I do n’t need your email address , I really do n’t want it .
68 % of Overcast accounts have email addresses today .
To reduce that as much as possible , I ’ve made major changes to account handling :
The previous login screen ( left ) and the new one .
In Overcast 4.2 , the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default .
If you already have an account in iCloud , it ’ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it .
And the first time you launch 4.2 , people with email - based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts :
The migration prompt that shows on the first run .
Finally , you can now change your account between email - based and anonymous whenever you want .
Blocking ad - tracking images
In most podcast apps , podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background .
The only data sent to a podcast ’s publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app ’s name .
The IP address lets them derive your approximate region , but not much else .
They do n’t know exactly who you are , whether you listened , when you listened , how far you listened , or whether you skipped certain parts .
Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that .
I ’m not .
Big data ruined the web , and I ’m not going to help bring it to podcasts .
Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions — they do n’t need more data from my customers .
Podcasting has thrived , grown , and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade .
We already have all the data we need .
One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible “ tracking pixels ” in each episode ’s HTML show notes .
When displayed in most apps , the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server , which can then record and track more information about you .
In Overcast 4.2 , much like Mail ( and for the same reason ) , remote images do n’t load by default .
A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from , and you can decide whether to load it or not .
I believe I ’ve done this in the most secure way possible —
I ’m actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy — and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto - loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes .
Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes , and two big ones :
Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork .
Password - protected episodes are now supported on password - protected feeds .
Get it now in the App Store !

Overcast 4.1 now available March 13 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/03/13/overcast41
Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features .
Smart Resume is actually two features :
It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation .
It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible .
Both are subtle but noticeable benefits ( my favorite kind ) , especially when you ’re being interrupted a lot , such as while following turn - by - turn navigation directions .
Smart Resume is on by default , and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details .
Delete episodes 24 hours after completion : Before , episodes could either be auto - deleted immediately upon completion , or not at all .
There ’s now a third option , auto - deleting 24 hours after completion , which will soon be the default for new accounts .
The 24 - hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync , so it wo n’t auto - delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period , such as a long flight .
Auto - deletion , either immediate or after 24 hours , also no longer applies to Premium subscribers ’
Uploads .
Password - protected podcasts :
Some private podcast feeds , including many paid and members - only podcasts , require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth .
You can now add these in the Add URL screen .
Password - protected podcasts , and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the < itunes : block > tag , do not show up in search or recommendations .
Noteworthy bug fixes : Resuming playback after quitting in the background , especially on very long podcasts and / or when using AirPods , no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations .
Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls , requiring pausing and playing again .
Downloads now fail less often .
Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally .
Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator .
1
Extremely large playlists now only show the most / least - recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts .
There ’s also one removal : rotation support on iPhone .
( The iPad app still rotates . )
iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default , and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time , so very few people have ever used it .
Meanwhile , it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain , especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape .
i Phone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage , and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features .
I apologize to the few people who did use it , and I hope this is n’t too disruptive for you .
The rest is all good news .
Go get Overcast now !
In the next update , I ’ll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4 : the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen .
Expect the return of an ancient user - interface tool known as “ buttons ” .

WatchKit is a sweet solution that will only ever give us baby apps February 26 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/02/26/watchkit-baby-apps
In the original 2007 iPhone introduction , Steve Jobs famously derided other smartphones at the time for running “ baby ” software and the “ baby ” internet .
He was right .
Developers were n’t given access to make native apps until the iPhone ’s second year .
Before the native development kit was ready , Apple tried to pass off web apps as a “ sweet solution ” for third - party apps , but nobody was fooled .
Apple was n’t using web apps for their own built - in iPhone apps — they were using native code and frameworks to make real apps .
1
Developers like me did our best with web apps , but they sucked .
We simply could n’t make great apps without access to the real frameworks .
Apps were terrible , and did n’t take off , until we had access to the same native tools that Apple used .
* * * Developing Apple Watch apps is extremely frustrating and limited for one big reason : unlike on iOS , Apple does n’t give app developers access to the same watchOS frameworks that they use on Apple Watch .
Instead , we ’re only allowed to use WatchKit , a baby UI framework that would ’ve seemed rudimentary to developers even in the 1990s .
But unlike the iPhone ’s web apps , Watch Kit does n’t appear to be a stopgap — it seems to be Apple ’s long - term solution to third - party app development on the Apple Watch .
The separation of Apple ’s internally - used frameworks from WatchKit has two huge problems : Apple does n’t feel Watch Kit ’s limitations .
Since they ’re not using it , it ’s too easy for Apple ’s developers and evangelists to forget or never know what ’s possible , what is n’t , what ’s easy , and what ’s hard .
The bugs and limitations I report to them are usually met with shock and surprise — they have no idea .

The bugs and limitations I report to them are usually met with shock and surprise — they have no idea .
WatchKit is buggy as hell .
Since Apple does n’t use it and there are relatively few third - party Watch apps of value , WatchKit is far more buggy , and seems far less tested , than any other Apple API I ’ve ever worked with .
2
Apple will never have a very good idea of where WatchKit needs to improve if they ’re not using it .
But this sweet solution is the only choice anyone else has to make Apple Watch apps .
Watch Kit only lets us create “ baby ” apps .
That ’s all it will ever let us create .
WatchKit needs to be discontinued and replaced .
No focus on quality or expansion of WatchKit will fix this .
There are only two ways to meaningfully improve Watch apps , spur third - party innovation , and unlock the true potential of the Apple Watch .
One solution is for Apple to reimplement all of its own Watch apps with WatchKit instead of their internal frameworks , which will force them to fix Watch Kit ’s many bugs and dramatically expand it .
The much better solution , and the one I hope they take , is for Apple to expose its real watchOS UI and media frameworks to third - party developers , as it has done on iOS .
* * * I also made this argument in podcast form in Under The Radar 114 .

Defending your app from copies and clones February 22 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/02/22/your-app-was-copied
App developers sometimes ask me what they should do when their features , designs , or entire apps are copied by competitors .
Legally , there ’s not a lot you can do about it : Copyright protects your icon , images , other creative resources , and source code .
You automatically have copyright protection , but it ’s easy to evade with minor variations .

App stores do n’t enforce it easily unless resources have been copied exactly .

Only assholes get patents .
They can be a huge PR mistake , and they ’re a fool ’s errand : even if you get one ( $ 20,000 + later ) , you ca n’t afford to use it against any adversary big enough to matter .
Do n’t be an asshole or a fool .
Do n’t get software patents .
If someone literally copied your assets or got too close to your trademarked name , you need to file takedowns or legal complaints , but that ’s rarely done by anyone big enough to matter .
If a competitor just adds a feature or design similar to one of yours , you usually ca n’t do anything .
You can publicly call out a copy , but you wo n’t come out of it looking good :
If they ’re more successful than you , it ’s envy and sour grapes .
If they ’re less successful than you , it ’s jealousy and punching down ( and giving them attention ! ) .
The public may have a very different opinion on whether you ’re really being copied from , whether you were really the first to do it , or whether you deserve to “ own ” it .
These disputes are best kept private , or not fought at all .
Nobody else will care as much as you do .
Nobody cares who was first , and nobody cares who copied who .
The public wo n’t defend you .
The instant someone else has the same feature or design as you , the public and press see it as a collective checkbox feature , or a “ standard ” or “ obvious ” design , that apps in this category just have .
It ’s no longer yours .
You can try to “ educate ” the public , but you ’ll lose .
This feels unfair when it happens to you , but it ’s just how it goes , and the entire ecosystem benefits .
Every app — even yours — includes countless “ standard ” and “ obvious ” features and designs that , at one time , were n’t .
Everything is a remix .
A great design or feature can give you a competitive advantage for a little while , but it ’s always temporary .
Compete on marketing , quality , and what you can do next , not the assumption that nobody can copy what you made .
Setting the roadmap for competitors is a satisfying accomplishment , but only a personal one .
You know you ’ve done it .
That has to be enough .

The end of the conference era January 17 , 2018 ∞https://marco.org/2018/01/17/end-of-conference-era
Chris Adamson notes a significant contraction in iOS and related conferences recently ( via Michael Tsai ) .
Having attended ( and sometimes spoken at ) many of these conferences over the years , I ca n’t deny the feeling I ’ve had in the last couple of years that the era of the small Apple - ish developer - ish conference is mostly or entirely behind us .
I do n’t think that ’s a bad thing .
This style of conference had a great run , but it always had major and inherent limitations , challenges , and inefficiencies : Cost :
With flights , lodging , and the ticket adding up to thousands of dollars per conference , most people are priced out .
The vast majority of attendees ’ money is n’t even going to the conference organizers or speakers — it ’s going to venues , hotels , and airlines .

Format : Preparing formal talks with slide decks is a massively inefficient use of the speakers ’ time compared to other modern methods of communicating ideas , and sitting there listening to blocks of talks for long stretches while you ’re trying to stay awake after lunch is a pretty inefficient way to hear ideas .
It ’s getting increasingly difficult for organizers to sell tickets , in part because it ’s hard to get big - name speakers without the budget to pay them much ( which would significantly drive up ticket costs , which exacerbates other problems ) , but also because conferences now have much bigger competition in connecting people to their colleagues or audiences .
There ’s no single factor that has made it so difficult , but the explosion of podcasts and YouTube over the last few years must have contributed significantly .
Podcasts are a vastly more time - efficient way for people to communicate ideas than writing conference talks , and people who prefer crafting their message as a produced piece or with multimedia can do the same thing ( and more ) on YouTube .
Both are much easier and more versatile for people to consume than conference talks , and they can reach and benefit far more people .
Ten years ago , you had to go to conferences to hear most prominent people in our industry speak in their own voice , or to get more content than an occasional blog post .
Today , anyone who could headline a conference probably has a podcast or YouTube channel with hours of their thoughts and ideas available to anyone , anywhere in the world , anytime , for free .
But all of that media can’t really replace the socializing , networking , and simply fun that happened as part of ( or sometimes despite ) the conference formula .
I do n’t know how to fix conferences , but the first place I ’d start on that whiteboard is by getting rid of all of the talks , then trying to find different ways to bring people together — and far more of them than before .
Or maybe we ’ve already solved these problems with social networks , Slack groups , podcasts , and YouTube , and we just have n’t fully realized it yet .

Fixing the MacBook Pro November 24 , 2017 ∞https://marco.org/2017/11/24/fixing-the-macbook-pro
Despite my love for the previous Retina MacBook Pro , I wo n’t be able to use it forever .
The best laptop to ever exist should be in the future , not the past .
There ’s a lot to like about the new MacBook Pros , but they need some changes to be truly great and up to Apple ’s standards .
Here ’s what I ’m hoping to see in the next MacBook Pro that I believe is technically possible , reasonable , widely agreeable , and likely for Apple to actually do , in descending order of importance : Magic Keyboard Butterfly keyswitches are a design failure that should be abandoned .
They ’ve been controversial , fatally unreliable , and expensive to repair since their introduction on the first 12 ” MacBook in early 2015 .
Their flaws were evident immediately , yet Apple brought them to the entire MacBook Pro lineup in late 2016 .
After three significant revisions , Apple ’s butterfly keyswitches remain as controversial and unreliable as ever .
At best , they ’re a compromise acceptable only on the ultra - thin 12 ” MacBook , and only if nothing else fits .
They have no place in Apple ’s mainstream or pro computers .
The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches .
If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro , it should be this .
It ’s far more important than anything else on this list .
Fans of the butterfly keyboard ’s feel need not worry — this does n’t mean we need the old MacBook Pro keyboard , exactly .
The Magic Keyboard ’s scissor switches feel similar , but with a bit more travel , and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations .
They ’re a much better , more reliable , and more repairable balance of thinness and typing feel likely to appeal to far more people — even those who like the butterfly keyboards .
The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro : returning to the “ inverted - T ” arrow - key arrangement by making the left - and right - arrow keys half - height again .
This arrangement is much more natural and less error - prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “ T ” shape , a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row .
Great first - party USB-C hubs The MacBook Pro bet heavily on the USB- C ecosystem , but it has n’t developed enough on its own .
When people ca n’t get what they need from Apple at all , or at a remotely competitive price , they ’ll go to cheap third - party products , which are often unreliable or cause other problems .
When these critical accessories are n’t flawless , it reflects poorly on Apple , as it harms the overall real - world experience of using these computers .
If a third - party hub or dongle is flaky , the owner does n’t blame it — they blame their expensive new Apple computer for needing it .
Apple needs to step up with its own solid offerings to offer more ports for people who need them .
Apple ’s most full - featured USB- C accessory is downright punitive in its unnecessary minimalism : one USB- C passthrough , one USB - A ( a.k.a. regular / old USB ) , and an HDMI port that does n’t even do 4 K at 60 Hz — all for the shameless price of $ 80 .
Instead of giving us the least that we might possibly need , this type of product should give us the most that can fit within reasonable size , cost , and bandwidth constraints .
I ’d like to see at least two USB - C ports , at least two USB - A ports , and HDMI that can do 4K60 .
An SD - card reader would be a nice bonus .
To make it easier to go all - USB - C on our peripherals and cables , I ’d also like to see a true USB - C hub : one USB - C in and at least three USB - C out , with power passthrough on one .
And just as we learned that the need for pro displays should n’t be outsourced to LG , Apple should stop outsourcing critical adapters and hubs to Belkin .
They ’re not as good as Apple ’s , and they never will be .
More ports USB- C is great , but being limited to 2 or 4 total ports ( including power ) simply is n’t enough .
Even if you adopt the USB-C ecosystem , these MacBook Pros are more limited than their predecessors : The 13 ” MacBook Air can connect to power , two USB devices , Thunderbolt , and an SD card simultaneously .
Its replacement , the 13 ” MacBook “ Escape ” ( without Touch Bar ) , can only connect to two total devices on battery , or one when powered .
The 2015 13 ” and 15 ” MacBook Pros can connect to power , two USB devices , two Thunderbolt devices , HDMI output , and an SD card simultaneously .
Their replacements can only connect to four devices on battery , or three when powered .
If there ’s not enough Thunderbolt or PCIe bandwidth to have more USB - C ports , that ’s fine — not every port needs to be USB-C with Thunderbolt .
All of that cost and bandwidth is unnecessary for most common real - world uses of laptop ports ( power in , charging iPhones , external keyboards , etc. ) .
Dongles should be the exception , not the norm , in real - world use — most owners should need zero .
But HDMI and USB - A are still far too widely used to have been removed completely , and neither are likely to fade away anytime soon regardless of how Apple configures their laptops .
Re-adding HDMI and at least one USB - A port would reduce or eliminate many people ’s dongle needs , which I bet would dramatically improve their satisfaction .
Finally , Apple should give serious consideration to bringing back the SD - card slot .
SD cards are more widely used than ever in photography , video , audio , and other specialized equipment , and they provide excellent options for fast , reliable storage expansion and data transfer .
And they ’re going to be around for a while —
Wi -Fi and cables do n’t or ca n’t replace most current uses in practice .
Back away from the Touch Bar Sorry , it ’s a flop .
It was a solid try at something new , but it did n’t work out .
There ’s no shame in that —
Apple should just recognize this , learn from it , and move on .
The Touch Bar should either be discontinued or made optional for all MacBook Pro sizes and configurations .
Touch ID is the only part of the Touch Bar worth saving , but the future is clearly Face ID .
If we ca n’t have that yet , the ideal setup is Touch ID without the Touch Bar .
We ’d retain the Secure Enclave ’s protection for the camera and microphones , and hopefully get the iMac Pro ’s boot protection , too .
Nicer charger USB-C PD charging and replaceable charging cables are great advances that should be kept .
USB -C PD is the reason I did n’t include battery life in this list — occasional needs for extended battery life can be achieved with inexpensive USB -C PD batteries .
But Apple could make their chargers and cables so much nicer — and they only need to look to their own recent past .
I ’d like to see them bring back the charging LED on the end of the cable , and the cable - management arms on the brick .
These were n’t superfluous — they served important , useful functions , and their removal made real - world usability worse for small , unnecessary gains .
MagSafe would be nice , but I do n’t think it ’s essential .
MagSafe 2 was n’t universally loved because it detached with too little vertical pressure when used on laps , couches , or beds , but maybe it could be moved to a splitting module along the cable , a few inches from the laptop end , like the original Xbox ’s controller cables ?
The move to a detachable , “ standard ” USB - C cable does n’t preclude any of this .
It ’s already a specialized , dedicated power - only cable in practice ( high - wattage USB PD support , but no Thunderbolt , and limited to USB 2.0 speeds ) .
Third - party cables could still work —
Apple ’s could just be nicer .
Keeping what ’s great
There ’s a lot about the current MacBook Pro that ’s great — fast internals , quieter fans , Touch ID , P3 screens , Thunderbolt 3 , USB-C PD charging , and space gray , to name a few .
We should n’t have to choose between what ’s better about the previous generation — connectivity , reliability , and versatility — and what ’s great about this one .

The best laptop ever made November 14 , 2017 ∞https://marco.org/2017/11/14/best-laptop-ever
Apple has made many great laptops , but the 15 - inch Retina MacBook Pro ( 2012 –2015 ) is the epitome of usefulness , elegance , practicality , and power for an overall package that still has n’t been ( and may never be ) surpassed .
Introduced in 2012 , less than a year after Steve Jobs died , I see it as the peak of Jobs ’ vision for the Mac .
It was the debut of high - DPI Macs , starting down the long road ( which we still have n’t finished ) to an all - Retina lineup .
And with all - SSD storage , quad - core i7 processors , and a healthy amount of RAM all standard , every configuration was fast , capable , and pleasant to use .
At its introduction , it was criticized only for ditching the optical drive and Ethernet port , but these were defensible , well - timed removals : neither could ’ve even come close to physically fitting in the new design , very few MacBook Pro users were still using either on a regular basis , and almost none of us needed to buy external optical drives or Ethernet adapters to fit the new laptop into our lives .
In exchange for those removals , we got substantial reductions in thickness and weight , and a huge new battery .
There were no other downsides .
Everything else about this machine was an upgrade : thinner , lighter , faster , better battery life , quieter fans , better speakers , better microphones , a second Thunderbolt port , and a convenient new HDMI port .
The MagSafe 2 power adapter breaks away safely if it ’s tripped over , and the LED on the connector quickly , clearly , and silently indicates whether it ’s charging and when the battery is fully charged .
The pair of Thunderbolt ( later Thunderbolt 2 ) ports gave us high - end , high - speed connectivity when we needed it , and the pair of standard USB 3 ports — one on each side — let us connect or charge our world of standard USB devices .
The headphone jack was thoughtfully located on the left side , because nearly all headphones run their cables down from the left earcup .
( External - mouse users also appreciate this frequently - used cable not intruding in their right - side mousing area . )
The keyboard was completely unremarkable , in the best possible way .
The crowd - pleasing design was neither fanatically loved nor widely despised .
It quietly and reliably did its job , as all great tools should , and nobody ever really had to think about it .
The trackpad struck a great balance between size and usability .
It provided ample room for multitouch gestures , but without being too large or close to the keyboard , so people ’s fingers would n’t inadvertently brush against it while typing .
Not every owner needed the SD - card slot or HDMI port , but both were provided for times when we might .
This greatly increased the versatility and convenience of this MacBook Pro , as many pro customers use A/V gear that records to SD cards or occasionally need to plug into a TV or projector .
The SD - card slot could also serve as inexpensive storage expansion .
The power adapter ’s built - in cable management keeps bags tidy .
And if you need a longer cable , the extension comes in the box at no additional charge .
Versatile USB - A ports allow travelers to standardize on just one type of charging cable that can charge their iPhones and iPads from the laptop itself , multi- port wall or car chargers , portable batteries , airplanes , many outlets , and nearly all other chargers likely to be found in the world around them .
The 2015 revision brought the modern Force Touch trackpad and used the space savings to increase the battery to 99.5
Wh , just under the 100 Wh carry - on limit for most commercial airlines .
When paired with the integrated - only GPU base configuration , this offered an unparalleled option for great battery life without giving up the large Retina screen .
And I like the backlit Apple logo on the lid .
Maybe I ’m old - fashioned , or maybe I just miss Steve , but it — along with the MagSafe LED and the startup chime — reminds me of a time when Mac designs celebrated personality , humanity , and whimsy .
* * * I recently returned to the 2015 15 - inch MacBook Pro after a year away .
Apple still sells this model , brand new , just limited to the integrated - only GPU option ( which I prefer as a non - gamer for its battery , heat , and longevity advantages ) , but I got mine lightly used for over $ 1000 less .
I thought it would feel like a downgrade , or like going back in time .
I feared that it would feel thick , heavy , and cumbersome .
I expected it to just look impossibly old .
It did n’t .
It feels as delightful as when I first got one in 2012 .
It ’s fast , capable , and reliable .
It gracefully does what I need it to do .
It ’s barely heavier or thicker , and I got to remove so many accessories from my travel bag that I think I ’m actually coming out ahead .
It feels like a professional tool , made by people who love and need computers , at the top of their game .
It ’s designed for us , rather than asking us to adapt ourselves to it .
It helps us perform our work , rather than adding to our workload .
This is the peak .
This is the best laptop that has ever existed .
I hope it ’s not the best laptop that will ever exist .

The story is about a battle against the odds , and some may argue that the chances of its making a good movie are slimmer still , but Sylvester Stallone is getting ready to clamber back in the ring for a fifth Rocky sequel , nearly 30 years after the first film , and 15 since the poorly received Rocky V .
Long - rumoured as a possible project , Production Weekly reports that Stallone , now 59 , has confirmed plans to direct and star in Rocky VI , with shooting due to begin in Los Angeles in December .
This time the story will open with Rocky Balboa in the middle of a lonely retirement .
In an effort to cheer himself up and keep his hand in , he embarks on a few low - key bouts but becomes a media sensation when he 's approached to go head to head with reigning heavyweight champ Mason " The Line " Dixon .
Reports have not so far indicated whether Stallone has written the screenplay himself , but since he did so with the first five films of the franchise this seems likely .
The original Rocky won the 1976 Oscar for best film and saw Stallone nominated for best actor .
Keith had some very choice words about Rumsfeld 's " fascism " comments tonight .
Watch it , save it and share it .
Download - WMV Download - QT
Olbermann delivered this commentary with fire and passion while highlighting how Rumsfeld 's comments echoes other times in our world 's history when anyone who questioned the administration was coined as a traitor , unpatriotic , communist or any other colorful term .
Luckily we pulled out of those times and we will pull out of these times .
Remember - Rumsfeld did not just call the Democrats out yesterday , he called out a majority of this country .
This was n't only a partisan attack , but more so an attack against the majority of Americans .
The transcript of Keith 's comments tonight is available below the fold .
The man who sees absolutes , where all other men see nuances and
shades of meaning , is either a prophet , or a quack .
Donald H. Rumsfeld is not a prophet .
We end the countdown where we began , our # 1 story .
with a special comment on
Mr. Rumsfeld 's remarkable speech to the American Legion
yesterday .
It demands the deep analysis - and the sober contemplation - of every
American .
For it did not merely serve to impugn the morality or
intelligence - indeed , the loyalty - of the majority of Americans who
oppose the transient occupants of the highest offices in the land ;
Worse , still , it credits those same transient occupants - our
employees - with a total omniscience ; a total omniscience which neither
common sense , nor this administration 's track record at home or abroad ,
suggests they deserve .
Dissent and disagreement with government is the life 's blood of
human freedom ;
And not merely because it is the first roadblock against the
kind of tyranny the men Mr. Rumsfeld likes to think of as " his " troops still
fight , this very evening , in Iraq .
It is also essential .
Because just every once in awhile ... it
is right - and the power to which it speaks , is wrong .
In a small irony , however , Mr. Rumsfeld 's speechwriter was
adroit in invoking the memory of the appeasement of the Nazis .
For , in their time , there was another government faced with true
peril - with a growing evil - powerful and remorseless .
That government , like Mr. Rumsfeld 's , had a monopoly on all the
facts .
It , too , had the secret information .
It alone had the true
picture of the threat .
It too dismissed and insulted its critics in
terms like Mr. Rumsfeld 's - questioning their intellect and their
morality .
That government was England 's , in the 1930's .
It knew Hitler posed no true threat to Europe , let alone to
England .
It knew Germany was not re-arming , in violation of all
treaties and accords .
It knew that the hard evidence it had received , which
contradicted it's own policies , it 's own conclusions - it's own omniscience - needed to be
dismissed .
The English government of Neville Chamberlain already knew
the truth .
Most relevant of all - it " knew " that its staunchest critics
needed to be marginalized and isolated .
In fact , it portrayed the foremost
of them as a blood - thirsty war - monger who was , if not truly senile - at
best morally or intellectually confused .
That critic 's name ... was Winston Churchill .
Sadly , we have no Winston Churchills evident among us this
evening .
We have only Donald Rumsfelds , demonizing disagreement , the way
Neville Chamberlain demonized Winston Churchill .
History - and 163 million pounds of Luftwaffe bombs over England
- had taught us that all Mr. Chamberlain had was his certainty - and his own
confusion .
A confusion that suggested that the office can not only make the
man , but that the office can also make the facts .
Thus did Mr. Rumsfeld make an apt historical analogy
excepting the fact that he has the battery plugged in backwards .
His government , absolute and exclusive in its knowledge , is not the
modern version of the one which stood up to the Nazis .
It is the modern
version of the government ... of Neville Chamberlain .
But back to today 's Omniscient Ones .
That about which Mr. Rumsfeld is confused is simply this :
This is a Democracy .
Still .
Sometimes just barely .
And as such ,
all voices count - not just his .
Had he or his president perhaps
proven any of their prior claims of omniscience - about Osama Bin
Laden 's plans five years ago - about Saddam Hussein 's weapons four years ago
- about Hurricane Katrina 's impact one year ago - we all might be able to
swallow hard , and accept their omniscience as a bearable , even useful
recipe , of fact , plus ego .
But , to date , this government has proved little besides its own
arrogance , and its own hubris .
Mr. Rumsfeld is also personally confused , morally or
intellectually , about his own standing in this matter .
From Iraq to
Katrina , to flu vaccine shortages , to the entire " Fog of Fear " which continues to envelope this
nation - he , Mr. Bush , Mr. Cheney , and their cronies , have - inadvertently
or intentionally - profited and benefited , both personally , and politically .
And yet he can stand up in public , and question the morality and
the intellect of those of us who dare ask just for the receipt for the
Emporer 's New Clothes .
In what country was Mr. Rumsfeld raised ?
As a child , of whose heroism did he read ?
On what side of the battle for freedom did he dream one day
to fight ?
With what country has he confused ... the United States of
America ?
--
The confusion we - as its citizens - must now address , is
stark and forbidding .
But variations of it have faced our forefathers , when
men like Nixon and McCarthy and Curtis LeMay have darkened our skies and
obscured our flag .
Note - with hope in your heart - that those earlier
Americans always found their way to the light and we can too .
The confusion is about whether this Secretary of Defense , and
this Administration , are in fact now accomplishing what they claim the
terrorists seek :
The destruction of our freedoms , the very ones for
which the same veterans Mr. Rumsfeld addressed yesterday in Salt Lake City ,
so valiantly fought .
--
And about Mr. Rumsfeld 's other main assertion , that this country
faces a " new type of fascism . "
As he was correct to remind us how a government that knew
everything could get everything wrong , so too was he right when he
said that - though probably not in the way he thought he meant it .
This country faces a new type of fascism - indeed .
--
Although I presumptuously use his sign - off each night , in feeble
tribute ...
I have utterly no claim to the words of the exemplary journalist
Edward R. Murrow .
But never in the trial of a thousand years of writing could
come close to matching how he phrased a warning to an earlier generation of
us , at a time when other politicians thought they ( and they alone ) knew
everything , and branded those who disagreed , " confused " or " immoral . "
Thus forgive me for reading Murrow in full :
" We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty , " he said , in 1954 .
" We must remember always that accusation is not proof , and that conviction
depends upon evidence and due process of law .
We will not walk in fear - one , of another .
We will not be
driven by fear into an age of un-reason , if we dig deep in our history
and our doctrine , and remember that we are not descended from fearful men ;
Not from men who feared to write , to speak , to associate , and to
defend causes that were - for the moment - unpopular . "
And so , good night , and good luck .
Raw acquires NSA wiretap talking points
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 13 , 2006
The National Security Agency has taken the unusual move of sending members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee a list of " approved talking points " regarding its warrantless eavesdropping program , RAW STORY has learned .
Some of the talking points urge Senators to imply that they have personal knowledge of plots foiled by the wiretap program , or that the Senators -- seven of whom responded by writing the NSA a letter blasting the move -- had other personal knowledge that the program was legal or necessary .
" I have personally met the dedicated men and women of the NSA , " one point reads .
" The country owes them an enormous debt of gratitude for their superb efforts to keep us all secure . "
" It has detected plots , " reads another , " that could have resulted in death or injury to Americans both at home and abroad . "
No examples are given in the document .
The Senate voted earlier today to reject Democratic attempts to limit the use of the controversial wiretaps .
The document , as acquired by RAW STORY , follows :

I worked with Lee on a substantive piece of content ( specifically , an ebook ) as part of an awareness campaign to promote the Marketing Profs B2B Forum .
To say that the experience was a pleasure does n't begin to capture the efficiency and level of professionalism Lee and the TopRank team brought to the job .
I was blown away by the awesomeness of it , as it delivered both substance AND style AND ( best of all ! ) results .

The figure appeared in Disneyland over the weekend
Enlarge Image
The hooded figure was placed inside the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride at the California theme park last weekend .
It is understood to have remained in place for 90 minutes before the ride was closed down and the figure removed .
A spokeswoman for Banksy said the stunt was intended to highlight the plight of terror suspects at the controversial detention centre in Cuba .
Banksy is notorious for his secretive and subversive stunts - such as sneaking doctored versions of classic paintings into major art galleries .
In 2005 , he embarrassed the British Museum by planting a hoax cave painting of a man pushing a supermarket trolley , which he said went unnoticed for three days .
Last week , he smuggled 500 " alternative " versions of Paris Hilton 's album into record shops around the UK .
Topless fake cover
The artist replaced Hilton 's songs with his own remixes , which were given titles such as Why am I Famous ? , What Have I Done ? and What Am I For ?
He also changed the artwork to show the US socialite topless and with a dog's head .
Banksy doctored the artwork on 500 Paris Hilton CDs
The Bristolian is most famous for his graffiti artworks , which are often created in prominent public places .
Last year , he produced nine stencil sprays on the Palestinian side of the West Bank barrier .
The satirical images showed images of life on the other side of the barrier .
One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach , while another showed a mountain landscape .
Earlier this summer , a piece of Banksy 's graffiti art on a Bristol building was allowed to remain in place by the city council after the public voiced overwhelming support .
The stencilled image , which showed a naked man hanging onto a window ledge , won a 97 % approval rating from residents on an internet discussion forum .
Banksy is due to hold what is billed as a " three day vandalised warehouse extravaganza " in Los Angeles this weekend .
Dear Cecil : Has anyone vanished in the Bermuda Triangle lately ?
There were many reports of mysterious incidents back in the 70s , but since then the whole subject has simply dropped out of sight ( grin ) .
Is the mystery any closer to being solved ?
I 'm thinking of sending my in - laws on a permanent vacation .
K.T. , Saint Louis , Missouri
Cecil replies :
Better stick to cyanide or blunt instruments , K . The lethality of the Bermuda Triangle has been greatly exaggerated .
The only reason I bring up the subject at all is to bestow some belated publicity on a fine example of the debunker ’s art .
More on this in a moment .
In case anybody ’s forgotten , the Bermuda Triangle is a region in the Atlantic Ocean where scores of ships and planes allegedly have vanished — usually without a trace , in good weather , without sending distress calls .
Two typical cases :
In December 1945 , five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale on a routine training mission .
After reporting that their compasses were acting up and everything looked “ strange , ” the five lost contact with their base and were never seen again .
Another plane sent out to look for them vanished as well .
No wreckage from any of the planes was ever found .
On December 28 , 1948 , a DC - 3 carrying 36 persons disappeared while en route from San Juan , Puerto Rico , to Miami .
In their last radio message around 4 AM the plane ’s crew reported they were only 50 miles south of Miami and within sight of the city ’s lights .
The plane was never heard from again .
A massive search turned up no wreckage , despite the shallowness of the waters south of Miami .
These and many other incidents were blamed on everything from UFOs to electromagnetic fluctuations in the space - time continuum .
Fortunately a few level - headed folk also looked into the matter .
Among them was Lawrence David Kusche , who wrote a book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery — Solved in 1975 .
In an analysis of some 50 cases , Kusche found that overeager BT buffs had been playing fast and loose with the facts .
In many cases the disappearances had taken place in bad weather , involving craft known to have been experiencing trouble .
Wreckage was found in many instances .
In others , darkness or delay in starting the search provided ample time for debris to disperse .
Many of the cases had n’t even taken place in the Bermuda Triangle , but rather in other sites near Ireland , in the Gulf of Mexico , off the coast of Africa or South America , or in one case , in the Pacific Ocean .
Here ’s what Kusche found out about the cases cited above :
The five Navy planes were piloted by four student pilots and one instructor .
The instructor ’s compasses failed and he became disoriented , thinking he was over the Florida Keys when he was really near the Bahamas .
Radio interference from ground stations hindered efforts to help him .
After flying aimlessly for several hours , the planes ran out of gas and were presumably ditched in the ocean shortly after nightfall .
By this time the seas were extremely rough .
Darkness , delay , and equipment failures hampered search efforts .
One of the planes sent up to search for the missing flight apparently blew up in mid-air ; the explosion was spotted by a nearby ship .
The destroyed plane was of a type that often reeked of fuel fumes and was widely considered dangerous .
While in San Juan the crew of the DC - 3 found the plane ’s batteries were dead but decided to take off without adequately recharging them .
Because of the lack of power , the radio was operational only intermittently .
An investigating panel speculated that additional electrical problems might have rendered the plane ’s navigation equipment inoperable .
The crew never said they were within sight of Miami — these reports were the work of Triangle buffs who jumped to conclusions .
The waters 50 miles due south of Miami are shallow , but those 50 miles along the flight path to San Juan ( i.e. , southeast ) are approximately 5,000 feet deep .
In short , both disappearances could be plausibly explained without reference to UFOs or mysterious vortexes or any other paranormal phenomenon .
The same could be said for almost all the other cases Kusche looked into .
Conclusion : the Bermuda Triangle “ mystery ” is a figment of a lot of overactive imaginations .
About what you ’d expect .

The first time that Aaron Robinson saw a horrible hack prefaced with a light - hearted apology ( or , a " hackpology " ) , he was understanding .
C'mon , I do n't think there is any one among us has n't had to patch up a ugly bug with an equally bad kludge .
The second and third time Aaron saw a hackpology , he was still understanding .
C'mon , we all have had a bad streak of luck here and there .
By the eleventh hackpology , Aaron realized that the original developer of the system should have just added " I 'm really , really sorry " to the header of every code file .
I 'm not sure what number today 's hackpology is , but it was uncovered when Aaron thought he'd save a few hundred megabytes / day in diskspace and disable session debugging .
Whoops ...
/* This is bad .
Reaaly bad .
It 's a really , really bad hack .
If you 're an employee of * Intertrode Communication , then I 'm really , really sorry that you have to maintain * this .

The RSPB said the crows could be attacking because they are mating
The birds initially attacked cars by pulling off windscreen wipers and scratching the paintwork .
But now they have moved on to attacking the residents themselves , similar to scenes in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller The Birds .
The RSPB said it was unusual for crows to attack humans and it could be because they are mating and nesting .
Linda Pheasey , who lives in Milton Avenue where the crows congregate , said : " These crows started coming last summer and they have become more and more aggressive in the way they are attacking cars .
It simply might be that they are being more aggressive at this time of year
Colin Wilkinson , RSPB
" And now , like I said , they have attempted to attack a lady and she was pretty frightened by it . "
Colin Wilkinson , conservation officer with the RSPB , said : " It is most unusual for these birds to do this .
" Attacking cars occurs from time to time but graduating to attacking humans is more rare .
" It is hard to explain except if it is an instinctive reaction to someone who is close to what they regard as their territory . "
' More aggressive '
He said it was the time of year that crows would be pairing up , building nests and laying eggs .
" It simply might be that they are being more aggressive at this time of year , that is the most likely explanation , " Mr Wilkinson .
Bird attacks are more common in coastal towns where gulls that are used to being fed may swoop to snatch food from people 's hands .
Mr Wilkinson said residents could protect themselves by wearing hats and any waste food lying around should also be cleared away .
Spare me Al Gore and George Bush on Earth Day .
The topic is much too important for either junk science or simple answers .
And please no more hysterical articles about the glaciers retreating .
Where my house is in Vermont was under a mile of ice around 12,000 years ago .
Last Ice Age ( 12,000 years ago )
With a few notable reversals , the glaciers have been retreating ever since ; get over it .
Through most of its history , the earth has not had polar ice caps .
Global warming is NOT new and it does predate the BushAdministration ( pronounced as one word , please ) .
Global warming wo n’t be solved by the Kyoto treaty even if the US joined it and the joinees observed it .
But global warming may be accelerated by burning fossil fuels .
On the other hand , we could go into a deep freeze .
Worst of all , climate change – real change , not just a gradual creep – could easily happen in our lifetimes .
Or not !
It ’s all about nonlinear change .
Scientists used to assume that change happened at a pretty steady pace .
Evolution .
Geography .
Climate .
All stately change over long periods of time .
Not !
Does n’t happen that way unless you ’re far enough away not to see the messy details .
Continents drift but they do so in lurches called earthquakes .
Evolution ( probably ) happens as sudden punctures of an equilibrium .
And the climate lurches violently .
In fact , climate is just weather writ large and , not surprisingly , is just as chaotic .
According to Abrupt Climate Change : Inevitable Surprises published by The National Academies Press and available free online : “ Recent scientific evidence shows that major and widespread climate changes have occurred with startling speed .
For example , roughly half the north Atlantic warming since the last ice age was achieved in only a decade , and it was accompanied by significant climatic changes across most of the globe .
Similar events , including local warmings as large as 16°C , occurred repeatedly during the slide into and climb out of the last ice age . ”
They ’re referring to a very short period at the end of the Younger Dryas event ( a pause in the most recent deglaciation ) .
“ The most spectacular aspect of the YD is that it ended extremely abruptly ( around 11,600 years ago ) , and although the date cannot be known exactly , it is estimated from the annually - banded Greenland ice - core that the annual - mean temperature increased by as much as 10 °C in 10 years , ” according to The Earth Institute at Columbia University whose site also contains the chart below .
Now notice something else .
After this abrupt event , climate change has been relatively smooth .
And it is during this relatively and atypically calm 12,000 years that we humans have built our civilization .
No wonder we think that climate change is gradual .
Apparently , climate is now changing more quickly than it has in many thousands if not millions of years .
The evidence for this is good although not indisputable because we do n’t yet have the means to make exact comparisons between antique evidence of climate change and what we ’re seeing today .
Certainly the warming trend that has been going on for the last fifteen thousand years or so is continuing if not accelerating .
( But it has been known to reverse ; ask George Washington ’s troops at Valley Forge ) .
Moreover , carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the atmosphere are at historic highs ( as far as we know ) .
Concentrations of these “ greenhouse ” gasses are associated with warming periods .
What is less clear is how much they are a cause and how much an effect of warming – quite possibly both which causes a feedback loop we may be in today .
For example , thawing of tundra releases greenhouse gasses which may then cause more warming and more thawing of tundra .
The melting of glaciers is also a positive feedback loop .
The more of the earth that is covered with ice , the more sunlight the earth reflects .
The more sunlight the earth reflects , the cooler it is .
Conversely , as the glaciers melt , the earth absorbs more solar radiation and gets warmer and melts more glaciers .
What we do n’t know is what causes the earth to oscillate between periods of cooling – both long and short term – and periods of warming .
We do n’t know if we ’re at the tipping point of a major change or just in a short term oscillation .
We do n’t know if human release of hydrocarbons can cause a tipping point .
We do know that it was n’t necessary to have humans around burning things to cause the last abrupt changes – it may be just our ego that makes us think that we ’re the cause this time .
But we could be !
Chaos theory and the math of nonlinear change ( and fractals ) tells us that the cause of momentous change does n’t have to be very large at all .
If a butterfly ’s wing flapped in China can cause a hurricane in Georgia , a bunch of brand new cars in India could cause global warming – or a new ice age .
Or nothing .
Unfortunately , the civilizations we built during a period of relative climate stability are highly dependent on both current climate and current ocean levels – would be surprising if it were otherwise .
So any change is likely to be overall for the worse – although a little rain in the desert would n’t hurt .
If change were as gradual as we are used to , we could probably accommodate it ( peacefully might be another question ) .
If climate change is abrupt as it might be , we ’re in a hell of a mess !
This post is already too long so a subsequent one will explore what we might do given that we do n’t know whether the pace of global warming since the last ice - age is going to continue accelerating , whether we ’re affecting it or not , whether we CAN affect it , and whether we ’re in for more heat , more cold , or no more change at all .
What we ca n’t afford to do is make policy based on hysterical observations that the glaciers are continuing their fifteen - thousand year retreat OR a complacent assumption that things will stay the way humans have always seen them .
It could be the most spirited interspecies escape since The Rescuers .
But unlike the 1977 Disney movie , this situation is anything but fun .
Photographed Friday in the northern Indian city of Lucknow , a mouse perches on a frog in waist - deep ( for a frog , anyway ) floodwaters — a small sign of the early arrival of annual summer monsoon rains .
So far , more than 30 people have died in India as a result of this year 's monsoon - driven landslides and floods .
Last year 's deluge killed some 1,000 people in the financial center of Mumbai ( Bombay ) alone .
Today polluted , knee - deep waters are raising fears of a repeat disaster among the city 's roughly 17 million inhabitants .
In drought - stricken areas , too , frogs were playing the role of rescuer .
According to the Indo - Asian News Service , some rural Indians are holding frog weddings in the hopes that the amphibians ' bliss will inspire farm - saving storms .
After marking the bride and groom with vermillion and turmeric — traditional adornments in human Hindu nuptials — villagers take the supposedly happy couple to a nearby pond to honeymoon .

Oct. 19 , 2006  --
The so - called " hole " in the earth 's protective ozone layer is at a new record -- 10.6 million square miles of sky around the South Pole -- even though most nations agreed back in 1987 to phase out the chemicals that cause it .
The number was reported today by U.S. government scientists , who said protecting the ozone layer was still clearly the right thing to do , but that it 's taking longer than originally expected for the ozone layer to heal .
A 10.6 million mile gap in it is about the size of North America .
" It 's going to be like this for the next decade , " said Paul A. Newman , a senior research scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " And then it will start tipping over , and decreasing , and be gone around 2070 . "
That 's a delay of 15 - 20 years .
Early computer models had shown the ozone layer would be back to normal around 2050 .
Ozone Layer Vital to Life
Ozone molecules , which form in the upper atmosphere and waft around approximately 12 - 20 miles above the Earth 's surface , protect us from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the Sun .
If ozone is destroyed , scientists say there would be multiple effects -- increased rates of skin cancer and cataracts ; and death of tiny plankton in the oceans , which form the base of the world 's food chain in many cases .
Scientists gave the world a shock in the 1970s and 1980s .
They realized that commonly - used chemicals -- the CFCs and halons used in everything from air conditioners to fire extinguishers to spray cans -- were escaping into the stratosphere .
Through complex reactions , they were eating away at the amount of ozone there .
What was more , they found that in the early spring in the southern hemisphere -- September and October -- a giant ozone " hole " formed in the swirling air currents over Antarctica , and often spread over South America , Australia and New Zealand .
The response was a 1987 treaty called the Montreal Protocol , calling for the phase - out of CFCs and other chemicals .
The treaty has been hailed as a model of international cooperation ; to date , 189 countries have signed it .
New Measurements from Orbit
But new readings , provided by the Ozone Measuring Instrument aboard NASA 's earth - observing Aura satellite , show what scientists suspected -- that even if CFCs are no longer made , molecules of the gases survive in the upper atmosphere for 40 to 100 years .
So the ozone hole has appeared again , bigger than ever .
" These numbers mean the ozone is virtually gone in this layer of the atmosphere , " said David Hofmann , director of the Global Monitoring Division at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory , in a statement .
" The depleted layer has an unusual vertical extent this year , so it appears that the 2006 ozone hole will go down as a record - setter . "
Does that mean the Montreal treaty has been a failure ?
Hardly , say the scientists who have worked on the issue -- if nothing had been done , the ozone loss would be much greater .
But they say people need to recognize how complex the chemistry of the atmosphere is , and be patient .
" It 's very clear what happened over Antarctica , and why it happened , " said NASA 's Newman .
" There 's absolutely no question at all about the causes of the ozone hole . "
Hey , it ’s getting late here .
Finishing up this newsletter is my current task to knock my own Laundry List down to size .
So let ’s wind up with a cool little Bidniz Lesson that -- cue up the theme music -- is both astonishingly simple , yet complex .
Here it is : People are wacky .
That ’s it .
That ’s the lesson .
People are wacky .
You may not have noticed before .
This simple realization , however , has profound repercussions for your business life .
You know the old joke about the firefighter jumping into the freezing river to save a kid who fell in ?
He ’s sitting back on the shore afterwards , shivering inside a blanket , when the mother of the child walks up .
She asks him , “ Are you the fireman who jumped into the icy river , grabbed little Seymour , and brought him back ? ”
“ Yes , ma’am , I am . ”
“ Well , ” she continues , looking pissed off .
“ Where are his mittens ? ”
Now , that ’s a funny joke ... but it illustrates a much deeper lesson about human behavior .
For example ... is there any question in your mind that this scene could have actually happened ?
Of course it could have .
Because people are wacky .
If you go through life -- and especially if you go through your business life -- not understanding this fact , you will hemorrhage time , money and energy .
Look -- people , basically , are your stock and trade , no matter what your business is .
And in most markets , the 80/20 rule is in effect : 80 % of your problems will be caused by 20 % of your customers ... who are either insane , criminally stupid , or time wasters .
( This is just an estimation , of course .
In my line , it ’s more like 90 % of the problems are caused by 10 % of the customers . )
The actual percentages are unimportant .
What is important is the realization that the root of your discontent may be much more centralized than you think .
The damage may be more extensive than you can chart , too .
I advise marketers to NEVER look at any of the “ white mail ” that comes in – which includes all refunds , complaints and dumb meanderings .
Any incoming correspondence that does n’t contain an order .
Most of these marketersignore my advice -- and often waste hours responding to a refund or complaint .
I try to have Diane , my assistant , intercept as much of the time - wasting stuff as possible ... but some sneaks through .
And it is ALWAYS tempting to get deeply involved .
Last month , some bozo wanted a refund on something ... and send a long letter explaining what he felt was wrong with my material .
He claimed he was a 20 - year veteran of advertising , knew it all ( he did n’t ) , considered my teachings too “ under - stimulating ” for him , yada yada yada .
There was no purpose served by me reading that letter ... and , worse , as a result of reading it , I was in a bit of a lather for the rest of the day .
Time wasters get you twice -- the time you spend reading their drivel is wasted , and the time you spend stewing about it is wasted , too .
You are n’t writing new ads , you are n’t finding new customers , you are n’t performing Operation Moneysuck .
Instead , you ’re thinking up clever retorts , or ( worse ) actually writing a reply letter .
The advice I give myself and clients : Just let it go .
If anyone is causing you grief , or cheating you , sic the attorneys on him and let them do their job .
Do n’t waste a second threatening anyone , or cajoling anyone , or begging anyone to do the right thing .
They wo n’t .
Time wasters LOVE it when you get involved with them .
That ’s how they win -- they engage you in a vicious little dance where nothing gets done , but they get to see your bile rise .
Your flustered rage is a turn - on to them .
You win by denying them that dance .
Gary Halbert , long ago , showed me a truly nasty and effective way to deal with a client who showed themselves to be a time waster .
It ’s brilliant , and super - effective .
Here ’s the set - up :
We had written a killer ad for this guy .
Any savvy marketer would have mailed it right away and started making money with it .
Not this guy .
No .
He wanted to talk on the phone , endlessly discussing details and dreams and irrelevant ideas .
Questioning everything , and acting onnothing .
He insisted we “ owed ” him this treat ( he loved to talk on the phone and avoid letting the curtain rise on any project ) because he had paid our fee .
So Gary sent him his money back .
“ We ’re not going to work with you , ” he said , simply .
“ Here ’s your fee back .
Do n’t call again . ”
The guy was floored .
This had never happened to him before .
He assumed he held a “ power ” over us by paying that fee , and he felt entitled to waste our time .
Entitled .
He had obviously done this before .
Imagine what a poor plumber has to endure with this freak -- who feels entitled to just talk and talk , and actually prevent anything useful happening .
I dunno -- maybe there are plumbers out there who do n’t care if a guy wants to pay their fee and never let anything get done .
That ’s not the way I work .
When I write an ad , I know that ’s only half the game .
The rest is in the mailing or publishing of that ad , gathering sales , and counting the money .
I do n’t wanna discuss it .
I wanna mail it .
Anyway , it was not only deeply satisfying to pull the rug out from under this jerk -- who could not believe we were actually shutting him down -- but it was also very profitable .
How so ?
Easy .
By shuttling this guy out of our lives , we opened up a spot for someone else .
Someone who knew the game , and would n’t sit on a killer ad .
So keep track of the time you spend dealing with your customers after the sale .
If anyone ’s name is constantly showing up ... or if you get even a single long , rambling letter trying to get your dander up ... or if your staff has multiple conversations that include someone ’s name and the word “ trouble ” too often in the same sentence ... think seriously about jettisoning that person from your life .
Even if you have to send his money back .
Consider it money well spent .
Time wasters eat up profit and your will to live .
Screw ‘em .
You have better things to do .

Dealing with Difficult People : How to Deal with Nasty Customers , Demanding Bosses and Annoying Co-workers
Programmers under the age of thirty probably do n’t realize why Aged Senile Programmers like me are so slow to adopt exciting new programming languages the day they come out , and why we roll our eyes at hip bandwagon ideas that sell books and consulting engagements ( forgive me if I do n’t seem excited enough about your new book , “ Extreme UML Refactoring Patterns ” ) .
It ’s probably because we read No Silver Bullet , a stunningly important essay from way back in 1986 , by Frederick P. Brooks ( he of Mythical Man-Month ) that has proven again and again to be spot-on .
Programming consists of overcoming two things : accidental difficulties , things which are difficult because you happen to be using inadequate programming tools , and things which are actually difficult , which no programming tool or language is going to solve .
An example of an accidental difficulty is manual memory management , e.g. “ malloc ” and “ free , ” or the singleton classes people create in Java because they do n’t have top level functions .
An example of something which is actually difficult is dealing with the subtle interactions between different parts of a program , for example , figuring out all the implications of a new feature that you just added .
Improvements in programming languages can eliminate accidental difficulties , but after you ’ve done that , you ’re left with the actual complexity of software development , so the No Silver Bullet theory basically warns us to expect diminishing returns from new technologies .
I ’m not really doing justice to Brooks ’ argument , so if you have n’t read No Silver Bullet recently , I would highly recommend it .
There have been about five great advances , since the 1950s , in eliminating accidental difficulties in programming .
These are , very broadly :
Assemblers Algebraic languages ( including Fortran ) Structured languages ( Algol - 60 and C ) Declarative languages ( including SQL ) Memory - managed languages ( including Lisp , VB , and Java )
So the question is , what ’s number 6 ?
Bruce Tate ’s book Beyond Java tries to address that , and does a good job of explaining why so many experienced Java programmers are getting fed up with that language and moving to Python and Ruby .
On page 56 and page 57 , Steve Yegge , who did n’t actually write the book , but plays an important walk - on role , bangs out the list .
These are actually the most important two pages of the book , because these are the things that Python and Ruby ( and , underappreciated , JavaScript ) actually solve .
Although Stevey lists lots of accidental difficulties in Java , when you read the book , you will notice a theme , which seems to be that it ’s explicit typing , where the programmer is asked to declare the type of things , that leads to most of the problems .
For example , the inability to express data in Java code is mostly just a side effect of the requirement that types be declared explicitly .
Yes , there are other problems in Java , but this is The Big Hairy Problem right at the heart .
To a historian , it ’s starting to look like type declarations are one of those accidental difficulties that good programming languages can eliminate .
Beyond Java is a good summary of the arguments and worth reading .
Deported man was actually U.S. citizen ALBANY , N.Y .
( AP )  Duarnis Perez became an American citizen when he was 15 , but he did n't find out until after he had been deported and then jailed for trying to get back into the country .
He was facing his second deportation hearing when he learned he was already a U.S. citizen .
Still , federal prosecutors fought to keep him in custody .
Last week , a federal judge scolded prosecutors for the mistake .
" In effect , the government is arguing that an innocent man who was wrongly convicted should not be released from the custody of the United States , " U.S. District Judge Lawrence Kahn wrote .
He ruled that Perez never should have been deported .
The case has gotten the attention of immigration observers , who call it a striking example of the gaps in an overworked immigration system .
Perez became a citizen when his mother was naturalized in 1988 but apparently was n't aware of it .
His lawyer , J. Jeffrey Weisenfeld of New York , declined to release details other than to say that Perez , now in his early 30s , remains in the United States .
" He would like to get on with his life quietly , " Weisenfeld said .
" It was an unpleasant experience for him . "
Perez was deported to the Dominican Republic in 1994 after a drug conviction .
In 2000 , he was caught trying to re-enter the United States from Canada .
But he was n't informed he was a citizen until the spring of 2004 , after serving three - and - a - half years in prison for that 2000 arrest .
It was not clear why Perez 's status was n't discovered when he first faced deportation .
Messages left over three days seeking comment on the case from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Washington were not returned .
In early 2005 , Perez filed a lawsuit to vacate the illegal re-entry conviction .
He also has sued the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice , claiming they had no right to imprison him , and against the Legal Aid Society in Albany , which represented him on the illegal re-entry charge .
Immigration watchers wonder if he can sue for being deported in the first place .
" Beyond legality , it 's just an issue of common sense and humanity , ' " said Daniel Kowalski , a Texas attorney who publishes Bender 's Immigration Bulletin , a publication that tracks immigration issues .
U.S. immigration courts handled 368,848 matters in 2005 , a 23 % increase over the 299,474 cases addressed in 2004 , according to U.S. Department of Justice 's Executive Office for Immigration Review .
A spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the government has no practical way to inform people of their citizenship in such cases because of the complexities involved .
" The responsibility rests fully on the shoulders of the new citizen , so the questions of the citizenship of children are adequately addressed , " said Chris Bentley .
" Many times , we honestly wo n't know about it . "
Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Lord , who prosecuted Perez , declined comment when asked if the government would appeal .
In a brief , she argued Perez was at fault for not knowing his status , saying he " cannot base his failure to discover the circumstances on the alleged omissions of others . "
Estelle McKee with the University of Wisconsin Law School said the responsibility is shared .
" The immigration service has to prove someone is removable .
It 's their job , " she said .
" It 's remarkable to go through an entire removal process and not know the person is a citizen . "

" The [ only thing ] I heard about it was , she had that cancer , " David Lacks says .
" They called me , said come up there because she died .
They asked me to let them take samples , and I decided not to let them do it . "
But the researchers told Lacks they could use his wife 's cells to study cancer .
Something that might strike his family again someday .
Their studies might someday help his children and his grandchildren .
Lacks was skeptical .
But , he thought , if they want to see how my wife 's cancer might affect our children , and get ready to treat them if they get sick , I guess that might be okay .
" My cousins said it would n't hurt , so eventually I let them do it .
The [ doctors said ] it was the fastest growing cancer they 'd ever known , and they were supposed to tell me about it , to let me know , but I never did hear . "
He did n't hear , that is , until a hazy day in 1975 , 24 years after Henrietta 's death , when his daughter - in - law went to a friend 's house for dinner .
In a two - story brown - brick townhouse in Baltimore , five doors down from her home , Barbara Lacks , the wife of Henrietta 's eldest son , Lawrence , sat down for dinner at her friend Jasmine 's house .
The two women had been friends for years , but Barbara had never met Jasmine 's sister or brother - in - law , who came all the way from D.C. for dinner .
They gathered around the mahogany table , surrounded by plants and soft light , and Jackson , Jasmine 's brother - in - law , looked across the table at Barbara .
" You know , " he said , " your name sounds so familiar . "
Jackson was a scientist who spent his days in a Washington laboratory .
" I think I know what it is .
. . I 've been working with some cells in my lab ; they 're from a woman called Henrietta Lacks .
Are you related ? "
" That 's my mother - in - law , " Barbara whispered , shaking her head .
" She 's been dead almost 25 years , what do you mean you 're working with her cells ? "
Jackson explained .
The cells , he told her , had been alive since Henrietta 's death and were all around the world .
Actually , by that time , they were standard reference cells -- few molecular scientists had n't worked with them .
Barbara excused herself , thanking him , promising she would be in touch , and ran home to tell her husband what she 'd heard .
Your mother 's cells , she told him , they 're alive .
Lawrence called his father who called his brothers and his sister .
They just could n't understand .
" The question I really had , " says Barbara , " the question I kept asking Jackson was , I wonder why they never mentioned anything to the family .
They knew how to contact us . "
But , since no one had called in the two decades after Henrietta 's death , instead of continuing to wonder , the Lacks family got on the phone and rang Hopkins themselves .
And they did it at an opportune time .
Henrietta 's cells , it turned out , had grown out of control .
Some scientists thought her relatives were the only people who could help .
Henrietta 's cells were , and still are , some of the strongest cells known to science -- they reproduce an entire generation every 24 hours .
" If allowed to grow uninhibited , " Howard Jones and his Hopkins colleagues said in 1971 , " [ HeLa cells ] would have taken over the world by this time . "
This strength provided a research workhorse to irradiate , poison , and manipulate without inflicting harm ; but it also meant research labs were only big enough for one culture : HeLa .
Though it took three decades for the Geys to succeed with their efforts to create a human cell line , after their success with HeLa , culturing cells became suspiciously easy .
Researchers cultivated tissue samples from their own bodies and the bodies of their families and patients .
Most grew successfully .
Sure , the samples struggled during the first few weeks , or even months , in culture , but then , suddenly , they flourished .
Samples blossomed into full - blown healthy cell lines with the strength of , well , the HeLa cell .
In 1974 , a researcher by the name of Walter Nelson - Rees started what everyone called a nasty rumor : HeLa cells , he claimed , had infiltrated the world 's stock of cell cultures .
No one wanted to believe him .
For almost three decades researchers had done complex experiments on what they thought were breast cells , prostate cells , or placental cells , and suddenly , rumor had it they 'd been working with HeLa cells all along .
To believe this would be to believe that years of work and millions of dollars had , in essence , been wasted .
The truth was , Henrietta 's cells had traveled through the air , on hands , or the tips of pipettes , overpowering any cell cultures they encountered .
And researchers had no idea .
There was no way to know which cells were growing in the petri dish .
And there was no universally accepted test for a cell culture 's identity .
To accept or reject the theory that HeLa cells had taken over , researchers wanted more evidence .
This required detailed information about the cells ' source .
But they knew only the barest facts about Henrietta :
She was black , she was a woman , and she was dead .
Though it may have been coincidence , soon after the Lacks children called Hopkins asking about their mother 's cells , letters appeared in their mailboxes .
Several Hopkins researchers wondered , the letters said , if the Lacks family would be willing to donate some blood and tissue samples .
Soon , a nurse circled Barbara Lacks 's narrow dining room table with needles , blood tubes , and slides , gathering samples from the Lackses .
From these donations , researchers would find precious bits of information about Henrietta -- like her blood type -- that they could use in their attempts to study her cells .
" [ It was ] an elegant piece of work , " Nelson - Rees told a reporter , " by simple Aristotelian class logic and pure applied genetics , you could speculate , to a remarkable extent , as to what Henrietta Lacks 's [ genetic makeup ] was . "
And this is exactly what the researchers did .
But if you ask the family , you 'll get a different story .
" The doctors tested us to see what was in my mother 's system , was it hereditary , " recalls Henrietta 's son Sonny Lacks .
" But that 's all they said .
They never got in contact with us again .
We contacted them a couple a times , but they said they'd get back at us , then after a while , we just got tired of calling , so everybody just let it go and went back with their lives . "
But every now and then , they wonder if they have the gene that killed their mother .
This point of confusion between what the researchers intended to do with the samples and what the participants understood their intentions to be is only one of several elements of the Lackses ' story that points to important ethical questions .
Some have yet to find answers .
" There are at least two issues that cases like Mrs. Lacks 's raise , " says Ruth Faden , executive director of the Johns Hopkins Bioethics Institute and the Philip Franklin Wagley Professor of Biomedical Ethics .
" One is the question of consent , and the other is what , if anything , is morally or legally due to a person if something of commercial value is developed from their cells . "
In terms of informed consent , says Faden , " the Lackses ' story is a sad commentary on how the biomedical research community thought about research in the 1950s .
But it was not at all uncommon for physicians to conduct research on patients without their knowledge or consent .
That does n't make it right .
It certainly was n't right .
It was also unfortunately common . "
Since the era when Henrietta walked through the doors of Hopkins , the field of biomedical ethics was born , and with it came regulations about informed consent .
Patients now have something like a legal promise that no physician will take samples without permission .
It 's the latter issue , the commodification of human body parts , which is still an extremely unsettled area of ethics and law in public policy .
And for the Lackses , who do n't all have health insurance or the money to afford it , the issue of commercial value in this case is very unsettled .
Unsettled , but with little recourse .
Since the development of the HeLa cells , there 's been an explosion of both scientific and commercial interest in the use of human tissues for research purposes , yet research subjects generally see none of the returns .
" The amazing thing , " says Faden , " is that here we are , almost 50 years later , the capacity to develop commercial products from human tissues is dramatically greater now than it was then , and we still have n't figured out how to handle it .
. . .
In terms of public policy , we 're real clear that you can't buy and sell organs , that 's illegal .
But you can sell blood .
You can sell human eggs and sperm .
But you can't sell your kidney .
And apparently , you can't sell your cells , you give those away .
So , nothing is very clear , and there are a lot of deep worries about putting price tags on the human body . "
This is partially why the United States has recently launched a Presidential Bioethics Advisory Commission to address this and related issues .
To this day , members of the Lacks family feel they 've been passed over in the story of the HeLa cells .
They know their mother 's cells started a medical revolution and are now bought and sold around the world .
They 're pretty sure that someone , somewhere , has profited from their mother 's death .
They know that someone was n't related to Henrietta .
And their experience is not well - known .
In cases like these , Faden agrees , a good way to begin addressing this problem is through the telling of a story from which everyone can learn .
This story starts with Henrietta and the origin of the HeLa cells :
They were not from Helen Lane or Helen Larson , as many publications have mistakenly reported , they were from Henrietta Lacks , wife of David , mother of five .
Not long before his death , Walter Nelson - Rees , who devoted his career to containing the spread of HeLa cells , sat in a small chair in front of a television camera .
He leaned forward , lifted his arms , and said , " HeLa will live forever , perhaps . "
And then he paused , staring wistfully ahead .
" The dance of HeLa continues , " he said , " they 're all dancing out there somewhere ... the stage is very broad and wide , and the curtain has by no means gone down on them .
The music plays on . "
And somewhere , with freshly painted toenails and curlers in her hair , perhaps Henrietta dances with them .
RETURN TO APRIL 2000 TABLE OF CONTENTS .
Long argument lists are a pain .
Using them can be a test of memory or an exercise in guess work .
In recent years , attention has increasingly been paid to the usability of user interfaces , exploring how users actually use — or work around — user interfaces in practice , tracking how long certain tasks take or how many errors are made in completing a task .
Similar considerations should apply to programmatic interfaces .
For example , to create a window using the Win32 API , the CreateWindow function takes 11 arguments .
Using this argument list is made that little bit more interesting because , in terms of underlying types , any one of the arguments can be called with a zero value .
Calls to such functions are often either cryptic or verbose .
Position is significant and you have to remember what position has what meaning , so if you just write the call on one or two lines , and the arguments are n't suitably descriptive , you are left with something that is less than obvious .
Which integer is which ?
Which handle is which ?
Which string is which ?
Sometimes , however , in attempting to deal with the problem , the resulting call is a less than compact ceremonial roll - call : each argument is passed on its own line , accompanied with a descriptive comment — 11 arguments take up 11 lines .
Tools can to some extent alleviate the call - site problem : context - sensitive help can offer you a hint when you are typing out the argument list .
The quality of such feedback , however , can vary greatly with the development environment and the called library in question .
There is still a problem in that after the act of initially writing the call and being away from the tool , such as browsing the code in a lightweight editor or just as plain text , you are still left with the underlying problem unsolved .
Just flicking quickly through some Java should not require me to fire up Eclipse .
The question of readability is also not always obvious to the author defining — as opposed to calling — the argument list .
In one example I came across , a method received five Boolean arguments that enabled or disabled various options .
The author of the method would n't have noticed anything amiss as , in the body of the method , the role of each argument was quite clear from its name .
At the point of call , however , you were typically left with a meaningless jumble of true and false literals — an example of code being written in , well , code .
The JTree.convertValueToText method is a comparable example from a published API .
One practical solution to the problem of multiple arguments with distinct meanings but the same declared type is to introduce meaningfully distinct types .
In this case distinct enum types would make the call far more self - documenting and allow the compiler to catch any muddling of argument order .
In the general case , using a distinct whole value , as opposed to a plain fundamental type , carries a lot more meaning and checkability .
There is also a methodological observation to make here : had the author of the method actually used the code , such as in a test case , the usability issue would probably have come to light sooner .
But if there is one thing that is more problematic with long argument lists than using them , it is maintaining their definition .
Alan Perlis 's epigram captures the problem succinctly :
" If you have a procedure with 10 parameters , you probably missed some " .
CreateWindowEx , which takes 12 arguments , inadvertently demonstrates the point .
What it adds to CreateWindow is the ability to use extended window styles .
It also demonstrates how constrained your choices are when you have a published interface in a statically typed language that does not support overloading .
Adding an additional function with a different name is about the only thing you can do .
If the distribution of your interface is more restricted and you can access all the points of use , you can potentially retain the name and add the argument ( s ) , updating all the existing calls in the process .
This is not without problems , and there is certainly an element of shotgun maintenance with each interface modification leading to changes scattered across the code base .
In addition to the question of usability , one of the issues we are dealing with here is that of interface stability in the face of change .
If the language supports overloading you have more options available to you .
Extended or modified argument lists can be accommodated by adding a new operation with the same name as the original but with an alternative argument lists .
This ensures that the name and intent are stable , even if the detail of the argument list is not .
The same mechanism can also improve the usability of the interface .
One of the most common problems with long argument lists is that , for common case uses , many of the values passed in are default values of some kind .
Overloading allows the common case to be captured more directly , without having to contrive unmemorable names for different functions .
It is , however , possible to get carried away with this ability and create a different problem .
The API can become overloaded ( in the classic sense of the term ) and the programmer is bombarded with many operations that are identically named but subtly different .
Another tack is to address the core problem : reduce the number of arguments in the list .
Remembering that one aspect of what we are dealing with is a question of stability — or , to be precise , a problem of volatility in search of a stable solution — we can think in terms of argument lists and cohesion .
There are many criteria for cohesion , including common usage and stability , which can be used to guide how arguments are bundled together into coarser - grained parameter objects ( also known as arguments objects ) .
Some groupings are obvious from the perspective of domain modelling : three integers representing year , month and day combine to give a date type ; four integers representing the x and y position of a corner plus width and height combine to give a rectangle type ; an upper and a lower bound combine to give a range ; and so on .
Other combinations are not necessarily as obvious , such as combining multiple Boolean arguments into an options object fitted out with methods for enabling and disabling each option specifically or , in its simplest form , a bitset with each option corresponding to a particular bit .
Likewise , information required pervasively across an application or by plug-ins can be captured in one or more context objects rather than through global variables , which are commonly disguised as Singletons .
In terms of stability , consider an interface at the root of a class hierarchy that is declared to have a method that could potentially have many arguments .
What is the effect of revisiting the decision to use , say , four arguments to add a fifth ?
This change will obviously touch the interface , but it will also break any code that depends on the interface , whether for usage or for implementation .
This kind of ripple effect through a whole class hierarchy and its dependents is more like a tidal wave .
Anyone overriding the method is affected , as is anyone calling it .
In many cases a far simpler and more stable solution is to identify the grouping of certain arguments as more stable than the individual choice of arguments themselves .
Any additions to such a parameter object leave the declared form of the method untouched and both clients and implementers unaffected .
Long argument lists are a pain for both callers and maintainers .
What qualifies as long depends very much on how distinct the arguments are and how obvious their grouping appears — in some cases this can be as low as three or four arguments , but it is normally safe to assume that by the time you 've hit 10 that is long by almost any definition !
It is possible to address many usability and stability issues through judicious use of techniques such as whole value types , overloading , and parameter objects .
Language support for variable - length argument lists , optional arguments with default values and named , non-positional arguments offers further possibilities , some of which are beneficial and some of which come with their own problems . ®

Farewell , PSM3 : Final issue on sale now By Justin Towell December 12 , 2012
But this is a personal tribute to a wonderful games magazine that is about to publish its final issue in the UK .
That magazine is PSM3 and here its last ever cover , which goes on sale in the UK today , December 12 , in retailers and on Apple 's Newsstand .
The final issue of the magazine is packed with content , including the 25 greatest PlayStation games ever ( as voted for by the PSM3 team ) , plus the 50 greatest PlayStation moments of all time .
There will also be a ten - page celebratory retrospective , including the Top 5 PSM3 covers ever , Top 10 PSM3 features ever , Top 5 regulars , Worst 5 games ever and staff profiles .
Where are all the old team now ?
It 's truly the end of an era as the last of Future 's independent single - platform games magazines closes its doors .
An era that had a profound effect on this writer .
The content below is from the site 's 2006 archived pages .
We will miss you .
And I can say that genuinely from the bottom of my heart .
I love playing games on my PlayStation and this mag kept you up to date on all that was happening .
Even now when I get home after a hectic day working with clients who need help with Salesforce development services , I will often spend the evening engaged with Titanfall 2 or Uncharted 4 , perhaps my favorite .
I can't believe its been a decade since Nathan Drake ’s introduction .
This past month I have been introducing a number of my company 's clients to the newest roll out from Salesforce called Salesforce Communities .
I work with a team who helps with the Salesforce partner community cloud consultant service .
Clients love it since it allow everyone in a company or organization to share documents , have access to analytics or workflows , and communicate with each other in one central location that is not a messy chain of emails .
My team works with the business to determine the its requirements for its Salesforce Community .
We identify the proper users and use cases , and then design the look and feel to match organization ’s branding .
I love my work , but it can get stressful dealing with different personalities , time restraints , and then any glitches that might occur .
So to come home to the rip- roaring Uncharted 4 and to get swept away in a tide of crowd - pleasing spectacle is a great change of pace .
Uncharted 4 ’s swagger sure makes it easy to succumb to the ride , its craftmanship , sense of adventure .
Now that PSM3 is no longer around , I go elsewhere to get the word on the newest Playstation releases .

The filth element
Howdy .
Andy here .
So what 's going on in the PSM3 office today then ?
Well , Nathan 's sat in the corner playing FIFA 07 , Milf 's applying his artistic skills to a picture of a big blue car , Dave 's playing Mercury Meltdown on our special PSP debug kit , I 'm sat at my desk typing a blog entry and , er , everyone else is off .
Nathan playing FIFA 07 .
Could he BE any happier ?!
So it 's a bit quiet here .
Or rather , it is now - it was n't earlier , when all that could be heard from PSM3's corner of the office was men swearing at the top of their lungs and shooting each other in the knees .
But not in real life !
Because that would be absurd .
No , I 've been playing Scarface and Reservoir Dogs .
In fact , I just finished Reservoir Dogs .
I 'd tell you what I think , but you 'll have to wait for next month 's review .
What I can tell you though is that both games are very , very sweary .
Scarface has an entire button reserved for foul - mouthed taunts and every second of play in Dogs is accompanied by someone calling someone else a " muddyfunksta " or a " coggsugga " .
But it 's brilliant .
You get extra ' balls ' for taunting someone as you shoot them to pieces in Scarface ( yes , really ) and with Reservoir Dogs being Tarantino - inspired , there just HAS to be creative , filthy jive - talk .
But we do n't condone swearing for the sake of it .
If you 're going to swear , make sure you have a good reason - like if a seagull starts chewing at your bin bags at 5 am , dragging their contents across your front steps , like what happened to me today .
Bloody seagulls .
I 'll kill the muddy - funksters !
Fuggin ' priggs !
...er , sorry .
Been playing too many gangster games .
I 'm going for a lie down .

Collared
Afternoon ,
So how were all your weekends , then ?
Here on PSM3 , work continues on the next issue .
Or as best it can , with Dan D and Rich still on holiday and now with Dan G off sick after breaking his collarbone in a shock DIY - related mishap on Sunday .
The lesson here is : always get a professional in to do your decorating .
I 'm sure he 'd appreciate any get well soon comments , though .
Anyway , what 's happening today ?
Well , first we had a team meeting to discuss a course of action following the loss of both our leader and his deputy for a week .
The list of games for review this month was drawn up , the content of Extended Play figured out and it was decided who was doing what throughout the issue .
Since then , Nathan 's been doling out freelance work to our merry band of non-staff wordhawks , Andy 's penning a review , Milf 's designing stuff and I 'm working on the Browser pages .
It 's all very exciting .
Kind of .
So there 'll just be the four of us in the office for most of this week .
Which is a bind , but these things happen .
Something to look forward to , though , for the legions of Milf - ites out there : Milf himself will be writing a blog entry later this week .
Oh , yes .
Steady at the back , now , no fainting .
And now , back to work .
Out . Dave
Friday August 18 , 2006
Your questions answered , Davey C's new hair - do and Nathan 's ( blatant self ) promotion
Hello there .
It 's Friday and it 's Nathan here , debuting on the PSM3 blog .
It 's almost exciting as Dave 's brand - new haircut , which he insists looks totally different than before .
We 're not so sure .
What do you reckon ?
So what 's been happening ?
Well as you can tell from the snapshot above Team PSM3 ( minus the holidaying Rich , Dan D AND Andy ) enjoyed a well deserved post - deadline pint followed by a curry bought for us by the good folk at Sega .
Sadly , the combination of booze and spicy food has created several noxious clouds lingering over our desks .
Grim .
On a less gassier note we 've already started piecing together the games we want to review for PSM3 issue # 80 ( out 28th September ) and we 're sure you 'll be pleased .
We always want to give you the best game reviews - as well as a packed mag full of exciting news and previews - and it's my job to secure these titles at the beginning of each issue .
And here 's that bit of ' blatant self - promotion ' as promised , I 've just promoted to Reviews Editor !
So if our review 's section is stinking worse than our curried stomachs then you know who to blame .
But enough about me .
As I type Milf is busy flicking through a copy of Ngamer , Dan G is laying the foundations of what gaming goodness will be going into issue # 80 ( remember it 's out 28th September ) and Dave is furiously fiddling with his new ' do ' in between cracking his knuckles at a horrific volume .
I 'm turning up the Go !
Team to drown out the sound .
In a fitting end to this busy week we 're going to answer the questions and queries that you 've been posting here .
Starting work on a new mag finally gives us the time to answer questions , mail stuff out and generally fill our heads with fun , ready for the next issue ) .
And also just to prove we read everything you write here and on the PSM3 MySpace .
Here we go for the questions .
Any more , or any we 've missed just tag them on the end of this blog .
James Harrison : I THOUGHT PSM3 WOULD'VE STARTED FROM ISSUE #1 RATHER THAN # 78 ?
PSM3 : We wanted to convey the fact the PSM3 is a continuation of PSM2 rather than a completely new launch .
We 're proud of what we achieved with PSM2 so we wanted it to evolve with the same team bringing you the same important Playstation information .
And besides , the likes of Tescos and WH Smiths would 've been confused with a new numbering system and stuck us behind the Dandy or up with the pornos .
Fresh Metal : DOES THE NEW PES STILL RELY ON THE NOTORIOUS " PES ASSIST " OR IS IT MORE RANDOM ?
PSM3 : We presume you 're referring to the times when it feels impossible to win a match no matter what ?
Too be honest we barely realise it's there and when it does occassionally happen we put it down to the fact it 's a game .
That 's right a computer game that has to sometimes over - compensate for your skills by throwing a spanner in the works .
It 's annoying but we 'd prefer it to remain if it means we do n't win every single game .
It 'd just get boring .
Mogwai : CAN I HAVE A JOB , PLEASE ?
PSM3 : Thanks for asking so nicely but ... no you can't .
We 've got all the players we need on PSM3 , but if you are serious about being a game 's writer then you should send us a couple of reviews ( any games ) and mail them in to psm3@futurenet.co.uk .
We 'll ( Read : Dave ) check every single one and if your stuff is good enough then we might have some work for you .
We can't promise anything , mind .
Mini Muffin : WHAT TIME DO YOU GUYS START WORK ?
PSM3 : Everyone starts at 9.30 am except Milf who slinks into the office at 9.45 .
Every .
Single .
Day .
We 're supposed to finish at 5.30 pm but when deadlines demand it , we stay until midnight sometimes .
One time Dan D , Andy , Dave and Nathan stayed until 2 am ( they started at 9 am ) just to report on the live feed coming from Sony 's PS3 reveal at E3 .
That 's 17 fully - committed sleepy - faced hours .
It 's one of the perils of being a journalist - somebody has to keep an eye on Justin Timberlake 24 hours a day just in case he cops off with a goat .
Mini Muffin : SEAN CONNERY AS ANDY ?
SURELY HE'S A BIT TOO OLD .
OR IS THAT THE ONLY SCOTTISH ACTOR YOU COULD THINK OF ?
PSM3 : Yes .
He was the only Scottish actor we could think of .
Apart from Ewan McGregor , but he 's cool and handsome and therefore totally unsuitable to play Andy .
Kindred : WHICH BIT OF THE MAG TAKES THE LONGEST ?
Amazingly it 's the proof - reading , changing , adjusting and sending the pages to the printer that takes the longest .
We can rattle off ten pages after seeing or playing a game in about an afternoon , and Milf can take a day to turn it into ten pages of magazine .
However , captioning , subbing , final checking and sending can take just as long .
And - because we want the latest news and games in there - a lot of work is done in the week before deadline ( hence the late nights ) .
Other mega time - consumers - do n't get Milf started on ' cutting out ' .
This laborious Photoshop process is what we have to do every time we have a nice game character or photo in the mag .
Milf has to trace the outline of the bloke / monster / joypad / whatever and delete the background to give us our unique look .
( The new mag is riddled with cutouts and they all take upwards of quarter of an hour each to look that good . )
AND FOR ALL YOU THEORISTS OUT THERE ...
Brian Dooley : MGS THEORY 1 - You guys keep saying that Snake 's aging is due to FOXDie . i think that this is wrong .
i believe , ever since MGS , that Snake was never injected with FOXDie as Liquid died apparently from it .even if Naomi gave Snake an altered version , Solidus would have died from it to as their all " Les Enfants terrible " .
no instead i believe that his aging is due to
1:Big Boss ' age when cloned ( Liquid said that Big Boss was in his 50's )
2:Big Boss could of had decayed genes ( was irradiated in snake eater by Davy Crokett )
i think cancer or fast gene decay are likly explinations to Snakes age .
PSM3 : We think that Snake WAS injected with Foxdie .
That 's why everyone who he met - i.e. all the people he was supposed to rescue - died in MGS1 .
Why he has n't died yet remains a mystery that should be revealed in MGS4 .
Aging due to his age when cloned ?
Great idea - we like it .
Similarly Big Boss being messed up by Davy Crockett .
Maybe a combination of the two - either way Big Boss was n't the sort of guy they should have been cloning … but they did .
Brian Dooley : Theory 2 : This one is just pure speculation , but the pic you show of the characters on p10 of psm3 , notice anything in common with 3 of them . . . . they have raised arms .
Ocelot definate bad guy , Naomi fugitive and dark horse Otacon , while the more likly good guys , Snake Raiden etc. , have lowered arms .
the poses resemble original sketches in issue64 of psm2.co-incidence , proberly caus thats what co-incidences are .
PSM3 : Raised arm bad guy theories ?
Basic body language says that if you 're being confrontational you fold your arms when speaking to someone .
So , you could be right there .
Brian Dooley : GTA4 theory - Well I think that James Worrall 's , writer of all the GTAs ' , connection with Manhunt , he also wrote that , is the backdrop for GTA4. set in Carcer City or a state containing Carcer City , Liberty City , Gta3 refers to Carcer as " nearby Carcer City " , and ' Upstate ' or Upstate could refer to Carcer .
It could be set between Gta3 , in 2001 , and Manhunt , in 2003 ,
what do you think ?
You could play as Cash a see how he got death row or something .
PSM3 : We 'd love to see Cash in GTA .
However , the most you can hope for is him being mentioned in a bit of dialogue , or perhaps a poster or newspaper referencing The Director .
Playable Cash ?
Nah… AAAAND that 's about it .
Have a great weekend .
For the record PSM3 officially backs
Pete to win Big Brother and if you see Grace * buy her a drink from us * [ last sentence modified for legal reasons ] .
Nate out .
Desky Business Good ( late ) Thursday to you .
We 've finished the mag and - in the time honoured tradition of all magazine deadlines - we 've gone to the pub .
( Expect exciting pic tomorrow ' live ' from the pub , showing that Dave has , indeed , had a haircut .
Feel free to flick ...

Late into the night ...
Evening , troops .
Dave here .

I n Japan , the matrimonial custom had survived feudal revolutions , world wars , industrialization and even the American occupation .
Up until the mid-196os , Japanese parents arranged proper marriages for their children through trusted ' intermediaries .
The ceremony was then consummated , according to Shinto law , by the bride and groom both drinking rice wine from the same wooden bowl .
This simple arrangement had persisted for more than a millennium .
There was no tradition for romance , courtship , seduction and prenuptial love in Japan ; and no tradition that required the gift of a diamond engagement ring .
Then , in 1967 , halfway around the world , a South African diamond company decided to change the Japanese courtship ritual .
It retained J. Walter Thompson , the largest advertising agency in the world , to embark on a campaign to popularize diamond engagement rings in Japan .
It was not an easy task .
Even the quartering of millions of American soldiers in Japan for a decade had not resulted in any substantial Japanese interest in giving diamonds as a token of love .
The advertising agency began its campaign by subtly suggesting that diamonds were a visible sign of modern Western values .
It created a series of color advertisements in Japanese magazines showing very beautiful women displaying their diamond rings .
The women all had Western facial features and wore European clothes .
Moreover , in most of the advertisements , the women were involved in some activity that defied Japanese traditions , such as bicycling , camping , yachting , ocean - swimming and mountain - climbing .
In the background , there usually stood a Japanese man , also attired in fashionable European clothes .
In addition , almost all of the automobiles , sporting equipment and other artifacts in the picture , were conspicuous foreign imports .
The message in these ads was clear : diamonds represent a sharp break with the Oriental past and an entry point into modern life .
The campaign was remarkably successful .
Until 1959 the importation of diamonds had not even been permitted by the postwar Japanese government .
When the campaign began in 1968 , less than 5 percent of Japanese women getting married received a diamond engagement ring .
By 1972 the proportion had risen to 27 percent .
By 1978 , half of all Japanese women who were married wore a diamond on their ring finger .
And , by 1981 , some 6o percent of Japanese brides wore diamonds .
In a mere thirteen years , the fifteen - hundred - year Japanese tradition was radically revised .
Diamonds became a staple of the Japanese marriage .
And Japan became , after the United States , the second largest market for the sale of diamond engagement rings .
It was all part of the diamond invention .
The diamond invention was an ingenious scheme for sustaining the value of diamonds in an uncertain world .
To begin with , it involved gaining control over the production of all the important diamond mines in the world .
Next , a system was devised for allocating this controlled supply of gems to a select number of diamond cutters who all agreed to abide by certain rules intended to assure that the quantity of finished diamonds available at any given time never exceeded the public 's demand for them .
Finally , a set of subtle , but effective , incentives were devised for regulating the behavior of all the people who served and ultimately profited from the system .
The invention had a wide array of diverse parts : these included a huge stockpile of uncut diamonds in a vault in London ; a billion - dollar cash hoard deposited in banks in Europe ; and private intelligence network operating out of Antwerp , Tel Aviv , Johannesburg and London ; a global network of advertising agencies , brokers and distributors ; corporate fronts in Africa for concealing massive diamond purchases ; and private treaties with nations establishing quotas for annual production .
The invention is far more than merely a monopoly for fixing diamond prices ; it is a mechanism for converting tiny crystals of carbon into universally recognized tokens of power and romance .
For it to ultimately succeed , it must endow these stones with the sort of sentiment that would inhibit the public from ever reselling them onto the market .
The illusion thus had to be inculcated into the mass mind that diamonds were forever -- " forever " in the sense that they could never be resold .
The invention itself was a relatively recent development in the history of the diamond trade .
Up until the late nineteenth century , diamonds were a genuinely rare stone .
They were found only in a few river beds in India and the jungles Brazil .
The entire world production of gem diamonds amounted to only a few pounds a year .
In 1870 , however , there was a radical change in this situation .
Huge diamond " pipes " were discovered near the Orange River in South Africa .
These were the first diamond mines ever discovered .
Now , rather than finding by chance an occasional diamond in a river , diamonds could now be scooped out of these mines by huge steam shovels .
Suddenly , the market was deluged a growing flood of diamonds .
The British financiers who had organized the South African mines quickly came to realize that their investment was endangered : diamonds had little intrinsic value , and their price depended almost entirely on their scarcity .
They feared that when new mines developed in South Africa , diamonds would become at best only a semi-precious gem .
As it turned out , financial acumen proved the mother of invention .
The major investors in the diamond mines realized that they had no alternative but to merge their interests into a single entity that would be powerful enough to control the mines ' production and , in every other way that was necessary , perpetuate the scarcity and illusion of diamonds .
The instrument that they created for this purpose was called De Beers Consolidated Mines , Ltd. , a company incorporated in South Africa .
As De Beers penetrated and took control of all aspects of the world diamond trade , it also assumed many protean forms .
In London , it operated under the innocuous name of the Diamond Trading Company .
In Israel , it was known under the all - embracing mantle of " the syndicate . "
In Antwerp , it was just called the CSO -- initials referring to the Central Selling Organization ( which was an arm of the Diamond Trading Company ) .
And in Black Africa , it disguised its South African origins under subsidiaries with such names as the Diamond Development Corporation or Mining Services , Inc .
At its height , it not only either directly owned or controlled all the diamond mines in southern Africa , it also owned diamond trading companies in England , Portugal , Israel , Belgium , Holland and Switzerland .
It was De Beers of course that organized the Japanese campaign as part of its worldwide promotion of diamonds .
By 1981 , De Beers had proved to be the most successful cartel arrangement in the annals of modern commerce .
For more than a half century , while other commodities , such as gold , silver , copper , rubber and grains , fluctuated wildly in response to economic conditions , diamonds continued to advance upward in price each year .
Indeed , the mechanism of the diamond invention seemed so superbly in control of prices - and unassailable - that even speculators began buying diamonds as a guard against the vagaries of inflation and recession .
Like the romantic subjects of the advertising campaigns , they also assumed diamonds would increase in value forever .
My interest in the diamond invention was sparked originally by a chance meeting that I had with an English diamond broker in St. Tropez in the summer of 1977 .
The .broker was Benjamin Bonas , and he represented De Beers ' Diamond Trading Company .
He was visiting some friends of mine for the weekend , and during the course of a leisurely lunch the subject of diamonds was broached .
Bonas explained that despite revolutions , hostile governments and general turmoil in Africa , De Beers still firmly controlled the production of diamonds .
He pointed out that this arrangement had proved so successful that even the Soviet Union sold the diamonds from its Siberian mines to De Beers .
He did not elaborate at this point on the actual mechanisms used De Beers to lock up the flow of diamonds from diverse quarters of the world .
Nevertheless , I was intrigued by the idea that a South African company , aided and abetted Black African and Communist nations who were pledged a total embargo of South African business , had succeeded putting together a truly global alliance to protect the value and illusion of diamonds .
As the former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique got their full independence , the pressures throughout Africa , and most of the world , to isolate South Africa would drastically escalate .
How would the diamond cartel survive ?
In Washington , later that year , I filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for all the investigations of the Justice Department concerning the diamond Cartel .
The resulting archive of documents provided a fragmentary picture of De Beers ' conflicts and near collision with antitrust laws of the United States , the clues all pointed to mining companies in South Africa and the distribution arm in London .
I therefore began my inquiry into the nature and future of the diamond invention in Johannesburg .
A man who had receieved radiotherapy set off alarms at US airport security and was detained , interrogated and strip searched .
A report in the British Medical Journal says the 46 - year - old had been treated with radioiodine for thyroid problems six weeks prior to the incident .
Learning of the invasive episode , the man 's doctors trawled medical journals and found details of four earlier incident of radiotherapeutics triggering security alerts .
Reports last year revealed heart patients given thallium for medical imaging could have a similar effect on airport scanners .
The authors of the report said : " Airports worldwide are deploying more sensitive radiation detection systems and one would therefore expect more such cases . "
Radioiodine is used in cases of overactive thyroid gland , administered as a drink .
It is transported in the bloodstream to the thymyus , where the radioactivity kills some cells , bringing the condition under control .
Around 10,000 are given the treatment annually in the UK .
Its thought scanners could detect the iodine up to 12 weeks after the treatment .
The authors call for patients to be warned they could face the rubber glove when travelling .®
Initially , Mr. Hussein appeared intent on describing the privations that other defendants , including his half - brother , Barzan Ibrahim al - Tikriti , the former head of the mukhabarat secret police , had complained about during earlier courtroom sessions .
Referring sarcastically to " this democracy in which the Americans have imprisoned us , " he said that he , like the Dujail prisoners , had been kept in a cell with no windows .
" There is no sun for Saddam Hussein , " he said , reverting to a habit of referring to himself , mantralike , only by his full name .
It was then that he made his claim of beatings and torture by American guards .
Since his capture in a spider hole near his hometown of Tikrit on Dec. 13 , 2003 , Mr. Hussein has been held in American military custody .
American and Iraqi officials , as well as Mr. Hussein 's lawyers , say they have met with him at Camp Cropper , an American detention center about 20 minutes ' drive from the Baghdad airport 's main passenger terminal .
American officials have said that he is kept in solitary confinement , but allowed exercise periods in a small yard where he tends plants .
They say he is given three meals a day , including , often , the dry - pack rations known to American soldiers as meals - ready - to - eat , or MRE's .
Mr. Hussein's torture allegations were dismissed by Chris Reid , a Justice Department lawyer who heads an American Embassy unit known as the Regime Crimes Liaison Office , as " bogus claims designed to ambush the court " and to counter the allegations made by the Dujail victims .
Speaking in a CNN interview after the court outburst , Mr. Reid , whose office has helped to set up and run the Iraqi court trying Mr. Hussein , said that he had toured Mr. Hussein 's quarters in the detention camp , and that the claims of torture and beatings had never been made previously been raised by Mr. Hussein or any of his co-defendants .
" No claims of this kind have ever been made before " he said .
One of the Dujail witnesses who testified on today , Ali Hassan al - Haideri , aged 37 , was 14 when he was arrested , on the day after the shooting that broke out during Mr. Hussein 's visit to the Shiite town .
He said he learned only after the American - led invasion in April 2003 that seven of his brothers who were arrested with him had been executed .
He said other people from Dujail had been tortured with plastic hoses that had been melted with heat and stabbed onto victims ' torsos , leaving a plastic residue in the wounds that ripped chunks of flesh as it was removed .
Another witness , testifying from a curtained - off dock to disguise his identity , said one of his sons , a farm worker , had been shot dead by Mr. Hussein 's forces on the day of the clashes in Dujail , and four others had been executed on the orders of Awad al - Bandar , chief judge of the revolutionary court , who is on trial with Mr. Hussein .
The witness , now more than 80 years old , said he only learned his four executed sons were dead when an Iraqi group tracking down missing persons after Mr. Hussein was toppled found a list of 148 Dujail men and teenage boys whose death sentences had been handed down by Mr. Bandar in 1984 .
[ Haskell - cafe ] Friday Afternoon Play : The Burrows Wheeler Transformation
So , it 's Friday afternoon ( well , here anyway ) , and presumably everyone is thinking of leaving for the weekend .
Is anyone interested in playing a little game ?
I 'm going to make the first move , and then just wait and see if anyone makes the next .
I 'm certainly not promising to make any further moves myself , but I 'm not promising I wo n't , either .
Below you 'll see a naïve implementation of the Burrows Wheeler transformation and its inverse .
That 's my move .
( And do n't complain too much about style and such -- I 'm half asleep . )
Further moves are made by transforming the programme so that it becomes more efficient .
The first target is not raw speed , but to adjust it until the computational complexity gets to be what it should be .
I 'm hoping for elegant moves here .
After that , folk might start replacing the lists with more efficient datastructures and so on , but still / elegantly / .
The object of the game is n't ultimate speed -- I 've no particular wish to see a Haskell version that 's as fast as a good C version , especially not if it ends up / looking / like a C version .
Really the objective is to think about Haskell programming -- and probably come up with some observations such as " there really ought to be a class of indexable structures , so that we do n't have to change ( !! ) to (! ) all over the place " .
And to have fun , anyhow ... * * * Demonstration of the principle of the Burrows Wheeler transform .
The implementations are simplistic ( and have worse complexity than is possible ) .
> module Burrows_Wheeler_Transform where > import List
This is surely the wrong module to have to find ( ><) from : > import Data.Graph.Inductive.Query.Monad ((><) )
The forward transformation .
Input a list , output the transformed list and possibly an int ( Nothing if there were no elements in the input -- perhaps the result type should be Maybe ( NonEmptyList t , Int ) ) > slow_bwt : : Ord t => [ t ] -> ( [ t ] , Maybe Int )
This version works by computing a list of all the rotations of the input and sorting it .
The transformation is then the last element of each line of the sorted rotations .
Tag the data with an index so that it 's possible to find where the original form of the unput ends up after sorting .
This is essentially the specification of the transform coded up directly .
> slow_bwt l > = ( map fst tagged_bwt , index_of_original ) > where tagged_bwt = map ( last > < id ) > $ sort > $ rotations l`zip` [ 0.. ] > index_of_original = findIndex ( ( ==0 ) .snd ) tagged_bwt that looks like worst case n²×log n to me ( where n is the length of the string ) : if every element is the same , the n×log n comparisons the sort does will each look at every element , and that 's really more than is necessary .
The inverse transform .
We should have that @ slow_inv_bwt .
slow_bwt == id @ Observe that sorting the input gives the first column of the sorted rotations ( and the input is the last ) .
So after one sort we have X ... c Y ... b Z ... a . . . . . . . . .
Since they are rotations , rotating each row of this gives pairs that belong to the original list : cX ... by ... aZ ... . . . . . . sorting these gives us the first two columns of the sorted rotations , and again we already know the last column , which can be rotated into the first and so on .
> slow_inv_bwt ( [ ] , _ ) = [ ] > slow_inv_bwt ( l , Just index_of_original ) > = iterate catsort ( replicate len [ ] )
After ( length input ) iterations we have the original sorted rotations , > !!
len and we have the index of where the untransformed string is , so we can just pick it back out .
> !!
index_of_original > where catsort s = sort $ map ( uncurry ( : ) ) $ l `zip`s > len = length l
This version does rather fewer sorts : > mark2_inv_bwt ( [ ] , _ ) = [ ] > mark2_inv_bwt ( l , Just n ) > = ( transpose $ take ( length l ) $ iterate ( permuteWith perm ) l ) !!( perm !!n ) > where perm = map snd $ sort $ l `zip` [ 0 ..]
Should I simply have left it out and hoped that it would turn up after a few moves ?
I 'm not going to explain it , anyway .
> rotations l = init $ zipWith (++) ( tails l ) ( inits l ) > permuteWith ns l = map ( l !! ) ns -- Jón Fairbairn Jon. Fairbairn at cl.cam.ac.uk

Heather Mills is furious Sir Paul McCartney has begun divorce proceeding against her - because she wanted to divorce him first .
Sir Paul has instructed lawyers to act on the grounds of her " unreasonable behaviour " - only 10 weeks after they split .
A source close to the charity worker told The Daily Mirror : " She wanted to divorce him .... she did n't expect it to happen this quickly . "
The source added : " She 's not going to make it easy .
This could drag on . "

• Heather and call - girl dined with the Blairs
• Heather and Paul 's relationship in pictures
When they announced their separation in May , Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills promised that the split was amicable , and - more importantly - would remain so .
But just two months on , and the gloves - as well as the wedding rings - are truly off as the couple square up for what could become one of the most acrimonious , drawn out and expensive divorce battles in British legal history .
The former Beatle issued formal divorce proceedings after the couple failed to reach a deal for a £ 30 m ' quickie ' divorce .
In the petition submitted to the courts , he has blamed the break - up on her ' unreasonable behaviour ' , claiming the one - time lingerie model was ' argumentative ' and ' rude to staff . '
More tellingly though - having initially gone out of his way to deny publicly suggestions that Heather had married him only for his money - he now appears to have changed his mind .
According to friends ,
Heather 's decision to reject his £ 30 m offer for a quick , clean break opens her up to accusations of being a ' gold - digger ' who is simply after a bigger slice of his £ 825 m fortune .
In a bid to make sure that does n't happen , Sir Paul has now hired a team of the country 's most feared divorce lawyers , including Fiona Shackleton , who represented Prince Charles in his divorce from Diana , and Nicholas Mostyn , QC , whose success in high - profile divorce cases have earned him the nickname , Mr Payout .
But while Heather has yet to unveil her legal line - up she has made clear her determination to fight him all the way .
It is understood that the animal welfare campaigner - who some claim could be entitled to as much as £ 200 m - is planning to file counter - claims in American and Britain , accusing Sir Paul of being mean and boring .
If the couple - who have a two - year - old daughter Beatrice - cannot reach a private compromise , it would raise the prospect of their marital difficulties being thrashed out in a public court room , including Heather 's acrimonious relationship with her step - children .
The breakdown in relations between the couple was underlined this weekend when Sir Paul openly displayed the fact that he was no longer wearing his wedding ring while attending a graduation ceremony at his Liverpool fame academy .
He had been pictured with it on as recently as four weeks ago - prompting speculation that he was hoping for a reconciliation .
That now seems nigh - on impossible .
A close friend of Sir Paul was yesterday quoted as saying : ' Paul is a reasonable guy who does n't like confrontation .
' In his eyes they agreed they wanted to make the divorce quick and painless and a settlement was virtually in place - but then Heather started getting unreasonable because she wanted more money , ' he told the Sunday Mirror .
' It appears she wants as much as she can and she has left her self open to suggestions that she is a " gold digger . "
Meanwhile such claims are said to have infuriated 38 - year - old Heather .
Sources close to her said there had been no financial offer and that the idea that she was after his money was ' outrageous . '
' Paul has always been tight with his money towards her , ' a friend was quoted as saying in the Sunday Mirror .
' She was having to pay the mortgage on their Hove home where she is based until a few months ago .
' She even went on chat shows to raise money to pay staff , people like her secretary .
This is likely to form part of her counter - claim . '
The couple first met in 1999 at a charity function , and married three years later in Ireland .
However she will claim that , having courted her assiduously , Sir Paul became ' boring ' after their wedding , preferring to stay at his 160 - acre estate in Sussex , while she pursued an energetic social life at their St John 's Wood home in central London .
The ex-Beatle did not make his young bride sign a pre-nuptial agreement before their wedding because he thought it was unromantic and had little likelihood of being enforced under UK law .
The couple split up in May this year with Sir Paul complaining he was being treated like a ' doormat . '
The day their separation was announced , the singer issued a statement saying there was ' not an ounce of truth ' in suggestions that Heather had married him for his money .
' She is a very generous person who spends most of her time trying to help others , ' he sad .
But relations between the pair deteriorated dramatically earlier this month after Heather confronted Sir Paul with a tape - recording of a private conversation he had had with his daughter , Stella .
Heather denied having anything to do with the bugging which revealed Stella 's dislike of her step - mother .
Meanwhile , Sir Paul was shocked by a string of allegations about his wife 's past .
These included claims that she worked as a high - class prostitute servicing wealthy Arab princes - claims she vehemently denies - and the publication of pornographic pictures of her .
A spokesman for Sir Paul yesterday said that reports of a bitter divorce battle were ' pure speculation . '

Updated Google 's support centre has pulled an answer to the topical question " Does Google censor search results ? "
Since the answer clearly stated the company " does not censor results for any search term " , and given the company 's recent foray into the lucrative Chinese search engine market , it seems fair that the internet monolith would probably want to review that particular stance and relegate the offending item to cache .
Yup , democracy is not a word you want to be flashing about when you 've just opened a big fat Yuan bank account .
For the record , Google 's justification for agreeing to censorship of search results on Google China is , as Sergey Brin put it : " We ultimately made a difficult decision , but we felt that by participating there , and making our services more available , even if not to the 100 percent that we ideally would like , it will be better for Chinese Web users , because ultimately they would get more information , though not quite all of it . "
Chinese news website Xinhua kicks off its " China welcomes running dog lackey imperialist search engine " piece with : " By creating a unique address for China , Google hopes to make its search engine more widely available and easier to use in the world 's most populous country . "
It does , however , quickly move on to a refreshingly frank analysis of Google 's real motivation : " China already has more than 100 million web surfers and the audience is expected to swell substantially — an alluring prospect for Google as it tries to boost its already rapidly rising profits . "
Do n't be evil ?
Do n't make us laugh . ®
Update
Reuters reports that Google and other internet companies have been " called " to attend a " Congressional Human Rights Caucus hearing on Wednesday and a February 16 session of the House of Representatives subcommittee on Global Human Rights " .
The latter invitation is at the behest of New Jersey Republican and subcommittee chairman Chris Smith , who said in a statement that Google " would enable evil by cooperating with China 's censorship policies just to make a buck . "
Cisco , Microsoft and Yahoo ! will also join " State Department officials and press freedom watchdog groups " at the 16 February shindig .
Whether Bill Gates will attend is unkown , but he today weighed into the debate by declaring : " I think [ the internet ] is contributing to Chinese political engagement .
Access to the outside world is preventing more censorship .
Speaking In Davos , Switzerland , Gates added that concerns about censorship or widespread piracy in China should not deter firms from doing business there .
Sept. 20 , 2006  --
Giving your kid a unique name is the hot new thing in Hollywood .
Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin named their firstborn Apple .
Jason
Lee gave his son the name Pilot Inspektor -- that 's not a misspelling , it 's spelled with a " k. "
Earlier this month , Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes posed for Vanity Fair with their uniquely named daughter , Suri .
Unusual names -- like Shabita and Shakira -- are also big in the black community .
" Thirty percent of black baby girls in a given year in California have a name that no one else has , " said Roland Fryer , an economist and assistant professor at Harvard University , who has taken a special interest in uniquely black names .
" White names tend to be things like Molly , " Fryer said .
" We had 16 million names in California .
We only had six black Mollys and not one white Lakisha .
Some of the blacker names tend to be things like Aida .
Reginald is a very black name . "
This matters because studies of resumes have found that people with black - sounding names are less likely to get callbacks .
Putting Names to the Test
In 2004 , " 20/20 " brought together a group of young black professionals who doubted that the black - sounding names on their resumes made a difference .
We put 22 pairs of names to the test , posting identical resumes , with the only difference being the name .
Since the content of the resumes was identical , it would make sense that they'd get the same attention .
However , the resumes with the white - sounding names were actually downloaded 17 percent more often by job recruiters than the resumes with black - sounding names .
" You really never know why you do n't get called back for that interview .
I thought it 's because of my job skills .
But I never thought it was because of my name , " said Tremelle , a participant in the study .
Jack Daniel , a professor of communication at the University of Pittburgh , has done research that shows both white and black children prefer white - sounding names .
Daniel asked a group of 4 - and 5 - year - old children a series of questions .
The children were asked to answer the questions based solely on names .
For example , " Who is the smartest , Sarah or Shaniqua ? "
" Sarah , " one boy answered .
Daniel asked , " Who would you like to play with , Tanisha or Megan ? "
" Megan , " another child said .
Daniel asked , " Who took the bite out of your sandwich ?
Do you think it was Adam or Jamal ? "
Another boy said , " Jamal . "
Inferring From a Name
Why do we discriminate based on names ?
It may not be about race but instead what some names signal about a person 's background .
" A distinctively black name tells us that a person typically comes from a neighborhood that has higher poverty , lower income , more likely to have teen mothers , et cetera , " Fryer said .
There 's new research that shows names may even tell us about more than just social background ; a name may affect future decisions about marriage and career .
Psychologist Brett Pelham , who has studied hundreds of thousands of names , said they can significantly affect your life , even what profession you enter .
He says it 's probably not just chance that a man named Nathan " Leeper " became a high jumper .
" It 's probably not a coincidence that of all the opportunities he [ Leeper ] had as a great athlete , that 's the one that he stuck with , " Pelham said .
His research shows that an unusual number of people named Dennis become dentists , and if you 're named George you 're more likely to become a geologist .
So do names even influence whom people pick to marry ?
Pelham said , according to his research , yes .
" My work has shown very clearly that people are disproportionately likely to marry other people , to want to befriend other people if their names resemble the name of the person making the decision . "
He said it's no coincidence that Tom Cruise dated Penelope Cruz , or that Paris Hilton was once engaged to Paris Latsis .
On one level , it might seem wrong to make decisions based on names .
" At another level , people like their names .
And the biggest symbol of who you are , in fact , is your name , and if you feel good about yourself and your name , you will feel good about anything that even vaguely resembles your name , " Pelham added .
It 's why he said people named Georgia are disproportionately more likely than other women to move to the state of Georgia
" It seems dumb .
It seems like a crazy reason .
But at another level , why not choose Georgia over Virginia ?
Because she is constantly surrounded by reminders of something that she loves , namely herself , " Pelham said .
Avoiding Bad Names
Pelham says names can have a negative impact , as well .
" My cousin Dinky -- not going to become the CEO of a major corporation , " he said .
So should parents steer away from being clever when naming their children ?
" Advice to parents :
It might seem cool to give your kid a unique name .
But there are many , many more disadvantages to doing that than advantages , " Pelham said .
That 's why Pelham named his son Lincoln , which has positive associations with Abraham Lincoln .
Pelham said , " [ People ] associate that name with compassion and care , which is exactly what I wanted . "
( The short version , in case you do n’t want to read more : have H1 tags in your pages , containing the keywords you ’re interested in .
It pays off )
Is n’t it frustrating when your page does n’t even appear in Google for your target keywords ?
It can be even worse :
you may not be targeting competitive keywords at all , and there may be no competing products at all .
There can be several other pages , about your product , and linking to your page , actually appearing on the results !
This is what was happening to me with the main page of my product , ViEmu .
ViEmu provides vi/vim emulation within visual studio , so pretty obviously the target keyphrases are “ vi visual studio ” and / or “ vim visual studio ” .
The product and the page have been there , accessible through http://www.ngedit.com/viemu.html since late last July .
There have been quite many mentions of it , which link to that page , from blogs , review sites , etc …
The page has been indexed all along , and appearing on the top results page of Google for things like “ visual studio vi emulation ” or , quite obviously , “ viemu ” .
But it did n’t even register on the much more interesting “ vi visual studio ” and “ vim visual studio ” search phrases .
By this , I mean it was nowhere to be seen on the first 40 pages of results or so .
What ’s even funnier is that many of the mentions of my page did appear there , even on the first few pages .
I have an adwords campaign ( read my report on adwords for details on the effectiveness , click fraud , etc ) , which helps out , but I ’d really prefer to be on the main results .
What ’s more , I could n’t easily understand why I was n’t .
Trying to understand how Google sorts its results is a tricky task , as well as a moving target .
But I had an advantage : a certain review from Tobias Gurock over at Gurock Software was scoring incredibly on search results – it was on the first or second page of the results for the interesting searches !
So I decided to have a look at it and try to find out why Google liked it so much .
The first thing to check , obviously , was whether that page had a significantly higher PageRank , or many more incoming links .
Actually , it seemed to be about the same as mine ( PR5 ) , so that probably was n’t it .
Even other reviews , with much lower PR , did at least appear after page 3 or 4 of the results .
So that left the actual content itself .
After some review , discarding the title , presence of the keywords , etc … I got it down to two differences :
The name of the html file , in their case , contains the keywords ( it ’s “ http://software.gurock.com/postings/vi-emulation-for-visual-studio/25/”)
… and their H1 tag is “ Vi emulation for Visual Studio ” ( today it also includes a self - link , but I think it used to contain just the text before they moved to WordPress )
Changing the filename was out of question – with all the links out there , I would n’t want to lose that .
A 301 http redirect may be a possibility , but I was weary of Google consequences ( I could make it even worse , possibly losing the accumulated PR ) .
But the H1 tag … see , my original web site design did not include an H1 tag at all .
Along the product ’s logo , I had a graphical rendering of the name – not leaving room for a text H1 tag .
So , I decided to “ upgrade ” those pages to having an H1 tag .
The contents of the tag : pretty obvious , “ ViEmu : vi/vim emulation for Visual Studio ” .
The text rendering of this title looked fine , so on February the 11th , I uploaded the new ViEmu pages .
And started waiting .
Google comes often to my site ( daily ? ) , so that was fast .
About a week afterwards , Google ’s cache started showing the new content .
So now I knew it was already there .
The search results , anyway , kept on the same .
But around the 21st ( last Tuesday ) , I found out to my grateful surprise that my page started appearing on the first results page , around # 5 .
During all of last week , it was a bit unstable – some searches would work fine , but searching a few hours later would show the old results with my page nowhere .
This week , finally , about 90 % of the searches already show the new results !
I attribute the instability to the results requiring propagation around Google ’s servers , which is expectedly a slow process .
I ’m guessing ( and hoping ) it will disappear altogether in a few more days .
Lessons learned ?
Always include a header in your design ( I guess an image with alt text may work as well , but I ’m not trying ) .
Name the html files with the relevant keywords , not just with your product name .
And be prepared to learn a lot !
The Truthiness Encyclopedia
If you feel deep in your gut that it ’s right , then you ’re just in the right place to be !
Truth is a bit like gambling .
Sometimes you win , sometimes you lose , but the house always wins .
Click and drag anywhere , just like normal Google Maps , and see how the Map View matches the Satellite View ( or vice - versa ) .
Control the level of transparency with the slider control at bottom .

人力検索はてなの質 問
マツキヨ等のドラッグストアでお手軽＆簡単に手に入る高価でないサプリメントで、γ-ＧＴＰを下げる、および肝機能向上に効果的なものを教えてください。
お手軽に手に入るサプリメントで肝機能向上の効果が証明されたものは存在しない。存在するのは、単に肝臓によいと「言われている」ものだけである。肝臓によい健康食品・サプリメントとしてウコンがよく挙がるが、健康な人ならともかく、肝臓病の人には勧められない。なぜなら、比較的稀ではあるものの、ウコンで肝障害が起こることがあるからだ（参考：■ウコンで肝障害その２）。ウコンに限らず、サプリメントは肝障害を起こしうる。肝障害の患者を問診するときには、薬の服用歴や酒量と同時に、サプリメントの摂取歴を聴取する必要があるくらいだ。
軽度の肝障害であれば、サプリメントに頼るのも一つの方法であろう。ほとんどの場合は、益もなければ害もない。実際の効果ではなく、「効果があるかも」という気分を買うのにいくら出せるのかは人それぞれである。肝障害が軽度でないのなら、サプリメントに頼るのは害である。γGTP上昇の原因にもよるが、たとえば飲酒によるものなら減酒・禁酒、肥満からきた脂肪肝によるものなら減量、その他の胆道系の疾患ならそれぞれ根拠のある治療を行うべきである。
肝硬変患者には、医師の許可がない限り、すべてのサプリメントが禁忌である。死亡例もある（参考：■ウコンで肝障害）。肝硬変では肝代謝が落ちているため、健康な人では問題にならない量の薬物でも悪影響が生じうる。さらに、肝予備力が低下しているため、少しの肝障害でも命取りになりうる。慢性肝炎の段階で適切な医療を受けていれば肝硬変への進展を抑制できていたのに、金ばかりかかるくだらないサプリメントに頼っていたため肝硬変に進展した患者もいる。
医療が必要な肝臓病患者に対して、無責任にサプリメントを勧める業者および善意の人に呪いあれ。
Release Late , Release Rarely
When you look at something you ’re working on , no matter what it is , you ca n’t help but see past the actual thing to the ideas that inspired it , your plans for extending it , the emotions you ’ve tied to it .
But when others look at it , all they see is a piece of junk .
You only get one chance to make a first impression ; why have it be “ junk ” ?
Once that ’s associated with your name or project , it ’s tough to scrape off .
Even people who did n’t see it themselves may have heard about it second - hand .
And once they hear about it , they ’re not likely to see for themselves .
Life ’s too short to waste it on junk .
But when you release late , after everything has been carefully polished , you can share something of genuine quality .
Apple , for example , sometimes releases stupid stuff , but it always looks good .
Even when they flub , people give them the benefit of the doubt .
“ Well , it looks great but I do n’t really like it ” is a lot better then “ it ’s a piece of junk ” .
Still , you can do better .
Releasing means showing it to the world .
There ’s nothing wrong with showing it to friends or experts or even random people in a coffee shop .
The friends will give you the emotional support you would have gotten from actual users , without the stress .
The experts will point out most of the errors the world would have found , without the insults .
And random people will not only give you most of the complaints the public would , they ’ll also tell you why the public gave up even before bothering to complain .
This is why “ release early , release often ” works in “ open source ” : you ’re releasing to a community of insiders .
Programmers know what it ’s like to write programs and they do n’t mind using things that are unpolished .
They can see what you ’re going to do next and maybe help you get there .
The public is n’t like that .
Do n’t treat them like they are .
You should follow me on twitter here .
July 5 , 2006
A few weeks ago my mother , Mehrangiz Kar , wrote an article about stoning to death in Iran .
She received many different feedbacks for her article that was published in Farsi .
Among those responses we found an astonishing letter from an anonymous person whose mother was stoned to death twenty six years ago .
Since the strength of the words of this letter paralyzed my body and mind for a few minutes , I decided to quickly translate the text .
According to Article 83 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran , stoning to death has been declared a permissible punishment for a few different types of adultery .
Hello .
I read your recent article about stoning to death .
Reading your article reminded me of the bleeding bruises in my heart once again .
You wrote about murdering by stoning ?
Have you ever held a bloody tool in your hands with which they have murdered your mother ?
Have you ever touched the bloody skin and hair of your mother who has just been killed in a deep hole ?
Have you ever followed the line of your mother ’s blood in order to find her corpse thrown at the back of a truck ?
Have you ever seen the fresh grave of that dearest being with a small piece of paper on which they have written her name wrapped around a small branch of tree ?
Has anyone ever said a word about the children of the people who have been stoned to death ?
I was fourteen and now I am forty .
To quote psychologists , I am one of the most fortunate people on this planet .
I am fortunate , because despite this contempt in my life I have been able to continue my higher education and find myself a wife , children and a credible job without letting a single black spot remain in my life .
Do you even understand what it means to be the child of a person who has been shamefully stoned to death ?
If Islamic clerics tell you that you could not win over the Islamic laws , they have , indeed told you the truth .
My mother used to tell me that she had become a sex - worker in order to feed us and to support us .
She used to command us in being real men .
She used to tell us to stand on our own feet and to never lose our hope in Ali ( the first imam in shiasm ) .
Seriously who would want to sell her body , to sell her sex to anonymous men except for those women who have no other way of feeding their children ?
If the husband knows how to make money , the wife and the mother of the family does not have to go and seek customers .
The economic situation needs to improve and single mothers or those mothers whose husbands do not have the ability or the willpower to work , should be able to seek help from the government .
You must establish an organization for supporting these women .
It does not have to be a very rich organization in the beginning .
No one has the right to condemn you for seeking financial support from different sources for these types of support organizations .
Women like my mother who was eventually stoned to death need your help .
They need the world ’s help and support .
Their forgotten families , too , need the world ’s help .
Help them !
Executing people for having not immoral actions is not going to have an effective result .
Tell me how many people have been executed and stoned to death since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in Iran …
What is the result of all of this violence other than the fact that the evil is now truly dominating our society ?
I never forget the last words of my mother ’s Islamic judge :
“ I issued a verdict for stoning this woman to death so that other individuals learn a lesson from her doomed fate and to avoid sins of such nature .
To execute by shooting would not have made her suffer enough ! ”
Alas .
Twenty six years ago my mother was stoned to death before my eyes .
Has these women ’s tragic fate helped our society improve ?
Statistics show that the rates of prostitution and corruption have increased exponentially .
God bless you !
Scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center have targeted a new culprit and method of attack on neurologic functions in diseases such as Alzheimer 's and dementia associated with HIV .
In an article in the Nov. 1 issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation , the Rochester scientists describe a new mechanism by which brain cells can be damaged during chronic neurodegenerative diseases .
When inflammation occurs in the brain , nerve impulses that are passed between cells during routine activities like learning and memory can become toxic .
Instead of triggering the formation of memories , these impulses can inflict injury on neurons and disrupt neurologic function .
Understanding this mechanism could provide a new path for drugs to treat the diseases .
Working in collaboration with researchers at the University of California at San Diego , the Rochester scientists propose a strategy of chemical preconditioning to induce adaptations in nerve cells that would enable the cells to better withstand toxic attacks , prevent injury , and preserve function .
" Preconditioning would allow the nervous system to experience stress and become more resistant to future encounters with stress and the damage it can trigger , " said Harris A. Gelbard , M.D. , professor of Neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center and the research project 's principal investigator .
A long - standing villain in neurodegenerative disease has been glutamate , an amino acid that normally acts as a neurotransmitter .
Excess glutamate , however , can overly excite neurons , causing damage and death � a process called excitotoxicity .
Some drugs developed for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , for example , are designed to lower the production of glutamate or block its transmission to reduce excitotoxic injury .
" But just blocking glutamate does n't seem to work efficiently in neurodegenerative diseases with inflammation , " said Gelbard .
" We reconsidered how excitotoxicity actually damages the nervous system in a functional way . "
The scientists focused on dendrites , the crooked branches of neurons that carry impulses toward the body of the nerve cell , and synapses , the places where impulses pass from neuron to neuron .
Injury to dendrites � characterized by swelling or beading , loss of dendrite spines , and reduction in size � is seen in HIV - 1 - associated dementia and Alzheimer's .
In laboratory studies , brain cells and slices were exposed to platelet - activating factor , or PAF , a compound that promotes inflammation and plays many roles in the brain .
It can be produced by neurons and takes part in the working of synapses , including activity associated with learning and remembering .
It also is produced by immune cells during inflammation .
The amount of PAF in the brain increases dramatically in HIV - 1 - associated dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases .
" We found that disease makes dendrites more vulnerable to excitotoxicity , " said Matthew J. Bellizzi , a researcher and student in the M.D. / Ph.D. program at the Medical Center and corresponding author of the journal article .
" We also found that damage to the dendrites may not require abnormal glutamate exposure . "
The lab studies showed that elevated levels of PAF promoted beading on dendrites and injury to synapses following bursts of synaptic activity similar to those thought to be involved in learning and memory .
" This mechanism does not just apply to HIV , " Gelbard said .
" It applies to Alzheimer 's , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson's and any neurodegenerative diseases that have synaptic dysfunction with inflammation , which is virtually all of them . "
In lab studies , brain cells were treated with diazoxide , a drug investigated for use in ischemic heart disease and strokes .
Pretreatment before exposure to PAF prevented dendritic beading and preserved synaptic functions , the studies showed .
" Stressing the cells with small amounts could trigger protective genes and induce adaptations that will make the dendrites more able to withstand insults , " Bellizzi said .
Diazoxide is not the only drug that would work , and others might be better , the researchers said .
Memantine , a drug that blocks glutamate receptors , is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's .
Chemical preconditioning could represent an alternate or complementary strategy .
" Preconditioning to protect the synapse is likely to be more important in the early and middle phases of neurodegenerative diseases than simply preserving the cell body , " Gelbard said .

Google as an SE is done .
Someone stick a fork in it .
Here 's why .
Not too long ago many startups relied on Google as their primary source of customers .
At least that 's what the Google Myth led entrepreneurs to believe it could do .
So hundreds of hours would be sunk into tweaking the SEO and fine - tuning Adwords advertising campaigns .
But if you have any experience in running online businesses , you are probably painfully aware of just how fickle and unreliable Google is as a business " partner " for a small business .
Firstly , it takes a very long time for a new site to appear in Google 's SERP ( Search Engine Results Page ) .
While Google denies it , most of the savvy webmasters who talk at places like webmasterworld ( WMW ) suspect that Google secretly does this in order to force new sites to spend money on its Adwords program .
( I believe this because all my new sites do well quickly on Yahoo and the other SEs but poorly on Google . )
Forcing sites to use Adwords makes perfect sense -- from Google 's point of view .
But not from mine .
Secondly , it would n't be so bad if , at least , Adwords delivered in terms of ROI .
But even it is deteriorating performance wise .
( See my earlier posts on this in the Online Business category . )
My suspicion is that most surfers have gradually turned a blind eye to Adwords .
They have probably seen the ads a few thousand times and have lost interest in them because the pay - off from clicking is so low , in most cases .
One final point .
Just a few short years ago the consensus on WMW was to avoid doing anything that might tick Google off .
They all walked around on eggshells as if Google was a spouse with Borderline Personality Disorder who might fly into a rage at any moment and attack them with a steak knife .
For example , reciprocal link exchanges were considered a taboo because Google would assume that they were n't freely given but the result of scheming by the two sites involved and then penalize both sites .
Then there was the obsession with the idiotic Page Rank system devised by Google .
So all the webmasters at WMW installed the G - toolbar and avoided incoming links from sites with a lower pagerank .
In summary , there was rampant paranoia about doing anything that might upset Google and result in a penalty .
I also read in horror daily tales from webmasters whose sites simply vanished from Google for reasons unknown .
( Speaking of vanishing sites , I watched a cancelled site sit in the middle of the first G SERP for over a year .
If you clicked on the link you 'd get a an error message stating the site was unavailable .
Why was it unvailable ?
Because the owners had pulled it .
So for over a year G's vaunted SE shows a non-existent site in the middle of the first SERP for a key search term .
Here 's what happened a year later , the original owners launched a new site and placed a redirect on the old site to the new one .
So a new site with a very low SERP ranking benefits from a redirect on the first G SERP . )
Sadly , I fell for all the " do n't do anything to upset Google nonsense " at WMW .
But then after a year , I began to notice that there were some renegade webmasters out there who did n't care what Google thought .
All they cared about was traffic -- and they were getting it !
Maybe I 'll write about this later but suffice it to say here that there are a lot of ways of driving traffic to your site .
Blogs combined with bookmark services are one great example of getting the word out .
The bottomline is to go for the right traffic .
Go for paying customers .
Who cares if they come from a site with a low page rank .
A sale is a sale .
Do I sound pissed at G ?
You bet .
One of my sites , www.antiventurecapital.com, used to appear on G's 4th SERP for searches on " venture capital " .
Then overnight a year ago it vanished from G and then returned a month later around the 90th SERP .
Since then it 's yoyo - ed between 80th and 95th SERP .
Screw you Google , instead of the tedium of constantly tweaking my meta-tags and key word density while blowing money on Adwords , I 'm doing fun marketing via this blog and other methods and it 's paying off .
My newest site 's strategy will basically ignore Google .
Cringe from crossing a concentrating coder
Some justifications why you should not disturb programmers while they are concentrating on work .
February 11 , 2000
You should not break without good reason the concentration of a programmer while they are working .
If at all possible , communicate via e-mail or some other way that lets them react when they have the time .
What follows are some justifications as to why this is so important .
A programmer 's work is divided roughly into three categories .
Brainless gruntwork : moving desks and machines , printing and copying specifications , etc .
Interrupt handling : answering the phone , dealing with most mails , sitting in meetings , some parts of testing and debugging , etc. Monomaniacal concentration : design , coding , some of the more demanding mails , testing , and debugging .
During points 1 and 2 interruptions do n't necessarily hinder the work : if there are not very many mails and there some extra time , a phone call or coming in to the office to ask a question do not cause much disruption .
During point 3 any interruptions at all will destroy everything .
Psychologists talk about a concept called " flow " .
A layman 's explanation : when you are in the flow , you concentrate only on what you are doing and you hold all the required details in your head , in the short and middle term memory .
Because there are no disturbances inside your own head , all the details are readily accessible to the brain and the brain in general works like a well - oiled machine , the work progresses excellently and working is a pleasure .
If there are any interruptions in this state , anything that requires bringing other things into the short term memory , naturally anything you had there is lost and that breaks your concetration and the feeling of pleasure vanishes .
Getting back into the flow usually takes at least fifteen minutes .
During this period no useful work happens .
Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister describe the flow in the classic project management book Peopleware like this ( page 63 ) :
During single - minded work time , people are ideally in a state that psychologists call flow .
Flow is a condition of deep , nearly meditative involvement .
In this state , there is a gentle sense of euphoria , and one is largely unaware of the passage of time : " I began to work .
I looked up , and three hours had passed . "
There is no consciousness of effort ; the work just seems to , well , flow .
You 've been in this state often , so we do n't have to describe it to you .
Not all work roles require that you attain a state of flow in order to be productive , but for anyone involved in engineering , design , development , writing , or like tasks , flow is a must .
These are high - momentum tasks .
It 's only when you 're in flow that the work goes well .
Unfortunately , you can't turn on flow like a switch .
It takes a slow descent into the subject , requiring fifteen minutes or more of concentration before the state is locked in .
During this immersion period , you are particularly sensitive to noise and interruption .
A disruptive environment can make it difficult or impossible to attain flow .
Once locked in , the state can be broken by an interruption that is focused on you ( your phone , for instance ) or by insistent noise ( " Attention !
Paging Paul Portulaca .
Will Paul Portulaca please call extension ... " ) .
Each time you 're interrupted , you require an additional immersion period to get back into flow .
During this immersion , you 're not really doing work .
One of the foundations of the Internet hacker culture , the Jargon File , defines the same concept as " hack mode " ( http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hack-mode.html):
hack mode /n./ 1 . What one is in when hacking , of course .
2 . More specifically , a Zen - like state of total focus on The Problem that may be achieved when one is hacking ( this is why every good hacker is part mystic ) .
Ability to enter such concentration at will correlates strongly with wizardliness ; it is one of the most important skills learned during larval stage .
Sometimes amplified as `deep hack mode ' .
Being yanked out of hack mode ( see priority interrupt ) may be experienced as a physical shock , and the sensation of being in hack mode is more than a little habituating .
The intensity of this experience is probably by itself sufficient explanation for the existence of hackers , and explains why many resist being promoted out of positions where they can code .
See also cyberspace ( sense 2 ) .
Some aspects of hackish etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer unaware of the high value placed on hack mode .
For example , if someone appears at your door , it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand ( without turning one 's eyes away from the screen ) to avoid being interrupted .
One may read , type , and interact with the computer for quite some time before further acknowledging the other 's presence ( of course , he or she is reciprocally free to leave without a word ) .
The understanding is that you might be in hack mode with a lot of delicate state ( sense 2 ) in your head , and you dare not swap that context out until you have reached a good point to pause .
See also juggling eggs .
All programmers are in the flow at some point , preferably during most of their work day .
If anyone enters the room to talk to someone , or calls , or otherwise interrupts , this will probably disturb everyone in the room .
In the worst case , the flow of a great many people will be broken .
Everyone will take fifteen minutes to get back into the flow , so one interruption of a few minutes can cause the loss of several hours of most productive work .
It is not necessarily clear to a casual observer , whether a programmer is in flow .
Because of this , it is best to avoid any unnecessary interruptions and use e-mail .
If the matter is urgent , and there is no response to e-mail , it is of course all right to use text messages , to call , or to visit in person .
Also , if the programmers are talking or it is otherwise clear they are not in flow , a visit is welcome .

A computer virus succeeded in bringing down the main Russian stock exchange on Thursday .
The Russian Trading System ( RTS ) was forced to suspend operations in its three markets between 1315 and 1420 GMT after unnamed malware infected systems .
Viral infection resulted in a huge upsurge of outgoing traffic , interrupting normal network operations .
" The virus got into a computer connected to a test trading system from the internet , " RTS vice president Dmitry Shatsky said in the statement issued Friday , Reuters reports .
" The infected computer started generating huge volumes of parasitic traffic , which overloaded the RTS 's support routers .
The result was that normal traffic - data going in to and out of the trading system - was not processed . "
RTS has since resumed trading .
The exchange is playing down concerns that sensitive systems and data might have been exposed by the attack .
The attack on the Russian financial system came the day before the widespread Kama Sutra worm began destroying files on infected systems .
The effects of the worm were far less than first feared , but the malware did force Milan city hall to turn off 10,000 computers as a precaution after discovering its systems were riddled with infection on Thursday , and deciding there was n't enough time to mount an effective clean - up operation , AP reports . ®
Gorazd Božič in Tomi Dolenc : Važen je človek
Kategorija : Intervju Stroka | Datum objave : Friday , 15 . 09 . 2006 | Avtor : Domen Savič
Gorazd Božič ( levo ) je vodja Si-CERT -a , Tomi Dolenc je vodja projektov pri krovni organizaciji ARNES .
Oba sta velika strokovnjaka na področju spletne varnosti in tehničnega vidika medmrežja .
Z njima smo se pogovarjali o spletni varnosti , tehničnih vidikih e-demokracije in o težavah implementacije e-volitev .
Država na eni strani skuša slediti smernicam za e-demokracijo ter e-upravo , na drugi strani pa teh smernic ne spromovira oziroma jim dela slabo reklamo .
Božič : Mislim , da je to zelo analogno trenutni situaciji , kjer se vse bolj govori o ekonomskemu pogledu na varnost .
Nekaj let nazaj Microsofta ni zanimala spletna varnost – ker to ni prinašalo povečanega tržnega deleža .
V varnost so začeli investirati šele , ko jim je to prinašalo dobiček .
In mogoče bi lahko rekli , da je v politiki isto – politika naredi točno samo tisto , kar ji prinaša izboljšavo ratinga v družbi , ne glede na to , ali je predlagana rešitev z nekega abstraktnega stališča pametna ali pa gre za napako .
Meni osebno se zdijo biometrični potni listi popolna izguba denarja .
Vsi strokovnjaki po celem svetu to kategorično trdijo in argumentirajo , na drugi strani pa vse zahodne države uvajajo biometrične potne liste .

Božič :
Mogoče gre tukaj bolj za kritiko civilne družbe oziroma celotne populacije , ki je po mojem mnenju vedno bolj apatična .
Razumljivo je , da vlada zagovarja neke rešitve in jih v okviru nekega programa izpeljuje .
Če te rešitve niso v redu , je tudi na civilni družbi , da izrazi svoje mnenje .
Mogoče politika v določenem trenutku ne pomisli na vse zadeve in mislim da je tukaj stanje z leti šlo na slabše .
Vedno manj je kritičnih glasov , kot ena apatičnost oziroma zaspanost in mislim da se kolikor je meni znano , je to fenomen zahodnega sveta .

Pred kratkim je AOL izdal podatke o iskanjih preko svojega iskalnika , mene pa zanima , ali gre tukaj bolj za faktor tehnologije ali za napakami stoji človek ?
Božič : Zadaj vedno stoji človek , vseeno pa razvoj tehnologije omogoča veliko več , kot je omogočal pred desetimi leti .
Že samo dejstvo , da imamo tako velike prostorske kapacitete ( trdi diski ) je pripomoglo k temu , da AOL lahko beleži vse iskalne nize .
To , da so nizi prišli v javnost , je pa nedvomno človeška napaka .
Mogoče bi bila tukaj lahko tehnologija uporabljena za neko dodatno zaščito , ampak dvomim , da tehnologija tukaj igra vlogo krivca .
Dolenc : Človeški faktor se mi zdi vedno ključen .
Če se sam ne znaš zaščititi , te tehnologija sama tudi ne bo zaščitila .
Po drugi strani pa te tehnologija sama ne bo nikoli zlorabila , ampak je zadaj vedno človek , ki bo zlorabil tehnologijo .
[ audio : http://www.ljudmila.org/~savicd/arnes/zaupanje.mp3]
Dolenc : Paranoičen sem , ko vidim , kakšne zlorabe ta tehnologija omogoča .
In če se mi enkrat zazdi , da živim v svetu , kjer so neki veliki igralci , ki si želijo zaupanje zlorabit , bodisi s strani marketinga , ki nam hoče nekaj prodati , ali s strani države , ki skuša nadzirati državljane , ali pa realna nevarnost terorizma , ki ima za posledico nove vdore v zasebnost , potem nimaš občutka , kje se bo ta stvar nehala .
In če ljudje ne zaupajo državi in medijskemu okolju ( internetu ) , potem nimaš nobene osnove za e-demokracijo in e-upravo .
Če se bo ponavljal model diskriminacije ponudnika vsebin s strani ponudnika dostopa do interneta , potem uporabnik sploh ne bo vedel , kolikšen del “ sveta ” sploh vidi .
