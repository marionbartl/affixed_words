I had to do a double take when reading this from neo con lunatic William Kristol in the NY Times :
I do n’t pretend to know just what has to be done .
But I suspect
that free - marketers need to be less doctrinaire and less
simple - mindedly utility - maximizing , and that they should depend less on
abstract econometric models .
I think they ’ll have to take much more
seriously the task of thinking through what are the right rules of the
road for both the private and public sectors .
They ’ll have to figure

out what institutional barriers and what monetary , fiscal and legal
guardrails are needed for the accountability , transparency and responsibility that allow free markets to work .
And I do n’t see why conservatives ought to defend a system that permits
securitizing mortgages ( or car loans ) in a way that seems to make the
lenders almost unaccountable for the risk while spreading it ,
toxically , everywhere else .
I do n’t see why a commitment to free
markets requires permitting banks or bank - like institutions to leverage
their assets at 30 to 1 .
There ’s nothing conservative about letting
free markets degenerate into something close to Karl Marx ’s vision of
an atomizing , irresponsible and self - devouring capitalism .

Could reality actually be having an effect on the man who was wrong on just about everything he has ever said ?
Kristol may have a fantasy view of the outside world and an unhealthy obsession with American military power , but he seems to get that the current economic system is completely insane , and most of all , not in the slightest bit conservative .
The Original Mountain Marathon ( OMM ) has been held in different locations each year since 1968 when the inaugural event took place in Muker in the North Pennines .
This year 's 41st running was the first time in its history it has had to be cancelled .
The perennial tale about church fundraising is that it's to rebuild the steeple .
But one church in Lichfield , Staffordshire , faced a different fundraising problem : to pay a £ 6,000 bill demanded for photographs used on its website .
The case came to the attention of Gavin Drake , the communications director for the diocese 's 600 churches .
In creating the church 's website , a volunteer had included a couple of images sourced from Getty , a large picture agency , without paying for them .
A couple of months later , Getty sent the church a demand for £ 6,000 .
" The issue is not that photographs are free on the net for anyone to use , but that enforcement has to be done properly .
Getty was basically bullying , " Drake says .
A former freelance journalist , he adds : " I know the value of images . "
Offer declined
Drake told the church they 'd been foolish .
" I then tried to talk to Getty about it , and their policy was ' they 're our pictures , we 'll charge what we want to charge ' .
I worked through the process and pricing system and came up with a couple of hundred pounds .
On behalf of the church , I offered Getty that amount if that was what they would commercially charge , and they declined and insisted they wanted the whole lot .
I pointed out some recent court cases in which photographers ' images had been used wilfully by national publications - over a period of time and many images .
They had had to pay much less than this and therefore if they wished to take it to court they could explain why the images were worth it . "
After some back and forth , in which Getty offered to take half , Drake says : " In the end I said to the church that Getty was not playing ball or following the normal litigation or dispute resolution procedures and to ignore them .
We do n't deal with bullies ; we deal with legal threats appropriately .
I told them by letter that 's what they were doing , that we were not going to play , and did n't hear any more . "
Drake now regularly reminds all churches to ensure that all the images they use are fully licensed .
Dozens of small businesses and charities tell similar stories .
On the online forums run by the Federation of Small Businesses , copyright infringement blows away every other subject .
Many of those posting on the federation 's forum have tried to do everything right ; they are n't arguing about copyright .
It 's the enforcement tactics they find objectionable .
Two years ago Brian Weir of Toucher Web Design received a letter from another picture agency , Corbis , via the law firm Baker & McKenzie , accusing him of stealing a vector graphic and demanding £ 2,400 .
" It was the image of a shopping cart , " he says .
When the letter arrived , he removed the graphic and sourced a new one from istockphoto.com ( since bought by Getty ) for less than $ 5 ( £ 3.30 ) .
" I really took fright when I saw it at first , " he says .
Besides the financial threat , there 's the reputation damage : " I do n't want to be associated with copyright theft , whether they 're right or wrong . "
When negotiating failed , he did n't pay up ; he 's heard nothing further .
Small organisations are the ones at risk .
Large companies have in - house staff to design websites and check copyright status .
Small ones may commission a volunteer or a cut - price designer , download a template , assume they have rights to images on a purchased CD or included with software , or thoughtlessly copy a small graphic .
Letters demanding large sums are scary , and it's not surprising if many recipients settle .
Those posting on the federation 's forum say that requests for a breakdown of the charges or proof of ownership , or responses that the image came as part of a paid - for template , are all ignored .
The virtual law firm Limeone has dealt with more than 300 of Getty 's infringement claims , plus some from Corbis , primarily for clients where the original source of the images is unclear .
Says Janine Hughes of Limeone : " Once we get involved generally Getty does back off .
I think the main problem Getty has is proving when images came into their possession .
It 's clear in some of our dealings with them that they have practical problems in establishing that .
It 's a massive problem for them with respect to evidence . "
Out of their depth
So far none of LimeOne 's clients has been taken to court , not even the limited company that was asked for £ 50,000 in damages .
Hughes directs people to the Court Service website , which lays out the rules for making intellectual property claims .
Instead of issuing court proceedings
Getty commonly sends in a debt collector .
" They will turn up on the premises , and a lot of small businesses feel out of their depth , " says Hughes .
Corbis 's senior counsel , Claire Keeley , says many infringements are reported by the photographers themselves .
Some are found by the sales team .
More are found via Digimark 's digital watermarking and the spidering service Picscout .
Keeley notes that one ( unidentified ) vendor Corbis works with nets a " small portion " of the recovered money .
She says : " I would hope that people would n't be intimidated , but we have to walk a fine line - we have to make it clear that it 's important and necessary . "
Ultimately , she adds : " My goal is to make my job obsolete .
The ideal scenario is we have businesses properly licensing these images through sales channels . "
Alison Crombie of Getty says : " The thing we try to do is just have a conversation with the customer .
We make them aware that it has happened and that they need to look at addressing it and making sure it 's licensed .
It goes into writing at the point when there 's denial of use or people saying they did n't know . "
Most of the time , she says , " that gets resolved . "
As for the valuations , " we only send out our bills according to what average usage would cost " .
And , she says : " We do negotiate with people , if people genuinely make a mistake . "
Numbers ' not plausible '
Despite Crombie 's conviction that " whatever we 're doing it definitely will be legal " , it 's uncertain whether sending in a debt collector , or the company 's valuations , would stand up in court .
Nicholas Bohm of the Law Society says : " It certainly is n't a debt in any legal analysis .
You can't incur a debt unless you have consented to it .
It makes them liable for damages , but it 's not a debt . "
The amount , he says , " can only be quantified by agreement or by the judgement of a court " .
In the UK , he says , court awards " ought to be supposedly reflective of the claimant 's loss . "
A lot depends on what the market rates are .
" If they can get $ 10 a day for a licence for five years and people are actually paying them , then there is a genuine market out there and they have a basis for saying this is what it 's worth . "
But , he says : " The numbers mentioned do n't seem plausible to me . "
They do n't seem plausible to photographer Tony Sleep ( halftone.co.uk ) either .
" In the UK they 'd struggle to make these amounts stick , " he says .
" UK law is only concerned with restoring the situation had licensing been correctly obtained .
The courts do n't like to be used as a means of extortion . "
Drake says : " I understand the difficulty companies like Getty have and photographers have - they have a product that needs to be protected .
But where is the Getty publicity campaign ?
Why are n't they issuing press releases and education to remind people that these images are not to be used ? "
Media companies using the image library sites know the rules .
" But it 's not about media companies any more - it 's kids , churches , schools . "
Getty , he says needs " to run a media campaign " .

New York City Orders Churches to Stop Sheltering Homeless People
This is just unbelievable .
New York City has told twenty two churches that they may no longer shelter homeless people .
Let me write that again in case you thought that you misread it .
New York City has told twenty two churches that they may no longer shelter homeless people .
City officials have ordered 22 New York churches to stop providing beds to homeless people .
With temperatures well below freezing early Saturday , the churches must obey a city rule requiring faith - based shelters to be open at least five days a week — or not at all .
Arnold Cohen , president of the Partnership for the Homeless , a nonprofit that serves as a link with the city , said he had to tell the churches they no longer qualify .
He said hundreds of people now wo n’t have a place to sleep .
I am not sure how the separation of church and state , that Thomas Jefferson wrote about to the Danbury Baptists in 1802 which was somehow subsequently interpreted into the constitution , would allow the state to tell a church that they can no longer help the homeless .
But that is what they have done .
Perhaps the government is jealous because somebody else is able to help those that ca n’t help themselves .
The government wants to be the sole provider of those who are less fortunate .
That is what the big government nanny state is all about , government control through government dependency .
They view the church as providing something that the government wants the people to rely on them for and they feel threatened .
So they must stop the church from providing shelter to the homeless so that these people will have to look toward Big Brother for help .
Where these people go for help really should be of no concern to the government if they truly believed in helping them but they do n’t .
They only want them dependent on the government to insure building a voter base .
I find this disgusting .
They care more about potential votes than the actual welfare of the people .
China 's internet giant Baidu has promised to overhaul its operations after state media accused it of allowing unlicensed medical services to buy high search rankings .
The search engine dominates the market in the world 's largest internet population , with around 60 % of users — well ahead of Google , which leads the field internationally .
But the case caused Baidu stocks to plummet and highlighted users ' complaints about the way the Nasdaq - listed firm allows companies to buy their way into search results .
Robin Li , Baidu 's chief executive , told the state news agency Xinhua today that the firm had sacked staff and more could follow .
He said : " Baidu employees who are found to have been involved in the scandal will be penalised …
We have already fired people who helped fabricate documents for unlicensed suppliers .
" We have removed the key words of all four clients mentioned in the report and have begun to double - check the licences of all other hospitals and pharmacies on our client list . "
Baidu said in a statement that it had removed paid search listings for firms which were unable to file their licence details , pending checks .
Those customers together account for around 10 % - 15 % of Baidu 's revenues , the statement added .
The state - run China Central Television ( CCT ) reported earlier this month that the search rankings had steered people suffering from illness to unlicensed and expensive hospitals or to medicines that failed to cure them .
One patient told the broadcaster he spent more than 10,000 yuan ( £ 950 ) at a clinic , as it topped Baidu 's results , but it failed to cure his abdominal pain , which was subsequently treated successfully by a public hospital for 100 yuan .
The unlicensed clinic paid Baidu almost 17 yuan a click to get a prominent ranking , according to the report .
CCT also alleged that some companies which did not pay were omitted from results .
But in a statement , the internet firm insisted : " Baidu has never excluded websites of any customers because they did not pay for keywords , and Baidu does not tolerate such practices . "
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - China crossed the line first in the race for big oil contracts in post - Saddam Iraq and has gained a head start over Western oil majors in the competition for future energy deals .

China ’s biggest oil company , state - run CNPC , agreed a $ 3 billion service contract with Iraq on Wednesday .
The deal could set a precedent for terms that fall far short of the lucrative contracts the oil majors had hoped for as they jostled for access to the world ’s third largest oil reserves .
Starved of investment since the Gulf War of 1990 - 1991 and the subsequent U.S. - led invasion of 2003 that removed former President Saddam Hussein , Iraq holds some of the world ’s last large , cheap , untapped oil reservoirs .
“ The biggest significance of this deal is that CNPC will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in Iraq in the new era , ” said Alex Munton , analyst at global consultancy Wood Mackenzie .
“ They will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with Iraq ’s oil ministry . ”
Now CNPC and China ’s other state - supported oil firms are likely to face off with Western oil companies in a bid round for other long - term contracts to enhance giant fields already in production .
Iraq aims to sign those deals in mid-2009 .
Baghdad needs billions of dollars of investment to overhaul and expand its energy sector after years of sanctions and war .
Energy - hungry China has already provided tough competition for Western oil majors in Africa .
Chinese state oil companies can take on more risk than big oil firms as securing future energy supplies is a matter of strategy rather than profit .
“ Given traditional markets have been dominated by well - established international oil companies , new entrants such as CNPC have to focus on new markets , ” said Gong Jinshuang , a researcher with a think tank run by CNPC .
The revised deal could prove to be on worse terms than the original signed with Saddam but that would be a pragmatic choice , he added .
TOUGH TERMS
CNPC faced no competition for Adhab , a renegotiated contract first signed under Saddam in 1997 .
Full details have yet to emerge , but it is know that the new service contract is for a set fee , a change from the initial production sharing agreement
( PSA ) .
Production sharing contracts were common in the 1980s and 1990s in the days before oil prices shot up , when the oil majors held the whip hand over producer countries who competed with each other for investor capital by offering generous terms .
“ This deal is a ‘ game changer ’ in my view , ” said Jason Kenny , oil analyst at ING in Edinburgh .
“ The majors are going to have to seriously rethink their returns criteria and resource ownership flexibility . ”
Oil majors prefer PSAs as they get a share of output , providing an incentive to maximize production and allowing them a share of revenues from any oil price rise .
But governments of oil producers worldwide have moved to take a bigger slice of record oil income , PSAs have become rarer and set - fee contracts more prevalent .
Baghdad has yet to say publicly what contract model it will adopt for fields already discovered but not yet producing such as Adhab .
But the CNPC deal may have set a tough standard .
“ This could set a precedent for Iraq , ” said Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East energy analyst for Global Insight .
“ Looking forward to future bidding rounds , Iraq could cease to be that opportunity that people had hoped for and become a different play altogether . ”
ISOLATED CASE ?
Others said the Adhab deal may be an exception , not a template .
The deal is to develop a billion - barrel field to feed an oil - fired power plant with capacity of 1,320 megawatts to be built by another Chinese firm , Wood Mackenzie ’s Munton said .
Iraq is short of power and Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani has come under political pressure to do more to meet domestic electricity demand .
“ It ’s difficult to see this having a wider implication for the majors and other contracts , ” said Munton .
“ This is a self - contained project , and is different in many ways to the large - scale projects to boost oil capacity elsewhere in Iraq . ”
Adhab could bode well for other projects linked to power generation , such as Royal Dutch Shell ’s scheme to capture associated gas that is currently flared at oilfields in southern Iraq .
Oil majors will hope that Shahristani ’s signing of Iraq ’s first long - term oil contract might prove good news rather than bad .
“ If anything this is a sign that Iraq is serious about these long - term contracts and that Shahristani can get them signed , ” said one oil company executive whose company is in the hunt for Iraq deals .
“ This will focus big oil companies even more on the upcoming bid round . ”

As usual , it ’s not Watergate , it ’s just slightly irritating .
“ Down ’s births increase in a caring Britain ” , said the Times : “ More babies are being born with Down ’s syndrome as parents feel increasingly that society is a more welcoming place for children with the condition . ”
That ’s beautiful .
“ More mothers are choosing to keep their babies when diagnosed with Down ’s Syndrome ” said the Mail .
“ Parents appear to be more willing to bring a child with Down ’s syndrome into the world because British society has become increasingly accepting of the genetic abnormality ” said the Independent .
“ Children ’s quality of life is better and acceptance has risen ” , said The Mirror .
Their quoted source was no less impeccable than a BBC Radio 4 documentary presented by Felicity Finch ( her what plays Ruth Archer ) , broadcast on Monday .
“ The number of babies with down syndrome has steadly fallen , that is until today , when for the first time ever that number is higher than before , when testing was introduced . ” I see .
“ I ’m keen to find out why more parents are making this decision . ”
They ’re not .
“ I was so intrigued by these figures that I ’ve been following some parents to find out what lies behind their choice . ”
Felicity .
Wait a second .
The entire founding premise of your entire 27 minute documentary is wrong .
There has indeed been a 4 % increase in Down ’s syndrome live births in England and Wales from 1989 to 2006 ( 717 and 749 affected births in the two years respectively ) .
However , since 1989 there has also been a far greater increase in the number of Down syndrome foetuses created in the first place , because people are getting pregnant much later in life .
What causes Down syndrome ?
We do n’t really know , but maternal age is the only well - recognised association .
Your risk of a Down syndrome pregnancy below the age of 25 is about 1 in 1600 .
This rises to about 1 in 340 at 35 , and 1 in 40 at the age of 43 .
In 1989 6 % of pregnant women were over 35 years of age .
By 2006 it was 15 % .
The National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register holds probably the largest single dataset on Down syndrome , with over 17,000 anonymous records collected since 1989 , and one of the most reliable resources in the search for patterns and possible causal factors .
They have calculated that if you account for the increase in the age at which people are becoming pregnant , the number of Down ’s Syndrome live births in the UK would have increased from 1989 to 2006 : not by 4 % , but from 717 to an estimated 1454 , if screening and subsequent terminations had not been available .
Except , of course , antenatal screening is widely available , it is widely taken up , and contrary to what every newspaper told you this week , it is widely acted upon .
More than 9 out of ten women who have an antenatal diagnosis of Down ’s syndrome decide to have a termination of the pregnancy .
This proportion has not changed since 1989 .
This is the “ decisions ” that Felicity Finch , Radio 4 , the Mail , the Times , the Mirror , and the rest are claiming more parents are taking : to carry on with a Down syndrome pregnancy .
This is what they are taking as evidence of a more caring society .
But the figure has not changed .
Crass and insensitive moral reasoning helps nobody .
If I terminate a Down syndrome pregnancy , is that proof that society is not a warm caring place , and that I am not a warm caring person ?
For many parents the decision to terminate will be a difficult and upsetting one , especially later in life , and stories like this make a pretty challenging backdrop for making it .
This would have been true even if their figures had been correct , but as is so often the case , for those with spare flesh to wave at strangers , their facts and figures are simply incorrect .
The National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register felt obliged to issue a thorough clarification .
The thoroughly brilliant “ Behind the Headlines ” service on the NHS Choices website took the story to pieces , as they so often do , in their daily round up of the real evidence behind the health news ( disclosure : I had a trivially tiny hand in helping to set this service up ) .
Everybody ignored them , nobody has clarified , and “ Born With Down ’s ” remains Radio 4 ’s “ Choice of the Day ” on the Radio 4 website .

" Where are we going ? "
We heard it over and over on Saturday as we marched along with the procession -- about 4 hours , and nearly 10 miles of walking .
" Where are we going ? " people kept asking each other .
The answer turned out to be ( with linked photos ) : Civic Center to Octavia > and the Castro and then back up Market to Union Square , Chinatown , North Beach , along the Embarcadero to Market and then back to Civic Center .
We 'd estimate that there were a thousand people at one point ; and by the end , as the most ardent protesters dragged their way to Civic Center , it was probably down to 100 .
We left the crowd at that point and went home ; later , we were in the Castro , and spotted the protesters again in the middle of the street until around 10 pm .
So who was steering the crowd ?
It varied .
Like Canada geese , various folks wandered in and out of the lead , with a few superstars generally taking charge .
We observed Shirtless Orange Flag Guy , and Determined Tank Top Dude , and HRC Flag Man and Captain Megaphone , and for a while a bunch of Socialists -- all more or less making it up as they went along ; and in general , we 'd say they did a pretty good job .
But then .
There was that crazy march back to the Castro to sit in the intersection for hours .
What was that about , and what should they have done instead ?
Answers after the jump .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
The original construction plans believed used for a major expansion of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in 1941 have been found in a Berlin flat , Germany ’s Bild newspaper reported on Saturday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The daily printed three architect ’s drawings on yellowing paper from the batch of 28 pages of blueprints it obtained .
One has an 11.66 meter by 11.20 meter room marked “ Gaskammer ” ( gas chamber ) that was part of a “ delousing facility . ”
No one from the federal government ’s archives was immediately available for comment on the authenticity or importance of the documents .
The plans , published ahead of the 70th anniversary of the “ Kristallnacht ” or the Nazi pogrom that was a harbinger of the Holocaust , also include a crematorium and a “ L. Keller ” -- an abbreviation for “ Leichenkeller ” or corpse cellar .
A drawing of the building for Auschwitz ’s main gate was also found in the documents that Bild said were believed to have been discovered when a Berlin flat was cleaned out .
The mass - circulation newspaper quoted Hans - Dieter Kreikamp , head of the federal archives office in Berlin , as saying the blueprints offered “ authentic evidence of the systematically planned genocide of European Jews . ”
There were mass killings of about one million Jews before the Nazi ’s “ Final Solution ” was formulated in late 1941 .
The decision to kill Europe ’s 11 million Jews was made at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942 .
A copy of the minutes , known as the “ Wannsee Protocol , ” is one of the most important documents from the war .
The newly found Auschwitz blueprints are dated October 23 1941 and could offer historians earlier evidence of Nazi plans to kill Jews on a mass scale , Bild said .
“ These documents reveal that everyone who had even anything remotely to do with the planning and construction of the concentration camp must have know that people were to be gassed to death in assembly - line fashion , ” Bild wrote .
“ The documents refute once and for all claims by those who deny the Holocaust even took place , ” it added .
The concentration camp at Auschwitz - Birkenau in Poland was the largest -- at least 1.1 million Jews were killed there .
Auschwitz I was set up in May 1940 in an old Polish army barracks .
The first victims were gassed in September 1941 .
Auschwitz II , or Birkenau , opened in October 1941 .
Four large gas chambers were added to the camp in January 1942 .
Cracking , popping , or snapping joints is a common experience for many individuals .
Some people make their joints crack , while others have cracking and creaking joints with normal activities .
The good news is that there is no evidence that typical knuckle cracking or joint creaks will cause arthritis .
Causes of a Cracking , Creaking , or Popping Joint
Different conditions may cause a cracking joint , and the problem is not always clear .
In most cases , the exact cause of a crack joint cannot be determined .
Some causes may include :
Gas Bubbles
The slow accumulation of gases around a joint can cause the formation of tiny bubbles of gas .
Joint cracking may occur when these gases are released .
Tendons or Ligaments
Tendons and ligaments cross over the joints .
These structures may pop or crack as they snap over the bony prominences around the joint .
Arthritis
Damage to the joint surface , the cartilage , can cause cracking joints .
However , this type of joint cracking usually is found in older patients who have known arthritis .
It is uncommon for a patient 's first complaint of arthritis to be joint cracking .
Does It Cause Arthritis ?
It 's unlikely that joint cracking is a significant cause of arthritis .
Joint cracking is usually painless , and so long as it does not cause pain , most doctors agree that you are unlikely to be doing any harm .
There are some conditions that can cause joint cracking that need to be addressed , but these tend to cause symptoms of pain .
If you have joint cracking that causes pain , you should be evaluated by your doctor .
Otherwise , you are not likely to be causing any problems , including arthritis , by your joint cracking .
When the noise is coming from your joints are associated with pain , there could be sources of the pain including loose cartilage in the joint , swelling , and other problems that may need to be addressed .
Causes of Arthritis
There are certain conditions and activities that can lead to the development of arthritis .
Some of these so - called ' risk factors ' are things you can control , and others are things you are stuck with .
Among the common causes of arthritis , are the following :
Age :
As we get older , arthritis becomes more common .
Joint cartilage is not made to last forever , and cartilage has very limited capacity to heal or regenerate .
For this reason , once you lose cartilage , you are unlikely to ever get it back .
That 's why we focus so heavily on preventing the progression of arthritis .
Genetics :
Our parents , or more precisely , our genetics are likely to blame for making certain individuals more likely to develop joint swelling and pain .
Some people are born with cartilage that seems to last , and joints that do n't wear out .
Others have anatomy that leads to the development of early joint problems .
Body Weight : People who are heavier are much more likely to wear out their joints , especially in their knees , hips , and spine .
Because the cartilage has to carry the added burden of the excess body weight , the cartilage is more likely to wear away .
Injury : Previous injury to the joint surface can cause damage to the joint cartilage that may not heal .
The result of this damage may be the early onset of an arthritic joint .
A Word From Verywell
Contrary to what you may have been told over the years , cracking of your joints has not been shown to be a cause of arthritis later in life .
When joint cracking or popping is painful , it is probably worthwhile to have this evaluated to see if there is an underlying source of the pain .
Painless noises coming from the joints may have a number of different sources , but most often this is not of clinical consequence and does not lead to the development of arthritis in your joint .
The militants say they are fighting to bring more money to the Niger Delta Militants in Nigeria 's oil - rich Niger Delta region say they have " declared war " on the government after battling security forces guarding facilities .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( Mend ) said it was responding to attacks by the military .
The military said it had repelled several Mend attacks .
Both sides say their opponents suffered heavy losses .
Mend 's violent campaign for a bigger part of the area 's oil wealth has cut Nigeria 's oil output by more than 20 % .
Mend militants are the largest of several armed groups operating in the impoverished delta region .
They frequently kidnap foreign oil workers and sabotage oil installations and pipelines .
Nigerian President Umaru Yar 'adua is under pressure to crack down on the militants and make the delta safer for international oil firms .
Lawless region
In an email released by Mend , the group said it had launched an " oil war " on the government in response to what it described as unprovoked aerial attacks on its bases in the Niger Delta .
The group said its heavily - armed fighters had fanned out in hundreds of boats to attack oil installations in Rivers state .
" The operation will continue until the government of Nigeria appreciates that the solution to peace in the Niger Delta is justice , respect and dialogue , " the group said .
An oil platform at Kula , operated by oil giant Chevron , was among the facilities targeted , Mend said , adding that 22 Nigerian troops had been killed in the attack .
A Nigerian military spokesman said they had repelled an attack on an oil platform operated by the US company , Chevron .
He said the militants had suffered heavy casualties .
The Niger Delta region is the source of most of the Nigerian government 's income , yet it remains blighted by poverty and corruption .

Update : Complete and unedited transcript of our interview here .
In today 's episode of Boing Boing tv :
One year ago , a 19 - year - old MIT engineering student named Star Simpson got dressed to go pick up a friend at Boston 's Logan airport .
She pulled a hoodie out of her closet , a wearable tech design she 'd made with a light - up LED - circuit on the chest .
In her hand was a small pink rose she 'd crafted from hardened clay , a gift for her friend .
A few hours later at the airport , after an airport employee mistook her sweatshirt for a bomb and the rose for an explosive implement , Star found herself surrounded by 40 armed police who believed she was a suicide bomber .
She was arrested for " possessing a hoax device , " and an unprecedented media frenzy ensued .
Here was the Boing Boing post from that day .
A year later , after a long series of court dates , a Boston judge ruled that Star must perform community service and make a public apology .
Star says she intended no harm .
She believes the authorities were unfairly harsh with her long after it was obvious she posed no threat , and that legal proceedings were unduly influenced by a prevailing atmosphere of anxiety over terrorism ( this just months after a similar case in Boston ) .
She has since dropped out of MIT , and says the school 's reaction felt like " being disowned . "
She has moved out of Boston in part because of recurring threats and attacks from strangers .
Star has finally come forward to tell her side of the story publicly , and she does so on Boing Boing tv today .

On November 17 , at the SuperSpeed USB ( USB 3.0 ) Developers Conference , the specifications for USB 3.0 will be released
The spec is expected to offer an incredible 10 times the speed of USB 2.0 .
Unfortunately for Windows users , there are rumours that Windows 7 wo n’t support USB 3.0 due to development time constraints … whether that is actually the case , time will tell .
To give you an idea of the difference in transfer speeds :
USB 1.0 : 9.3 hours
USB 2.0 : 13.9 minutes
USB 3.0 : 70 seconds
Can you say fast ?

A game of Monopoly being played by the Henderson family of Watford took a surprise twist today when the Bank of England stepped in with a rescue package to save one of the key players , Mr Henderson , from what the Chancellor described as ‘ almost certain bankruptcy . ’
The deal , which had been thrashed out in the early hours between Alistair Darling and Mr Henderson , who was acting as the banker , means that each player will receive a £ 1 billion pound injection of cash , ( although this may take some time to count out what with having to use up all the yellow one pound notes ) .
The short - term borrowing deal led to furious protests from the rest of the Henderson family , who complained that it was unfair to use their money to bail out Mr Henderson so that he could go back to ripping them off .
As Mrs Henderson put it ‘ He ’s the one who spent recklessly at the start of the game .
He was going around in a top - hat buying up properties like Old Kent Road .
And now they ’re worthless he expects us to get him out of the mess he ’s in . ’
However , Alistair Darling insisted that the measures were necessary .
‘ Demand for the little houses and hotels had reached an all - time low .
We are revising earlier predictions that we would actually run out of little green houses and have to use the counters from ‘ Coppit ’ instead . ’
Mr Henderson had tried to raise money by auctioning Mayfair , but no bids were forthcoming – not even when he offered to throw in Fenchurch Street Station and ‘ let them off the first time they landed on one of his hotels ’ .
Tension in the game had been high after Mrs Henderson had won second prize in a beauty contest , and Mr Henderson had joked ‘ Yeah , but there were only two people in it !’
In an emergency statement to the House of Commons , Gordon Brown gave his backing to the rescue package , warning that there was simply no option .
‘ If we allow Mr Henderson to go bankrupt , others will follow , and in time there will only be one winner . ’
Ignoring cries of ‘ Is n’t that the whole point ? ’ the Prime Minister went on to reveal that as a condition of the loan , players would have to show more responsibility in future .
‘ There will be no more of this paying yourself £ 200 just for passing Go. Players have to learn that there is no such thing as a Get Out Of Jail Free Card …
Oh hang on what ’s this ? ’

Earlier this month saw the publication of my eleventh novel , Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks , a satire on the efforts of the religious lobby , the psychic charlatans and their incurably credulous dupes to wage war on science and impose their “ no , we ’ve no evidence , we just like the notion ” philosophy upon our children ’s education .
The novel is dedicated to James Randi and Richard Dawkins , and never before has my choice of dedicatees occasioned so much discussion .
In certain quarters it has been interpreted as a calculated act of provocation , as though these two names were imbued with such talismanic significance that the mere invocation of them was tantamount to a blood - curdling battle cry .
The dedication has also been depicted as the first declaration of intent in “ a novel with an agenda ” ; to which I would respond that it shows how far the pendulum requires to be swung back in our society if the advocacy of rational thought is perceived as “ an agenda ” .
And , with a certain inevitability , it has been suggested that this dedication – and indeed the entire undertaking of the novel – represents some form of opportunistic bandwagon - hopping .
I think the type of person who holds this last opinion must derive comfort from the word “ bandwagon ” , with its connotations of something transient and superficial ; so much less burdened with worrying implications than the term “ groundswell ” .
In keeping with a novel depicting scientific investigation into the paranormal , the truth turns out to be more straightforward and prosaic : it is a simple act of stating my thanks ; of acknowledging a debt of inspiration and enlightenment to two people whose work so fired my imagination that I embarked upon this book .
The genus of the novel came three years ago when I was preparing to write a horror screenplay and found myself researching demon lore and other “ unexplained ” supernatural phenomena .
What I discovered , admittedly with a slight degree of disappointment , was that all the phenomena I looked into were in fact adequately and irrefutably explained , but certain parties simply did n’t like those explanations and preferred to stick with their own , utterly unsubstantiated ones ( see above re “ no , we ’ve no evidence , we just like the notion ” ) .
I became captivated by the narrative of sceptical , rational and scientific inquiry into the supposedly paranormal , a field in which James Randi ’s front - line experience and writing both excel .
As an author of crime fiction , I found the detective work , revelations and stings in Randi ’s exposes of Uri Geller , Peter Popoff and others as page - turningly exciting as the most finely crafted thrillers .
Suddenly divested of my inhibiting preconceptions regarding the impenetrability of science writing , I dipped my toes into Dawkins and found myself exhilarated .
I am constantly bemused to see him depicted as “ Darwin ’s Rottweiler ” and described as an aggressive polemicist ; what engages me about Dawkins ’ writing is its joy , passion and boyish excitement , its infectious desire to include and to illuminate .
Sure , I also enjoy his waspish humour , but it is always allied to warmth and compassion , and when he deploys his weaponry , it is in defence of something he cherishes which we should all wish to protect .
Thus moved , excited and inspired , I wanted to dramatise this struggle between the open - minded inquiry of science and the infantile self - indulgence of those who believe that open - mindedness involves attributing an equivalency to solid evidence and notions that “ we just like ” .
The question you are most asked as an author is : “ where do you get your ideas from ? ”
Put simply , Randi and Dawkins gave me an idea for a book , and I dedicated it to them out of gratitude .
If by doing so I have annoyed certain people , then that was not my intention – merely a bonus . ■
Enlarge By Ben Curtis , AP Archaeology workers dig at the site of a newly - discovered pyramid , the base of which is seen center - left , at Saqqara near Cairo .
SAQQARA , Egypt  Archaeologists have discovered a new pyramid under the sands of Saqqara , an ancient burial site that remains largely unexplored and has yielded a string of unearthed pyramids in recent years , Egypt 's antiquities chief announced Tuesday .
The 4,300 - year - old monument most likely belonged to the queen mother of the founder of Egypt 's 6th Dynasty , several hundred years after the building of the famed Great Pyramids of Giza , the country 's antiquities chief Zahi Hawass said as he took media on a tour of the find .
The discovery is part of the sprawling necropolis and burial site of the rulers of ancient Memphis , the capital of Egypt 's Old Kingdom , about 12 miles ( 19 kilometers ) south of Giza .
All that remains of the pyramid is a square - shaped 16 - foot ( 5 - meter ) tall structure that had been buried under 65 feet ( 25 meters ) of sand .
" There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath , " said Hawass .
Hawass ' team has been excavating at the location for two years , but he said it was only two months ago when they determined the structure , with sides about 72 feet ( 22 meters ) long , was the base of a pyramid .
They also found parts of the pyramid's white limestone casing — believed to have once covered the entire structure — which enabled them to calculate that the complete pyramid was once 45 feet ( 14 meters ) high .
The pyramid is the 118th discovered so far in Egypt .
" To find a new pyramid is always exciting , " said Hawass .
" And this one is magical .
It belonged to a queen . "
Hawass said he believes the pyramid belongs to Queen Sesheshet , who is thought to have played a significant role in establishing the 6th Dynasty and uniting two branches of the feuding royal family .
Her son , Teti , is believed to have ruled for around 20 years until he was possibly assassinated , a sign of the time 's turbulence .
Evidence of the identification is still indirect .
The pyramids of Teti's two wives , already discovered 100 years ago and in 1994 respectively , lie next to it as part of the burial complex alongside the collapsed pyramid of Teti himself .
The Egyptian team is still diging and is two weeks from entering the burial chamber inside the pyramid , where Hawass hopes they will find proof of its owner — a sarcophagus or at least an inscription of the queen , he said .
Finding anything more would be next to impossible , as robbers in antiquity looted the pyramid , Hawass added , pointing to a gaping shaft on the structure 's top that remains a testament to the thieves ' actions .
Dieter Wildung , head of Berlin 's Egyptian Museum and a leading Egyptologists in Europe , said Hawass ' claim is plausible because it was common in the Old Kingdom for kings to build pyramids for their queens and mothers next to their own .
" Hawass is likely right , " Wildung , who is not involved in the dig , said in a phone interview .
" These parallel situations give a very strong argument in favor of his interpretation . "
Joe Wegner , an associate professor of Egyptian archaeology at University of Pennsylvania who has been involved in other expeditions at Saqqara , cautioned that until " inscriptional confirmation is found , it 's still an educated guess " that the pyramid is Sesheshet's .
Although evidence of the queen 's existence was found elsewhere in Egypt in inscriptions and a papyrus document — a medical prescription to strengthen the queen 's thinning hair — the site of her burial was not known .
The find is important because it adds to the understanding of the 6th Dynasty , which lasted from 2,322 B.C. to 2,151 B.C.
It was the last dynasty of the Old Kingdom , which spanned the 3rd millennium B.C. and was the first peak of pharaonic civilization .
Saqqara is most famous for the Step Pyramid of King Djoser , built in the 27th century B.C.
Only a third of the Saqqara complex been explored so far , and recent digging has turned up a number of key finds .
The last new pyramid found there three years ago is thought to belong to the wife of Teti 's successor , Pepi I. In June , Hawass ' team unveiled a " rediscovery " at Saqqara — a pyramid believed to have been built by King Menkauhor , an obscure pharaoh whose pyramid was first discovered in 1842 by German archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius .
But desert sands later covered the pyramid and archaeologists were unable to find Menkauhor 's resting place until three months ago .

Advocates for the opening of the " white spaces " were rewarded with a resounding victory earlier this month when the FCC unanimously voted in favor of allowing unlicensed use of the unused spectrum between TV channels .
( For a more complete explanation of white spaces , check out our earlier blog post . )
While FCC Chairman Kevin Martin had telegraphed his support for white spaces at the conclusion of technical trials , the landslide vote opens doors for innovation and is a victory for the public over the entrenched media incumbents .
However , it 's important to consider the remaining variables in play .
The end goal is better wireless broadband access in America -- more Internet , in more places , at lower cost .
While innovators have been given a significant green light by the FCC through this vote , there are other milestones to be met and obstacles to overcome : a possible legal challenge from the broadcasters , full implementation of spectrum avoidance technology , and FCC certification of consumer - ready devices .
These will all have an effect on the amount of time it takes for white space devices to reach consumers .
Regardless , the FCC 's unanimous approval is a major win for the public .
It 's easy to imagine the FCC playing it safe and succumbing to the incumbent broadcasters instead , closing the gates on improved wireless technology at the outset .
But the current Commission 's commitment to innovation , its investment in researching the technology , and the efforts of public interest groups and regular folks speaking out made the difference and is paving the way for a better future in wireless broadband .

The Thai government today rejected calls from the country 's powerful army chief to dissolve parliament and call a new election because of escalating anti-government protests .
The crisis deepened as a pro-government gang shot dead an opposition protester in the northern province of Chiang Mai .
The embattled prime minister , Somchai Wongsawat , was due to address the nation on television but this was cancelled at the last minute .
The shot man , whose son ran a small anti-government radio station , was dragged by the gang from his car and executed , police Lieutenant Colonel Atipol Thongdaeng told Reuters .
The army chief , General Anupong Paochina , urged the government to step down and called for a withdrawal by demonstrators who shut down the country 's main airport , leaving thousands of tourists stranded .
Nattawut Saikuar , a government spokesman , said : " The prime minister has said many times that he will not quit or dissolve parliament because he has been democratically elected .
That still stands . "
Somchai returned to Thailand today after an Asia - Pacific summit in Peru and is due to have an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Thai media reported that Somchai landed at a military airport in the north of the country .
His flight had to be rerouted and his handlers were careful not to give details of his destination .
Reports said he might declare a state of emergency in Bangkok .
The demonstrators , from the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , rejected Anupong 's demands .
A spokesman , Suriyasai Katasila , said the group would meet later to decide its next steps .
" But right now , our demand remains the same .
If the government does not quit , we will not quit , " he said .
The group has rejected a government offer of talks to end the airport blockade .
It is insisting Somchai resign first .
At a news conference outlining a four - point plan to end the turmoil , Anupong repeated his view that a military coup would not resolve the deepening turmoil in Thailand .
" We are not pressuring the government , " Anupong said .
" The government should give the public a chance to decide in a fresh election .
If a coup could end all the troubles , I would do it .
It is not going to resolve anything . "
Anupong was constantly pressed at a news conference on what he would do if neither side heeded his calls , but would only say that he had set his mind against using force .
There has been speculation that the government might sack Anupong for calling on the Somchai government quit .
Last month , Anupong and the heads of the navy , air force and police used a prime time television interview to say Somchai should have stood down after bloody clashes between police and PAD protesters outside parliament .
Reuters reported that sources within a pro-government protest group had said if Somchai quit they would regard it as a coup and immediately launch anti-military demonstrations .
" There will be war for sure , " one senior member of the anti-PAD Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship told the news agency .
If a fresh election went ahead , it is likely that a pro-Thaskin government would return due to the continuing support for Thaskin in the countryside and among the urban poor .
Such a result would be unpalatable to the PAD as the current administration , sending the entire crisis back to square one unless anti-government demonstrators pledged to honour the result .
Thousands of overseas passengers were stranded at Bangkok 's Suvarnabhumi airport today when all flights were halted because of an invasion by the protesters .
Thai Airways rerouted 16 inbound flights to the old airport at Don Muang , while many other airlines cancelled services .
A grenade was thrown at PAD protesters manning a checkpoint on the road to the airport .
Two more were tossed at protesters guarding roads to Bangkok 's second airport , injuring three people .
At one point about 50 masked demonstrators demanded access to Suvarnabhumi 's control tower to check the flight schedule in the belief that Somchai might consider landing there .
The PAD vanguard - brandishing iron bars and wearing goggles and hard - hats - last night pushed through lines of riot police who were ordered not to use violence after two protesters were killed by faulty tear gas canisters ilast month .
The pro-government Democratic Alliance responded to the action by saying it would launch its own street action .
" What they ( PAD ) have done are terrorist acts , " said Jatuporn Prompan , a ruling party politician who is the Alliance leader .
The airport , an important regional hub , handles around 700 flights each day and almost 40 million passengers a year .
Serirat Prasutanont , the airport director , said : " This incident has damaged Thailand 's reputation and its economy beyond repair . "
Thousands of demonstrators , mostly sporting yellow shirts or armbands in allegiance to the revered king , settled in the departure area or milled about the check - in desks as their comrades blockaded roads to and from the airport .
Around 3,000 stranded and bemused passengers were given food handouts by the demonstrators , who apologised for the inconvenience and attempted to explain their motivation .
Many passangers were angry and some scared , fearing a confrontation , particularly after a squad of riot police came to the outside of the terminal building at around 5 am .
For most , the source of their outrage was their airlines ' inability to tell them what was happening or when their flights might depart .
Some were fearful of going to a hotel in case they missed their plane .

With an environmentally - friendly Obama administration coming to power , a new green business coalition — led by Nike , ( NKE ) Starbucks , ( SBUX ) Levi Strauss , Sun Microsystems ( JAVA ) and Timberland ( TBL ) — is calling for stronger policies to slash global warming and to create a clean - energy economy .
The coalition called BICEP , or Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy , includes consumer - product companies involved for years in business and environmental issues .
BICEP officials say retailers , their supply chains and the larger economy will be hurt by global warming 's potential effects .
So BICEP is proposing more aggressive policies for : • Greenhouse gases .
Tougher federal targets for greenhouse gas reduction , including 25 % by 2020 and 80 % by 2050 .
• Renewable energy .
Federal regulations requiring that 20 % of electricity come from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by 2020 , and 30 % by 2030 .
• Coal - fired plants .
Federal laws limiting the building of new coal - fired power plants that do not capture carbon emissions .
Mindy Lubber , president of Ceres , a coalition of environmental groups and large investors managing $ 7 trillion in assets , says she expects to see legislation using BICEP proposals .
Lubber , a former Environmental Protection Agency official , says lawmakers need to hear that green energy " can be good for the economy . "
According to the United Nations Environment Programme , the global industry for renewable energy will create millions of jobs as it grows from $ 148 billion today to $ 600 billion in 2020 .
Global warming " is of critical importance " to Starbucks and other companies , says Ben Packard , Starbucks vice president of global sustainability .
Even small temperature changes will hurt agricultural regions worldwide .
By 2010 , Starbucks aims to cut energy use by 25 % in its 15,000 worldwide stores , to make sure 50 % of all store energy is renewable and to adopt green building standards for new stores .
Sarah Severn , Nike 's director of corporate social responsibility , says that Nike , among other green practices , has cut carbon emissions by 18 % from 1998 to 2005 and has phased out SF6 global - warming gas from all Nike shoes with air - cushioning units .

City of Boatmen , France ?
Map Reveals the Secrets Behind Place Names
If you 've got a date in New York , she 'll be waiting in New Wild Boar City , according to a new etymological map of the world .
STEP 11
Take off the heat and pour it over the chocolate .
Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth .
Cool until it is a little thicker but still pourable .
If you ’re an election geek like us , you ’ll have seen this electoral map from the NYT .
It shows which counties in the US actually shifted toward McCain , in comparison with how they voted in 2004 .
( The map showing which counties shifted by how much to Obama is interesting too . )
Since the country as a whole saw a 9 % swing to the Democrat , it ’s just a small part of the country that moved toward McCain , obviously .
Just 22 % of counties , as the Times helpfully notes .
But their geographical concentration is noteworthy , as apart from obvious bits in Arizona and Alaska , the candidates ’ home states , most of the counties in question form a perfect arc in the Highland South , from Oklahoma eastwards to Tennessee and then upwards through the Appalachians .
Striking as the pattern is , however , it ’s become fodder for some misinterpretation as it did the rounds on the blogs .
Some of it may just be a matter of emphasis .
Some of it , however , has to do with the way the differing racial demographic balances in red states cloak the true concentration of McCain switch voters .
In terms of general emphasis , I ’d be a bit wary about impressions when these counties become dubbed “ the McCain belt ” — you ’d almost think that these were the best counties for McCain , rather than just the ones that moved toward him most .
For example , McCain won Alabama and Louisiana by about 20 points , a more ample margin than he got in Tennessee , Kentucky or West - Virginia .
So what ’s the real McCain Belt ?
The more interesting point is about race .
The NYT map showing the electoral shifts to McCain obviously does not take into account the role of race , it just maps the overall results .
One thing , however , that distinguishes the Appalachians is that they have a very small black population .
In the Deep South , on the other hand , you have some of the largest black minorities around .
Those black populations turned out en masse for Obama — and so their extra votes for Obama effectively canceled out the shift to McCain among whites there .
Do Southern whites constitute the real McCain Belt ?
Compare the Electoral Shifts map above , with its “ McCain belt ” stretching from the Oklahoma to the Appalachians , with this one :
This map shows , state by state , how much the white vote , taken separately , changed since 2004 .
It looks very different , does n’t it ?
The numbers are taken from the exit polls .
Exit polls , of course , are still polls , and still have margins of errors ; and when you measure the shift from one exit poll to the other , I presume those margins double .
Nevertheless , they are based on an immensely larger sample than regular polls , and exit poll data gathered during election day are reweighed as the actual results come in to properly match the outcome .
What they show is that whites in much of the Deep South actually swung toward McCain more strongly than the populations of the Appalachians and Ozarks highlighted on the NYT ’s Electoral Shifts map .
They just do n’t show up on the NYT map because their swing is canceled out by the mobilisation of their black neighbours by Obama .
Overall , the exit polls show , just about as many whites moved from Bush to Obama as from Kerry to McCain in states like Tennessee , Kentucky and West - Virginia , as well as Oklahoma .
This may seem surprising , as those states form most of the core of the presumed “ McCain belt ” in the Electoral Shifts map ; but remember that a rural county with just a few thousand voters may paint a swathe of the map red , while an urban county with manifold more voters may just be a blue dot .
Apparently , in these states Bush voters moving to Obama in the ( sub ) urban counties canceled out the move of their Democratic peers to McCain in the larger , rural counties .
Meanwhile , the real “ McCain whites ” live in the Deep South .
All four states where McCain won at least 3 % more of the white voters than Bush did in 2004 are on the Mississippi or the Gulf , and in all four the white vote was already deeply Republican .
These are states where you would have thought there was little still left to win for a Republican .
In Alabama , 80 % of whites already voted for Bush in 2004 ; but 88 % of them voted for McCain now .
In Mississippi , the Republican ’s share of the white vote went from 85 % to 88 % .
In Louisiana , Bush got 75 % of the white vote , but McCain strongly upped that number still to 84 % .
The fourth state , Arkansas , stands apart a little because its white voters are n’t quite as overwhelmingly Republican , but they just became a little more so .
McCain won 68 % of the white vote there , when Bush had gotten 63 % .
Revisiting the electoral map and what it says about the South
What does this mean ?
It may mean that the relief that Facing South ‘s Chris Kromm appeared to feel that the McCain Belt was “ clearly not , ” actually , “ the South ” , but rather a kind of Appalachia - plus , was misplaced .
There was n’t any specific Appalachian swing toward McCain .
Instead , there was a swing toward McCain among whites of the South and border states ( with the striking exception of the mid-Atlantic states ) .
It just mainly showed up on the map in Appalachia and a state like Oklahoma because the “ whiter ” demographic balance there allowed it to appear .
What that means in turn is that extensive analyses of what exactly in the Appalachians ’ demographic and historical specificities may explain its bucking the trend and moving to McCain were premature .
Looking at the NYT Electoral Shifts map , for example , Alex Massie delved into “ the nature of the Appalachian and “ Highland ” vote ” .
The Scotch - Irish heritage , the ethnic self - identification as simply “ American ” , the military tradition .
But again , the mostly homogenously white Appalachians did not swing to McCain any more than their white counterparts further South ; they actually swung to McCain less .
This in turn brings the question of race as motive back to the fore .
If it was n’t something specific to the Appalachian culture that moved the white voters that switched to McCain , was it just because they could n’t bear voting for a black man after all ?
Massie ’s analysis was based on the sense that “ one ought to be wary of presuming that race is the only reason a county might buck the national trend ” ; hence exploring other facets of Appalachian culture and demography that may be at work .
But if the Appalachian vote turns out to merely be a paler echo of the shift to McCain seen among whites in the Deep South , many of those facets seem rendered irrelevant .
Some of Massie ’s points remain valid .
He notes , for example , that while “ the percentage of .. veterans is , broadly speaking , fairly consistent across the states , the south is .. the only part of America in which the number of veterans as a percentage of the overall population is increasing . ”
Since veterans are more likely to vote for Republicans , and perhaps especially for a war hero like John McCain , this might be an additional explanation for his relatively good score in some locales .
On the other hand , Massie proceeds to point out that people in rural counties are far more likely to have served , or know someone who served , in Iraq than their urban peers , and may therefore have been more likely to vote for McCain ; yet the exit polls show that nationally , rural area voters swung to Obama in the same proportions as the national average .
The fissured South ; Gulf states and Atlantic states on different paths
What the maps of the white vote and how it changed since 2004 show is not all just reinforcement of stereotypes about the racist white South , though .
On TNR ’s The Plank , Clay Risen had a point , even if he opted for the wrong examples .
Risen ran with the NYT Electoral Shifts map much in the same way as Kromm saw it .
The “ red splotches , ” he noted , “ center in eastern Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Oklahoma , and southern Louisiana ; northern Alabama ” ; but meanwhile , “ across the “ Deep South ” — South Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , .. the map is almost entirely blue . ”
As the maps on this page show , much of this is simply a reflection of race ; the map is almost entirely blue there because the extra black voters Obama mobilised outweighed the white voters moving toward McCain .
In that sense , Risen ’s argument that the blue brush strokes there show that “ broad swaths of the region look just like the rest of the country ” is at least partially wrong .
An increasingly racially polarised political landscape like that of Alabama and Mississippi , where whites rallied even more behind the Republican banner while the Democrat gained ground by even better mobilising the black vote , is not exactly what you found in the rest of the country .
But that ’s not the whole story .
Because for other states in the South , he was right on point .
Risen wrote that what the map showed was not “ some sort of static geographic - demographic bloc of racists , ” but rather “ a fissured and rapidly changing ” South .
And the fissured part certainly hits the mark .
Because even as whites in Alabama , Louisiana and Arkansas shifted further to the Republican candidate , those in the Mid- and South - Atlantic did the opposite .
Four years ago , 73 % of whites in North Carolina voted for Bush .
This year , just 64 % voted for McCain .
Four years ago , 68 % of whites in Virginia voted for Bush .
This year , just 60 % voted for McCain .
Those are significant shifts .
Four years ago , 78 % of whites in South Carolina voted for Bush .
This year , 73 % did – still an overwhelming majority , but a 10 % swing to Obama nevertheless .
Whites in Georgia did not warm to Obama , but also were n’t chased any further into the McCain camp by him – or at least not on balance .
( Some rural whites were , but must have been counterbalanced by urban whites moving to Obama . )
Developments thus appear to be going in opposite directions in the Atlantic South on the one hand , all the way down to South Carolina , and in the Highland and Gulf South on the other .
Zooming in on the low - income white vote puts the Deep South as a whole in starker contrast again , however – but that ’s for a different blog post .
What about the rest of the country ?
Obama ’s popularity among the whites of “ Greater New England ”
One would almost forget that the map of the red and blue states of white America in this year ’s elections is not just all about the South .
There are impressive shifts elsewhere in the country .
Compare this year ’s map with that of the 2004 elections .
That map had practically no blue in it at all .
There were just nine states in the US where a majority of whites voted for John Kerry , and in three of those they did so barely .
Six of them were the states of New England .
The other three were Hawaii , Minnesota and Washington .
In not one state did Kerry get 60 % of the white vote .
The Democratic strongholds California , New York and Illinois showed up in pristine white , because the white vote there was exactly split .
Every other state except for Iowa and Oregon glowed red to some degree or other .
This year the map is still , well , rather reddish in tone .
After all , 55 % of white voters opted for McCain .
But the balance has shifted .
Obama got the majority of the white vote in 19 states .
He scored blowout wins among whites in Hawaii and Vermont , where he held McCain down to 31 % or less , and led McCain by about 20 points in Oregon , Washington , Maine and Rhode Island .
He won a majority of whites in Colorado and Michigan , and almost half the votes in Ohio and Montana .
Outside the South and the Appalachians , the only states where the white vote did not significantly shift to Obama were Alaska and Arizona — the Republican candidates ’ homestates — and the neighbouring states New Mexico , Texas and Oklahoma .
The states where whites swung most strongly toward Obama were the same as where the swing in the overall vote was largest : Hawaii and Indiana .
( Who , a year ago , would have thought that the one mainland state of the United States where white voters would swing most strongly to Obama would be Indiana ? )
The core of both Obama ’s support and his gains compared to Kerry ’s scores , however , lies in what has been described as “ Greater New England ” : see Elazar and Lind for history and Patashnik and Lind again for topical commentary from the primary season .
See these listings :
Top ten states where Obama received highest share of the white vote Top ten states with largest swing among whites to Democrat between 2004 and 2008 1 . Hawaii 70 % 2 . Vermont 68 % 3 . Oregon 59 % 4 . Maine 58 % -. Rhode Island 58 % 6 . Washington 57 % -. Massachusetts 57 % 8 . Wisconsin 54 % -. New Hampshire 54 % 10 . Minnesota 53 % -. Delaware 53 % I.e. : homestates ( HI , De ) ; New England proper ( VT , ME , RI , MA , NH ) ; “ Greater New England ” ( WI , MN , WA , OR ) .
1 . Hawaii 27 % 2 . Indiana 22 % 3 . Vermont 19 % 4 . Delaware 18 % -. Oregon 18 % 6 . Colorado 17 % -. North Carolina 17 % 8 . North Dakota 15 % -. Virginia 15 % 10 . Michigan 14 % -. Utah 14 % -. Wisconsin 14 % I.e. : homestates ( HI , DE ) ; Mid-Atlantic ( VA , NC ) ; Indiana ; “ Greater New England ” ( VT , MI , WI , ND , CO , UT , OR ) .
The role of Greater New England in the overall election results is also nicely underscored in these two maps , also from the NYT , which map the overall lead of the candidates by percentage and by number of votes :

Column : Impeach before Bush leaves office RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008
Print This Email This A Detroit Free Press columnist argues that Congress should n't let President Bush 's last two months in office go by without pressing for impeachment .
Rochelle Riley argues that immediate impeachment hearings would prevent Bush from issuing preemptive pardons for government officials accused of crimes and would prevent the president from further pursuing economy - wrecking deregulatory policies .
If Congress moves quickly and forces the president to focus on impeachment , then he wont have so much time to push through last - minute regulatory changes that will continue to hurt our country and our ideals .
He already has pushed deregulation that would allow employers to talk directly with employees doctors and allow power companies to build polluting facilities close to national parks .
Anyone worried that our congressional representatives cant tie their shoes and chew gum at the same time , or cannot focus on the economic crisis and impeachment hearings at the same time , will find that many answers to our economic and global defense problems will come from those hearings .
It 's unclear precisely how those two ideas can co-exist .
Riley does n't explain how impeachment will prevent Bush from enacting his bad economic policies , while simultaneously not distracting Congress from developing its own economic policies .
It almost certainly does n't matter , though .
Although Riley urges Congress to follow through with impeachment articles introduced earlier this year by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has maintained a strict opposition to beginning impeachment hearings .
So Bush can rest assured .
In January , he will leave office , as scheduled , with simply the disapproval of more than two - thirds of the country , not the formal condemnation an impeachment trial would bring .
While we are being distracted with the theatrics of these long months of presidential canidates theatrics and hollow rehtoric , the grave issues in our nation ( purposefully ) are being ignored .
The latest antics has Michigan ( in ecomomic free fall ) ignored by the party ( Democratic ) that once represented the working man .
This because of rules (? ) that punished Michigan for holding its primary too early .
Now they are told they cannot send delegates to the National Convention .
That 's par for the course - why would the voice of the dispossessed be represented ?
Jeffrey , age 49 , lost his auto plant job in Aug .
He has had to move in with his mother .
Jeffrey says , " I lost everything I worked for all my life . "
John McCain 's message was , " The jobs are n't coming back " .
I 'm not impressed with McCain ( having never worked in the real world ) advising the hundreds of thousands laid off ( losing homes ) to go back to college .
He tells these hundreds of thousands from his removed affluence - " The jobs are never coming back " .
This shows you how detached those in Foggy Bottom are to the working man / woman .
The arguments in SC - today say it 's a race issue .
Who loves Blacks more ?
Huckabee is still doing his hokum song fest ( guitar ) and promising a chicken in every pot ( Tyson that is ) .
His newest delusion is to change the constitution to line it up with Scripture .
On and on it goes - while in the working man 's world millions are losing their homes .
There 's an economic meltdown going on in the financial markets .
The canidates say it needs studied .
The REAL story has yet to be told to the American public .
The ONE Question that should have been asked in these forever " Groundhog Day " debates has yet to be asked ?
These managed ' debates ' ( sniping contests ) have yet to touch our domestic carnival of errors .
You'd think we were electing a prom king or queen .
Citizens are being treated like pet gerbils running round and round on a wheel of partronizing dribble and lies .
Both parties have been complicit over these past decades in the meltdown we 're witnessing .
People need to climb down off their elephants and donkeys .
They need to discard their red - white - and boo attire and enter into the neutral zone .
As long as people can be kept in the arena of elephant dung and donkey drippings they 'll remain ignorant to the facts that will vitally affect their lives and their children .
REAL ESTATE : This problem began in the early 90s .
This is when the Federal Reserve began lowering the costs of funds and banks encouraged people to borrow at low rates .
Mortgage rates were lowered in 1991 .
This is when credit lines using home equity were created by your friendly banker .
That was when people began going into debt up to their eyeballs using the inflationary increases in the value of their primary residence as a personal ATM machine !
People forgot that the only true value in real property is the equity .
Market estimates of home values can drop 50 % in one day .
Why would the Federal Reserve do something so harmful to the national economy ?
When a bank makes a loan of $ 100,000 , ninety per cent of that amount ( or , $ 90,000 ) creates new money out of thin air .
This is called ' fractional - reserve ' banking .
It is a system used in most nations worldwide .
Most nations have central banks - the Federal Reserve is a central bank .
It is not a federal agency as most people have been led to believe .
It is a cartel of privately owned bankers and other affluents - much like OPEC is owned by people in oil producing nations .
When Congress are over spending like mindless idiots , when the cost of war is approximately $ 245 million a day , one of the best ways to create money to pay these costs is to encourage American consumers to borrow .
Every time you borrow - ninety percent of that amount creates new money from thin air .
That money is injected into the economy .
As long as we all borrow more and more and more money from banks more money is created .
No wonder borrowing was made so easy - it gave them the cash they needed for all that spending .
Every good thing comes to an end .
Expect an economic upheaval when Washington 's cash cow quits giving milk .
" All of the perplexities , confusion , and distress in America arises , not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation , not from want of honor or virtue , so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin , credit , and circulation " John Adams , Founding Father Congressman Louis T. McFadden , ( therefore knowledgeable ) was a banker .
He headed the Congressional Banking Committee for 11 years .
He stated the following ( in part ) before Congress on June 10 , 1932 .
" Mr. Chairman , we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks .
The Federal Board , has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt .
This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the U.S. ; has bankrupted itself , and has practically bankrupted our government .
It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates , through the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board , and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it . "
The Depression was a severe crisis in banking history .
Between 1930 and 1933 more than 9000 banks close their doors and investments decreased by 90 % .
Ninety per cent of small community banks failed .
By 1933 the banking system was a wreck .
Congressional hearings in early 1933 revealed gross irresponsibility on the part of major banks , which had used billions of dollars of depositor 's funds to acquire stocks and bonds and had made unsound loans to inflate the prices of these securities .
The Banking Act of 1933 ( the Glass - Stegall Act ) , was passed by Congress in the face of vociferous opposition from the American banking community .
This act prohibited commercial banks from using their own assets to invest in securities ( such as stocks and bonds ) .
In his ' Economic History of the Great Depression ' , John Galbraith pointed out one of the causes : " The large scale corporate thimblerigging that was going on .
This took a variety of forms , of which by far the most common was the organization of corporations to hold stock in yet other corporations , which in turn held stock in yet other corporations .
During 1929 one investment house , Goldman Sachs and Company , organized and sold nearly a billion dollars ' worth of securities in three interconnected investment trusts .
All eventually depreciated virtually to nothing . "
Progressive Historians - Nov 27 , 2007 , Ralph Brauer
In 1971 , in Investment Company v. Camp , no less than the United States Supreme Court would write what stands as the most cogent summary for the Banking Act ( Glass - Steagall ) .
" Congress was concerned that commercial banks in general and member banks of the Federal Reserve System in particular had both aggravated and been damaged by stock market decline partly because of their direct and indirect involvement in the trading and ownership of speculative securities . "
Supreme Court No. 61 argued Dec 15-1970 : http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/617/case.html
FAST FORWARD :
The chief aim of the money men ( assisted by both Republicans and Democrats ) for decades was to roll back FDR's New Deal .
Anti-government rhetoric ( distracting labeling ) has hidden this from public view .
The ' Banking Act ' of the New Deal was a priority by vested interests in being repealed .
The undoing of this Act took decades and approximately $ 200 million in lobbying funds to accomplish .
" Billionaire Sanford Weill made ' Citigroup ' into the most powerful financial institutions since the House of Morgan a century ago .
A major trophy of Sanford 's is the pen Bill Clinton used to sign the REPEAL of FDR's Banking Act - a move which allowed Weill to create Citigroup .
" Sanford Weill called President Clinton to break the deadlock after Senator Phil Gramm , chairman of the Banking Committee , warned Citigroup LOBBYIST Roger Levy that Weill has to get the White House moving on the bill or he would shut down the House - Senate Conference .
A deal was announced at 2:45 a.m.
Just days after the Clinton administration ( including the Treasury Department ) agrees to support the REPEAL , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , the former co-chairman of a major Wall Street investment bank , Goldman Sachs , raises eyebrows by accepting a top job at Citigroup as Weill 's chief lieutenant .
The previous year , Weill had called Rubin to give him advance notice of the upcoming merger announcement .
When Weill told Rubin he had some important news , the secretary reportedly quipped , " You 're buying the government . "
Progressive Historian
With the stroke of a pen , Bill Clinton ended the long saga of Republicans and Democrats , working in concert , for their puppet masters ( the bankers ) with his signing of the ' Financial Modernization Bill ' ( Nov 12 , 1991 ) .
Clinton ended an era that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson and reached fruition with FDR and Harry Truman .
As he signed his name , William Jefferson Clinton symbolically signed the death warrant of a level playing field that had guided the Democratic Party .
Clinton ( both parties ) knew better than FDR and our Supreme Court .
Nov 12-1999 , President Clinton stated , " Glass - Stegal ( FDR Banking Bill ) is no longer appropriate for our economy .
This was good for the industrial age .
The ( 1999 ) Financial Modernization Bill is the key to rising paycheck and great security for ordinary Americans " .
Tell this to Michigan - NH - California - Georgia etc .
The public was distracted from one of the most important pieces of legislation in this nation 's history being signed by Bill Clinton , with round the clock coverage , of the Monica debacle .
Seeing how Clinton came out of this shameful episode lauded as heroic - super stud - and a multi-millionaire , why one one would almost think that the whole sordid affair was contrived ?
Most especially with Lieberman acting as the holier than thou apologist !
Missed was Clinton 's reason for the undoing of FDR 's landmark bill Press release : http://Treas.gov/press/releases/ls241.htm
What does this repeal mean ?
The hedge fund industry and subprime mortgage market is out of control .
The New York Times in a June 2007 profile of Goldman Sachs : " While Wall Street still mints money advising companies on mergers and taking them public , real money - staggering money - is made trading and investing capital through a global array of mind bending products and strategies unimaginable a decade ago . "
Goldman Sachs head Lloyd Blankfein paints the perfect picture of what has happened : " We 've come full circle , because this is exactly what the Rothschild 's or J.P. Morgan the banker were doing in their heyday .
What caused an aberration was the Glass - Steagall Act ( FDRs - Banking Act ) . "
Blankfein , like his cohorts in corporate greed , sees the New Deal as an aberration and longs for a return to the Gilded Age .
Level playing field ?
Notice how flat it was before the REPEAL of FDR's Banking Act .
Those subprime loans amount to nothing more than an organized ripoff of millions of Americans with the steepness of the graph illustrates how far the playing field has titled .
Robert Kutter ( Stanford University ) testified before Barney Frank 's Committee on Banking and Financial Services in Oct 2007 " Since repeal of Glass Stegall ( FDR Banking Act ) in 1999 , after more than a decade of de facto inroads , super banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structual conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s - tending to speculators , packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off , wholesale or retail , and extracting fees at every step along the way .
And , much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s .
Much of it is n't paper at all , and the whole process is supercharged and automated formulas . "
To the Victor goes the spoils - burp !
It 's lonely at the top , but you eat better !
2008 - Citigroup .
The repeal ( Clinton 's Financial Modernization Bill ) of FDR's Banking Act - was responsible for the creation of Citigroup as an all - purpose financial supermarket and too - big - to fail banking marvel ..( much like the unsinkable Titanic ? ) .
Investment bankers lobbied for thirty years to repeal the Glass - Steagall Act , which separated commercial banking from its investment house cousins .
Wall Street hated the law but failed year after year to win repeal .
The problem was always the Democrats ( since Republicans were supporters ) .
In enters a reincarnation of our old carnival snake oil salesman .
Bill Clinton delivered his ' New Democrat Party ' with a lot of the usual scripted rhetoric .
Meaningless made up words .
The combination of insurance , investment banking , and old - line commercial banks , have multiplied the conflicts of interest within banks , despite so - called ' firewalls ' .
Much like Enron , placing some deals in off - balance sheet entries did not insulate Citigroup from losses in its swollen subprime housing lending .
The bank ( Citigroup ) has so far written off something like $ 15 billion and there 's more to come .
Ah - but meantime we 're going to see these presidential canidates argue over who loves Blacks the most - or the miracle of Hillary 's tears !
It 's interesting that in the Neveda debates ( Nov 15 ) , when Hillary was asked about Citigroup and the subprime debacle she responded , that that she was concerned over these huge pools of money , and that Congress and the Federal Reserve need to ask questions .
She went on to remark on how mortgages ( subprime and conventional ) were being bundled and sold to foreign investors .
THE 64,000 QUESTION ( yet to be addressed in these debates ) was not asked : ' Senator Clinton , its a known fact , that Citigroup would not exist , except for President Clinton 's repeal of FDR's ' Banking Act ' .
Would you ( other canidates ) not agree with the 1971 Supreme Court ruling , Goldman Sachs , and testimony by economists , that we have re-enacted the same conflicts of interest that were in place before the Great Depression and thus are doing the very same things that the Rothschild 's and J.P Morgan were guilty of ? '
This is the question that has yet to be asked in any of these ' debates ' ( Republican or Democrat ) .
The media and canidates blame the victims or wander off into some escoteric meaningless gibberish .
" Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men .
They have no vision and where there is no vision the people perish " .
FDR First Inaugural Address
Rest assured we 'll hear the same sorry blame game - with each party ( both complicit in this debacle ) them ) blaming the other .
Hillary is worried about repairing the image of America .
Nobody is asking these candidates about the disasterous REPEAL of the Banking Act of 1933 , which is leaving millions ( not them ) foreclosed on and losing jobs , investments , and pensions etc !
When people are losing their jobs , homes , and children 's futures ; like their grandparents or great grandparents of old , they do n't give a damn about ' image ' .
They are focused on having a roof over their heads and food to eat .
The attention to the export of jobs in the U.S. did not develop until white - collar jobs began to evaporate along with manufacturing jobs with no replacement jobs .
A U.S. company can hire a software developer in India for $ 6.00 an hour according to the McKinsey Global Institute .
A data - entry clerk earns $ 2.00 an hour in India .
The presidential - canidates ( Jan 15 - 2008 ) report that we 're spending $ 10 billion a month on war .
Ten billion a month , as multitudes lose their homes over medical costs ( hospitalization ) and job losses that bankrupt them .
A $ 600 per day hospital fee soon brings a family to ruination .
The working man does n't have the smörgåsbord of medical coverage ( tax payer subsidized ) that those in elected office have secured for themselves ( prescriptions covered - dental - eyeglasses ) .
Note they promise that someday the citizens may have affordable health care .
Meantime those promising affordable health care , if elected , are receiving bundles of campaign money from the insurance companies & pharmaceuticals .
These ( lobbyists ) are the people that wrote the bills that made the cost of prescriptions prohibitive , and excused them from liabilities , should a vaccine kill you or render your child brain damaged !
Whose interests do you think these canidates will be serving ?
Today we see the promises of the last election serving OIL interests to the tune of obscene billions in profits .
Not mentioned these past few days , is the recent $ 4,100 raise ( Jan - 2008 ) that Congress gave itself .
The Supreme Court and Dick Cheney also got raises .
The President 's salary stays at $ 400,000 .
Nancy Pelosi will now be making $ 217,000 .
This for working Tue through Thur ( not counting the numerous recesses ) .
These salaries are for an approximate 151 days .
The excuse offered , is how much they work when they go home .
I 've yet to see this - except for some convenient photo - op .
The ordinary guy misses work and he 's fired .
As for paid vacations - those are a rarity .
During the Great Depression ( not taught in schools ) millions lost their farms and homes ( due to bankers greed ) .
It 's hard to imagine ( maybe not with Clinton 's repeal of Banking Act ? ) what it felt like to walk through the door of their bank and learn that the dollars that had earned had vanished .
Every day spent working and saving had been for nothing .
The people believed ( they were right ) that the bankers had stolen their lives .
To stave off Banks selling farms at public auction - farmers from the area would gather at the farm up for sale .
They would start bids at 15 cents which rarely got above a $ 1.00 .
Outsiders were kept from attending .
If someone made a serious bid , a burly man would put a hand on his shoulder and say , " That bid 's a little high ai n't it ? "
These were known as Penny Auctions .
Fast forward to 2008 .
The repeal of FDR's Banking Act in 1999 , with the promise of " increased wages and security for workers " sees auctions such as the one above ( California ) taking place from coast to coast .
These folks ( speculators ) are benefiting from the hardships of others .
The Penny Auction to help one 's neighbor against the greed of banks and lenders , has been replaced with the thought of getting a ' real deal ' .
2008 - The promise of Bill Clinton ( repeal of Banking Act ) of rising wages and security for Americans is being realized with millions of layoffs and foreclosures .
Not reported on the major news stations were the 10,000 + people showing up to apply for a job at Wal - Mart in Atlanta Georgia .
Besides homeowners - renters are being put out in the cold with landlords being foreclosed on .
" Remember you are just an extra in everyone else 's play " .
FDR Detroit ( no debates held here ) has been in a free fall for the past seven years .
Hundreds of thousands in Michigan are without work .
The drop out rate in schools is 70 % .
With foreclosures the highest in the nation ( there 's great competition ) funds needed for local programs , schools , etc , are unavailable .
No tax revenue .
Per usual , you 'll hear the victims being blamed , not disreputable bankers .
If only they had n't asked for a living wage ( to keep up with inflation ) .
If only they ( auto workers ) would work for Third World wages they would n't be out of work .
Meantime the CEOs ( corporate ) of these echoing plants make 400X that of the ordinary worker .
Their pensions are n't stolen .
The golden parachutes they receive are in the multi - millions ( even if they have brought their company to ruination ) .
Hotels , office buildings , and thousands of homes are boarded up in Detroit .
Meantime hundreds of thousands are homeless or forgotten in noxious formaldehyde FEMA trailers .
Go figure ?
McCain has told those out of work - " The jobs are never coming back " .
John , whose wife 's trust , recently purchased them a $ 5 million exclusive condo in Phoenix , has n't got a clue of the suffering and fear of these folks .
His advice , " Go back to school and get that college degree - get some job retraining " .
John , busy trying to catch the brass ring , neglected to tell folks that President Bush has cut funding for job re-training by one billion dollars ( amongst many other domestic programs ) .
Bush Budget - AFL - CIO , Mike Hall .
Thankfully for John , after divorcing his first wife , when his salary was a mere $ 45,000 , he married an heiress .
No job retraining for him .
What John is oblivious to , is the fact that thousands of college graduates ( with several degrees ) are looking for work .
Duh - like Wall Street .
How one secures a college degree living in a shelter - tent - car or FEMA trailer , miles from nowhere ( in cornfields ) beats me ?
" Who said the free ?
Not me ?
Surely not me ?
The millions on relief today ?
The millions shot down when we strike ?
The millions who have nothing for our pay - Except the dream that 's almost dead today . "
" Sure , call me any ugly name you choose -
The steel of freedom does not stain .
From those who live like leeches on the people 's lives ,
We must take back our land again , AMERICA ! " -- Langston Hughes ( Great Depression ) jdthmoriarty@yahoo.com
YouTube , in its quest to make nice with copyright holders , has partnered with Nexicon , a Malibu - based digital rights management provider .
Under their arrangement , Nexicon will monitor YouTube for copyrighted material .
When Nexicon identifies videos that violate a copyright , it will give the copyright owner the option to have the videos removed from the site or to leave them up and monetize them .
It 's been more than a year since Google rolled out Video ID , an identification and content management system .
And in that time , the company says content providers – including Viacom – are increasingly choosing to leave copyrighted videos up .
That 's bound to make users happy .
The more videos , the better .
Know what else would make users happy ?
If videos on YouTube could be downloaded .
It 's not impossible – anyone could probably figure out how to do it .
But given the fact that YouTube technically could track videos offline ( for advertising purposes ) with available software , and given the fact that users want the option to download videos , why is n't it officially possible ?
Lots of content providers are playing with the idea – NBC , for example , is experimenting with free downloads with commercials with an initiative called NBC Direct .
But it will never happen on YouTube , says Forrester analyst James McQuivey .
" I do n't think YouTube has any incentive to create that experience , " says McQuivey .
For one thing , he says , it would kill off traffic to the site if anyone could download a video to their hard drive and forward it to friends in an e-mail .
And another potential problem :
The videos are too short , and the advertising is too insignificant to justify the cost of that sort of system .
" [ NBC ] is experimenting with 30 - minute or one - hour shows .
In that environment , advertisers are willing to pay a premium to get in front of those viewers .
But nobody 's paying a premium to advertise on
YouTube .
The currency YouTube has right now is traffic . "
Another reason why it wo n't happen , says McQuivey , is that it's not compatible with Google 's vision of the future , in which high - speed wireless access is available everywhere and it wo n't matter whether anything is stored on a hard drive or online .
" Every other software solution Google has tries to push you to the web rather than your hard drive .
Google 's vision is that in the future everyone will have wireless high - speed access on any mobile or fixed device , so going offline to watch videos is unnecessary since you 're never offline . "
McQuivey is equally skeptical that YouTube could ever roll out a pay - per - view plan .
" ITunes is having a hard enough time selling TV shows for $ 3 , can you imagine trying to sell a 3 - minute clip of a skateboarding accident ?
What are you going to do , sell it for five cents ?
I just do n't see that being feasible . "
Of course , Google has done it before – the billions of dollars it earns from advertising are generated pennies at a time in page views .

America decides : Voters queue for hours as Obama - mania sweeps the nation
At dawn , they began to turn out in their millions and head for the polling stations .
Black and white , rich and poor , young and old , they were determined to have their say in the historic battle for the White House .
The unprecedented enthusiasm generated by the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain saw a record turnout that brought chaotic scenes across America last night .
With more than 130 million Americans expected to vote , many of the nation 's 7,000 polling stations were simply overwhelmed .

A long line of voters wraps around the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union local 683 in Columbus , Ohio , a key battleground state
Queues snaked for hundreds of yards forcing voters to wait up to three hours to cast their
ballot in the most anticipated U.S. presidential election in history .
Some became so tired of waiting that they simply gave up and went home , while others left because they had to return to work or to care for their families .
For many who reached the ballot box , the process of voting was so bewildering that they took an eternity to make their choice from a hefty ballot sheet that included votes for , as well as the president , congressional lawmakers , local officials and a myriad of legislative proposals .
History in the making : Barack Obama holds up an ' I voted ' paper after casting his vote at a polling place in Chicago
The delays were likely to cause some polling stations to stay open longer than planned in some states , which threatened to delay by hours the final result .
Whatever the outcome , it was evident from early yesterday how Obama 's bid to become the first black U.S. president had galvanised the country from coast to coast .
A turnout of 130 million would equate to 70 per cent , far above the 63 per cent who voted in the 1960 election that put John F Kennedy in power .
As the queues built up yesterday , most analysts were agreed that the delays would not favour either side , with Democrat and Republican voters equally caught up in the chaos .
Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and his wife Cindy McCain gesture to supporters after casting his vote at the polling place in the Albright United Methodist Church in Phoenix
But some felt the problems could harm McCain , saying Democrats , and particularly black Democrats , would be more determined to stay in line so they could cast a historic vote for Obama .
Embarrassingly , even Obama and his wife Michelle were caught up in the farce , although they sidestepped the queues at their local polling station in Hyde Park , Chicago .
In scenes seen by millions of TV viewers , they were clearly puzzled by the complex ballot form .
Their daughters , Malia , ten , and Sasha , seven , fidgeted beside them as they took 20 minutes just to tick all the various boxes .
The Illinois senator made light of the delay afterwards , joking : ' Michelle took a long time to vote , I had to check who she was voting for . '
After casting his vote , Obama dashed off to a final rally in Indiana before returning to Chicago for what he hopes will be his triumphant victory rally .
More than one million people are expected to attend the event in Grant Park .

Obama , 47 , started as the firm favourite based on opinion polls and early voting numbers .
He struck first blood in Dixville Notch , the New Hampshire hamlet that traditionally opens presidential voting after midnight .
He gained 15 votes to McCain 's six , becoming the first Democrat to win there in 40 years .

War veteran McCain , 72 , kept campaigning right up until polls closed early today in the hope of pulling off a last - gasp comeback .
He finished a frantic seven - state tour to vote in Phoenix , Arizona , with wife , Cindy , 54 , before giving a string of eleventh hour TV interviews .
' Look , I know I 'm still the underdog , I understand that , ' he said on CBS .
' You can't imagine the excitement of an individual to be this close to the most important position in the world . '
Aside from the problems caused by long queues , there were widespread reports of hiccups in the patchwork voting system , computer crashes , legal stand - offs , political skulduggery and just plain thuggery .
By mid-day , CNN said they had received 22,000 complains about the flawed system .
America has an unhappy history of voting mishaps .
In 2000 , the results of the election were held up until the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately decided to halt a recount over contested votes in Florida , leaving George Bush the winner .

Bandwidth - starved military spyplane chiefs are resorting to the use of humans as airborne data - processing nodes , according to reports .
Difficulties in deployment of unmanned robot surveillance craft have led to the purchase of basic civilian planes for use in intelligence work above Iraq and Afghanistan .
For years now , ground commanders fighting elusive enemies in Southwest Asia have been begging for more and more long - endurance overhead surveillance , particularly that provided by the well - known Predator and Predator - B / Reaper Unmanned Air Vehicles ( UAVs ) .
Yes , that one is pretty funny looking
Initially , problems in delivering more video and groundscan radar imagery were seen as following from foot - dragging by the air force .
Generals were reluctant to draft jet jockeys into hated shift duties on the ground , piloting roboplanes by remote over satellite hookups from America .
That logjam was resolved at least in part by sacking the boss of the US air force - his replacement has pledged to send pilots into drone duties straight from training if that 's what it takes .
After that , continued slow ramp - up of the drone fleets was blamed on demand outstripping supply - there are other customers for UAVs than the military , including the CIA * and homeland - security authorities - and failures by one of the main roboplane makers , General Atomics , to scale up its manufacturing base swiftly enough .
In any case , more and more talk has been heard this year on the stateside spyplane beat of " Project Liberty " - a cheap - and - cheerful push to get more surveillance birds into the Southwest Asian skies in a hurry .
The plan is to buy ordinary civilian twin - engine planes and fit them out with the lightweight sensors used by UAVs .
They would of course need pilots , but in fact so do the current Predator and Reaper .
The only difference is that these pilots would need to be physically in the aircraft .
This Tuesday , indeed , saw an order for 23 Beechcraft King Air 350 extended - range models for the US air force 645th Aeronautical Systems Group , aka " Big Safari " , a famous secretive spyplane and electronic - trickery unit .
King
Airs are a very popular plane for clandestine spy work , oft - used by shadowy American and allied spy / intel and spec-ops projects and units over the years with a variety of mad equipment fitted .
Indeed , the King Air is so popular for this kind of job that there 's a generic term for a spyplane - modded one .
It is Funny Looking King Air ( FLKA ) , as used by the doyen of secret - plane journalism , Bill Sweetman of Aviation Week .
For its part , the British Army ordered some King Airs last year , to be specially fitted out for Afghan spy work .
The British forces have long used homegrown Islanders for this sort of thing in Northern Ireland and Iraq - and lately above certain parts of the mainland UK - but the hot - and - high conditions of Afghanistan call for a more powerful plane .
The RAF ordered some Canadian - made Twin Stars this year , but the Army Air Corps favours the King Air for what it calls " Manned Airborne Surveillance " .
It might seem odd that Army pilots will be flying FLKAs as well as air force people , but it 's primarily the ground and special - ops forces who want these planes .
The whole idea of using cheap , relatively low - performance airframes to do any task is quite unpopular among air forces .
Airmen tend to describe such planes as not being " survivable " - meaning that if there were some enemy air forces or serious air defences about they 'd often get shot down .
Soldiers , however , who get killed frequently even when there 's no enemy air threat at all , are sanguine about this .
“ THE conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence , to Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address , to the Fifteenth , Seventeenth and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing  one person , one vote , ” the Supreme Court ruled almost a half - century ago .
Yet the framers of the Constitution made this aspiration impossible , then and now .
Under the Constitution , electoral votes are apportioned to states according to the total number of senators and representatives from each state .
So even the smallest states , regardless of their population , get at least three electoral votes .
But there is a second , less obvious distortion to the “ one person , one vote ” principle .
Seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned according to the number of residents in a given state , not the number of eligible voters .
And many residents  children , noncitizens and , in many states , prisoners and felons  do not have the right to vote .
In House races , 10 eligible voters in California , a state with many residents who cannot vote , represent 16 people in the voting booth .
In New York and New Jersey , 10 enfranchised residents stand for themselves and five others .
( And given that only 60 percent of eligible voters turn out at the polls , the actual figures are even starker . )
Of all the states , Vermont comes the closest to the one person , one vote standard .
Ten Vermont residents represent 12 people .
Author ’s Note
Shortly after this article was released on August 13 , US military sources as well as Stratfor ( a Strategic Studies Think Tank ) stated that the various press reports ( UPI , Middle East Times , Kuwait Times , Debka ) regarding the naval deployment to the Middle East were incorrect .
According to the press reports ( see UPI , August 11 , 2008 ) , the war ships involved in the “ Operation Brimstone ” war games off the US North Atlantic coast , had set sail for the Middle East .
This information is apparently incorrect , according to the US Navy and Stratfor .
It is worth noting that the Kuwaiti government had activated emergency procedures based on the information pertaining to a major naval deployment in the Persian Gulf .
Based on the movement and location of USS carrier and expeditionary strike forces , the Bush administration has not decided to carry out a naval surge directed against Iran immediately following the conduct of the North Atlantic War Games ,
The eventuality of a naval blockade directed against Iran is nonetheless being considered by the Pentagon .
In fact , the naval blockade initiative is supported by a bill which was launched in the US Congress in late May .
( See below for details ) .
We have checked the most recent information regarding the movements and location of the various USS Carrier and Expeditionary Strike Groups .
The text first released on August 13 has been revised .
Corrections , and updates to the text are indicated .
We will provide further updates and analysis as more information becomes available .
Michel Chossudovsky , August 14 , 2008
The Bush administration is envisaging the possibility of launching a naval blockade directed against Iran .
Extensive war games were held off the US Atlantic Coastline under “ Operation Brimstone ” in late July .
These war games were activated shortly after the submission in the US House of Representatives ( May 22 ) , of a bill ( H CON 362 ) which called upon the Bush administration to carry out an economic blockade directed against Iran .
“ Operation Brimstone ” : North Atlantic Ocean War Games
Joint Task Force Exercise ( JTFEX ) 08 - 4 ‘ Operation Brimstone ’ commenced on July 21 in North Carolina and off the Eastern US Atlantic coast from Virginia to Florida .
Of significance was the participation of British , French , Brazilian and Italian naval forces as part of a multinational US naval exercise directed against Iran .
More than a dozen ships participated in the naval exercise including the USS Theodore Roosevelt and its Carrier Strike Group Two , the expeditionary Strike Group Iwo Jima , the French submarine Amethyste , Britain ’s HMS Illustrious Carrier Strike Group , Brazil ’s navy frigate Greenhalgh and Italy ’s ITS Salvatore Todaro ( S 526 ) submarine .
( See Middle East Times , August 11 , 2008 , Dailypress.com , July 28 , 2008 , www.mt-milcom.blogspot.com)
Stating the purpose of a war game and identifying the real “ foreign enemy ” by name is not the normal practice , unless there is a decision to send an unequivocal message to the enemy .
Invariably in war games , the foreign enemy is given a fictitious country name : Irmingham , Nemazee , Rubeck and Churia stand for Iran , North Korea , Russia and China ( codes used in the Vigilant Shield 07 War Games ’ Scenario opposing the US to four fictitious enemies .
( See William Arkin , The Vigilant Shield 07 War Games : Scenario opposing the US to Russia , China , Iran and North Korea , Washington Post , February 10 , 2007 )
In the case of “ Operation Brimstone ” , the stated military purpose of the naval exercise is crystal clear : the North Atlantic war games are carried out with a view “ to practice enforcing an eventual blockade on Iran ” .
These naval exercises are intended to display US and allied “ combat capabilities as a warning to Iran . ”
They are tantamount to a declaration of war :
“ The drill is aimed at training for operation in shallow coastal waters such as the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz . ”
The USS Theodore Roosevelt equipped with 80 - plus combat planes , was carrying an additional load of French Naval Rafale fighter jets from the French carrier Charles de Gaulle .
( Ibid ) .
France ’s E2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft , which was “ assigned to the 4th Squadron began flight operations with Carrier Air Wing ( CVW ) 8 aboard Roosevelt , marking the first integrated U.S. and French carrier qualifications aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier .
French Rafale fighter aircraft assigned to the 12th Squadron also joined . ”
Navy.mil , July 24 , 2008
Anglo - US war games are a routine practice .
What is significant in these large scale naval manoeuvres is the active participation of France , Brazil and Italy in war games which are explicitly directed against Iran .
The participation of these countries in extensive war games points to broad consensus .
It also suggests that the participating nations have accepted ( in political and military terms ) to participate in a US - led military operation directed against Iran .
The active participation of France and to a lesser extent Italy also suggests that the European Union is firmly behind the US initiative :
“ Operations with our friends and allies are the cornerstone of the U.S. Navy ’s current maritime strategy , ” said Capt .
Ladd Wheeler , Roosevelt ’s commanding officer .
“ These combined operations will certainly pay dividends into the future as our navies continue to work together to increase global security . ” Navy.mil , July 24 , 2008
Another important precedent has been set .
Brazil ’s President Luis Ignacio da Silva has ordered the dispatch of the Greenhalgh Frigate , marking the first time that a Brazilian warship ( under a government which claims to be “ socialist ” ) has operated as part of a US .
strike group in war games directed against a foreign country .
According to the Greenhalgh ’s Commander Claudio Mello , “ It allows us to be one more asset in an international operation . ” ( Pilot Online.com , July 28 , 2008 )
Brazil ’s Frigate Greenhalgh dispatched to participate in US War Games
Congressional Initiative
The naval blockade against Iran , which is tantamount to a declaration of war , is a bipartisan project , which has tacitly been endorsed by the Democrats .
In May 2008 , a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives ( H.CON. RES 362 ) that called for the enforcement of an all out economic blockade , including the encroachment of trade and the freeze of monetary transactions with the Islamic Republic :
“ The President [ shall ] initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran …. prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
“ [ H. CON . RES. 362 ] urges the President , in the strongest of terms , to immediately use his existing authority to impose sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran , … international banks which continue to conduct financial transactions with proscribed Iranian banks ; … energy companies that have invested $ 20,000,000 or more in the Iranian petroleum or natural gas sector in any given year since the enactment of the Iran Sanctions
Act of 1996 ; and all companies which continue to do business with Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . ”
( See full text of H.CON RES 362 ) ( emphasis added )
Meanwhile , H CON RES 362 has been referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
A similar procedure has taken place in the Senate .
Concurrent Military Operations : War in the Caucasus
The planning of a naval blockade by the Bush administration ( Operation Brimstone , H Con 362 ) occurs at the very outset of an unfolding crisis in the Caucasus , marked by the Georgian air and ground attacks on South Ossetia and Russia ’s counterattack .
The timing and chronology of these related and concurrent military operations is crucial .
We are not dealing with separate and unrelated military events .
The war in Georgia is an integral part of US - NATO - Israeli war preparations in relation to Iran .
Georgia does not act militarily without the assent of Washington .
The Georgian head of State is a US proxy and Georgia is a de facto US protectorate .
The attack on South Ossetia was launched by Georgia on the orders of the US and NATO .
US military advisers and trainers were actively involved in the planning of Georgia ’s attacks on the South Ossetia capital .
( For further details see Michel Chossudovsky , War in the Caucasus , Towards a Broader Russia - US Military Confrontation , Global Research , August 10 , 2008 )
Russia is an ally of Iran .
Russia is currently caught up in a military confrontation with Georgia .
The Georgian attack on South Ossetia constitutes an act of provocation directed against Russia .
It creates an aura of instability in the Caucasus , marked by heavy civilian casualties .
It serves to distract Russia from playing a meaningful diplomatic and military role , which might undermine or obstruct the US - led war plans directed against Iran .
Both Russia and China have bilateral military cooperation agreements with Iran .
Russia supplies the Islamic Republic with military hardware and technical expertise in relation to Iran ’s air defense system and missile program .
Since 2005 , Iran has an observer member status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
In turn , the SCO has ties to the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) , an overlapping military cooperation agreement between Russia , Armenia , Belarus , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Republic , Tajikistan .
The structure and strength of military alliances is crucial .
In the context of US war plans directed against Iran , the US is intent upon weakening Iran ’s allies , namely Russia and China .
In the case of China , Washington is seeking to disrupt Beijing ’s bilateral ties with Tehran as well as Iran ’s rapprochement with the SCO , which has its headquarters in Beijing .
The Georgian attack on South Ossetia seeks to undermine Russia , which constitutes a significant countervailing military power and ally of Iran .
The ultimate objective is to isolate Iran , cut it off from its powerful allies : China and Russia .
In Washington ’s mindset , the events in Georgia coupled with media propaganda , can be usefully applied to discredit and weaken Russia prior to the enforcement of a naval blockade on Iran in the Persian Gulf , which could lead into an all out war on Iran .
This somewhat crude line of reasoning tends , however , to overlook America ’s own military setbacks and weaknesses as well as the enormous risks to America and the World which could result from a continued and sustained confrontation with Russia , let alone an attack on Iran .
In view of the evolving situation in Georgia and Moscow ’s military commitments in the Caucasus , military analysts believe that Russia will not protect Iran and encroach upon a US led operation directed against Iran , which would be preceded by a naval blockade .
In other words , Washington believes that Moscow is unlikely to get actively involved in a showdown with US and allied forces in the Persian Gulf .
Naval Deployment
According to press reports , upon completing the North Atlantic war games on July 31st , the participating warships in “ Operation Brimstone ” headed for the Middle East , to join up with other carrier strike groups and a constellation of US , British and French war ships .
Which Carrier Strike groups and Expeditionary Forces sailed for the Middle East upon the completion of “ Operation Brimstone ” remains to be ascertained .
Below we provide the most recent information pertaining to the movement of Carrier Strike Groups and Expeditionary Strike Groups
According to Stratfor and military sources :
- the USS Iwo Jima and the USS Theodore Roosevelt , according to Stratfor , returned to their home port in Norfolk after concluding participation in JTFEX Operation Brimstone on July 31
- the nuclear powered USS Ronald Reagan Carrier and its Strike Group Seven ; according to Stratfor USS Reagan is currently under way in the South China Sea on a routine deployment in the 7th fleet area of responsibility ( AOR ) ( Indian Ocean and Western Pacific )
- the USS Abraham Lincoln is in the Arabian Sea ( confirmed by Strafor , “ operations in the 5th fleet AOR , which includes Iraq and Afghanistan ” , namely Ariabian Sea ,
– the USS Peleliu which was in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden .
( latest news from Stratfor USS Peleliu is in the Arabian Sea , “ operations in the 5th fleet AOR , which includes Iraq and Afghanistan ” )
USS Abraham Lincoln
In other words , there are at present ( August 14 , 2008 ) two Strike Groups in the region : USS Abraham Lincoln , northern Arabian Sea , USS Peleliu Strike Group , northern Arabian sea .
There is no confirmation as to whether the USS Ronald Reagan is moving towards the Arabian Sea .
“ Maritime Security ” to Enforce a Naval Blockade
US Central Command ( CENTCOM ) under the helm of General Petraeus , coordinates out of Bahrain so - called Maritime Security Operations ( MSO ) in Middle East waters ( Gulf of Aden , Gulf of Oman , Arabian Sea , Red Sea and Indian Ocean ) .
This MSO initiative is conducted by the Combined Maritime Force ( CMF ) with a powerful armada of 36 warships .
Established at the outset of the Iraq war , CMF involves the participation of the US , Canada , Australia , UK , Germany , Australia , Italy , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Portugal , Spain , Turkey and Pakistan .
There are several combined task forces responsible for maritime security ( including CTF 150 , CTF 152 and the CTF 158 North Arabian Gulf ( NAG ) )
The mandate of the Combined Task Forces “ aims to establish security and stability by countering terrorism in the Middle Eastern maritime environment and allowing legitimate mariners to operate safely in the area … ” ( see Canadian Navy , News ) ,
In the present context , this multinational naval alliance , will be used to encroach upon maritime trade with Iran as well as play an active role in implementing the proposed economic blockade of Iran .
Canada has recently deployed three war ships to the Arabian sea , including HMC Iroquois along with HMC Calgary and HMC Protecteur which will be operating under CTF 150 , which is responsible for MSO in the Gulf of Aden , the Gulf of Oman , the Arabian Sea , the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean .
Canada ’s HMC Iroquois , involved in Maritime Security .
Canada currently leads the CTF 150 Task Force
Among the 36 war vessels involved in so - called Maritime Security Operations , are :
RBNS Sabha ( FFG 90 ) – The Bahraini flagship of CTF 152 conducting Maritime Security Operations ( MSO ) in the Central and Southern Arabian Gulf .
USS Harry S. Truman ( CVN 75 ) – The U.S. flagship of CTF 50 , conducting MSO in the Central and Southern Arabian Gulf , as well as support Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom .
( currently in the Atlantic Ocean according to Stratfor ) .
FS Guepratte ( F 714 ) – French Navy ship operating as part of CTF 150 in the North Arabian Sea , Gulf of Aden , Gulf of Oman , Red Sea and the Indian Ocean .
USCGC Wrangell ( WPB 1332 ) – One of several USCG 110 ’ patrol boats conducting MSO in the North Arabian Gulf .
HMAS Arunta ( F 151 ) – Australian Navy ship conducting MSO as part of CTF 158 .
PNS Tippu Sultan ( D 186 ) – Pakistan Navy ship conducting MSO as part of CTF 150 .
RFA Cardigan Bay ( L 3009 ) – British Royal Navy auxiliary ship operating with CTF 158 .
USS Port Royal ( CG 73 ) – US Navy guided - missile cruiser deployed with USS Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Group .

Naval Blockade
The first stage of a naval blockade directed against Iran would in all likelihood be initiated by Maritime Security Operations ( MSO ) under USCENTCOM .
For Iran , a naval blockade , were it to be implemented , is tantamount to a declaration of war .
The blockade constitutes a blatant violation of international law .
According to Francis Boyle , a renowned specialist in international law :
“ A blockade is an act of war under international and domestic law .
A “ Blockade ” is a term used under international law to specifically refer to belligerent measures taken by a nation for the purposes of preventing the passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country .
Customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade .
Blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the Declaration of Paris of 1856 and the Declaration of London of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare . ”
Meanwhile , war preparations are also being undertaken by Israel and NATO in the Eastern Mediterranean .
German war ships are stationed off the Syrian coastline .
Turkey which constitutes a major military actor within NATO is a major partner of the US led coalition .
It has an extended bilateral military cooperation agreement with Israel .
Turkey has borders with both Iran and Syria .
( For further details see Michel Chossudovsky , “ Triple Alliance ” : The US , Turkey , Israel and the War on Lebanon , Global Research , August 6 , 2006 )
Pre-emptive Nuclear War
A diabolical and related consensus is emerging at the political level , pointing to the pre-emptive first strike use of nuclear weapons in the Middle East war theater , more concretely against Iran :
“ In January 2005 , at the outset of the military build - up directed against Iran , USSTRATCOM was identified as “ the lead Combatant Command for integration and synchronization of DoD - wide efforts in combating weapons of mass destruction . ”
To implement this mandate , a brand new command unit entitled Joint Functional Component Command Space and Global Strike , or JFCCSGS was created .
JFCCSGS has the mandate to oversee the launching of a nuclear attack in accordance with the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review , approved by the US Congress in 2002 .
The NPR underscores the pre-emptive use of nuclear warheads not only against “ rogue states ” but also against China and Russia . ” Michel Chossudovsky , Nuclear War against Iran , Global Research , January 2006 )
More recently , a December 2007 NATO sponsored report entitled “ Towards a Grand Strategy for an Uncertain World : Renewing Transatlantic Partnership “ .
calls for a first strike pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons .
The NATO doctrine in this report is a virtual copy and paste version of America ’s post 9/11 nuclear weapons doctrine as initially outlined in the 2002 Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) .
( for details , see Michel Chossudovsky , The US - NATO Preemptive Nuclear Doctrine : Trigger a Middle East Nuclear Holocaust to Defend “ The Western Way of Life ” , Global Research , January 2008 )
The preemptive use of nukes as formulated in the NATO Transatlantic Partnership document would be used to undermine an “ increasingly brutal World ” ( e.g. Iran ) as well as a means to prevent “ rogue enemies ” to use “ weapons of mass destruction ” .
Under this NATO framework , which is explicitly envisaged in relation to Iran , US and allied forces including Israel would “ resort to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to try to halt the imminent spread of nuclear weapons , ” ( quoted in Paul Dibb , Sidney Morning Herald , 11 February 2008 ) .
“ They [ the authors of the report ] consider that nuclear war might soon become possible in an increasingly brutal world .
They propose the first use of nuclear weapons must remain “ in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction ” .
( Paul Dibb , op cit )
In terms of the ongoing threats directed against Iran , a pre-emptive nuclear attack using tactical nuclear weapons , which are according to the Pentagon is “ harmless to the surrounding civilian population ” could be carried out in relation to Iran , even if if Iran does not possess nuclear weapons capabilities , as confirmed by the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) .
According to a 2003 Senate decision , the new generation of tactical nuclear weapons or “ low yield ” “ mini- nukes ” , with an explosive capacity of up to 6 times a Hiroshima bomb , are now considered “ safe for civilians ” because the explosion is underground .
Through a propaganda campaign which has enlisted the support of “ authoritative ” nuclear scientists , the mini-nukes are being presented as an instrument of peace rather than war .
The low - yield nukes have now been cleared for “ battlefield use ” , they are slated to be used in the next stage of the Middle East war ( Iran ) alongside conventional weapons :
“ Administration officials argue that low - yield nuclear weapons are needed as a credible deterrent against rogue states .
[ Iran , North Korea ]
Their logic is that existing nuclear weapons are too destructive to be used except in a full - scale nuclear war .
Potential enemies realize this , thus they do not consider the threat of nuclear retaliation to be credible .
However , low - yield nuclear weapons are less destructive , thus might conceivably be used .
That would make them more effective as a deterrent .
” ( Opponents Surprised By Elimination of Nuke Research Funds Defense News November 29 , 2004 )
In an utterly twisted logic , nuclear weapons are presented as a means to building peace and preventing “ collateral damage ” .
The NATO sponsored report – which broadly reflects a growing consensus– insists that the option of a nuclear first strike is indispensable , “ since there is simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear - free world . ” ( Report , p. 97 ) :
“ Nuclear weapons are the ultimate instrument of an asymmetric response – and at the same time the ultimate tool of escalation ”
The US - NATO doctrine to use nukes on a pre-emptive basis against Iran , with a view to “ saving the Western World ’s way of life ” , is not challenged in any meaningful way by the antiwar movement .
The mainstream media has a strong grip on the public ’s perception and understanding of the Middle East war .
The dangers of nuclear war in the Post cold War era are barely mentioned and when they are , the use of nuclear weapons are justified as a preemptive military option to ensure the security of Western World .
The truth is twisted and turned upside down .
Media disinformation instills within the consciousness of Americans and Europeans that somehow the war on Iran is a necessity , that Iran is a threat to the Homeland and that the Islamic Republic is supporting Islamic terrorists , who are planning a Second 9/11 .
And that a pre-emptive nuclear attack is the answer .
In contrast , the powerful economic interests behind the war economy , the Anglo - American oil giants military , the defense contractors , Wall Street are rarely the object of media coverage .
The real economic and strategic objectives behind this war are carefully obfuscated .
9/11 is used profusely both by the Bush administration and the media as a justification for waging war , despite the fact that there is mounting evidence of cover - up and complicity of key members of the Bush Administration .
Despite the evidence , Afghanistan , Iraq and now Iran have been portrayed as the “ State sponsors of terrorism ” and a threat to the Homeland , thereby justifying the various stages of the Middle East military roadmap .
The Project for a New American Century , had already described in a 2000 document the nature of this road map or “ long war ” .
What is envisaged is a global war without borders :
fight and decisively win multiple , simultaneous major theater wars ( PNAC , September 2000 )
At present US and coalition forces including NATO and Israel are in an advanced state of readiness to launch an attack on Iran .
Leaders of the US led coalition including France , Germany and Italy , should understand that such an action could result in a World War III scenario .
Escalation scenarios have already been envisaged and analyzed by the Pentagon .
US sponsored war games have foreseen the possible intervention of Russia and China in the Middle East .
World War III has been on the lips of NeoCon architects of US foreign policy from the outset of the Bush regime .
In response to “ Operation Brimstone ” and the Naval deployment , Iran ’s Foreign Ministry said that “ Tehran will give a ‘ maximum response ’ to the slightest threat against the country ’s national security . ”
War propaganda , through media disinformation consists in galvanizing US citizens not only in favor of “ the war on terrorism ” , but in support of a social order which repeals the Rule of Law , derogates fundamental civil liberties , upholds the use of torture and establishes a modern police state apparatus as a means to “ preserving Western democracy ” .
There is a tacit public acceptance of a diabolical and criminal military agenda , which in a very sense threatens “ the community of nations ” and life on this planet .
In the course of the last four years , Global Research has documented in detail the various war plans directed against Iran .
Operation TIRANNT ( Theater Iran Near Term ) was initially formulated in July 2003 , in the wake of the US led Iraq invasion .
We have done our utmost to reverse the tide of media disinformation , to inform our readers and the broader public on the impending dangers underlying the US military adventure .
This is the most serious crisis in modern history which in a very real sense threatens the future of humanity .

401(k ) Retirement Plans
A 401( k ) plan is a retirement savings plan that many United States employers offer to its employees .
In this plan , participates contribute pre-tax salary into the plan and is often rewarded with a match for a portion of the contribution .
Congress recognized that corporations have been cutting back on its pension packages to remain competitive globally .
So under the Revenue Act of 1978 , Congress added section 401 ( k ) and stated that employees are not taxed on the portion of income they elect to receive as deferred compensation rather than as direct cash payments .
Pros and Cons of 401(k ) Plans
There are many advantages of 401k plans , which I list a few here :
Contribution are pre-taxed
All earnings and income from investments can grow tax - free Employees get to pick their own investments ( self - directed ) .
Therefore , you can pick your favorite mutual fund investment Many companies match your contribution to a certain percentage , effectively giving you a raise .
You can change jobs and the 401k moves with you , unlike pension .
Disadvantages include :
While the money is essentially yours , it ’s very costly to access 401 k money before the age of 59 1 / 2 .
Since it is pre-tax dollars in the account , withdraws are subject to taxes .
With the uncertainty of future tax rules , it ’s hard to really know how much money is really yours .
The tax complications make financial planning much harder if you have both post - tax accounts and pre-tax accounts as you can only guess future tax rates .
The plan is self - directed .
Notice that the plan being self - directed is both an advantage and a disadvantage .
In theory , having more control is always good but as we know from history , investors do not always invest logically .
Investment Options
Many employers ’ 401 ( k ) plans are actually offered through payroll or investment companies like ADP or Fidelity .
These third parties will often work with your employer ’s plan administrator to come up with a list of investment choices for all its employees .
One thing to note is that while third party companies might have hundreds of investment choices , the list available to employees are usually narrowed to 10 - 20 .
The idea is usually that if there are too many choices , it makes administration impossible and also becomes too confusing for most employees .
While the choices are limited and is based on the discretion of the employer , the majority of 401 ( k ) plans offer investment choices that are diversified , including :
Money Market Funds
Bond Funds ( short , intermediate , and long term )
Various Stock Funds
Index Funds
Company Stock ( if applicable )
Contribution Limits
In order to keep taxes coming , the IRS limits plan contributions to a fixed amount each year .
The limits are said to be inflation indexed ( as an example , limits from 2005 – 2009 are listed below )
2005 – $ 14,000
2006 – $ 15,000
2007 – $ 15,500
2008 – $ 15,500
2009 – $ 16,500
To help people closer to retirements save for the future , the IRS included a “ catch - up ” limit for people ages 50 and above .
These limits are higher and the limits from 2005 – 2009 are :
2005 – $ 18,000
2006 – $ 20,000
2007 – $ 20,500
2008 – $ 20,500
2009 – $ 22,000
Note that these are participates contribution limits .
This means that the limit do not include the matching contributions of the employer , nor the capital gains that any portfolio can have .
Penalties of Early Withdrawal
To limit participates from withdrawing money early ( 401 ( k ) plans are meant to be “ retirement ” funds after all ) , there are steep penalties for withdrawing money early from the retirement plan .
In general , the penalty is 10 % off the withdraw amount on top of the withdrawal being subject to taxes .
Therefore , think extremely thoroughly before taking out money from your 401 ( k ) plan .
There are also penalties for not withdrawing .
A participant who is of age 70 and a half years old must start taking minimum withdraws or face monetary penalties .
The only way around this is if you still work after 70 and a half and your 401 k still being with that employer , then you do n’t have to take the annual minimum withdraw .
If you really need money from your 401 ( k ) , not all is lost though .
There is a way to retrieve funds from your 401 ( k ) plan without penalty , and that ’s through a loan from your plan .
Essentially , you are taking a loan from yourself , so money ( principle and interest ) are paid back to yourself .
The major disadvantage is that if you lose your job , all the money will need to be paid back immediately ( not a good thing ) !
Even without a loan , those who leave their job after the age of 55 can start withdrawing without penalty , even if they are working through another job .
Matching Contributions
Companies can elect to match part of your contributions .
For example , your employer may match half of the first 6 % of your salary if they are 401 ( k ) contribution .
Say your salary is $ 100,000 and contribution 6 % of your salary ( $ 6,000 ) , then the employer will add another $ 3,000 to your 401 ( k ) plan .
This is one of the major advantages of contributing to a 401 ( k ) plan , because it is like electing to get a raise .
Changing / Leaving Your Job
If you are switching to a new job , remember to ask your new employer if you can directly roll - over your 401 ( k ) plan to the new company .
Other options include :
Withdrawing the money ( not recommended ) Opening a Traditional IRA and rolling it over Leaving It with Your Old Employer ( not always available )
For the most part , rolling it over to a tradional IRA is generally the best option because companies offering IRA accounts usually offer more investment choices .
However , many people like to roll it over to the new employer because of ease of administration .
Take caution because the check from your old employer must be made in the new employer ’s plan name if it ’s a roll - over .
If it ’s made to you , a mandatory 20 % penalty must be withheld so you will have to come up with the missing 20 % contribution for the new plan within 60 days to make up the difference .
Otherwise , it is treated as a withdrawal and the 10 % withdrawl penalty applies .
Should I Contribute ?
While the government heavily encourages contribution to 401 ( k ) retirement plans , many people do not participate because either :
They are lazy .
They do n’t see the benefit .
In general , experts believe that everyone should at least contribute to the extent to take advantage of the employer contribution match .
As whether to contribute further , it will depend on individual circumstances .
More Information 401k Retirement Plans
With its name coming from a subsection in the U.S. tax code , the 401 ( K ) is a well known type of retirement savings account offered by many companies as part of their benefits package .
Presented as an alternative to the traditional employee funded pension , the 401 ( K ) moved a significant portion of the responsibility for retirement funds from the employer to the employee .
In a recent survey it was found that 60 % of American households nearing the age of retirement had at least some form of 401 ( K ) .
Unfortunately , a majority of those accounts will not be sufficient to support retirees over the long term .
In fact , only about 25 % of retirees can expect to maintain their standard of living based upon these savings .
How much the employer contributes to the account varies tremendously .
In good financial times employers may match the employee contribution dollar for dollar , but in poor conditions , they may contribute nothing .
The reason that 401 ( k ) plans are so popular is that they are much cheaper for employers to maintain .
The employer only has to pay for administration and support costs , and even some of those can be passed on to employees .
Furthermore , employers can anticipate exactly what those costs will be each year , making it easier to manage a budget .
For a 401 ( k ) to be a successful vehicle for retirement savings individuals should contribute the maximum amount allowed annually , diversify their contributions and avoid any unnecessary withdrawals before the age of 59 ½ .
Early withdrawals of funds are accompanied by severe financial penalties .
Wise investors will also make contributions to other retirement accounts , post tax , in order to increase their chances of having sufficient resources to enjoy a consistent standard of living in their later years .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Riding a wave of resentment against Republican President George W. Bush , Democrats headed toward winning possibly their biggest majorities in the U.S. Congress in decades in Tuesday ’s elections , polls showed .
If Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama also prevails , the new Congress that convenes in January should be able to take action on a long list campaign promises , within the constraints of the current financial crisis .
Democrats , who now control the Senate 51 - 49 and the House of Representatives 235- 199 , have pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from Bush ’s Iraq war , roll back Bush ’s tax cuts for the rich and move to end the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
They hope to win a big enough Senate majority , 60 , to overcome Republican procedural hurdles and pass legislation .
All 435 House seats and 35 of the Senate ’s 100 seats are up for election .
Regardless of how many seats Democrats pick up , record federal deficits and the poor state of the economy will limit what they can do .
Democrats would likely have to limit or postpone any big new spending programs , such as ones to expand health care , upgrade education and advance renewable energy technology .
“ None of this will be easy .
It wo n’t happen overnight .
But I believe we can do all this because I believe in America , ” Obama said in his party ’s weekly radio address on Saturday .
Democrats have a plausible chance to gain nine Senate seats and amass for the first time in three decades a majority big enough to keep Republicans from using parliamentary rules to kill legislation and presidential nominations .
But even if they fail to reach the 60 votes needed to end procedural roadblocks , or filibusters , Democrats figure they will be able to win over enough moderate Republicans to pass legislation .
“ With 56 , 57 , 58 ( Democratic Senate seats ) , we ’ll be able to get a lot done , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee .
On the other side of the U.S. Capitol , Democrats could gain upward of 30 seats in the House , analysts say .
That could give them their biggest House majority since the mid-1980s .
UNPOPULAR BUSH
If Republican presidential nominee John McCain defies the polls and wins , Democrats will have to compromise with him or face McCain vetoes on issues like Bush ’s tax cuts and wars .
Slideshow ( 14 images )
Democrats won control of Congress from Republicans in 2006 .
But Republicans blocked much of the Democrats ’ agenda the past two years -- on matters from expanding health care to withdrawing troops from Iraq -- with Senate filibusters .
Republicans running for Congress have been hurt by Bush ’s poor public standing and McCain ’s inability to rally support in states that have traditionally backed Republicans .
They also have been damaged by the unpopular Iraq war and the fact that Democratic candidates have been able to raise far more money than Republican contenders .
Slideshow ( 14 images )
“ The face of our party is a president with a 25 percent approval rating , ” said a senior Republican Party aide .
“ We have two wars and the economy is tanking . ”
“ When people think of our party they think of George Bush and they are very angry and that is a drag on all of our candidates , ” the aide said .
“ If I had to bet my life on it , I ’d bet Obama wins and Democrats end up with 57 or 58 seats in the Senate . ”
A number of big - name congressional Republicans are in jeopardy of being unseated .
They include Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina , whose husband , Bob Dole , was the party ’s 1996 presidential nominee .
Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska , the longest serving Senate Republican in history , more than four decades , is also in trouble .
He was convicted last week of political corruption .
Mary Landrieu of Louisiana appears to be the only Senate Democrat in any jeopardy of being unseated , but polls show her with a slight advantage over her challenger , state Treasurer John Kennedy .
Nowhere else in the country do voters know John McCain like Arizonans know John McCain .
Voters here have sent McCain to Washington , D.C. , on their behalf five times since his first election to Congress in 1982 .
As much as an electorate can , we know this man .
We have seen the irascible McCain .
The bawdy and irreverent McCain .
And , yes , the temperamental McCain .
Likewise , we here in Arizona have seen the former Navy pilot and war hero evolve - slowly and with lots of fits and starts - into a statesman .
We have witnessed John McCain become a leader - not only of a delegation from a fast - growing Southwestern state , but into a national leader with a reassuring habit of stepping to the front when things seemed most difficult .
Nobody in the country knows the Republican presidential candidate better than we do .
And no one is better placed to judge whether he would serve honorably and admirably as president of the United States .
We are confident he will .
The Arizona Republic proudly recommends John McCain for president .
Regarding foreign policy , no contemporary American statesman is more prepared than McCain to assume the mantles of first diplomat and commander in chief .
In the tradition of Harry S. Truman , McCain already has demonstrated a willingness to let the buck of responsibility stop at his desk .
No one elected McCain to stand virtually alone against three administrations over their use of power overseas - against President Reagan 's ill - fated decision to send Marines to Lebanon in 1983 ; against President Clinton 's decision to send U.S. troops to Somalia in 1993 ; and against President George W. Bush 's decision 10 years later to send insufficient troops to Iraq .
He fought Republicans and Democrats over irresponsibly sending troops into harm 's way , and he fought Republicans over their equally irresponsible refusal to send enough troops to do the job .
In all three instances , history has proved ( too often tragically ) that McCain 's judgment was right .
Even McCain mischaracterizes his noble willingness to stand up and stand alone .
He contends it is the " maverick " in him .
Well , he 's wrong about that .
It is the leader in him .
In truth , the son and grandson of war admirals was never a good fit for the go- along , get - along comity of the U.S. Senate .
The nation simply has not had an opportunity to elect a president this well prepared - and this willing - to be a world leader since Dwight Eisenhower .
But as the Iraq war inches slowly toward peaceful resolution , domestic issues , notably the wrenching tumult on Wall Street and the economic woes it heralds , take center stage this election season .
If McCain were to do no more than to serve as a presidential protectorate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , most of which never were made permanent , he would provide a boost to the nation 's troubled economy .
As the economy lurches and slows , business leaders already envision further drag - and an unnecessarily elongated recession - caused by the heavy anchor of higher taxes , should the Bush - era tax cuts be repealed .
The same concerns apply to the future of American free trade , a cornerstone of the nation 's longest - ever period of economic expansion and wealth production .
McCain is a stalwart advocate of free trade , while the rhetoric of his Democratic opponent strongly suggests to us that he is not .
Which brings us to our concerns regarding Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
No one will dispute that the Illinois senator 's candidacy constitutes a historic moment in the life of this nation .
In addition to his demonstrated capacity to help heal the greatest American wound , its racial divide , Obama has inspired millions of Americans to see anew the value of public service .
Still , in terms of experience , Obama is barely four years removed from the Illinois State Legislature .
And even that thin record in public office is obscured to us by the senator 's proclivity for voting " present , " often on knotty issues like abortion .
For a candidate seeking the world 's greatest political challenge , Obama presents an extraordinarily lightly traveled trail .
Considering what we do know of his record , it is hard to envision Obama tamping down even the wildest leftist aspirations of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid .
Obama 's plan to reduce the taxes of " 95 percent " of working families is most troubling .
As many as 44 percent of " taxpayers " today pay no federal income tax at all .
What Obama in fact is proposing is a direct transfer of wealth from top earners to those on the lower rungs .
In short , he seeks to use the tax system as a revived form of welfare .
John McCain joins hands with Barack Obama and other Democrats on numerous important issues .
They are scarcely apart in their personal judgments about how to resolve illegal immigration .
They speak virtually in one voice regarding the environment and the dangers of global warming .
But McCain 's support for a wide array of energy sources , including expanding domestic - oil production and building nuclear - power plants , is considerably more credible than Obama's .
McCain speaks with a voice of credible authority .
It is not as mellifluous a voice as Obama's .
But it is a voice we in Arizona know well .
It is one we trust .
The Republic recommends John McCain for president of the United States .
Manhattan prosecutors are expected to seek state racketeering and fraud charges later this month against about a dozen officers and employees of a company hired to test the strength of the concrete at some of the biggest construction projects in the New York area , according to investigators and others briefed on the case .
The charges are expected to accuse the company ’s president and several senior officials of failing to do some tests and falsifying others over a period of about five years , the investigators and the others said .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity because no charges had yet been filed .
Prosecutors are also expected to ask the grand jury convened in the case to vote enterprise corruption charges  the state equivalent of federal racketeering violations  against the company , Testwell Laboratories Inc. , along with some of the company ’s senior officials , with lesser charges leveled against other employees , the people briefed on the case said .
When the investigation was disclosed in June , after prosecutors executed search warrants at Testwell ’s headquarters in Ossining , N.Y. , lawyers for the company vigorously defended its work and said its officials denied wrongdoing .
They said that tests had been done properly and that company officials had cooperated with the inquiry .

Subject : Witness the federal police state .
Coercion , lies and the mockery of justice .
I went down to the Richmond federal building today and made a statement to a Special Investigator with the Department of Homeland Security concerning the assault on me by an employee of the General Services Administration outside of a Federal Courthouse that occurred on October 21 , 2008 .
I did so at the behest of Special Agent Ed Ryan with the Dept. of Homeland Security .
First off , he never informed me that I was going to be doing that .
It was only at the end of the statement did I find this out , that this would be a " sworn affidavit " .
Second , HE wrote down the statement , and there were several inaccuracies .
When I pointed them out , the statements were stricken on that page .
Even after I pointed out several , he left in a lot stuff that I told him to strike and I had to tell him to strike it again .
He wanted the statement to look disjointed , it was obvious that he was doing this on purpose which in my opinion is obstruction of justice .
When I asked him about this he said , " That 's okay , " and tried to make me believe that it was no big deal .
He purposely misinterpreted what I said and wrote it down in his own hand writing .
When I told him that I was n't signing it he all but coerced me into signing it and made me swear to it .
I only swore to it because of two reasons , the statement had a caveat which said to the " best of my knowledge " and he also wrote at the bottom that he wrote the statement .
When I told him to put this in he refused : " If there are any discrepancies or inaccuracies in this statement they only occur because of Ed Ryan 's inability to interpret what I have told him and to right it down in the manner in which I stated . "
He refused to put that into my " official statement " even though I dictated that part to him and told him to put it in .
When I was done with that , he said that he would answer my questions .
I asked him about the case .
This is where he accused my of making the entire story up even though there were several witnesses .
He said there were several " inconsistencies " .
He said that the witnesses claimed that the guy was never closer that 10 feet to me .
A lie .
He then pointed to a statement in the affidavit .
He had asked me if I had made a statement about this case anywhere before .
I told him about the original statement to Homeland Security and the statement to the Richmond P.D.
He whipped out a printed article from afterdowningstreet.org , the original email I had sent to David Swanson and John Young at cryptome.org and claimed that this was proof that I had lied in my sworn affidavit .
This really was n't as shocking as Ed thought it might have been .
You see , I sent a link to the Office of the Inspector General for the General Service Administration .
I also sent the article to somebody in the Department of Homeland Security asking for an investigation .
He really thought he had a " gotcha " moment there but it fell flat .
So , Ed , if you are reading this and I know you are , does this email count as an official statement ?
Huh , Ed ?
On my way out he also claimed that I had lied to the Homeland Security officer concerning my Social Security # .
Why would I lie then , only to come back and give them my proper Social Security #?
Pretty weak arguments .
Why would I also supposedly lie about a statement which I myself sent to the Dept. of Homeland Security ?
It 's clear that his only intention was to try and discredit me with his so called revelation that I had lied on the so called affidavit .
This was his only intention .
He claimed that the federal government could come after me for making false statements .
It was clear that Special Agent Ed Ryan was not concerned with justice , he was only concerned with making this case go away for the Federal government .
He did a pretty horrible job of it .
The Special Agent was Ed Ryan .
He is a Special Agent with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

First , let me say , the man who assaulted me was NOT a federal police officer .
He works for the General Services Administration .
I was down in Richmond , VA , taking pictures of the Virginia State Capitol and then I decided to take pictures of the United States Post Office and Custom House ( now a federal courthouse ) just below the capitol .
A guide says , " The building remains in use by the Federal District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals .
The building is one of Richmond 's oldest and finest examples of government architecture . "
This is the building : http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/richmond/USPostoffice.htm
This GSA guy was on a smoke break in an alley next to the Post Office building and told me to stop taking pictures .
I ignored him , he continued to harass me , so I said I wanted his name and the name of his supervisor .
He said he'd let me talk to him in person and took me into the building with him .
A federal marshal started asking what was going on when we try going through the metal detectors .
At this point the GSA guy told me , " it is illegal to take pictures of federal buildings " .
The marshal started asking me questions and the GSA guy started going off .
The marshal asked me to come outside to talk to him and I did .
More marshals arrive , and the original hotheaded GSA guy is out there as well .
We are all now on a public sidewalk outside the federal Buildings .
I tell my side of the story to the marshals .
At one point I point to the GSA guy and say , " I do n't need to talk to that guy , " at which point he yells , " Fuck you " .
I say ( to him ) , " I 'm gonna need your name and your supervisor 's name , " and I snap off several pictures of him to record the event .
He again explodes and comes at me .
More photos : http://www.flickr.com/photos/27669106@N08/sets/72157608247985133/
The marshals are trying to hold him back , he swings and hits me in the chest .
Not sure if it was with his elbow or fist .
Anyway , that 's assault .
The entire thing was witnessed by several people .
And it was caught on tape by several security cameras .
I wrote a statement to Dept. Homeland Security ICE ( Federal Protective Services ) .
Tomorrow I will go down to the State Courthouse and file criminal charges against the guy .
Two Federal Protective Services officers , James A. Russell and Commander R. Cox responded .
They said I would have to file requests with their office to get the security tape .
One guy said to file an FOIA .
Is this true ?
I need to get that tape .
It shows the assault .
Any ideas on how to proceed ?
I need to get a lawyer but can't afford one .
Do you think I could get a lawyer to do this on a contingency basis ?
Do you know a lawyer who specializes in this who might like to take on the case ?
I have pictures of the building and the GSA guy but not of the assault .
Right now I have a copy of my statement to ICE and the names of the ICE officers .
I do n't know the name of the guy who assaulted me .
There were tons of witnesses .
Federal marshals and the administrator of that GSA building were there , people on the street and people in the office complex across the street .
Any help would be greatly appreciated .

james.russell@dhs.gov __________ Cryptome Note :
It is not illegal to take pictures of federal buildings or any other facility from a public sidewalk .
Cryptome has taken hundreds in New York City , Washington DC and elsewhere .
Cryptome has asked federal guards on several occasions about taking pictures ; all said it was okay , a couple said this is your property not ours .
On other occasions rent - a - guards have been hostile , act as though they have something to hide about their unimportance .
In 2002 rent - a - guards at a CIA - State Department communications facility in Virginia ( Warrenton Training Center Site D ) confiscated camera and and video chips , saying they could be recovered by contacting CIA .
Follow - up requests to CIA have been ignored .
A responds :
Please have someone try to take a picture of the DARPA building ( 3701 N. Fairfax Ave , Arlington , VA ) .
I have seen actual Arlington cops chase people down and delete the images from their camera .
Not just rent - a - cops .
Would love to see a collection of stories on your site .

In a presidential race that has never lacked for drama , another riveting scene unfolded on the eve of the election as Barack Obama teared up before a crowd of 25,000 on a rain - drenched football field .
Madelyn Dunham , the 86 - year - old grandmother who helped raise Obama and was ill with cancer , died early Monday in Honolulu , just hours shy of an election he had prayed she would survive to witness .
The Democratic nominee learned of her death while doing radio interviews from his hotel room in Jacksonville , Fla .
He did not mention it at a raucous rally a few hours later .
But in Charlotte , Obama offered a tribute that brought a hush over the field .

“ Look , she has gone home , ” Obama said , his voice hoarse .
“ And she died peacefully in her sleep with my sister at her side , and so there ’s great joy as well as tears . ”
Obama ’s voice cracked , and tears rolled down his cheeks .
It ’s “ hard for me to talk about , ” he said .
“ I want everybody to know , though , a little bit about her , ” he went on .
“ Her name was Madelyn Dunham , and she was born in Kansas , a small town , in 1922 , which means that she lived through the Great Depression .
She lived through two world wars .
She watched her husband go off to war , while she looked after a baby and worked on a bomber assembly line . ”
Obama called his maternal grandmother humble and plain - spoken , then wove her story into the speech he usually gives with little variation .

“ She was one of those quiet heroes that we have all across America , who -- they ’re not famous , their names are n’t in the newspapers , but each and every day they work hard , ” he said .
“ They look after their families .
They sacrifice for their children and their grandchildren .
They are n’t seeking the limelight .
All they try to do is just do the right thing . ”
“ North Carolina , ” he said , his voice blasting from loudspeakers across the University of North Carolina field , “ in just one more day we have the opportunity to honor all those quiet heroes all across America .
. . .
We can bring change to America to make sure their work and their sacrifice is honored . ”
As Obama moved on to familiar passages of his speech , he dabbed his cheeks with a white handkerchief .
Even without his loss , emotions were running high on his closing - day dash from Florida to North Carolina and Virginia .
At his Charlotte headquarters , Obama , who would be the first African American president , told volunteers , “ I hope you guys feel like you ’ve been making a little bit of history here .
If we take North Carolina , we win this election . ”
Advertisement
Alverna Bracy , a 76 - year - old black volunteer , sobbed and shuddered .
“ This is the best surprise I ’ve ever had since my babies were born , ” she said as Obama put his arm around her .
The day was not without levity .
MTV ran a half - hour “ Ask Obama ” special .
One question led him to suggest that it was a waste of time to worry about passing laws against people wearing their pants too low .
“ Having said that , brothers should pull up their pants , ” he said .
After Obama ’s weekend of campaigning in Nevada , Colorado , Iowa , Missouri and Ohio , it was hard to tell whether mourning or fatigue had distracted him at his Jacksonville rally .
Republicans , he told the crowd , were “ spending a lot of money here in Ohio . ”
When the crowd protested with groans and shouted reminders that he was in Florida , Obama corrected himself .
“ I ’ve been traveling too much , ” he said as supporters booed at his confusion .

“ Listen , ” he joked .
“ They ’ve been spending a lot of money in Ohio too . ”

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
The Democratic National Convention wraps up Thursday with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , the party 's presidential nominee , addressing about 75,000 people at Invesco Field at Mile High .
" Obama will communicate the urgency of the moment , highlight the struggles Americans are facing and call on Americans to come together to change the course of our nation , " the Democratic National Convention Committee said in a statement .
Obama became the first African - American to lead a major party 's ticket for the White House on Wednesday .
His rival for the nomination , Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , interrupted a roll - call vote to ask that he be nominated by acclamation , or voice vote .
It was a carefully choreographed maneuver designed to unite the party after the bitter primary battle between Obama and Clinton .
The convention 's theme for Thursday is " Change You Can Believe In , " a slogan borrowed from Obama 's successful quest for the Democratic nomination .
Watch Democrats nominate Obama »
Prominent speakers who are scheduled to address Democrats on Thursday include Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico , who competed for the nomination before backing out and endorsing Obama , and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia , who was among those mentioned as possibilities to become Obama 's running mate .
Former Vice President Al Gore , the party 's presidential nominee in 2000 , is also scheduled to speak .

In addition , Democrats plan a tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , who delivered his famous " I Have a Dream " speech in Washington , D.C. , exactly 45 years ago , on August 28 , 1963 .
Two of King 's children , the Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III , plan to participate in the tribute after remarks from Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , who switched his allegiance from Clinton to Obama during the contentious primary contest .
Obama will formally accept his party 's presidential nomination in a speech that is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. local time ( 10 p.m. ET ) .
It promises to be the main event after a week of rousing speeches at the Pepsi Center in Denver , Colorado , by Democratic heavyweights , including Sen.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , who underwent surgery for a brain tumor June 2 , and Clinton , who urged her supporters to back Obama .
On Wednesday night , Sen .
Joe Biden of Delaware formally accepted the vice presidential nomination and praised Obama as a leader who had been right on a wide range of issues , including Afghanistan .
" On the most important national security issues of our time , John McCain was wrong and Barack Obama has been proven right , " he said .
Watch Biden 's entire speech »
Also on Wednesday , former President Bill Clinton declared Obama " ready to be president of the United States " after months of attacks from his wife 's supporters on the Democratic nominee 's lack of experience .
The former president himself was among the most outspoken proponents of that line of criticism of Obama .
On Wednesday night , however , he reversed himself and pointed out that Republicans had used the same line of attack against him when he first ran for president .
" It did n't work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history , " Bill Clinton said .
" It wo n't work in 2008 because Barack Obama is on the right side of history . "
The former president said Obama " will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope . "
Watch Clinton 's entire speech »
During a brief appearance after Biden 's speech Wednesday night , Obama said he believed that " change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things . "
He said he chose to speak Thursday at Invesco Field at Mile High , which seats 76,000 people , to make sure " everybody who wants to can come .
... I think we will have a great night .
I look forward to seeing you there . "

The Republican National Convention is scheduled to start Monday in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota , but the presumptive Republican nominee , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , may make headlines before then .
Several Republican sources told CNN late Wednesday that McCain has decided on his choice of a running mate .
Some suggested that reporters could learn that person 's identity as early as Thursday night not long after Obama 's acceptance speech .

After a lawsuit from a Christian anti-abortion group , Google is allowing religious organizations to take out ads using the keyword “ abortion , ” a rare case of the search giant admitting it was wrong .
In March , Google rejected an ad from the Christian Institute , a British organization , that read , in part , “ UK abortion law : Key news and views on abortion law from The Christian Institute . ”
The group , which wanted to advertise because the House of Commons was considering a bill involving abortion issues , filed a lawsuit against Google in April , saying the company was discriminating on religious grounds .
Google has limits on what can and cannot be advertised ; it will not allow ads for products derived from endangered species , for example , nor will it allow ads promoting violence .
In the past , Google would not sell the “ abortion ” keyword to religious groups , but did sell it to other groups , including secular groups , doctors offering abortions and resource sites like Our Bodies , Ourselves .
A couple of hours ago , the Google Security Team posted an article claiming that Google ’s made the switch to OpenID , joining Yahoo ! and Microsoft in the ranks OpenID providers .
But it looks like someone may have been a bit to hasty to pull that switch ( perhaps itching to get some of the limelight Microsoft has been receiving for adding OpenID to all Live ID accounts just the day before yesterday ) … because whatever it is that Google has released support for , it sure as hell is n’t OpenID , as they even so kindly point out in their OpenID developer documentation ( that media outlets certainly wo n’t be reading ) :
The web application asks the end user to log in by offering a set of log - in options , including Google .
The user selects the " Sign in with Google " option .
The web application sends a " discovery " request to Google to get information on the Google authentication endpoint .
This is a departure from the process outlined in OpenID 1.0 .
[ Emphasis added ]
Google returns an XRDS document , which contains endpoint address .
The web application sends a login authentication request to the Google endpoint address .
This action redirects the user to a Google Federated Login page .
As Google points out , this is n’t OpenID .
This is something that Google cooked up that resembles OpenID masquerading as OpenID since that ’s what people want to see – and that ’s what Microsoft announced just the day before .
It ’s not just a “ departure ” from OpenID , it ’s a whole new standard .
With OpenID , the user memorizes a web URI , and provides it to the sites he or she would like to sign in to .
The site then POSTs an OpenID request to that URI where the OpenID backend server proceeds to perform the requested authentication .
In Google ’s version of the OpenID “ standard , ” users would enter their @gmail.com email addresses in the OpenID login box on OpenID - enabled sites , who would then detect that a Google email was entered .
The server then requests permission from Google to use the OpenID standard in the first place by POSTing an XML document to Google ’s “ OpenID ” servers .
If Google decides it ’ll accept the request from the server , it ’ll return an XML document back to the site in question that contains a link to the actual OpenID URI for the email account in question .
This is shown quite clearly in the following image ( courtesy of Google , ironically ) :
As you can see , steps 3 & 4 are not part of OpenID and leave Google ’s implementation of OpenID , such as it is , incompatible with everyone else .
Google actually mentions this in passing :
Starting today , we are providing limited access to an API for an OpenID identity provider that is based on the user experience research of the OpenID community .
Websites can now allow Google Account users to login to their website by using the OpenID protocol .
We hope the continued evolution of both the technical features of OpenID , as well as the improvements in user experience .
will lead to a solution that can be widely deployed for federated login .
One of the companies using this new service is www.zoho.com.
Eric Sachs , author of the blog post in question , does n’t actually come out and say , but he does come very close .
Basically , Google has rewritten OpenID .
Not only is it not exactly the same as the current OpenID protocol , it ’s so different that existing OpenID relying parties wo n’t be able to use it .
Only a handful of “ partner sites ” have been updated to understand Google ’s perverted version of the OpenID standard , and anyone else hoping to authenticate via “ OpenID ” to Google ’s servers will need to do the same .
But OpenID is an open , community - based standard .
Stabbing them in the back by creating an incompatible standard “ based on ” the same technology and masquerading under the same name is n’t the way to go .
Google may have the best interests of decentralized authentication in mind , and perhaps even the better protocol to boot ; but this is no way to prove a point .
OpenID is on tenterhooks as it is , and cannot withstand any more efforts to splinter its adoption .
Never mind the fact that almost all the big names adopting OpenID are joining only as providers and not as relying parties ( rendering the whole basis of OpenID useless ) – now even the provider side of things is chaos .
Thanks , Google .
Good to see you ’re still doing the whole “ Do no evil ” thing , the community really appreciates this kind of approach to improving de facto standards and pushing decentralized authentication !
More bad news for emerging energy tech ...
Automaker Chrysler says it 's shutting down its only plant that produces a hybrid gas-electric vehicle .
It 's brilliant timing ; the two models -- hybrid versions of Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen SUVs -- only hit the market this month .
Then again ,
It 's kind of hard to think of a worse car in this environment than a hybrid SUV .
Nobody wants expensive SUVs , and with oil falling , the demand for hybrids has dissipated as well .
Given the sorry state of the industry , it 's probably for the best , but remember that $ 25 billion bailout the auto industry has already received ?
That money , in the form of low - interest loans , was supposed to go for , yep , production facilities for fuel - efficient cars .
So you really have to wonder :
If Chrysler is shuttering plants where it builds hybrid vehicles , is it really going to use that money to build these production facilities ?
Thought so .

Detroit : Give Us Bailout Cash To Help Fund Layoffs
During Reagan ’s years in office , unemployment and inflation dropped sharply .
Tax rates generally fell , as did spending on government programs outside the military .
But there were also two significant downsides to the 1980s economy , and Mr. McCain has made an issue of both at different points in his career .
The budget deficit soared , because the cuts in domestic spending were not large enough to make up for the Reagan tax cuts and a military buildup .
And middle - class incomes grew at a much slower rate than they had in the 1950s or ’60s .
In the aftermath of his loss to Mr. Bush in the 2000 Republican primaries , Mr. McCain began emphasizing middle - class pocketbook issues .
After having consistently voted for tax cuts in the 1980s , he was one of the few Republicans to oppose the administration ’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 .
He said at the time that they benefited “ the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle - class Americans . ”
In the current decade , wage gains for most families have been even weaker than they were in the 1980s , and Mr. McCain has spoken during the campaign about the anxiety being caused by a globalization and technological change .
Were he to win the Republican nomination , it is possible he would then put a bigger emphasis on such themes .
“ Change is hard , ” he said in a speech in Detroit in October , “ and while most of us gain , some industries , companies and workers are forced to struggle with very difficult choices . ”
To spur the economy , Mr. McCain has called for more spending on alternative - energy research .
Spending on basic research , he said , could lead to a repeat of the Internet ’s success story , in which government financing ultimately led to the creation of a huge private industry .
He has also called for an expansion of community - college programs and an overhaul of unemployment benefits , to reflect the fact that people who lose their jobs now are often out of work for long periods .
Mr. McCain now favors the extension of the Bush income tax cuts , saying that letting them lapse would amount to a tax increase that would damage the economy .
He said the Democrats ’ plans to allow the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for households making at least $ 250,000 would simply redistribute wealth and lead to an endless fight over who was truly affluent .
“ Americans do n’t dislike wealthy people ; they want to be wealthy people , ” he added .
On several occasions over the last year , Mr. McCain has said that tax cuts can reduce the deficit by spurring additional activity that , in turn , leads to more taxes being paid .
But numerous studies have found that not to be the case .
WASHINGTON , May 1 ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp GM.N is taking another stake in a company focused on developing ethanol from sources other than corn , the automaker said on Thursday .
Mascoma Corp is testing its process for converting biological wastes -- plant matter , grasses , wood chips and other non-grain sources -- to fuel .
It expects to start producing ethanol later this year at a demonstration plant in New York state .
There is growing concern among international aid groups and others that diverting a sizable percentage of America ’s corn harvest for ethanol production has helped to drive up crop and food prices .
In January , GM announced it was taking a stake in Coskata Inc of Warrenville , Illinois , a biofuels company looking at sources of energy including garbage , old tires and plant waste .
“ These investments in leading edge firms supports belief that ethanol has the greatest near - term potential as a clean - burning , renewable fuel that can help reduce oil dependence , ” GM President Fritz Henderson said in announcing the Mascoma deal .
Henderson would not disclose the size of the equity stake in Boston - based Mascoma , which is privately held .
Mascoma said its technology is designed to produce ethanol more efficiently and at lower cost .
President George W. Bush has promoted producing ethanol from cellulose sources like crop wastes and grasses as an alternative to grain , but some critics say it will take years to bring it to market .
U.S. gasoline prices are at all - time highs , prompting automakers , already under pressure from the government to make more efficient vehicles , to consider more ways to conserve fuel .
More than three million GM cars and trucks on U.S. roads are “ flex - fuel ” capable , meaning they can run on either gasoline or an ethanol / gasoline blend , called E85 .
But there is little infrastructure in the United States to deliver ethanol and other alternative fuels to most consumers so most “ flex - fuel ” vehicles run on straight gasoline .
GM is also developing an electric vehicle , the Volt .
Consumer preferences , seen in declining U.S. sales for Detroit - based auto manufacturers , is continuing to shift from truck - based sport utilities to more fuel - efficient , smaller designs .
Congressional negotiators trying to complete a new farm bill are proposing to reduce a tax credit for producers of corn - based ethanol and create one for those that make cellulosic fuel .

Some people are lucky with their timing and their friends .
Paul Dacre is one of them .
This week the editor of the Daily Mail gave a lively lecture berating the judges and extolling the tabloid press , of which he is such a luminary .
Rightly , and not entirely surprisingly , his words received lots of media airtime and coverage .
Twenty - four hours later , however , an independent survey revealed something entirely at odds with Dacre 's views .
The survey found that eight times more British people trust judges to tell the truth than trust tabloid journalists to do so .
Sadly , but not at all surprisingly , this finding went almost wholly unreported .
Lucky , privileged Dacre .
I say this finding went unreported , which it did .
However , other parts of the research from which it came - a survey of attitudes towards conduct in public life commissioned by the independent committee on standards - were vigorously covered .
One part of the report in particular caught the media eye .
Many papers carried stories about the low esteem in which the public holds government ministers and MPs - " Get your snouts out of the trough " ( Daily Mail ) , " Trust in MPs at new low " ( the Sun ) , " Sleaze tsar slams greedy MPs " ( the Mirror ) .
There was nothing in any of these reports , however , about public attitudes to the media .
So let me correct the tabloids ' omission .
The survey asked the public how much they trusted 17 different professions to tell the truth .
Top of the list as usual were family doctors , trusted by 94 % of the public , followed by headteachers ( 83 % ) and judges ( 82 % ) .
Ministers and MPs indeed trailed far behind , trusted by 27 % and 26 % respectively - as the red - tops were quick to point out .
At the very back of the line , though , came another group , tabloid journalists , who were trusted to tell the truth by a miserable 10 % of the population .
Yet this particular finding has not been published in any newspaper until now .
Even this , though , only scratches the surface of what this striking survey revealed about public attitudes to the media in general and to the tabloids in particular .
Tabloid readers , the survey found , are more likely than the readers of broadsheet papers or of no newspapers at all to believe that standards of conduct in public life are low , are getting worse , and to think that the relevant authorities are not upholding the right rules .
Given their exposure to the sort of stories quoted above , perhaps this is not exactly surprising .
What may surprise , though , is the scepticism of readers towards tabloids .
The survey asked their opinion of the papers .
Do they " do a good job of keeping politicians accountable ? "
Yes , said 43 % .
What about " help the public to learn about what is happening in politics ? "
Not so sure .
This time only 31 % of readers thought they did .
Then the figures become really dire .
" Generally fair in their representation of politicians ? "
Only 13 % thought that applied to the tabloids .
" Look for any excuse to tarnish the name of politicians ? "
A massive 90 % agreed with that one .
" Focus on negative stories about politics and politicians ? "
Almost the same , 87 % .
And finally , " more interested in getting a story than telling the truth ? "
This time an overwhelming 82 % of tabloid readers concurred .
You might suppose that the tabloids would find these devastating figures - casting their papers as unfair , negative and untruthful in the eyes of their own readers , not of some liberal columnist - somewhat chastening .
And certainly some of them will be chastened .
But there 's also a bit of the tabloid DNA that is hardwired never to be self - critical when challenged and that simply rolls with the punches at such moments .
What readers want more than anything , the hacks tend to say , is entertainment .
The readers know perfectly well that the stories are n't always fair , positive or true - and so do we - but the readers know , and we the journalists know too , that in the end they do n't take any of it too seriously .
" Dull does n't sell newspapers , " as Dacre put it this week .
" Boring does n't pay the mortgage . "
Or maybe true does n't pay it either ?
In the end Dacre is adopting what is essentially the Russell Brand defence .
This says that the liberty to behave immorally will always trump the responsibility to behave morally because that 's the way people are .
Put sex and Obama in the headline and you will get the hits and the sales , even if there is n't a sex and Obama story .
It echoes something that the Mail 's Melanie Phillips used to say , back in her Guardian days , that any fool can put up the circulation .
Yet this is not the code that the tabloids say they live by .
Ultimately , they do not defend themselves to the public on the basis of the right to be foolish , untrue or rude , or even to sell newspapers .
They defend themselves , as Dacre did again this week , by asserting their civic virtue .
" Our extensive coverage of public affairs is the glue of democracy , " he told his audience .
At this , it is hard to know whether to laugh or cry .
Glue of democracy ?
Laxative more likely .
Only connect , urged Dacre , quoting EM Forster .
If only we did .
Too few make the connection between the way something like this week 's public attitudes survey is so wilfully misrepresented , and the perception among tabloid readers that standards of public life are in headlong systemic decline .
In reality , as even Dacre himself said in his lecture , ours is not a particularly corrupt society .
Sir Christopher Kelly of the standards committee naturally says the same thing .
No one who knows our public life seriously believes otherwise , save in the occasional case at the margins .
Yet increasingly the public believes the worst about ministers and MPs .
They do so not because it is true , but because that is the message that many of them hear most of the time .
There is not a lot that can be done in a hurry about the tabloids or their readers .
But at least acknowledge the problem and determine not to make it worse .
Tabloid readers , says the survey , are less likely than others to seek out other sources of news and information about politics .
Only 4 % of them go to a political website in a typical week .
The upshot is a civic Catch - 22 in which tabloid readers get large amounts of their political information from newspapers which they overwhelmingly believe are unfair and which neither they nor anyone else trusts in any significant numbers to tell the truth .
It is often said that a society gets the press it deserves , but it is also true that the press gets the society it deserves .

Today , Drop.io is introducing a complete redesign of its hosting platform , which offers private file sharing , conference calling , fax receiving , blogging , collaboration , and media presentation features .
Drop.io's new design better highlights and organizes the service 's broad array of features for both admins and users ; the update comes on the heels of a variety of other service enhancements .
Despite all the recently added features , Drop.io 's fundamental approach of allowing users to quickly create " drops " without having to sign up or hand over any personal or registration details is still front and center .
Drops are share points where users can post files , receive faxes , host conference calls , write blog posts , and more , all with granular privacy controls .
Account registration is optional , but allows for greater control and longevity .
The company wo n't share any specific numbers on the status of its user or visitor base , but CEO and founder Sam Lessin told Ars Technica that " several million " Drop.io users have created drops to share " several million assets " since the service launched in August 2007 .
Drop.io's default layout with the new redesign and a theme applied to spice things up
The most obvious change the redesign brings to live drop sites is a much cleaner layout that no longer overpowers users with options .
Previously , many of Drop.io's functions , such as reorganizing a drop 's asset view , adding content , and subscribing to e-mail alerts , were displayed prominently to new users , even to those who were n't logged in and could n't add content except in cases where a drop admin allowed guests to make changes .
Now , a drop 's content is front and center for visitors — most of the viewing and sharing options are hidden under AJAXy tabs at the top .
Contextual features , like buttons for adding content or the display of a drop 's conference call and fax number , are revealed only to those with appropriate permissions , such as logged - in users , or guests if a drop is opened to the public .
The " System " view that takes a file organization approach ,
allowing files to be sorted , separated by type , and renamed in batches
A basic set of themes were also recently introduced to Drop.io ; these allow admins to spice up their drop 's design in ways that go beyond the standard ( and spartan ) white layouts .
With today 's announcement , these themes get a bit more face time , since the redesigned layouts like Blog ( a chronological view of asset additions ) , Media ( assets grouped by types such as photos , text , and documents ) , and even System ( best for sorting files manually and performing batch operations ) can do a much better job of organizing assets and compartmentalizing content than the previous incarnations .
Drop.io's redesigned admin panel is a lot friendlier to new users as it organizes
the service 's many features in a much more intuitive way
Drop.io's admin interface is also far more intuitive , as the previously spartan layout and unorganized list of features have also been replaced with a much more intuitive dashboard .
Features are quite a bit easier to track down now , including the location - based options the company recently enabled .
The experience feels slightly broken in some areas , however .
For example , some headings have sub-sections unfurl beneath them , whereas others link to a different page entirely .
Still , this new dashboard is a welcome refresh that makes Drop.io's wide variety of sharing and permissions options much easier to wrap one 's head around .
Besides a new API that we explored when coding a GNOME file uploader , Drop.io has gained a number of other useful features in the last few weeks .
One is a Firefox 3 add - on that allows users to drag - and - drop files from the desktop to create new drops or expand existing drops .
While drops have long provided embed codes that allow visitors at other websites to upload files , they can now be embedded in Facebook profiles , as well .
A new " Hidden " upload option also allows drop owners to share an obfuscated URL that allows files to be uploaded without exposing the true URL of a drop ; great for opening up a drop for clients while keeping everything else private .
While this was technically just a redesign of Drop.io 's front and back ends , it feels like a major feature update .
Now that options are organized and exposed in a much more intuitive , contextually relevant manner , Drop.io 's potential to be nearly anything — a low - maintenance blog , a collaborative work hub , or a communication proxy for journalists and employees alike — is much more apparent .
Drop.io's business model still focuses on charging users for extra storage space ( free accounts get 100 MB ) and stability ( free drops may expire anywhere from one day to one year after the last time they are viewed ) .
If you want more details about today 's redesign or to view a video of it in action , head over to Drop.io 's announcement blog post .
A throwaway line about sports snared another candidate today when Sarah Palin mentioned the World Series victory of the Philadelphia Phillies to thousands of supporters at a rally in Erie , Pa .
“ I am thrilled to be here in the home state of the world champion Philadelphia Phillies , ” Palin said , drawing boos from the crowd .
Philadelphia is a good seven - hour drive from Erie , which is on the western edge of the state , and the city ’s baseball devotions are split between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Indians .
( Pittsburgh and Cleveland are about two hours away from Erie . )
Palin , as you may recall , has been booed in Pennsylvania before .
Earlier this month , she was heckled at a Philadelphia Flyers game .

COURIC : What other Supreme Court decisions [ than Roe v. Wade ] do you disagree with ?
PALIN : Well , let ’s see .
There ’s –of course –in the great history of America rulings there have been rulings , that ’s never going to be absolute consensus by every American .
And there are –those issues , again , like Roe v Wade where I believe are best held on a state level and addressed there .
So you know–going through the history of America , there would be others but –
COURIC : Can you think of any ?
PALIN : Well , I could think of –of any again , that could be best dealt with on a more local level .
Maybe I would take issue with .
But you know , as mayor , and then as governor and even as a Vice President , if I ’m so privileged to serve , would n’t be in a position of changing those things but in supporting the law of the land as it reads today .

Schwarzenegger signs bill authorizing dehydration , starvation of patients
SACRAMENTO --California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has officially approved an assisted - suicide measure allowing nurses to sedate , dehydrate and starve depressed or confused individuals they consider to be " terminally ill . "
The bill , sponsored by Assemblywoman Patty Berg , a Democrat , passed the California Assembly Aug. 28 , and the state Senate Aug. 20 .
It was signed by the governor yesterday .
The legislation , called the " Terminal Patients ' Right to Know End of Life Options Act , " or AB 2747 , passed by a 42 to 34 vote .
An Aug. 20 Senate vote of 21 to 17 ushered the measure to the governor 's desk for signing .
Randy Thomasson , chief of the Campaign for Children and Families , said the legislation is dangerous and should have been vetoed by Gov. Schwarzenegger .
" AB 2747 pushes suicide through the back door at the hands of non-physicians taking advantage of depressed patients , " he said in a statement .
" AB 2747 cheapens the value of human life by endorsing suicide as an option . "

Betsy Markey thumped her :
GOP Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave was unseated tonight by Democratic challenger Betsy Markey after another intense campaign that blasted voters with nasty attack ads .
Musgrave first won the 4th Congressional District in 2002 and has fought bitter campaigns to hang onto it ever since .
The race , considered one of the most important in the country , was eyed by Democrats as key to expanding their control in Congress .
Republicans have had control of the seat since 1972 .

“ You can not reason people out of positions they did n’t reason themselves into . ”
— Ben Goldacre , MD
Dr. Ben Goldacre is the author of the popular Guardian column , Bad Science .
He has recently published a book by the same name .
Bad Science received a very favorable review from the British Medical Journal and although I was tempted to write my own review for Science Based Medicine , I decided to cherry pick some concepts from the book instead .
I hope you ’ll enjoy the cherries .
Honesty & Placebos
As you can imagine , any good book about bad science must devote at least one chapter to the concept of placebos .
We are all quite familiar with placebos , and how squarely the vast majority ( and some would argue all ) of complementary and alternative medicines fit into that category .
Ben surprised me with a couple of points that I had n’t considered previously .
Firstly , that alerting patients to the fact that you ’re planning to prescribe them a placebo does not necessarily negate its effects , and secondly that no matter how skeptical or intelligent you are – all humans are subject to placebo effects .
Ben references a 1965 study from Johns Hopkins [ Park et al. , Archives of General Psychiatry ] in which patients were explicitly told that they were going to receive a sugar pill ( with no medicine in it at all ) as treatment for their neuroses .
The researchers reported substantial improvements in many of the study subjects ’ symptoms .
This is the script that the physicians were to use to explain the placebos to the study subjects :
Mr. Doe… we have a week between now and your next appointment , and we would like to do something to give you some relief from your symptoms .
Many different kinds of tranquilizers and similar pills have been used for conditions such as yours , and many of them have helped .
Many people with your kind of condition have also been helped by what are sometimes called ‘ sugar pills , ’ and we feel that a so - called sugar pill may help you too .
Do you know what a sugar pill is ?
A sugar pill is a pill with no medicine in it at all .
I think this pill will help you as it has helped so many others .
Are you willing to try this pill ?
Wow .
I was under the impression that the efficacy of the placebo was in the person ’s belief that it was a legitimate medicine / therapy .
Perhaps it only matters that the prescribing physician believes it might help ?
Perhaps snake oil salesmen are wasting their time on linguistic and pseudoscientific mental gymnastics ?
Of course , the “ gymnastics ” do help .
Other research has shown that the more complex the associated placebo ritual , the more potent its effects ( such as piercing the skin with fine needles in many different locations ) .
Nonetheless , I was surprised that an honest and accurate description of a placebo does not necessarily negate its effects .
We ’re All Placebo Responders
My second surprise was that no one is immune to placebo effects .
My pride wanted to assure me that I was above being hoodwinked , but alas , Ben explained that we humans are all potential placebo responders .
Does packaging and marketing language influence your purchase decisions ?
Then you ’re a placebo responder .
Ben carefully described the role of packaging and marketing for the cosmetic industry – and I sheepishly had to admit that I have fallen for some of it .
About Liars vs. Bullsh * tters
Placebo peddlers are not necessarily liars .
This is a subtle distinction that I had n’t made before .
Ben helped me to understand that alternative medicine practitioners are n’t necessarily offering therapies that they know are outright pseudoscience .
Rather ,
The liar knows and cares about the truth , but deliberately sets out to mislead ; the truth - speaker knows the truth and is trying to give it to us ; the bullsh * tter , meanwhile , does not care about the truth , and is simply trying to impress us .
Ben goes on to quote the philosophy professor Harry Frankfurt ( from his 1986 essay “ On Bullsh *t ” ) :
[ The bullsh * tter ] is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false .
His eye is not on the facts at all , as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are , except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says .
He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly .
He just picks them out , or makes them up , to suit his purpose .
I hope that distinction was helpful to you .
I know I ’ve mistaken many bullsh * tters for liars in the past .
I ’ll be glad to label them more correctly in the future .
Dr. John is first on my list .
The Prevalence of Woo in Britain vs. the US
My final learning point for this blog post is that , as egregious as American woo is , Britain does seem to be farther along the path to utter surrender to pseudoscience .
When I see Sanjay Gupta and Nancy Snyderman teaming up to sell home stool sampling kits for diagnostic purposes , then I ’ll know that all hope is lost .
Until then , I still feel a sense of pride in the general sensibleness of our medical leaders and spokespeople .
Please do n’t anyone dissuade me of that potential illusion .
Anyway , you should really pick up a copy of Bad Science to make yourself feel a tiny bit better about US healthcare .
Apparently , the school curriculum in Britain encourages children to “ massage their carotid arteries through their rib cage ” to enhance oxygenation to the brain .
Meanwhile , the British government is asking nutritionist Gillian McKeith to advise them on national food policy .
Of course , Gillian says that we should eat more dark green vegetables because their chlorophyll will help us create oxygen for our bloodstream , and that she can sense organ toxicities through a light touch of anyone ’s abdomen .
Feel better now , my American friends ?
MUSIC NEWS - Some 40 years ago , some Christians were infuriated by the Beatles ' claim that they were " more popular than Jesus " .
Now , the Roman Catholic Church has made peace with the group !
In Saturday 's edition of the Vatican 's official newspaper , the paper absolves John Lennon of his famous remark , saying that " after so many years it sounds merely like the boasting of an English working - class lad struggling to cope with unexpected success " .
In a lengthy editorial marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles ' famous White Album , L'Osservatore Romano bestows lavish praise on the group .
" The talent of Lennon and the other Beatles gave us some of the best pages in modern pop music , " said the newspaper , which has recently tried to drop its stuffy image by covering popular culture events such as the Oscars and inviting articles from Muslim and Jewish contributors .
Only " snobs " would dismiss the Beatles ' songs , which had shown " an extraordinary resistance to the effects of time , providing inspiration for several generations of pop musicians " , said the newspaper , regarded as the Vatican 's official paper .
It was in March 1966 that Lennon made his infamous claim .

Human aerial bombardments might have pushed Neanderthals to extinction , suggests new research .
Changes in bone shape left by a life of overhand throwing hint that Stone Age humans regularly threw heavy objects , such as stones or spears , while Neanderthals did not .
“ The anatomically modern humans would have this more effective and efficient form of hunting , ” says Jill Rhodes , a biological anthropologist at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania , who led the new study .
A warmer Europe would have opened up forests , enabling longer range hunting , she says .
Rhodes and a colleague studied changes to the arm bone that connects the shoulder to the elbow – the humerus – to determine when humans may have begun using projectile weapons .
“ If we ’re trying to understand whether anatomically modern humans had projectiles , then why not read the signature that it can imprint in the skeleton , ” Rhodes says .

Bent bones
Studies of elite handball and baseball players suggest that frequent overhand throwing from an early age permanently rotates the shoulder - end of the humerus toward an athlete ’s back , compared to people who have n’t spent much time hurling .
This bone rotation only occurs in the throwing arm , so a difference between the right and left arm in fossils could be a sign of projectile use , Rhodes says .
To find out , she and Churchill measured humerus bones from Neanderthals and ancient and modern humans .
They found some evidence for projectile use in male European humans from around 26,000 to 28,000 years ago – the middle Palaeolithic period – who would have been contemporaries of Neanderthals .
Their right humerus bones were generally more rotated toward their back than their left , while Rhodes ’s team noticed no such asymmetry in Neanderthal arms .
Earliest projectiles ?
“ These upper Palaeolithic men were doing something different with their arms than the Neanderthals were , ” she says .
The earliest concrete evidence of projectile use comes from a 20,000 - year - old spear - throwing device , says Steve Churchill , at Duke University in Durham North Carolina , who co-authored the paper .
But as far back as 100,000 years – before Homo sapiens left Africa – sharpened stones began to resemble the pointed stone heads of later throwing spears and arrows .
This has led some researchers to speculate that the use of projectile weapons originated in Africa – not later on in Europe or other places of human settlement .
“ It ’s all very suggestive , but there ’s no smoking gun there , ” Churchill says .
However , Erik Trinkaus , a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis , doubts that projectile weapons played a major role in human culture before about 25,000 years ago and the extinction of Neanderthals .
Ancient conflict
“ The shift in hunting strategies , there ’s probably something there , but it ’s not as pronounced as people make it out to be , ” he says .
Humans may have been hurling aerodynamic stones around the time Neanderthals died out , but spear - throwing did not become a common hunting practice until aeons later , he argues .
“ No matter what ’s happening , we ’re not talking about the appearance of a new behaviour , but the shift in frequency of a behaviour , ” Trinkaus says .
This could leave open the door for occasional uses of projectiles during the period when Neanderthals and humans might have interacted .
A Neanderthal rib bone that shows signs of damage inflicted by a thrown spear is tantalizing evidence for a more nefarious use of projectile weapons .
“ There is some evidence of warfare between them , ” Rhodes says .

Qin Gang , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , called the document “ untrue and slanderous , ” and said that China cherished human rights and opposed torture .
“ To our regret , some biased committee members , in drafting the observations , chose to ignore the substantial materials provided by the Chinese Government , ” he said in a statement posted Monday on the ministry ’s Web site , adding that they “ even fabricated some unverified information . ”
The ministry did not describe the material it had provided to the United Nations committee .
The report ’s publication is another embarrassment for the Communist Party , which has been striving to demonstrate its commitment to human rights .
Last month , the government was infuriated by the European Union ’s decision to honor Hu Jia , one of the country ’s best - known dissidents , who is serving a three - and - a - half year prison term for subversion ; last week , China was angered by a United States Congressional report that criticized what it called China ’s failure to fulfill a pledge to improve human rights leading up to the Olympic Games and during them .
“ Illegal detentions and harassment of dissidents and petitioners followed the Chinese government and Communist Party ’s instructions to officials to ensure a ‘ harmonious ’ and dissent - free Olympics , ” the report said .
“ Individuals detained for circulating a ‘ We Want Human Rights , Not Olympics ’ petition are now serving sentences in prison and ‘ re - education through labor ’ centers . ”
Although China ’s Constitution includes provisions to protect human rights and China has ratified numerous international conventions banning torture , public security officials frequently use coercion to gain signed confessions .
“ I have yet to see a political case in which the person was not tortured or mistreated , ” said Nicholas Bequelin , a researcher based in Hong Kong for Human Rights Watch .
Even though torture is technically illegal under Chinese law , he added , there is no explicit prohibition against evidence obtained through coercion .
Human rights advocates say that the government ’s crackdown on dissenters has not let up since the Games , when petitioners seeking permission to demonstrate in parks officially designated for protests were whisked away by the police .
While attending QCon San Francisco , I had the particular pleasure of attending a whole track that was devoted to the area of functional programming , a topic that I have a profound interest in .
After having followed the track , I ’m even more convinced than before that functional programming is not confined the the academic world .
I think that it will have a profound impact on our mental perspective and the way we think about programming and problem solving in the next coming years .
In this blog , I will summarize the sessions I followed , provide you with a couple of thought provoking ideas that I picked up , and hopefully makes you think about your programming style .
The track started of with what seemed like a rather unusual combination : a presentation by Paul Hudak about Haskell and the Arts .
He talked about the concept of Functional Reactive Programming ( FRP ) , now a key area of research at the University of Yale .
FRP is a programming style where each function can capture a time varying quantity ( for instance input sound , video , user actions ) .
This style of programming has applications in Robotics , parallel programming , audio processing .
Whenever a new input value is given to a function , it is re-evaluated and new output is returned .
In his talk , he presented specially HasCore and HasSound , domain specific languages developed for music and sound synthesis .
Paul said that functional languages are specially suited for computer music , as they are declarative ( saying ‘ What ’ should be done , instead of ‘ How ’ it should be done ) .
Haskells abstraction mechanisms allow for musical programs that are elegant , precise and powerful , using the mechanisms of lazy evaluation , higher order functions , algebraic data types and type classes .
A basic example of music modeling in Haskell can be found here .
The next talk was given by Lennart Augustsson on a very different subject , yet no less interesting : implementing Domain Specific Languages in Haskell .
It seams that , whenever the topic of DSL ’s is mentioned to a Haskell programmer , a wry smile will appear on his face , since this has been done since ages in Haskell already , and it ’s hard for him to see why it ’s currently such a hype .
Lennart gave a couple of examples which he himself had developed by implementing DSL ’s in Haskell .
For me , the most striking was the case where he had implemented a DSL for generating Excel ( i.e. the real Excel sheets , not just a text based csv file ) .
As he stated , Excel has a somewhat rudimentary abstraction mechanism , consisting only of copy and past re-use .
However it is used widely by business people and is a familiar UI .
Therefore , the solution is to generate Excel sheets .
Lennart is an advocate of strong type checking to prevent errors at compile time .
He showed how he had used Haskells type classes , and also a more obscure concept as Phantom types in his Excel DSL .
The result was a DSL capable of generating Excel sheets without allowing type errors in operations , such as the addition of two cells in Excel where one contains an integer and the other containing a string , a thing that Excel itself does not prevent .
An interesting and also amusing session indeed , showing the full power of Haskells type system capabilities , and demonstrating a use of it in an area that probably does not spring directly to the mind when thinking of Haskell .
A perhaps more familiar concept to most of us was demonstrated in a session given by David Pollak .
He talked about a web application , Buy a feature , that he had developed recently .
A subject that perhaps will not raise most interest immediately , however , David had used Scala and Scala ’s Lift web framework , the latter being created by himself .
He had been using functional programming paradigms , including Scala ’s Actor library to deal with concurrency , in order to implement a multi-user , web - based , real - time , serious game .
As he stated , the team initially used the Java ’s imperative programming style .
However , after some time ( and coaching ) they gradually move over to use the declarative , functional programming style that Scala also offers .
Some more noteworthy statements were , that none of the bugs found in the application were concurrency related , apparently the event driven , message passing programming style using Scala ’s Actor library served him well .
Also , he stated , the amount of unit tests he needed to comfortably put this system into production had been considerably less ( in the order of 30 % if my remember correctly ) compared to the amount of test coverage required when using Ruby and Rails , which he has also been using extensively .
An interesting case study , and one of the first real world examples about Scala ’s usage that I had heard of .
If you ’re interested , read David ’s blog ) for more on this topic .
The day ’s ending could not have been much better for a functional programming adherent .
Eric Meijer himself concluded it , with a delightful talk titled ‘ The fundamentalist functionalist programming ’ .
His thought provoking argument is that we ’ve been moving into the wrong directions for the last dozens of years in the way we program , and it ’s time to see change direction .
Turning , as the title of this blog indicates , to pure , fundamental functional programming .
Why would this be a good thing ?
All ‘ pure ’ functional code has no side effects , and therefore does not alter state .
Lacking state that is altered , the order in which statements are executed does not matter , nor does number of times a program gets executed .
This makes programs better understandable and far less error prone .
How nasty an implicit side effect of a function can be was shown by Eric with an example from the C# language .
It would make this blog too lengthy to go into detail , so for the interested reader should take a look at his blog .
Now , many will think along these lines : ‘ no side effects , thus , no use ’ , specially when thinking about how to do IO , which always causes some side effect .
Actually Eric ’s main argument about fundamentalist functional programming was not that all side effects are bad .
Indeed he argued that any program can have side effects , and that side effects are even a good thing .
However , his main argument was that all side effects should be made explicit in the language .
It ’s the implicit side effects hidden in function or method calls that leads to surprising and unexpected results and as a consequence lengthy debugging sessions .
Even Erlang is not a ‘ pure ’ functional language in the fundamentalist sense , since IO operations as well as the spawning of a new process do have side effects that are implicit in the language .
The language Eric has taken part in designing , Haskell , is naturally the language he is advocating to use , and if not the language itself , then at least its ideas .
In Haskell , all side effects are coded in Monadic classes .
Eric gave a simple example about this concept , stating that a Monad can be simply be understood as a Collection of values of things that change .
He made the comparison of a watch being a Monad , of which the time has a different value each time you take a look at it .
The watch does not change itself , but the value it represents does .
Monadic classed can be passed around functions without letting side effects escape the Monadic class itself .
By using this mechanism , it is immediately obvious which parts of a program actually do change state , and this makes programs easier to understand .
One might think that these concepts are still only of academic interest .
However , as Eric showed , it ’s already out there in LINQ , .NET ’s language - integrated query , set , which uses Monadic classes and lazy evaluation .
So if you if you ’re a C# programmer , you ’re already dealing with these functional concepts .
C# incorporates more and more functional features into the language .
A very thought provoking talk that made me think why the whole world is not using a functional programming style .
However , after this day , I ’m convinced that functional programming is very much alive , and we ’ll see an increasing use of it and its ideas in our daily work .
I think we need to embrace those ideas to take full advantage of them in our problem solving and , ultimately , to write better programs .
Google Docs has yet to take a bite out of Microsoft Office 's slice of the productivity pie , according to new data from Clickstream Technologies .
The market research firm surveyed its standing panel of 2,400 US Internet users and found that , not only was Google Docs usage relatively low compared to other suites , those who used Google Docs continued to use Office alongside it .
Google obviously has a long way to go if it wants to compete with Microsoft , but it still has a chance at growing its productivity market share .
Between May and November of this year , only one percent of Clickstream 's panel used Google Docs , making it the second most popular free productivity suite after OpenOffice.org ( which was used by five percent of the panel ) .
Microsoft Office managed to trounce both , however , with more than 50 percent of the panel making use of it exclusively .
Additionally , Google Docs users did less when using the web - based suite than people who used OpenOffice.org or Office apps .
Users only performed an average of 40 actions per session , whereas they performed 548 in OpenOffice and 1,797 in Microsoft Word .
Google Docs users did n't appear to make use of the suite 's offline capabilities either , and none of them made use of Gmail 's " Open as a Google Document " feature to open an attachment .
Finally , 68 percent of the Google Docs group still reported having used Word at least once during the six - month period .
Comparatively , only 26 percent of OpenOffice.org users made use of Microsoft 's apps .
This tidbit of data is particularly telling , as it shows that most users still do n't see Google 's offerings as a standalone option even if they prefer it .
( Of course , I type this as I have a Google Docs tab open in my browser and with no other productivity suite installed on my machine .
Hey , that fraction of a percent has to come from somewhere . )
" Although Google Docs and Spreadsheets has been touted as a potential competitor to the Microsoft Office Suite , OpenOffice is currently the more likely app to take that position , possibly indicating the value of offline and local processing enabled by installed applications , " says Clickstream .
The firm 's data seems to support a report from NPD Group published last year , which said that online productivity suites barely register on the general public 's radar .
At the same time , Google 's target audience trends more toward educational institutions and businesses , and the company 's list of customers has been steadily growing with names like Procter & Gamble , General Electric Corporation , and Prudential .
Consumer adoption could increase as more users experience the suite in a business setting , but Google clearly has a long way to go before unseating Microsoft as king in the productivity space .
McCain is touting his VP choice as a reformer who fought against earmarks ( often called “ pork ” ) .
But the LA Times has found that when Palin was mayor of Wasilla , she made McCain ’s “ Pork List ” three times for requesting questionable earmarks for her small Alaska town .
Among the projects in McCain ’s Pork List that Palin requested was $ 1 million for a communications center in Wasilla , which local law enforcement has said is redundant and creates confusion .
Records show that Palin — first as mayor of Wasilla and recently as governor of Alaska — was far from shy about pursuing hundreds of millions in earmarks for her town , her region , and her state .
In fact , just this year Palin wrote in a newspaper column “ The federal budget , in its various manifestations , is incredibly important to us , and congressional earmarks are one aspect of this relationship . ”
Before Palin became mayor of Wasilla , the town received few if any earmarks , but Palin actively sought federal earmarks , even hiring a Washington lobbyist .
It does n’t help that the lobbyist was Ted Stevens ’ former chief of staff ( Stevens is currently under indictment for corruption ) , and was a close associate of convicted influence peddler Jack Abramoff .
In her speech when McCain announced Palin as his running mate , Palin said :
I ’ve championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
In fact , I told Congress thanks , but no thanks , on that bridge to nowhere .
If our state wanted a bridge , I said , we ’d build it ourselves .
The facts say otherwise .
As a candidate for governor two years ago , Palin supported funding for the bridge .
Later , when this became a political liability , Palin flip - flopped and killed the bridge project , but she still kept the earmark funds and spent them for other projects .
This year alone , Palin submitted to congress a list of proposed earmarks for Alaska worth almost $ 200 million .
UPDATE : Taxpayers for Common Sense , a watchdog group that tracks earmark spending , ranks Alaska first in earmark spending for this fiscal year .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday signaled a readiness to lower U.S. interest rates in a dramatic shift to support an economy battered by a financial crisis of “ historic dimension . ”
Recent economic data and financial developments show the outlook for growth has worsened , Bernanke told the National Association for Business Economics .
The outlook for inflation , while still uncertain , has improved somewhat as oil and other commodity prices have eased , he added .
“ In light of these developments , the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate , ” Bernanke said .
In opening the door to rate cuts , Bernanke is departing from the view he and other Fed officials had expressed until recently that lower rates would likely have little effect in boosting economic activity while credit markets are frozen .
The Fed cut interbank lending rates to 2.0 percent in seven steps between mid-September of last year and the end of April in a bid to put a floor under the economy .
Since then , the central bank has focused on cash auctions and loans of ultra-safe Treasury securities to unlock credit markets .
The Fed ’s efforts at restoring credit flows by pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system have become increasingly frequent and aggressive .
Earlier on Tuesday , the Fed announced a plan to buy an unspecified amount of commercial paper to ensure this common channel of short - term corporate lending remains open .
US stocks , already lower on credit worries , initially extended their decline on Bernanke ’s gloomy growth outlook but then pared losses .
Prices for U.S. government debt at first found support , but then slipped as stocks gained .

RATE CUT WEAPON
Many
Fed officials had argued that lowering rates further would do little to spur economic activity while credit is jammed , and they have warned that with inflation already at worrisome levels , easier borrowing terms could set the stage for problems when the economy picks up .
Bernanke said the economy is poised for subdued growth during the remainder of this year and into 2009 .
Financial turmoil is likely to extend the weak period and increase risks to growth , he said .
“ Continued efforts to stabilize the financial markets are essential , ” Bernanke said .
“ The Federal Reserve will continue to use the tools at its disposal to improve market functioning and liquidity . ”
The Fed chair also took a softer tone on price increases , which have bedeviled the inflation - wary central bank even amid a deep housing slump and mortgage - related losses that have put financial markets into disarray .
While inflation has been elevated , prices for oil and other commodities prices have tumbled from recent peaks and import prices have fallen , Bernanke said .

Further , expectations of future inflation had eased , he said , which would lessen any chance of a wage - price spiral from igniting .
“ These recent developments , together with economic activity that is likely to fall short of potential for a time , should lead to rates of inflation more consistent with price stability , ” Bernanke said .
Even so , he cautioned that commodity prices could turn sharply and said some higher costs have already become embedded in the system .
“ We have to be very careful not to declare victory . ”

Several interesting things are happening in the wild world of digital photography as it ’s colliding with digital video .
Most notably , the new Canon 5D Mark II ( roughly $ 2700 ) can record 1080 p video and the new Nikon D90 ( roughly $ 1000 ) can record 720 p video .
At the higher end , Red just announced some cameras that will ship next year that will be able to record full video ( as fast as 120 frames per second in some cases ) at far greater than HD resolutions ( for $ 12 K , you can record video at a staggering 6000 × 4000 pixels ) .
You can configure a Red camera as a still camera or as a video camera .
Recently , well - known photographer Vincent Laforet ( perhaps best known for his aerial photographs , such as “ Me and My Human “ ) got his hands on a pre-production Canon 5D Mark II and filmed a “ mock commercial ” called “ Reverie ” , which shows off what the camera can do , particularly its see - in - the - dark low - light abilities .
If you read Laforet ’s blog , you ’ll see that he ’s quite excited , not just about the technical aspects of the camera , but about what this means to him as a professional photographer .
Suddenly , he can leverage all of the expensive lenses that he already owns and capture professional - quality video “ for free . ”
This has all kinds of ramifications for what it means to cover an event .
For example , at professional sporting events , video rights are entirely separate from the “ normal ” still photography rights given to the press .
It ’s now the case that every pro photographer is every bit as capable of capturing full resolution video as the TV crew covering the event .
Will still photographers be contractually banned from using the video features of their cameras ?
Laforet investigated while he was shooting the Beijing Olympics :
Given that all of these rumours were going around quite a bit in Beijing [ prior to the announcement of the Nikon D90 or Canon 5D Mark II ] – I sat down with two very influential people who will each be involved at the next two Olympic Games .
Given that NBC paid more than $ 900 million to acquire the U.S. Broadcasting rights to this past summer games , how would they feel about a still photographer showing up with a camera that can shoot HD video ?
I got the following answer from the person who will be involved with Vancouver which I ’ll paraphrase : Still photographers will be allowed in the venues with whatever camera they chose , and shoot whatever they want – shooting video in it of itself , is not a problem .
HOWEVER – if the video is EVER published – the lawsuits will inevitably be filed , and credentials revoked etc .
This to me seems like the reasonable thing to do – and the correct approach .
But the person I spoke with who will be involved in the London 2012 Olympic Games had a different view , again I paraphrase : “ Those cameras will have to be banned .
Period .
They will never be allowed into any Olympic venue ” because the broadcasters would have a COW if they did .
And while I think this is not the best approach – I think it might unfortunately be the most realistic .
Do you really think that the TV producers and rights - owners will “ trust ” photographers not to broadcast anything they ’ve paid so much for .
Unlikely .
Let ’s do a thought experiment .
Red ’s forthcoming “ Scarlet FF35 Mysterium Monstro ” will happily capture 6000 ×4000 pixels at 30 frames per second .
If you multiply that out , assuming 8 bits per pixel ( after modest compression ) , you ’re left with the somewhat staggering data rate of 720 MB /s ( i.e. , 2.6TB / hour ) .
Assuming you ’re recording that to the latest 1.5TB hard drives , that means you ’re swapping media every 30 minutes ( or you ’re tethered to a RAID box of some sort ) .
Sure , your camera now weighs more and you ’re carrying around a bunch of hard drives ( still lost in the noise relative to the weight that a sports photographer hauls around in those long telephoto lenses ) , but you manage to completely eliminate the “ oops , I missed the shot ” issue that dogs any photographer .
Instead , the “ shoot ” button evolves into more of a bookmarking function .
“ Yeah , I think something interesting happened around here . ”
It ’s easy to see photo editors getting excited by this .
Assuming you ’ve got access to multiple photographers operating from different angles , you can now capture multiple views of the same event at the same time .
With all of that data , synchronized and registered , you could even do 3D reconstructions ( made famous / infamous by the “ bullet time ” videos used in the Matrix films or the Gap ’s Khaki Swing commercial ) .
Does the local newspaper have the rights to do that to an NFL game or not ?
Of course , this sort of technology is going to trickle down to gear that mere mortals can afford .
Rather than capturing every frame , maybe you now only keep a buffer of the last ten seconds or so , and when you press the “ shoot ” button , you get to capture the immediate past as well as the present .
Assuming you ’ve got a sensor that let ’s you change the exposure on the fly , you can also now imagine a camera capturing a rapid succession of images at different exposures .
That means no more worries about whether you over or under - exposed your image .
In fact , the camera could just glue all the images together into a high - dynamic - range ( HDR ) image , which yields sometimes fantastic results .
One would expect , in the cutthroat world of consumer electronics , that competition would bring features like this to market as fast as possible , although that ’s far from a given .
If you install third - party firmware on a Canon point - and - shoot , you get all kinds of functionality that the hardware can support but which Canon has chosen not to implement .
Maybe Canon would rather you spend more money for more features , even if the cheaper hardware is perfectly capable .
Maybe they just want to make common feature easy to use and not overly clutter the UI .
( Not that any camera vendors are doing particularly well on ease of use , but that ’s a topic for another day . )
Freedom to Tinker readers will recognize some common themes here .
Do I have the right to hack my own gear ?
How will new technology impact old business models ?
In the end , when industries collide , who wins ?
My fear is that the creative freelance photographer , like Laforet , is likely to get pushed out by the big corporate sponsor .
Why allow individual freelancers to shoot a sports event when you can just spread professional video cameras all over the place and let newspapers buy stills from those video feeds ?
Laforet discussed these issues at length ; his view is that “ traditional ” professional photography , as a career , is on its way out and the future is going to be very , very different .
There will still be demand for the kind of creativity and skills that a good photographer can bring to the game , but the new rules of the game have yet to be written .
As much as people complain about the challenges of balancing copyrights and fair use in the US , overseas courts have been happy to provide examples that remind us that some aspects of US copyright law are actually fairly liberal .
The latest such reminder comes courtesy of a case in Germany that revisits an issue that appears settled in the US : the right of image search services to create thumbnails from copyrighted works to display with the search results .
The German courts have now determined that this is not OK in Germany , where Google has just lost two copyright suits over image thumbnails .
This is not the first tussle of this sort that Google has been involved with .
The company had initially lost a copyright case based on its creation of thumbnails from porn site Perfect 10 , but ultimately prevailed on appeal in that case .
Although the appeal did not clarify all the legal issues , it did determine that the creation of thumbnails fell within the exceptions granted by US copyright law for transformative use .
The search giant has n't always had good luck in European courts , however .
Last year , Google lost a legal tussle with a Belgian newspaper trade group , and was left in the awkward position of seeing the excerpts it uses for Google News content be declared a violation of copyright .
Negotiations have gotten the Belgian papers ' content back in Google searches , but the case is still very active ; Google is appealing , while the newspapers are looking to extract a healthy fine .
The latest case to be decided combines aspects of both of these others : image thumbnails and European courts .
In this case , the venue was Germany , where Google was being sued for creating thumbnails from the copyrighted materials of a photographer and a comic artist .
According to Bloomberg News ,
Google lost both of these cases , with courts declaring that shrinking images down to thumbnail size does n't create a new work , and thus displaying the thumbnails is a violation of copyright .
Google was , not surprisingly , unamused .
A Google spokesperson told paidContent , " Today 's decision is very bad for Internet users in Germany , it is a major step backwards for German e-business in general , and it is bad for the thousands of websites who receive valuable traffic through Image Search and similar services . "
Although copyright holders can easily let search engine indexing bots know what files to avoid , the ruling apparently leaves them with no legal need to do so .
Instead , the burden lies on the search engines , which apparently need to determine what images they discover are subject to copyright .
Given the impossibility of doing so in an automated fashion , the ruling is likely to see Google radically alter its image search offerings in Germany .
Google is unlikely to be the only one with this problem , too , as those who initiate these lawsuits rarely stop at one search engine .
Perfect 10 later went after Microsoft despite having part of its case against Google thrown out .
Meanwhile , the Belgian newspapers , fresh off their Google victory , went after the EU itself .
It seems likely that it will be a matter of time before other image search services get served in Germany .
I shot these photos at a denim factory in Kentucky that specializes in distressing high - end jeans for a few top designers .
I used to scoff at paying a premium for jeans that come with holes in them already .
Then I saw just how much work goes into distressing jeans , and I realized that these people are artists .
You ca n’t just have any loose threads , you have to have the right loose threads .
They ca n’t just be faded .
They have to be the right color .
A lot of work goes into making these jeans look just right .
The iOS update 10.3.1 was indeed quite surprising with all its features , but it seems that its successor is also raising the standards .
It will bring some new and interesting features to users all around the world , which can only be good news .
However , up until now we have n’t seen any device that would ignore the 32 - bit support , and this is the case with the update .
Briefly , it only supports the 64 - bit iOS devices , even though the company has already released 2 beta versions .
What Devices Are Affected ?
Forbes reports that the devices that are going to suffer after this decision are iPhone 5 and 5C , since both of them rely on a 32 - bit infrastructure .
Naturally , this is going to be a huge disappointment for people who are using these devices , since they will not be able to enjoy the update 10.3.2 .
Good for Users and the Company
The iOS update 10.3.2 is different than the previous 10.0.3 one because it follows releases over all the devices that are compatible with the iOS 10 : iPad Mini 2 , iPod touch ( sixth generation ) etc .
The 10.0.3 has been released in a limited manner , for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus compatible phones only .
This decision is mutually beneficial both for users and for the company , due to the resource sharing feature .
MacRumors reported that on April 10 this year , Apple released the 2nd beta version for the 10.3.2 iOS version .
The previous update , iOS 10.3 , brought interesting features , such as Apple File System and the Find My AirPods , which was highly appreciated .
The next one , 10.3.1 , was intended more for security improvements .
Now it seems that Apple is offering a downgrade from 10.3.2. to 10.3.1 , but not older than this .
You cannot , however , downgrade to 10.3 or 10.2.1 .

North Carolina , Indiana , Missouri , Montana , and the impact of Bob Barr and Ron Paul
Tonight , Indiana and North Carolina look to go blue for president - elect Barack Obama .
And in both of these states Bob Barr 's vote total made the difference .
Missouri looks like it will go McCain , but Barr 's vote total still made it closer than it had to be .
Meanwhile , Ron Paul appears to be making a difference in Montana , although , within the last fifteen minutes , McCain 's numbers have eclipsed Obama 's ( Obama had a slight lead until just now ) .
With 99 per cent of precincts reporting in Indiana , Obama has 49.9 per cent of the vote to McCain 's 49 .
Bob Barr has 1.1 per cent .
With 100 per cent of precincts reporting in North Carolina , Obama has 49.8 per cent to McCain 's 49.6 .
Bob Barr has 0.6 per cent .
With 99 per cent of precincts reporting in Missouri , McCain has 49.4 per cent to Obama 's 49.3 .
Bob Barr has 0.4 per cent .
In Montana , with 74 per cent of precincts reporting , McCain is leading with 49.6 per cent to Obama 's 47.2 .
Ron Paul , who did n't run an official campaign at all , and tried to get his name removed from the ballot , is sitting on 2.1 per cent of the vote ( Barr has 0.3 per cent ) .

So if Libertarians are having a Ross Perot effect , is that good or bad ?
I can not help but wonder ...

Given the tiny precentages -- and given the ideological grab bag of supporters attracted to the Libertarian party -- we probably can't read too much into this .
Had Paul been actively campaigning for the Republicans , though , he could have energized new voters .
But will never know what impact Paul could have had within his own party had he been given a chance .

Too bad Ron Paul could not just dump his principals and support McCain , them maybe he would have only lost by a few votes instead of getting smeared ......
Juan McCain , who for all his hot air about Pork Barrel Projects and Earmarks had to rush back to Washington from the campaign trail to vote in favor of the fattest welfare check to Americas richest banks , voting yes right in step with his comrade Obama .
If McCain had a spine he would have filibustered the bailout but he did not even give a floor speech ..... shameful ......
Ron Paul gave a floor speech .
He told us this was going to happen years ago and Voted NO as he always has on issues that go against the US Constitution .
Now the bankers who created this mess have been given more of our money and more power and we will work for generations to pay the interest to the IRS to cover THEIR bad investments .
It is time for the people of this county to wake up and see they way we are all slaves to the money masters .

Consider researching the outstanding two - term Governor of New Mexico , Gary Johnson , for Republican nominee in 2012 .
I have met Governor Gary Johnson and he would get the full support of millions of Americans in the drug - law reform movement .
Mr. Johnson has unassailable integrity , huge intelligence , a great mind , a thorough understanding of the US Constitution , great principles of limited government .
He is articulate , sincere and accessible .
Indeed , I welcome the news of Mr. Johnson 's candidacy .
He is just the revitalization the Republican leadership requires .
To add your support for the GARY JOHNSON in 2012 campaign , go here
http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=38552147212&ref=nf
Johnson will need to start the dinner & speaking circuit now to develop a leadership role by the next mid-term ( 2010 ) election .
Our support now may be influential .
Calling all Ron Paul Republicans , libertarians , conservatives : let Gary Johnson know you would support his bid to test the waters for a 2012 bid .
Getting the proper , educated Republican candidate in 2012 is so vital .
It has to be a limited government constitutionalist who believes in sound money , freedom , the repeal of Prohibition , an end to empire , and an end to the security - surveillance state .
Gary Johnson represents that kind of Republican .
Ron Paul will be 76 in 2012 .
He'd be an excellent adviser to Johnson , and I love Ron Paul .
I think Ron would support Gary Johnson for the leadership of the Republican Party .
Someone will have to ask Congressman Paul for his opinion on Gary Johnson but I 'll tell you now , I know Dr. Paul is an admirer of Johnson 's record as Governor of New Mexico .

Marc : I came across Gary Johnson when Cato put together a report of the best governors in the U.S .
Apart from Jeff Flake , my other top pick would be Johnson .
Keep your eyes on the Western Standard , we 'll be writing about him very soon .

This column recently recommended that as part of their 21st - century survival kits , rock and pop artists should strive to become freewheeling multimedia brands .
With the major labels in decline and thus unable to float generous advances to up - and - coming talent , this is no time to sit around and craft a sonic masterpiece .
Two years off the road - and under the radar - is an eternity in this environment .
Bands of modest means need to think like Hollywood actors .
Keep working .
If your face is n’t on the big screen , make sure it ’s on a magazine cover or a prominent video - store shelf .
That ’s an easy task for the camera - ready likes of the Jonas Brothers - not so much for indie - minded types who might be wary of self - promotion or highly protective of their music .
Doubtless in reaction to this sage advice , a couple of bands have leapt toward the front lines of Beatlesque multimedia innovation .
Tennessee rockers Kings of Leon , hyping the Sept. 23 release of their fourth studio LP , “ Only by the Night , ” are posting one home movie per day this month on their official Web site .
The clips include intimate recording - studio footage and performance pieces plus some charming , deadpan interview segments .
For instance , one of the boys offers up this profound meditation on the band ’s new single , “ Sex on Fire ” : “ I think that one ’s about … sex .
Obviously . ”
Indeed .
Then there ’s Tally Hall , a fresh - faced band of color - coordinated , necktie - clad indie- popsters not long out of the University of Michigan .
Soon after college , they were signed to the tiny indie label Quack .
They toured extensively behind their debut album , “ Marvin ’s Marvelous Mechanical Museum , ” and moved back in with parents .
Then came a big break : a deal with Atlantic Records .
The band members promptly found themselves at a crossroads - exuberant about the future but with an unexpected amount of free time on their hands .
The machinery of a major label , it turned out , is like a jet engine : a powerful propellant that takes a while to warm up .
“ So we said , ‘ What do we now ? ’ ” recalls Tally Hall guitarist Joe Hawley , 25 .
“ What we like to do is write music and play music , but the formal business elements have n’t fallen fully into place , ” he says .
A film student who studied screenwriting at Michigan , Mr. Hawley says that rather than wait idly while Atlantic put a promotional plan in place , Tally Hall plunged into making short films for the past year and a half .
With friends and family on hand as extras , the five band members on Monday will launch “ Tally Hall ’s Internet Show ” ( “ T.H. I.S. ” ) , a series of polished , approximately two - minute set pieces predicated on hip , absurdist humor .
The series , shot on digital cameras and edited with Macintosh movie software , will be showcased front and center on the band ’s Web site and cross-posted on YouTube.com and iTunes.com - a multiplatform strategy designed to generate viral , word - of - mouth traffic .
A clip I previewed , “ Natural Ketchup , ” finds the band mates around a cafeteria table playing a game of 20 Questions centered on the titular , corn - syrup - free condiment .
Bassist Zubin Sedghi fields the queries , which escalate with hostility : “ Can you get it in a normal grocery store ? …
Is it pulpy ? …
Does it need to be refrigerated ? ”
Then the whole thing degenerates into a food fight as a , well , ketchup -y ballad by Matchbox 20 plays on the soundtrack .
Mr. Hawley is modest about the artistic pedigree of “ T.H.I.S . ”
“ A lot of it ’s just for fun , ” he says .
“ It ’s not necessarily professional , but it ’s not amateur , either . ”
Modesty aside , the band has high hopes for the series .
“ We wanted to make a quality product rather than something that ’s thrown up on the Web and then torn down .
We ’re trying to make something that will be meaningful .
It ’s a project .
We definitely planned it out , ” Mr. Hawley says .
“ T.H. I.S. ” may or may not become the next viral smash , but it seems clear that Tally Hall is blazing a trail .
As Mr. Hawley says , the Web has become an abstract playground where “ identity is liquid . ”
As in politics , success in music will depend increasingly on artists ’ ability to pierce through the clutter with biography and “ narratives ” - the more revealing or unusual , the better .
Rapper Diddy opining into a hand - held camera about Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin wo n’t cut it .
Madonna comparing Sen. John McCain to murderous dictators like Adolf Hitler and Robert Mugabe was good for a news cycle , but the stunt felt tired , irritating ; it felt 20th - century , in fact .
The future belongs to bands like Kings of Leon and Tally Hall and other artists who use the Web to interact with fans in a sustained way and with humor and intelligence .
To the cleverest will go the spoils .

At least five artists share the name Rodriquez .
1 ) Sixto Diaz Rodriguez ( also known as Rodriguez or as Jesus Rodriguez ) is an American folk musician , born in Detroit , Michigan on July 10 , 1942 .
He was named ' Sixto ' ( pronounced seex - toe ) because he was the sixth child in his family .
Rodriguez 's parents were middle - class immigrants from Mexico , who left in the 1920s .
In most of his songs he takes a political stance on the cruelties facing the inner city poor .
In 1967 ( under the name Rod Riguez ) he released the single " I 'll Slip Away " through the small lab … read more
You know !
It 's a thingummy ...
Whatjermercallit ...
The everyday items with the forgotten names
Our lives are full of ' thingummys ' , ' thingamajigs ' and ' whatjermecallits ' - those everyday items we should know the word for , or were once told but have since forgotten .
Now , a collection of them has been compiled for a fascinating new book ...
Aglet
Is the little plastic or metal tube at the end of your shoelace .
Its purpose is to stop the thread of the lace from unravelling , as well as making it easier to feed through the shoe 's eyelets .
( The word comes from the Old French aguillette , meaning needle . )
Before the invention of plastic , aglets were made of metals such as copper , brass and silver , glass and even stone .
They were often ornamental and some were fashioned into small figures .
Should your aglet break , you may , of course , just buy another shoelace .
But if you 're more frugal - especially in these credit crunch times - shoemakers recommend that you repair them by dripping melted candle wax onto the broken end .
Borborygmus
( Pronounced bor - buh - rig - mus ) is the name for the rumbling sounds made by the stomach .
These are caused by the movement of fluids and gases , as food , acids and digestive juices migrate from the stomach into the upper part of the small intestine .
The average body makes two gallons of digestive juices a day .
The hydrochloric acid in your stomach is so strong it could eat into metal , but a special form of mucus protects your inner linings from this acid along the length of its journey .
Burgee
Is the little triangular flag that flutters on a sailing dinghy , traditionally at the top of the main mast .
As well as giving a useful indication of the direction of the wind , the burgee often proclaims membership of a particular yacht club .
Caruncula
Is the small pink protuberance in the corner of the eye .
It contains glands which produce sweat and tears .
These tears are then secreted onto the surface of the conjunctiva .
These glands are known as Ciaccio 's glands , named after Italian anatomist Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio , who first described their function in 1874 .
Caruncula :
The small pink protuberance in the corner of the eye
Contrail
Is the long , thin trail left behind by an aircraft when it 's flying high enough for the cold to turn the exhaust vapour into ice crystals .
Indeed , a condensation trail ( to give it its full name ) is , in effect , a very long , thin , man -made cloud .
Contrails may look like big swathes of pollution in the sky , but although they contain , as well as water vapour , hydrocarbons , sulphates , and nitrogen and carbon dioxides , they create , comparatively , far less ' greenhouse gas ' than motor vehicles or power plants .
Condensation trail : A contrail is created when an aircraft is flying high enough for the cold to turn the exhaust vapour into ice crystals
Dewclaw
Is the tiny fifth claw on the inner part of a dog's leg above the other toes , so called , rather romantically , because it brushes the dew from the grass .
Dogs almost always have these tiny talons on the inside of their front legs and sometimes also on their hind legs .
Some people say that dewclaws are useless and should be removed , because they can get torn or cause damage ( to clothes , furniture and the like ) .
Others claim that this odd appendage is very useful to a dog , for example , to help pick up bones and sticks .
Dongle
Is a small hardware device that plugs in to a computer , generally to authenticate a particular piece of software .
What 's that word ?
This handy guide can help you when you 're tongue - tied
Dragées
( pronounced drah - zhay )
Are those little silver balls to be found on birthday cakes .
They 're smaller than a cultured pearl , made of sugar and adorned with a metallic coating to resemble a ball bearing .
Generally , they are as tough to crunch through as a real ball bearing .
Available in gold and copper finishes .
Sugared almonds are also called dragées .
Emoticon
Is short for emotional icon .
It is the word for the symbols expressed through the keyboard of a computer or mobile phone to represent human emotions .
:-) is perhaps the most common icon , describing a smiling face .
;-) incorporates a wink in one of the eyes .
Fines
Are the dusty remnants at the bottom of cereal boxes - particularly delicious in the more sugary brands .
The cold cereal business began in the late - 19th century with the desire for a healthier diet , as an alternative to the heavy , meat - laden breakfasts people were eating at the time .
In 1863 , American James Caleb Jackson developed the first breakfast cereal , which he called Granula .
It was a healthy concoction of grains , nuts and husks of bran .
Fauxhawk
Is the hairstyle in which a strip of hair across the top of the head is longer and higher than the hair on the remainder of the head , as once worn by David Beckham .
The name is a play on words , referring to the style 's more dramatic inspiration , the Mohawk , in which the sides of the head are completely shaved , elevating the remaining top hairs to a splendid crest .
American Paratroopers during World War II adopted the cut and it was popularised by the actor Mr T in the Eighties television series The A - Team .
Fontanelle
Is a patch of soft membrane on a baby 's head , which has not yet developed into bone ; if you look closely , you can see it pulsating .
During birth , it allows the skull 's bones to flex , enabling the infant 's head to pass through its mother 's narrow birth canal .
Gari
Is the pink pickled ginger that is served on the corner of a sushi tray to accompany sushi .
It is served to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls and aid digestion .
Though it should really be eaten a slice at a time , many sushi lovers like to mash it up with the pungent , bright green wasabi paste , which is made from green Japanese horseradish .
Glassine :
The type of paper that lines boxes of chocolates or truffles
Glassine
Is the type of paper that lines boxes of chocolates or truffles and cups single chocolates .
In a special manufacturing process , paper pulp is beaten to break down the fibres , and pressed into moulds , then allowed to dry into sheets .
After that , a process called ' calendering ' presses the sheets through hot rollers , making the paper grease - and air - proof .
This is ideal for protecting chocolates from that white ' bloom ' that can sometimes appear .
The Gluteal crease
Is the place where the lower buttocks meet the upper leg .
If those buttocks are particularly comely , they might be described by the adjective callipygian , a word which derives from the Greek for beautiful ( kallos ) and buttocks ( pyge ) .
Hemidemisemiquaver
Is a musical note played for one - 64th the duration of a whole note , or semibreve .
Shorter notes are very rarely used , although Beethoven employed the semihemidemisemiquaver ( half the length of a hemidemisemiquaver ) in the first movement of his piano sonata op .13 , the PathÈtique .
The Interrobang
Is one of the most eloquent punctuation marks in the English language , combining an interrogative point , or question mark , and a bang ( printers ' parlance for the exclamation mark ) .
These are some sentences which require one : ' She said what ?!' ;
' He ate how many slices of cake ? ! ' ;
' You 're going to have a baby ?!'
No one uses them more eloquently than Captain Haddock in Herge 's Tintin stories .
Jabot
Is a ruffle or frill , generally of lace , worn at the throat of a woman 's shirt or blouse .
They were formerly also worn at the neck of a man 's shirt , and still are by Scots wearing traditional Highland Dress .
This somewhat ostentatious item was widespread in eras of luxury , and was a key part of an 18thcentury gentleman 's costume .
However , in modern times , no one has worn a jabot with quite the panache of Austin Powers .
Kerf
Is the notch made by a cutting tool such as a saw .
The size and number of teeth determines the smoothness of the kerf .
Most saws have five to ten teeth per inch .
For fine work , as many as 20 points will work best .
Lunula
Is the white half - moon part at the base of the fingernail or toe nail .
It is paler than the rest of the nail because it is n't so firmly attached to the blood vessels and is most visible on the thumbs .
The thick fold of skin that overlaps the lunula , which manicurists push down , is called the eponychium ( or cuticle ) and it protects the area between the nail and the skin from harmful bacteria .
Lunula :
The white half - moon part at the base of the fingernail or toe nail
Muselets
( Pronounced muse - lay )
Is the name for the wire cage that is wound around the neck and over the cork of a champagne bottle .
The Oche
( Pronounced okee )
Is the line ( 2.37 metres from the board ) you must stand behind to throw your arrows in a game of darts .
Philtrum
Is the vertical indentation between the upper lip and nose .
The term derives from the Greek word philein , to kiss - for the ancient Greeks believed this area was one of the most erogenous spots on the body .
Both Hitler and Charlie Chaplin covered theirs with a moustache- - while , apparently , SAS officers can kill someone simply by tapping - their philtrum in a certain way .
Philtrum :
The vertical indentation between the upper lip and nose
Phloem bundles
( Pronounced flo- em bundles ) are the squidgy , stringy bits between the skin and the edible part of a banana .
Quinquagenarian
Is the category you fall into at 50 .
Your tricenarian and vicenarian decades will be forgotten dreams .
Rowel
Is the spiked revolving wheel at the end of a cowboy 's spur .
Spogs
Are the pink and blue aniseed - flavoured jelly sweets in bags of Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts - and the only ones that contain no liquorice .
Tines
Are the prongs on a fork .
In the cutlery triumvirate of knife , fork and spoon , the knife came first , developed from implements of sharp - edged flint .
As late as the 16th century , forks were thought to be an affectation , and people who dropped food while trying to use a fork for eating were ridiculed .
Tittle
If you 've dotted an i , you have tittled , because the little dot above the i - and the j ( incidentally , the last letter to be included in our 26 - letter alphabet ) - is called a tittle .
Hence the phrase ' jot and tittle ' , which indicates that every small detail has received attention .
Ullage
Is the space in a wine bottle not occupied by wine .
If the top level of the wine is anywhere in the neck of the bottle , that 's regarded as a perfect fill level .
Older bottles may have a lower level than this , due to evaporation through the cork ; for Bordeaux wines this is described in terms of the level 's position on the shoulder , the rounded part at the top of the main bottle .
Voussoir
( Or Wedgestone ) is the term for one of the individual , slightly tapered stones forming the curved part of an arch .
The top one is called the keystone ( or quoin ) and the lowest is the springer .
Waldo
Is a mechanical , hand - like device ( otherwise known as the ' zapper ' or ' thingummy ' ) for manipulating objects by remote control .
It was named after the main character in Robert A. Heinlein 's novella Waldo ( 1942 ) , which told the story of Waldo Farthingwaite - Jones , who had been born such a weakling that he could n't even hold a spoon .
Refusing to let this hold him back , he developed a powerful mechanical hand that he operated remotely .
Zarf
Is the cardboard holder for a coffee cup that has no handle .
The word comes from the Arabic for container or envelope , because the device ( originally a metal holder for a handle - less glass ) originated in the Middle East .
Zuchetto : Pope Benedict XVI wearing a white zuchetto skullcap
Zuchetto
( pronounced zoo - ket - oh ) Is the skullcap worn by Roman Catholic clergy .
The colour of the zucchetto ( which means pumpkin in Italian ) denotes rank .
Cardinals traditionally wear red , bishops and abbots wear violet , priests black and the Pope has a white one .
Yips
Is half physical ailment , half psychological / psychosomatic condition : the golfer 's equivalent of the writer 's block , the surgeon 's shaky hand or the construction worker 's dodgy back .

Denser computer chips possible with plasmonic lenses that 'fly '
Engineers at the University of California , Berkeley , are reporting a new way of creating computer chips that could revitalize optical lithography , a patterning technique that dominates modern integrated circuits manufacturing .
( Liang Pan and Cheng Sun , UC Berkeley )
By combining metal lenses that focus light through the excitation of electrons - or plasmons - on the lens ' surface with a " flying head " that resembles the stylus on the arm of an old - fashioned LP turntable and is similar to those used in hard disk drives , the researchers were able to create line patterns only 80 nanometers wide at speeds up to 12 meters per second , with the potential for higher resolution detail in the near future .
" Utilizing this plasmonic nanolithography , we will be able to make current microprocessors more than 10 times smaller , but far more powerful , " said Xiang Zhang , UC Berkeley professor of mechanical engineering and head of the research team behind this development .
" This technology could also lead to ultra - high density disks that can hold 10 to 100 times more data than disks today . "
Zhang worked jointly on the project with David Bogy , UC Berkeley professor of mechanical engineering .
The study now appears online in Nature Nanotechnology , and is scheduled for the journal 's December print issue .
The process of optical lithography shares some of the same principles as film photography , which creates pictures by exposing film in a camera to light , and then developing the film with chemical solutions .
In the semiconductor industry , optical lithography is a process in which light is transferred through a mask with the desired circuit pattern onto a photosensitive material , or photoresist , that reacts chemically when exposed .
The material then goes through a series of chemical baths to etch the circuit design onto a wafer .
" With optical lithography , or photolithography , you can instantly project a complex circuit design onto a silicon wafer , " said Liang Pan , a UC Berkeley graduate student working with Zhang and Bogy , and one of three co-lead authors of the Nature Nanotechnology paper .
" However , the resolution possible with this technique is limited by the fundamental nature of light .
To get a smaller feature size , you must use shorter and shorter light wavelengths , which dramatically increases the cost of manufacturing .
Also , light has a diffraction limit restricting how small it can be focused .
Currently , the minimum feature size with conventional photolithography is about 35 nanometers , but our technique is capable of a much higher resolution at a relatively low cost . "
The UC Berkeley researchers chose a different approach to overcome the diffraction limit of light .
They took advantage of a well - known property of metals : the presence at the surface of free electrons that oscillate when exposed to light .
These oscillations , which absorb and generate light , are known as evanescent waves and are much smaller than the wavelength of light .

The engineers designed a silver plasmonic lens with concentric rings that concentrate the light to a hole in the center where it exits on the other side .
In the experiment , the hole was less than 100 nanometers in diameter , but it can theoretically be as small as 5 to 10 nanometers .
The researchers packed the lenses into a flying plasmonic head , so - called because it would " fly " above the photoresist surface during the lithography process .
Similar flying heads have been developed at UC Berkeley 's Computer Mechanics Laboratory , which is directed by Bogy .
" Flying heads support the phenomenal advances in data storage in hard disk drives , " said Bogy .
" They enable the fast speeds and nanometer accuracy required in this potentially new approach to semiconductor manufacturing . "
The researchers said the flying head design could potentially hold as many as 100,000 lenses , enabling parallel writing for even faster production .
The researchers compared this flying plasmonic head to the arm and stylus of an LP turntable , with the photoresist surface spinning like a record .
Instead of a needle moving along the grooves of a spinning record , however , the flying plasmonic head contains a nanometer - scale optical stylus that " writes " onto the spinning surface of the photoresist without actually touching it .
Because the light from plasmons decays less than 100 nanometers from the metal surface , the photoresist material must be placed very close to the lens .
To accommodate this limitation , the researchers designed an air bearing that uses the aerodynamic lift force created by the spinning to help keep the two surfaces a mere 20 nanometers apart .
Air bearings are used to create magnetic tapes and disk drives , but this is the first application for a plasmonic lens .
With this innovative setup , the engineers demonstrated scanning speeds of 4 to 12 meters per second .
" The speed and distances we 're talking about here are equivalent to a Boeing 747 flying 2 millimeters above the ground , " added Zhang .
" Moreover , this distance is kept constant , even when the surface is not perfectly flat . "
The researchers pointed out that a typical photolithography tool used for chip manufacturing costs $ 20 million , and a set of lithography masks can run $ 1 million .
One of the reasons for the great expense is the use of shorter light wavelengths to create higher resolution circuitry .
Shorter wavelengths require nontraditional and costly mirrors and lenses .
The system described by the UC Berkeley engineers uses surface plasmons that have much shorter wavelengths than light , yet are excitable by typical ultraviolet light sources with much longer wavelengths .
The researchers estimate that a lithography tool based upon their design could be developed at a small fraction of the cost of current lithography tools .
Other alternatives have been developed that can achieve higher resolution than conventional photolithography and without the need for a lithography mask .
However , those techniques - electron beam lithography , scanning probe lithography and focused ion-beam lithography - work at a snail 's pace compared to the flying plasmonic lens system , said the UC Berkeley researchers .
Zhang noted that the flying head design is not limited to plasmonic lenses .
His lab has been developing metamaterials - composite materials capable of bending electromagnetic waves in extraordinary ways - into lenses that can be used for nano - optic imaging and other applications .
" I expect in three to five years we could see industrial implementation of this technology , " said Zhang .
" This could be used in microelectronics manufacturing or for optical data storage and provide resolution that is 10 to 20 times higher than current blu - ray technology . "
The other co-lead authors of the study are Werayut Srituravanich , a former Ph.D. student in Zhang 's lab and currently a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand , and Yuan Wang , a UC Berkeley graduate student in mechanical engineering .
The study was also co-authored by Cheng Sun , a former graduate student in Zhang 's lab and currently an assistant professor in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University .

I ’m not entirely sure why this series from Canadian photographer Fred Muram fascinates me so much .
Maybe it ’s because kissing a ceiling is n’t something most us will ever do , yet it ’s really not that difficult once you set your mind to it .
It ’s not a matter of “ how ” as much as a matter of “ why ? ”
And there is n’t really a “ why ” , which is both exciting and frustrating .
I also like how it ’s focus is on the study of how unusual it is to see the human body interacting with space this way ; despite the implied romance of “ kissing ” something , we ca n’t see the people ’s faces and so we ’re not sure if they ’re enjoying this or if it ’s simply just happening .

Both of Apple 's new MacBooks , the Pro and the regular , will support up to 6GB RAM , up from 4 in the previous versions .
6GB is an odd number for RAM , and you 'll have to buy it in an odd configuration – one 2 GB stick and one 4GB stick .
Ramjet , the memory and storage supplier , is selling these configurations on its site .
A 4BG stick right now costs $ 600 , and a 2GB is $ 75 |( these will obviously fluctuate as do all RAM prices ) .
These sticks are DDR3 - 1066 SO - DIMM memory .
We 're not sure , however , that this will make much difference to the speed of the MacBook .
Apple has recommended for a long time that all RAM be installed in matched pairs , so 6GB should ideally be supplied as two 3GB modules ( which is n't possible ) .
Reports over the last few years have said that non-matched pairs do n't increase the performance of the machines .
As a faster computer is the whole point of installing extra RAM , we 'll be holding off until we see some benchmark tests .
And hopefully , that will coincide with my savings hitting the right level to buy a new MBP .

It looks like 20th Century Fox is willing to bet that “ greed is indeed good , ” said Borys Kit in The Hollywood Reporter online .
“ With the nation keeping an eye on the see - sawing stock market , ” Fox is “ pushing anew ” its Wall Street sequel , Money Never Sleeps .
Michael Douglas might even reprise his role as Gordon Gekko , but wo n’t commit until he ’s read the finished script .
That ’s definitely going to be “ a tricky script to write , ” said Roger Moore in the Orlando Sentinel online .
Wall Street came out in 1987 , and Gekko is " supposed to have been in prison . "
But for “ 20 - plus years ” ?
Wealthy people “ do n’t do that kind of time — not in America ! ”
This is either “ the perfect time to do another Wall Street movie , ” said Katey Rich in Cinema Blend , “ or exactly the wrong one . ”
While some people may be “ fascinated with the inner workings of that industry that screwed us all over , ” others would prefer “ they all crawl away and die — I 'm kind of feeling the latter . ”
Well , there are certainly “ enough villainous roles for Gekko to fill , ” said Xan Brooks in the Guardian online , “ maybe even more than there were 20 years ago . ”

Dear Cecil :
In the answer about the guillotine in your online archive , you say that " the fatal blow induces immediate unconsciousness . "
In actuality , the human head does remain conscious fifteen to twenty seconds after decapitation .
This was proven when a scientist condemned to the guillotine in the 1700s told his assistant to watch and that he would blink as many times as he could .
The assistant counted fifteen to twenty blinks after the head was severed , the blinks coming at intervals of about one second .
So the head does remain briefly alive .
Joel Brusk , via AOL
Cecil replies :
Let ’s see .
Over the years we ’ve covered crucifixion , kidney theft , and now a second helping of decapitation .
What next , you ask — how to perform your own spinal tap ?
But bear with me .
New facts have come to light .
A lot of people disputed my claim that victims of the guillotine blacked out immediately .
Many had seen a TV show on the Discovery Channel called “ The Guillotine ” in which a medical expert tells the story above , with the added detail that the scientist was the pioneering French chemist Antoine Lavoisier , who was beheaded during the Reign of Terror in 1794 .
Not likely .
There ’s no mention of the blinking incident in the standard biographies of Lavoisier .
When I contacted the expert quoted on the TV show , neurosurgeon Robert Fink , he said he ’d heard the story from a colleague .
The colleague said he ’d read it in a book , but could n’t remember which .
He admitted the story may be apocryphal .
But let ’s return to the original question , appalling though it may be :
Is a severed head aware of its fate ?
People have been debating the point since the invention of the guillotine , and not just out of morbid curiosity .
Some felt the guillotine , far from being quick and painless , was an instrument of the most profound and horrible torture : to be aware of having been beheaded .
Numerous anecdotes and bizarre experiments have been adduced as evidence on either side .
After Charlotte Corday was guillotined for murdering Jean - Paul Marat , the executioner slapped her cheek while holding her severed head aloft .
Witnesses claimed the cheeks reddened ( without blood ? ) and the face looked indignant .
According to another tale , when the heads of two rivals in the National Assembly were placed in a sack following execution , one bit the other so badly the two could n’t be separated .
It does n’t get any better .
In one early series of experiments , an anatomist claimed that decapitated heads reacted to stimuli , with one victim turning his eyes toward a speaker 15 minutes after having been beheaded .
( Today we know brain death would have occurred long before . )
In 1836 the murderer Lacenaire agreed to wink after execution .
He did n’t .
Attempts to elicit a reaction from the head of the murderer Prunier in 1879 were also fruitless .
The following year a doctor pumped blood from a living dog into the head of the murderer and rapist Menesclou three hours after execution .
The lips trembled , the eyelids twitched , and the head seemed about to speak , although no words emerged .
In 1905 another doctor claimed that when he called the name of the murderer Languille just after decapitation , the head opened its eyes and focused on him .
Is it possible ?
The aforementioned Dr. Fink believed the brain might remain conscious as long as 15 seconds ; that ’s how long cardiac arrest victims last before blacking out .
( Dr. Fink ’s colleague put the window of awareness at 5 seconds . )
He also pointed out that people have remained alert after having had their spinal cords severed .
Still , this did n’t seem like the sort of question that could ever be resolved .
Then I received a note from a U.S. Army veteran who had been stationed in Korea .
In June 1989 the taxi he and a friend were riding in collided with a truck .
My correspondent was pinned in the wreckage .
The friend was decapitated .
Here ’s what happened :
My friend ’s head came to rest face up , and ( from my angle ) upside - down .
As I watched , his mouth opened and closed no less than two times .
The facial expressions he displayed were first of shock or confusion , followed by terror or grief .
I cannot exaggerate and say that he was looking all around , but he did display ocular movement in that his eyes moved from me , to his body , and back to me .
He had direct eye contact with me when his eyes took on a hazy , absent expression … and he was dead .
I ’ve spoken with the author and am satisfied the event occurred as described .
One can of course never be certain that anyone in this predicament is aware of his surroundings and realizes ( briefly ) what has happened to him .
But I concede the possibility that he might .

The standard model of physics got it right when it predicted where the mass of ordinary matter comes from , according to a massive new computational effort .
Particle physics explains that the bulk of atoms is made up of protons and neutrons , which are themselves composed of
smaller particles known as quarks , which in turn are bound by gluons .
The odd thing is this : the mass of gluons is zero and the mass of quarks [ accounts for ] only five percent .
Where , therefore , is the missing 95 percent ? [ AFP ]
The answer , according to theory , is that the energy from the interactions between quarks and gluons accounts for the excess mass ( because as Einstein 's famous E=mc² equation proved , energy and mass are equivalent ) .
Gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that binds three quarks together to form one proton or neutron ; these gluons are constantly
popping into existence and disappearing again .
The energy of these vacuum fluctuations has to be included in the total mass of the proton and neutron [ New Scientist ] .
The new study finally crunched the numbers on how much energy is created in these fluctuations and confirmed the theory , but it took a supercomputer over a year to do so .
The theory that describes the interactions of quarks and gluons is
known as quantum chromodynamics , or QCD .
These exchanges bind quarks together by changing a quark property known as color charge .
This charge is similar to electric charge but comes in three different types , whimsically referred to as red , green and blue .
Six different types of quarks interact with eight varieties of gluons to create a panoply of elementary particles [ Science News ] .
Calculating these interactions was a massive task , as researchers explain in an article in Science [ subscription required ] .
The team
used more than a year of time on the parallel computer network at Jülich , which can handle 200 teraflops - or 200 trillion arithmetical calculations per second [ New Scientist ] .
But what , you may be saying , of the Higgs boson ?
The Higgs is often mentioned as an elusive particle that endows other particles with mass , and the Large Hadron Collider will search for it when it starts up again next year .
But the Higgs is thought to explain only where the mass of the quarks themselves comes from .
The
new work confirms that the mass of the stuff around us is due only in very small part to the masses of quarks themselves .
Most of it comes from the way they interact [ Nature News ] .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The dollar soared against the euro and the British pound Wednesday , pressured by further fund repatriation and expectations the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will move to aggressively cut interest rates in coming months .
But the greenback slipped against the yen , which also gained on the pound and euro as another sell - off on Wall Street fanned risk aversion .
U.S. stocks ended sharply lower , with the Dow industrials down more than 500 points .
See Market Snapshot .
" Deleveraging and risk aversion have been the primary catalysts for the strength in the low yielders ( U.S. dollar and Japanese Yen ) , but currency bets gone wrong , repatriation and the fears of weak growth in Europe have also fueled the rally , " wrote Kathy Lien , director of currency research at GFT .
The yen , which has been the ultimate risk - aversion currency during recent financial turmoil , posted broad gains .
" Investors continue to flock to the dollar as speculation mounts that central banks elsewhere will continue with aggressive rate cuts in an attempt to stimulate growth in the near term , " said James Hughes , analyst at CMC Markets .
The euro dropped to its lowest level against the greenback in almost two years , breaking support at $ 1.2800 and plunging as far as $ 1.2743 .
" The meltdown in currency markets takes a life of its own , reflecting further deleveraging in equity and credit markets , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief FX strategist at CMC .
Weakness in both the euro and the pound , he said , was intensified by worries about emerging market currencies in Eastern Europe and remarks from Bank of England Gov. Mervyn King , who said the U.K. economy is in recession .
The euro recently trimmed losses to change hands at $ 1.2823 , still down sharply from $ 1.3046 in late North American trade Tuesday .
The euro also plunged against the Japanese unit to 124.58 Japanese yen , but had pared losses to 125.51 yen .
It was buying 130.73 yen late Tuesday .
The pound sterling recently traded at $ 1.6212 , down from $ 1.6694 late Tuesday .
Earlier , it fell to a five - year low of $ 1.6135 .
The pound plunged against the Japanese currency to 157.84 .
It was last buying 158.81 , down 5 % from Tuesday .
The dollar fell to 98.04 yen from 100.38 yen late Tuesday .
Earlier Wednesday , the dollar fell as low as 97.22 , its lowest level since March .
The dollar index DXY , +0.13 % , a measure of the greenback against a trade - weighted basket of six major currencies , traded at 85.602 , up from 84.434 late Tuesday .
Late Wednesday , the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its official cash rate by one percentage point , to 6.50 % , as widely expected .
Emerging worries
The sharp downward pressure on the euro comes even as signs point to further stabilization of the financial sector .
Instead , the focus has turned to prospects for a deep recession , pressuring the euro even though the United States and the Federal Reserve must also wrestle with a steep downturn , traders said .
" The same old reasoning still applies : The U.S. is regarded as being able to weather a recession much better than the euro zone , " wrote strategists at Commerzbank .
Also , the European Central Bank has further to go in cutting interest rates than the Fed , which has already delivered the bulk of its interest - rate cuts in this cycle , they said .
" The euro is also being undermined by worries about the economies of emerging Europe , " said Julian Jessop , chief international economist at Capital Economics .
Hungary 's central bank on Wednesday raised its key lending rate by 3 full percentage points to 11.5 % in an emergency move to defend the nation 's forint currency .
Read more .
The forint strengthened about 1.5 % on the move , but the rebound was n't impressive given the size of the rate hike , said Lars Christensen , chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen .
He also noted the move did little to support other central European emerging currencies such as the Polish zloty and the Romanian leu .
Other countries in the region may follow suit in an effort to defend their currencies , " but we would stress that rate hikes not only have a negative impact on growth , but also on the funding costs for banks in the region , which is of course a serious problem in the present situation with a credit crunch , " Christensen said in a research note .
' R ' word in the U.K .
Sterling , meanwhile , fell under heavy pressure late Tuesday after Bank of England 's King warned that the British economy had entered a recession .
Minutes released Wednesday from the emergency meeting of Bank of England policy makers on Oct. 8 underlined expectations for further , aggressive cuts , economists said .
The minutes showed the nine - member Monetary Policy Committee unanimously backed the decision to join other major central banks in cutting key interest rates .
The central bank slashed the bank rate by a half of a percentage point on Oct. 8 to 4.5 % .
See full story .
Following the minutes and King 's remarks , there is " very little doubt that the easing cycle will be front - loaded and the repo rate will likely be cut to 3 % " by the end of the first quarter of 2009 , said Chiara Corsa , economist at UniCredit MIB .
" We expect the next 50 basis point rate cut in November . "
Also , the pound was left particularly vulnerable by the U.K. banking sector 's reliance on external capital flows to finance lending , said Naeem Wahid , currency strategist at HBOS .
" These external flows have now fallen sharply [ and ] unless they are replaced by other forms of external finance the adjustments in the trade deficit and the exchange rate will need to be faster than would otherwise have occurred , implying a rise in domestic saving and weakness in domestic spending in the short - run , " Wahid said .
G7 volatility watch ?
Volatile currency action could attract attention from Group of Seven policy makers , one strategist warned .
" Although we would not argue that the major currency pairs are substantially out of line at present ... an argument can certainly be made that the G7 members would prefer to see a sharp decline in the levels of volatility seen in the currency markets , " said Simon Derrick , currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon , in a research note .
The recent instability in currency markets could further unsettle other asset markets , Derrick said , noting sharp overnight losses in Asian equity markets .
OK group ... let 's see a show of hands ...

Good , Good .... yeah , that 's a majority all right .
Thanks for taking your hand out of the Cheeto 's bag long enough to be inconvenienced .

Oops ... Well , that was expected as well .
Now you know what it 's like to be a Ron Paul Supporter .
So ... one more question then we 'll wrap this up .
How many of you feel comfortable that Linux has a firm hold on the penguin as an unofficial trademark of Linux ?
My goodness .
There is a veritable sea of hands in the air .
That 's a good thing .
Well , at least we agree on something .
Now let me show you how a consensus of opinion is as reliable as an unbooted Windows server .
Not to mention those that hold said opinion .
Many of you in the first group I queried can take pride in this .
Congratulations to everyone who made this possible .
Excuse the poor photograph .
This billboard picture was taken on IH 35 in Austin from the upper deck in a car doing 70 mph .
Stopping on the upper deck for any reason is almost certain catastrophe .
It 's good enough however to make the point .
Microsoft has now successfully claimed the penguin as their " symbol " .
Yep , I see it coming ... " What 's the big deal helios ?
So they use a flock of penguins to advertise . "
If those words come out of your mouth , I would make certain they were n't heard too loudly .
Ask yourself this .
Why penguins ?
How many tens of thousands of other animals could they have chosen ?
Why penguins ?
It 's obvious if you just spend a few minutes thinking about it .
These billboards are going up all over the United States .
I 've called Microsoft numerous times Friday to get a statement but they 've yet to respond .
By the way , the rest of the text from that sign reads " Life Without Walls " .
That is funny in itself .
Microsoft trying to equate itself with freedom .
They better hope people continue to ignore their EULA .
So ... let 's keep on handing out cd's , holding our Lindependence events , flooding You Tube with Cube videos ad nauseum and anything else we can think of that reaches hundreds of people in a months time .
Microsoft is reaching millions a day .
And their doing it with your penguin .
Guerrilla marketing ... now that 's effective .
Instead of getting the community organized into some sort of legitimate promotional entity , and Heaven knows we 've tried ... we 've screwed around and let Microsoft take the one thing we thought they could never touch .
Do n't forget ... Linus chose the penguin himself as our mascot / symbol .
Congratulations to all who made this possible .
All - Righty

September 1 , 2008 Loofah Day in honor of Bill O’Reilly Countdown to Loofah Day
Whereas millions of Americans despise Bill O’Reilly as a loathsome polluter of the airwaves , fanning ignorance and hatred with every word he utters ,
Whereas no opportunity should be missed to expose this contemptible scoundrel to ridicule ,
Whereas at 11.06 pm on September 1 , 2004 the above - mentioned O’Reilly made a lewd phone call to his Fox producer Andrea Mackris , depicting a prospective sexual encounter between the two of them in which “ You would basically be in the shower and then I would come in and I ’d join you and you would have your back to me and I would take the little loofa thing … and kinda ’ soap your back … and I would put it around front , kinda ’ rub your tummy with it and then with my other hand I would start to massage your boobs , get your nipples really hard … ‘ cuz I like that and you have really spectacular boobs … .
I ’d be rubbing your big boobs and getting your nipples really hard , kinda kissing your neck from behind … and then the other hand with the felafel thing ” ….
Whereas this conversation was recorded by Ms Mackriss and subsequently exposed to public scrutiny in court documents ,
Whereas this engendered mirth among the millions of O’Reilly haters and much satisfaction at his humiliation ,
Be it proclaimed that September 1 , 2008 will be recognized as Loofah Day and citizens should honor it by proceeding at noon to the nearest
Fox studio with a loofah and , standing outside the Fox studio , brandish said loofahs in mirthfull derision of O’Reilly .

Post - Election Depression : How to Cope
After Any Political Campaign , Depression Can Await the Defeated
It 's over .
Nov. 5 has come , and no matter whom you were rooting for , many political animals say the day after an election can bring on a special sort of blues .
The bored kind .
" It 's almost kind of a surreal feeling . [...]
When her father 's campaign ended during the Republican primaries , Huckabee said she felt more than a sense of loss .
" It felt like it did n't hit us until a couple of weeks later when we were like , ' Uh , what do we do now ? '
You do n't know how to have a normal life anymore , " [...]
" Getting back to the real world is probably one of the hardest things , " she said . [...]
Bill McConochie , the founder of Political Psychology Research , Inc . [...]
" What I do know from my research is there are two types of political animals , if you will , " McConochie said .
According to McConochie , how far a person falls on either end of a spectrum of " liberal " or " conservative " traits will determine how serious they will take a victory or defeat on Election Day :
The more extreme in views , the more important the election .
" Their reaction will simply depend on how strongly a person is invested in the election process , " said McConochie .

McCain was the worst possible candidate .
It remains to be seen as to whether or not he was our actual choice , since so many demonRATs crossed over to make sure he got the position on the ticket .
But he did n’t deserve to win .
The only thing he did RIGHT was to choose Palin - everything else was just being dumb .
He “ crossed ” the aisle so much , he did n’t know how to fight the dems .
He SHOULD have gone after Obama for every question we had about this new “ dear leader ” of ours .
McCain is as responsible for whatever damage this cretin does as those who voted for Obama .

SAN FRANCISCO  California officials will investigate accusations that the Mormon Church neglected to report a battery of nonmonetary contributions  including phone banks , a Web site and commercials  on behalf of a ballot measure to ban same - sex marriage .
Roman Porter , the executive director of the Fair Political Practices Commission , which oversees California campaign finance laws , signed off on the investigation after reviewing a sworn complaint filed on Nov. 13 .
The complaint , filed by Fred Karger , founder of the group Californians Against Hate , asserted that the church ’s reported contributions  about $ 5,000 , according to state election filings  vastly underestimated its actual efforts in passing Proposition 8 , which amended the state ’s Constitution to recognize only male - female marriage .
Broadly speaking , California state law requires disclosure of any money spent or services provided to influence the outcome of an election .

Here 's an important state political story we almost missed given all the sound and fury surrounding the climax of the 2008 presidential election race between Barack Obama and John McCain and their trusty sidekicks , Joe Biden and Sarah Palin .
For a brief change of pace we 're going to tell you about Massachusetts state senator Dianne Wilkerson .
She 's a Democrat who 's in some more legal trouble now because , it seems , an FBI sting operation caught her on videotape stuffing numerous $ 100 bills into her bra as alleged bribe payments during a meeting in a fancy Boston restaurant .
According to U.S. Atty .
Michael Sullivan and a 32 - page affidavit filed in federal court Tuesday , Wilkerson is charged with accepting $ 23,500 in eight different bribes over an 18 - month period in return for her legislative influence on behalf of a developer and bar owner , among others .
The embattled legislator has represented the Roxbury area since her first election in 1992 as the state 's only black state senator .
Wilkerson , who 's been supported by Gov. Deval Patrick , lost the Democratic primary but is seeking reelection through a sticker writein campaign next week .
Max Stern , Wilkerson 's attorney , maintains her innocence and accused federal authorities of trying to " character assassinate " her by bringing up past legal troubles , including a tax - cheating conviction and campaign finance violations .
The state bar has begun proceedings to disbar Wilkerson for perjury during state court testimony on behalf of a nephew convicted of murder .
And now back to your regularly - scheduled presidential campaign .

An urgent effort by the Bush administration to find a country willing to accept 17 detainees held at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , has stalled because of a bitter dispute inside the government about whether the men are dangerous .
The administration stepped up its search for a new home for the detainees , members of the Uighur Muslim minority in western China , after a federal judge ordered them to be released inside the United States a week ago .
But because of the dispute within the administration , an American ambassador canceled a trip for international negotiations about the fate of the 17 men that had been scheduled to begin Monday .
People briefed on the issue said that the State Department , which is charged with trying to resettle Guantánamo detainees by coaxing other countries to accept them , argued that the Justice Department compromised diplomatic efforts with a court filing Friday that asserted that the Uighurs should not be released inside the United States .
The filing described them as “ a danger to the public ” and as men who had been trained in insurrection .

The hits just keep coming , and the blood continues to course down Wall Street .
The S&P 500 has offered a terrifying ride over the past three weeks , the yield on three - month Treasury bills has dropped to almost zero , and even money market funds are having trouble maintaining value .
Where is an investor to turn ?
One of the most repeated quotes from this site 's favorite font of knowledge , Warren Buffett , says something about being greedy when everyone else is fearful .
I understand that typing this bit of advice is infinitely easier than actually putting money into a market that appears to be testing the bounds of terminal velocity , but Buffett seems to have done well , so let 's assume he has something to teach us .
Into the void
Taking Buffett 's advice , if we want to make the most money , we should be looking where people are most afraid .
Right now , that 's emerging markets .
Since the turn of the century and right up through last year , these markets have posted amazing returns .
Since last year 's all - time highs , however , Brazilian markets are down 51 % , Indian markets are down 50 % , and Russian and Chinese markets are down a whopping 70 % .
This seems like fertile ground for our greedy searching , but there has to be a reason for these plunges , right ?
Well , yes and no .
Loose credit sparked vigorous investment in these markets because they offer strong growth opportunities .
However , with lots of money chasing relatively few assets , prices climbed rapidly .
When prices climb rapidly , you attract speculators ( people chasing quick returns based on momentum ) , which pushes prices even higher .
Those readers who were paying attention to markets in the late 1990s might recognize this as the type of activity that created the dot - com bubble and , more recently , the real estate bubble .
Watch that first step ...
When the U.S. real estate bubble popped and subprime concerns tightened up credit markets , this speculative investing rapidly lost steam .
Then , banks that had bet big on securities backed by subprime mortgages found they held assets that were n't worth nearly what they had thought .
In order to shore up their balance sheets with cash , they were forced to sell off assets , often including foreign assets .
Now the situation is just the opposite of what I described above : lots of participants looking to rapidly sell assets that had previously been fetching artificially high prices .
The result has been the rapid drop of emerging markets .
But that does n't mean the fundamental reasons investors went overseas in the first place have changed .
The U.S. currently has the largest economy in the world , but our economy is mature and , at only 304 million people , we wo n't be driving the economic growth over the next 10 , 50 , or 100 years .
As long - term investors , we should be interested in companies serving the 1.3 billion Chinese , the 1.1 billion Indians , the 238 million Indonesians , the 196 million Brazilians , the ... well , you get the picture .
With these massive populations joining the global economy and gaining access to previously undreamed of wealth , billions will be spent on things like infrastructure and consumer goods .
That 's great news for companies like Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE : JNJ ) and General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) .
But the companies that will provide investors with the biggest wins will be the ones that are currently unknown on Wall Street -- companies like Brazilian food processor Sadia ( NYSE : SDA ) or Indonesian telecom Telkom Indonesia ( NYSE : TLK ) .
Tomorrow 's forecast is sunny
That 's not to say there are n't risks and challenges in emerging markets .
Rapid , strong economic development has resulted in high inflation in many markets , as well as an uneven distribution of new wealth , both of which can lead to political disruptions .
Emerging markets are also relatively unsophisticated , so regulations protecting shareholders are not nearly as robust as they are in more mature markets .
But these are near - term issues and will be worked out .
Even with the inherent risks , emerging economies offer unprecedented opportunities for far - seeing investors to capitalize on global growth .

And as for the stock market , you could buy Westpac shares yesterday at a snip under $ 17 offering a fully - franked yield of nearly 8.4 % which grosses up to about 10.9 % - and some people think it 's hard being an investor right now .
They would n't know Christmas if Santa smacked them in the face with reindeer dung .
In some ways the national psyche - and therefore consumer confidence and therefore consumer spending and therefore the economy - is suffering the after effects of a media and political conspiracy to have us believe things were crook in the lead - up to the last election .
Sooled on by battlers - champion tabloid media , the successful candidate said " let me tell you something , working families are doing it tough " , so many times , we came to believe him .
The reality is that " working families ' ' always do it tough on a relative basis .
A couple with a baby or two trying to get by on a single average income has never had it easy and never will .
For most , it 's a stage that 's worked through and survived into reasonably comfortable middle - class middle age .
The present generation of " working families ' ' though is spectacularly better off than its predecessors with more government assistance on tap and much more chance of being " working ' ' as opposed to unemployed .
It is a Gen X and Y thing that no one much under the age of 33 or 34 has been in the workforce when it was turning down - it's been that long since the business cycle actually turned in Australia .
And we have a whole generation of management that has never been in charge of anything more than their lunch money when things were genuinely tough .
Similarly the " housing affordability crisis ' ' grew legs and ran largely unchallenged when it was more a matter of a housing desirability crisis coinciding with the piercing of a speculative bubble pumped up by the usual cheer squad of real estate spruikers , urgers and industry associations .
The nadir of that particular cycle of self - pity was an SMH article about poor little rich kids finding it hard to live in Sydney 's most affluent suburbs :
" The situation is particularly dire for young people who have grown up in well - located suburbs .
Without the support of parents to help stump up a deposit , finding a home near family and friends can be difficult . ''
Oh , my heart bled for them .
There are plenty of reasons to be concerned about the international economy and certainly Australian growth is slowing and will slow .
But as Treasury Secretary Ken Henry told us again on Wednesday and Peter Hartcher reminds us today ( ) , there remain good reasons to be relatively optimistic about Australia 's outlook .
That can be a bit tricky though when we convinced ourselves life was hard during the very best of times .
The stock market seems to have already priced in a severe domestic recession .
The Westpac share price example indicates a fear that Australia 's most conservative bank might not be able to maintain its dividend - a fear that is at odds with the bank 's guidance .
But with examples like that around , anything less than a severe recession means there 's plenty of upside down the track for investors who can stomach the volatility .
Let me tell you something , we can all do with that dose of Harden Up .

The Bush administration ’s time is draining away .
President George W. Bush apparently believes that history will vindicate his policies , but a positive legacy is not likely to be .
On the domestic side his record is a horrid mishmash of wild spending , massive corporate bailouts , civil liberties violations , and executive aggrandizement .
On foreign policy the president ’s program comes down to Iraq , Iraq , and a few other minor issues .
Alas , the administration ’s case for invading Iraq was entirely wrong .
Saddam Hussein did n’t possess weapons of mass destruction , had no connection to 9/11 , and , like even worse dictators before him , such as Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong , was contained and deterred by American military might .
The humanitarian argument for the war dissolved amid horrific sectarian violence .
Yet President Bush refused to admit error or doubt about his tottering occupation policy even as Iraqi civil society collapsed .
Through it all he sought to fashion a permanent , or “ enduring , ” occupation that would allow the US to maintain scores of bases  58 according to leading Shia lawmakers  for use to intervene militarily throughout the region .
His objective was shared by the Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , who advocated an occupation running 100 or 1000 years .
Although President Bush hoped to commit the US to a permanent occupation , preventing future administrations from disengaging from Iraq , the Iraqis decided differently .
While the Maliki government remains reliant on Washington ’s military support , even more importantly it remains reliant on Iraqi popular support , and the vast majority of Iraqis want US forces to go .
The Bush administration ’s attempt to pressure Baghdad into accepting the lengthy presence of military personnel and civilian contractors immune from Iraqi law backfired , as Iraqis rallied against Washington .
After months of bargaining , the two governments negotiated a Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) to replace the current UN mandate , which expires December 31 .
But even after a draft accord was reached , rising popular opposition convinced Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki that pushing ahead was , he reportedly said , “ political suicide . ”
Maliki told a fellow Shia politician that “ We do n’t call it a security pact but an agreement to withdraw the troops and organize their activities during the period of their presence in Iraq . ”
America ’s October raid into Syria further raised Iraqi popular concerns with an extended US military presence .
Last month the Iraqi government demanded more than 100 amendments to the draft SOFA , including making more certain America ’s departure date of December 31 , 2011 and further limiting the immunity of US military personnel and civilian contractors under Iraqi law .
With provincial elections scheduled for January , the timing is particularly sensitive for Baghdad : Prime Minister Maliki does n’t want to appear to be bowing to Washington .
Although Washington has agreed to further concessions , the pact faces an uncertain future .
With major Islamic holidays coming in December , which will further slow Iraqi decision - making , the two governments might not reach final agreement before the UN mandate expires .
One option would be to extend UN authority , but Russia and China could demand concessions before approving any Security Council deal .
Washington and Baghdad could forge an interim accord , but that might prove little easier than negotiating the SOFA .
Without any legal authority for US forces to act , Washington has threatened to halt all operations ( to “ basically stop doing anything , ” in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates ) when the UN mandate expires .
The dispute creates another mess for the incoming Obama administration to clean up .
The right policy is an expeditious exit .
Uncle Sam should not pass “ go ” or collect $ 100 first .
Rather , Washington should begin a rapid drawdown of its forces and equally speedy closure of American bases .
At the same time , the US should urge Iraq ’s neighbors to meet and develop regional arrangements to promote Iraqi stability  which might win Iraqi and Syrian acceptance in the absence of a continuing ( and to them threatening ) American military presence .
It does n’t matter if the Maliki government secretly would like , contra the Iraqi population ’s view , to keep its foreign guardians around a little longer for regime protection .
The question is America ’s interest , and America ’s interest is to get out of Iraq .
However , it is n’t clear what the president - elect intends .
Sen . Barack Obama ’s insistence on an Iraqi withdrawal waned as the campaign advanced and Iraq fell out of the news .
He once proposed a 16 - month withdrawal , but his Iraq working group coordinator , Colin Kahl , wants US support to “ hinge on continued progress toward political accommodation . ”
That is , Washington should continue attempting to micromanage Iraqi affairs , setting benchmarks , lobbying for different policies , meddling in Iraqi politics .
It ’s a policy that has had only indifferent success in the past and is n’t likely to become more effective if Baghdad senses that Washington officials really want to stick around .
For instance , Richard Danzig , a former Navy secretary who advised candidate Obama on defense matters , has talked about keeping up to 55,000 ( out of the current 146,000 ) US troops in Iraq in various advisory capacities .
That ’s the equivalent of a permanent occupation in disguise .
Former Pentagon official Larry Korb , now with the Center for American Progress , instead contends that “ Unless we set a firm withdrawal date and make it clear that our open - ended support has a deadline , the Iraqis are n’t going to get serious about what they need to do . ”
He ’s almost certainly right .
But the fact that only withdrawal gives the US leverage is n’t the most important point .
The US should n’t be worrying about having leverage over Iraq  getting Baghdad to pay more of the occupation bills , protesting Iran ’s role in the country , pestering the Maliki government about its relations with other governments , or much else .
Washington has defenestrated Saddam Hussein and armed the successor government .
Now the US government should leave Iraq and allow Baghdad to decide its own policies .
Whether Iraq ’s future is increased stability or civil war is impossible to know and is not under Washington ’s control .
Iraq ’s relative quiescence today is due less to the US troop “ surge ” and improved anti-insurgency tactics than domestic Iraqi factors .
Particularly important is the turn of the Sunni militias against al - Qaeda , shift of Muqtada al - Sadr and his militia away from violent resistance towards political activism , and nearly complete ethnic cleansing of mixed Baghdad neighborhoods  which left fewer religious minorities vulnerable to attack by sectarian militias .
However , millions of Iraqis remain refugees and there still is disturbing violence 
Christians recently were targeted in the city of Mosul , for instance .
Iraq ’s relative quiet may be transitory .
Washington ’s arming and financing of the so - called “ Awakening Councils ” could prove to be the transition to more intense sectarian strife rather than a gateway to permanent peace .
Baghdad ’s relationship with the councils is difficult at best and any attempt by the central government to extend its sway over them could spark violent resistance .
Moreover , Sadr ’s commitment to the political process may prove transitory if his party falters in upcoming elections .
Iraq ’s ruling council is fractious and unstable , and Sadr may not be the only ambitious religious and political leader frustrated by electoral outcomes and tempted to look elsewhere to assert himself .
“ From now on , violence will follow the politics , ” one Western diplomat warned the Scotsman .
No wonder that CENTCOM head Gen. David Petraeus declares Iraq ’s gains to be “ fragile and reversible . ”
Washington policymakers should hope for the best for Iraq , but must have no illusions about the likely outcome .
In any case , America ’s role is finished .
The Maliki government has sufficient military force to defend itself ; the one certain outcome of any future hostilities is that al - Qaeda will lose , since even Sunnis hostile to the US and the Shia - dominated central government have turned on the terrorist organization .
What the Maliki regime desperately needs is legitimacy , but that Washington cannot provide .
Indeed , being forced to play the tool of America makes it harder for any Iraqi government to win the respect of its own people , as well as of neighboring states .
This is why negotiations over a continued US troop presence have proved to be so contentious .
Finally , Washington ’s disengagement will prove to be the most effective push to Iraqi politicians to make the hard compromises necessary for Iraq to create and maintain some sort of peaceful political order .
However , the most important reason to get out is because it is in America ’s interest to do so .
Thankfully the human toll for both the US and Iraq has fallen sharply over the last year , but the financial bill continues to accumulate .
Some $ 600 billion already has been wasted on Bush ’s folly , and the war continues to cost about $ 145 billion a year .
The Congressional Budget Office figures the ultimate price tag will hit $ 2 trillion .
Economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes warn the cost could go substantially higher , perhaps to $ 3 trillion .
The sooner the US gets out , the sooner Washington ’s Iraq current bill starts shrinking .
In an attempt to complete the negotiations  made more difficult by the fact that the Maliki government , in contrast to the Bush administration , is committed to winning legislative approval for the troop accord  the administration yielded on some of Baghdad ’s demands for revisions .
But the agreement retains a continued US presence until 2011 with the possibility of a longer stay , especially for troops to train and support Iraqi forces .
President - elect Obama should announce that agreement or no agreement , the US military will be coming home from Iraq in 2009 .
He also should pledge to present any SOFA , whether reached by his predecessor or his own administration , to Congress for approval .
The war was tragic and unnecessary .
America ’s professed security objectives  ensuring that Iraq is free of WMDs and terrorists operating against the US  were accomplished even before the invasion .
Having eliminated the Hussein regime , Washington should leave Iraq ’s continuing transformation up to the Iraqi people .
An enduring occupation , which presumes future US military intervention in the region , is in neither country ’s interest .
The recent election was about change .
And who , other than the bedraggled neoconservative refugees from the Bush administration , doubt that Washington ’s Iraq policy needs to change ?
The US troops need to come home .
Quickly .
And completely .

A question often asked is how much does it cost to light the holiday display - the electrical meter does spin a bit faster .
That 's easy to calculate - with all 11,300 lights ON , the current draw is 35.7 amps .
Multiply by 120 Volts and divide by 1,000 to get 4.2 KiloWatts .
The electricity cost in Colorado is about 10 cents per KiloWatt - Hour , so to run the display continuously for an hour , it costs 42 cents / hour - not much !... so divide that by two and then multiply by the 4 hours / day it 's active , and the electricty costs 84 cents per day .
Multiply that by 31 days and for $ 26 , a whole month of holiday fun is provided to people around the world ... plus some awareness and thousands of dollars in donations for Celiac Disease Research !

WASHINGTON — Private contractors account for more than one - quarter of the core workforce at U.S. intelligence agencies , according to newly released government figures that underscore how much of the nation ’s spying work has been outsourced since the Sept. 11 attacks .
The CIA and other spy agencies employ about 36,000 contractors in espionage - related jobs , in addition to approximately 100,000 full - time government workers , said Ronald Sanders , head of personnel for the U.S. intelligence community .
Contractors carry out missions including collecting intelligence in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as operating classified computer networks for the 16 spy agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community .
Sanders said the number of contractors remained steady over the last year , after surging in the years following the Sept. 11 attacks .
“ As you may know , we ’ve been hiring a great deal since Sept. 11 , 2001 , ” Sanders said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday , discussing the results of a survey .
The growing reliance on contractors has been a source of controversy for the spy agencies , in part because of concerns that temporary employees might not be as trustworthy as career workers in handling some of the most sensitive national security work .

Remember that thing Google put together a comic book about ?
Chrome is its name , and Web browsing and AJAX crunching is its game .
Well , just recently the latest beta builds are said to have basic Greasemonkey support .
With emphasis on basic .
According to Martin at gHacks , the fact that Google does n’t yet support an extension system within Chrome means that there are some pretty significant ifs and buts about what ’s possible and what ’s not with the addition of Greasemonkey .
Script loading and a metadata issues are purported to be conflict prone .
As Martin writes , “ Only scripts in c:\scripts are loaded and only if the user adds the parameter ‘ –enable - greasemonkey ’ by appending it to the program ’s shortcut . ”
He goes on to explain that , “ The scripts are not limited to a domain but will work on all domains which is usually handled by the @include metadata .
The metadata part is ignored which could be problematic .... ”
The reason for Greasemonkey ’s emergence in Chrome , however stifled , is because the software ’s creator , Aaron Boodman , is a Google employee , as Google Operating System ’s Alex Chitu describes .
If you ’re looking to give the latest Greasemonkey - enhanced Chrome build , you can venture over to the Chromium BuildBot website .
You ’re able to download the most recent development , but keep in mind that stability is not guaranteed .
MEEKER —
It ’s 6:20 p.m. and Democratic Senate candidate Mark Udall is working a campaign event in this Western Slope town , where the joke is that there are n’t enough Democrats in town to fill a small Volkswagen .
It is not the warmest of rooms .
One questioner challenges Udall to explain why he got an “ F ” rating from the National Rifle Association .
When Udall tells the crowd that this election is n’t about turning Colorado “ blue , ” but “ red , white and blue , ” a man from the back shouts , “ you mean red , white , blue and black ” — visibly startling Udall with an apparent reference to the party ’s presidential candidate .
But there are also openings for the Democrat , among them Cheri Robinson .
As Udall shakes her hand , the lifelong Republican complains about the thousands of gas - field vehicles that pass her ranch daily , damaging roads , tossing garbage and “ making it almost impossible for my sheep ranch to continue . ”
“ We should tap these resources — but we need to do it smartly , ” Udall reassured her , repeating a version of the message that he has been hammering on the Western Slope for months now .
In a marathon bus tour last week , the five - term congressman from Boulder County was furiously crisscrossing a landscape where he ought to be at a distinct disadvantage .
In the 22 counties west of the Continental Divide , Republicans have about 135,000 registered voters to the Democratic Party ’s 95,000 .
But in a sign of how much Colorado ’s political landscape is changing , several polls show Udall now leading on the Western Slope by a slim margin .
As he goes from mountain resort towns full of fleece - wearing progressives to counties dominated by gun enthusiasts and oil and gas workers , the tour shows the highs and lows of a changing political landscape .
In Montrose , Democrats listening to Udall give a speech on a lawn were met with yells of “ terrorism supporters ” from passengers in a pickup that circled the block three times to ensure the message got through .
But then there is Jill Potter , an 82 - year - old Republican and former treasurer in overwhelmingly Republican Jackson County , who had just cast her ballot for Barack Obama in early voting .
“ It ’s the economy , ” said Potter , crediting the recent endorsement of Obama by Colin Powell with helping her to make up her mind .
“ People are really hurting . ”
Region transforming
While Ken Salazar did well here in his Senate race four years ago , shrinking the vast margins that Republican candidates traditionally have garnered in western Colorado , he did n’t win the region outright .
If a congressman from one of the state ’s most liberal districts captures an area that should be among the Republicans ’ easiest to win , analysts say it will mark a sea change .
Democrats are practically giddy at the idea .
In places like Craig , Grand Junction , and Ouray , Udall spun out the well - worn themes of a campaign that has purposely been pitched to the kind of moderate conservative voters that have moved into this region over the last decade .
He talked of reining in spending , investing in renewable energy , and — in a riff on a theme by Western writer Wallace Stegner — “ building communities to match our scenery . ”
John Salazar , the Democrat who represents western Colorado in Congress and traveled with Udall most of the week , cheerily told crowds how when he first ran , Democrats would come up to him on the street and express their support in embarrassed whispers .
Four years later , that political environment has been transformed , Salazar said .
“ I have never in my entire life seen such energy in western Colorado , ” he told a crowd in Ridgway .
But just as often , the crowds have been packed with conservative Democrats skeptical of trademark policies .
In Silverton , Steve Kral told Udall that he had voted for him already , then quickly launched into a critique of Obama ’s progressive tax plan .
But there is also little doubt that Udall has managed to make inroads — partly by spending a significant chunk of campaign time here ; partly by following a carefully crafted strategy that aims to peel off pieces of a Republican coalition fractured by the area ’s rapid energy development .
“ The Democrats said , ‘ We are going to align ourselves with sportsmen , with hunters and anglers — and the business community out here , ’ ” Udall said as he sat in the back of the bus as it wound along mountain roads between events .
“ People out here know that one of the biggest business bumps comes in the summer with recreation , and in the fall with all these hunters that come to the area . ”
“ We want to look after those interests as well , ” he said .

The Obamas are officially adopting a dog , America 's dog lovers can rest assured .
Michelle Obama told Entertainment Tonight recently that the family would adopt a rescue dog after the election was over .
Michelle and her Democratic presidential candidate husband , Barack , made the promise to their two pre-teen daughters ( Malia and Sasha ) .
The couple told the girls ( and the press ) that their campaign lifestyle would n't allow the family to properly train and care for a dog until after Nov. 4 .
The announcement comes after summerlong campaigns to persuade the family not to get a goldendoodle , which the Obamas considered because the breed is hypoallergenic .
The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals sent a letter to the Obamas saying getting a purebred would be elitist and a petition by the Best Friends Animal Society garnered over 50,000 signatures to persuade the Obamas to adopt a dog instead of having one bred or buying one .
PETA has already responded to the potential first lady 's announcement on their blog :
So you can see why we 're quite proud of this whole thing and thank everyone who weighed in .
We hope that the Obama family really listened to our message , and we hope that Barack , Michelle , and their daughters find a loving mutt who needs a good home .
Now , with the campaign in its final few weeks , might this help the Democratic nominee with the animal set , especially since his Republican rival John McCain beat Obama in a polls of pet owners ?
In related news , there was the recent endorsement by the Humane Society Legislative Fund of the Obama - Biden ticket .
Either way , though , looks like the White House will have a dog in the next administration .

At a very basic level , John McCain ’s effort to dodge the responsibilities to veterans he has as a U.S. Senator are disrespectful .
As a veteran himself — and his subsequent efforts to deny that he has not fulfilled his commitments — his actions are dishonorable .
But this is not the first time John McCain has been judged to be inadequate by his peers .
If you remember , a vet not long ago questioned him about his lack of commitment to veterans issues , and John McCain could n’t give a straight answer .
In their annual Congressional Report card , Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America has done just that .
They give John McCain a “ D ” in his commitment to our troops .
( Obama and Biden , FWIW , each get “ B ” s. )
I meet vets on a pretty regular basis who tell me they ’re skittish about going after McCain on his failure to support our troops .
Most vets do n’t like complaining about these things because they ’re not the types to ask for handouts .
They are not the people who ask things from their country .
So here ’s what I tell them :
What John McCain has done for you — or in this case has n’t done for you — tells Americans what kind of treatment they can expect from him .
If you want to help other Americans in making a decision about this election , then just be honest about him , and let them judge for themselves .
Now , I know John McCain was a POW .
He and Sarah Palin tell me all the time .
For that , we ’ve all given him well deserved admiration .
It may seem like political posturing , but it ’s not .
I do respect him for this , and ca n’t begin to comprehend how that shaped him as a person .
But then he and Sarah tell me they do n’t use this political gain and that he never mentions it .
The pictures , the stories about the Green Bay Packers ( or Steelers if he ’s in Pittsburgh ) , the book his daughter wrote , the book HE wrote , the drinking games played across America when “ POW ” is said … all of that has nothing to do with politics ?
Sorry .
I do n’t believe it .
It is for political gain .
But hey …he ’s entitled to that .
It ’s his story .
But it ’s also part of his story that he has n’t put his money where his mouth is .
He has been more committed to his service than he has to the service of Americans who put on a uniform because they admired guys like him .
John McCain tells these stories about himself because he wants us to think he cares about the troops and understands them .
He wants Americans to see him as an extraordinary hero who ’s never stopped giving .
When I look at his treatment of vets over the years , however , I see something completely different : Hubris and Indifference .
It ’s not that I think John McCain does n’t think vets from these wars deserve the same care and thanks from their country that other vets were given .
It ’s that it ’s not important to him to stand up and tell America that .
It ’s not important for him to be responsible to the men and women in uniform who believed that having a POW in Congress would help make sure they took care of their own .
Instead — as with the case of the GI Bill vote this year — it ’s more important to him to be at a fundraiser and on the Ellen show .
His politics are more important than his honor to service .
Furthermore , John McCain gets mad when people suggest that his record is less than stellar .
HE thinks that he ’s done enough .
What kind of message does that send to men and women who are just now coming home ?
Is n’t “ I ’ve done my part ” the opposite of what John McCain wants us to know about him ?
So when he says he cares about the middle class , when he says he cares about people losing homes and jobs , can you really trust him ?
This is the same guy who does n’t show up to care about his friends .
This is a guy who counts on the support of people who were like him 20 years ago , but whom he ’s forgotten today .
I ’m not a vet , but am a proud brat and a friend … one who sometimes says things on behalf of others who are too proud to say it for themselves .
I ’ve learned one thing …forgetting , and not being there when you ’ve got the opportunity to serve your brothers in arms , is the greatest of wrongs to those who ’ve served .
Since serving in Vietnam , John McCain has enjoyed a privilege few other vets do : he has a chance to take care of those who still need him as a US Senator .
And when it ’s come down to it , he does n’t even bother to show up .
What ’s the guy gonna do about people he does n’t care about ?
How will they matter ?
I mean , if this is how you treat your friends …
Geographic isolation is a driving force in evolution .
If there ’s a mountain , a body of water or other physical barrier between two populations of a species , then chances are good they ’ll diverge over time .
But members of a species can become isolated from each other in other , nonphysical ways  through the way they sense the world , for instance .
Evidence for this kind of speciation has been incomplete , however .
Image Color perception in cichlid fish like the Pundamilia pundamilia is evidence of speciation , a report finds .

Now , Ole Seehausen of the University of Bern and the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science and Technology and colleagues report strong ecological , genetic and molecular evidence for speciation among cichlid fish in Lake Victoria in Africa , based on how they perceive color .
In two related species the females choose mates based on their coloration .
In one , found in deeper parts of the lake , the males have red features .
In the other , found in shallower waters , the males are blue .
What ’s more , in some parts of the lake the two are n’t really separate species , but rather are intermixed .
This global move is an encouraging sign that governments around the world appreciate the seriousness of this problem .
There is no magic wand or miracle cure to the problems that we have but sitting around and waiting for more failures without action is definitely wrong .
Nothing is going to stop the market declines but this may be a starting point for getting money flowing again .
Central banks around the world Wednesday cut interest rates amid mounting losses in financial markets , as the credit crunch continued to seize up lending .
The Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds rate a half a point to 1.50 percent .
It also lowered its discount rate as well .
The Fed , whose decision was unanimous , last cut rates a quarter point in April .
Central banks in the UK , European Union , Switzerland and elsewhere participated in the move .
The action comes after days of growing pressure on central banks to act together to stem mounting panic in the financial markets .
For the first time since records began , an otter has reached the isolated Farne Islands , off Britain 's North Sea coast , one of the country 's most important sanctuaries for seabirds .
The discovery this week of the species ' distinctive tracks on Brownsman , an islet on the outer edge of the little archipelago , has startled naturalists and marks a new high for the recovery of Britain 's once - threatened otter population .
" We almost had to rub our eyes with disbelief when we found the tracks , " said David Steel , head warden for the National Trust on the Farnes , yesterday .
" It is staggering that an otter could survive the perilous journey out to the islands . "
The otter , which is thought to be still on Brownsman , although it has not yet been seen , will have faced strong currents on a swim , which is three miles in a direct line .
Although the sleek , streamlined mammals are at home in the water , the distance is one of the longest British otters are known to have travelled .
Steel said : " It can be tricky to reach the islands even on a relatively calm day , and we 've recently had force nine gales which makes this journey that much more special .
We have no previous records of otters on the Farnes .
" We have no idea how long it might stay but the islands are very rocky and offer it a safe place to live and it should be able to find an abundance of food . "
The single otter will not pose a threat to seabird colonies , although wardens are sure that it is still on Brownsman because gulls there have been unusually agitated in the last week .
The annual Farnes nesting survey last week reported a rise in the numbers of the six main seabirds , including the guillemot , kittiwake and shag , although puffins have declined .
Paul Chanin , of the Mammal Society , said : " This is a really exciting discovery .
We know that otters like living on the coasts where there is food available and will sometimes travel to islands .
To find them so far off shore shows not just their strength but that they have a remarkable ability as navigators . "
Otters suffered a serious decline in the last century because of pesticide poisoning in rivers and hunting .
By the 1960s , they were seldom seen and evidence of their presence was found at only 6 % of their holts , or riverside lairs .
A steady revival has raised this figure to 30 % and otters have been seen in the Thames at London , and the Aire in central Leeds , although they are still classed as a vulnerable species on the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .
Testicular cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer but one that can cause extreme distress to the roughly 9,600 American men estimated to be diagnosed in 2020 .﻿﻿
As there are no screening tests available to detect the disease , detection depends largely on your ability to spot its common ( and not - so - common ) symptoms , which may include a lump in the testicle , a heaviness in the scrotum , testicular pain , fatigue , lower back pain , and unexplained weight loss .
By knowing the signs and symptoms of testicular cancer , you can be diagnosed and treated early and , more often than not , achieve complete remission .
Illustration by Joshua Seong , Verywell
Frequent Symptoms
The most common sign of testicular cancer ( also known as malignant neoplasm of the testes ) is a lump in one and sometimes both testicles .﻿﻿
The lump is usually found while taking a shower , when performing a routine testicular self - exam ( TSE ) , or by your partner during sex .
Testicular lumps are most often painless , although some do cause pain .
They can also be movable or immovable .
Some tumors may be smaller than a pea , while others can be larger than a marble .
Many of the tumors will feel hard and rock - like .
Other common signs and symptoms include :
A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum
A dull ache or sharp pain in the scrotum or lower abdomen
The swelling of one testicle but not the other
The accumulation of fluid in a testicle
While a testicular lump can be scary , it does n’t necessarily mean that you have cancer .
There can be many different explanations for this of which cancer may be the least likely .
With that being said , you should never ignore a testicular lump or any other symptoms suggestive of cancer .
Some men with testicular cancer may have no symptoms and will only be diagnosed during an unrelated medical exam ( such as a fertility test or routine physical ) .﻿﻿
Rare Symptoms
There is a rare type called testicular choriocarcinoma that is extremely aggressive and is more likely to spread to the lungs , bones , and brain .
Other uncommon forms , like embryonal carcinoma , are also more prone to metastasis .
Testicular cancers like these can trigger the excessive production of a hormone known as human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) , also known as the " pregnancy hormone . "
If this occurs , a man may experience gynecomastia , the abnormal enlargement of breast tissue .﻿﻿
Other types can cause gynecomastia by increasing the production of the female hormone , estrogen .
One such example is Leydig cell tumors of which 10 % will develop into testicular cancer .﻿﻿
While testicular cancer is exceedingly rare before the age of 14 , it can occasionally occur .
If it does , early puberty ( also known as precocious puberty ) may be the first sign .
The condition is most often associated with the development of Leydig cell tumors .
Later - Stage Symptoms
If left undiagnosed and untreated , testicular cancer may begin to spread , moving from the site of the original tumor ( known as stage 1 cancer ) to nearby lymph nodes ( stage 2 ) and , finally , to distant organ systems ( stage 3 ) .
The original cancer is referred to as the primary tumor , while the site of the new cancer is known as either a secondary or metastatic tumor .
If metastasis does occur , the symptoms can vary based on the location of the secondary tumor .
Among the possible signs and symptoms :﻿﻿
Lower back pain may develop if the cancer starts to spread to nearby lymph nodes .
Swollen lymph nodes may develop in the neck as the cancer further spreads to distant organs .
Swelling and pain of the lower extremities may be a sign of a blood clot known as deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) .
As cancer progresses , it places people in a hypercoagulative state wherein blood cells called platelets will begin to stick together abnormally .
﻿ ﻿
﻿ Shortness of breath ( dyspnea ) , a chronic cough , or the coughing up blood ( hemoptysis ) can occur if the malignancy spread to the lungs .
This is typically associated with the formation of a blood clot in the lungs known as a pulmonary embolism .
Headaches , confusion , and other neurological symptoms may develop if a secondary tumor is established in the brain .
Chronic fatigue and unexplained weight loss are common signs of late - stage cancer .
When to See a Doctor
If you discover a lump on your testicle , see your doctor as soon as you can .
While it is important to be proactive and vigilant , try not to jump to conclusions or let anxiety get the best of you .

According to the National Cancer Institute , only around six of every 100,000 American men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year , making it one of the least common causes of cancer in the United States .﻿﻿
Unless you are at high risk , the chances are pretty good you ’ll be cancer - free .
Some of the more likely causes of testicular lump are infection and injury , either of the testicle itself or the tube through which sperm is transported from the testicle ( called the epididymis ) .
On the off - chance you do have cancer , treatment is such that more than 95 % of cases have a five - year survival rate , including 73 % of men diagnosed with metastatic disease .﻿﻿
EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
Pid’jin attempts to grow two more balls .
An article in the Journal of English Linguistics ( Soda or Pop ? , # 24 , 1996 ) explores the way we address our favorite drink .
Soda , which the average American drinks about 43 gallons of per year , has a lot of different names .
Those names have been mapped by county so that the regions where different names are predominant light up like a Christmas tree .
Check it out below ( click to enlarge ) :
As it turns out there are three predominant terms that people use when asking for a soft drink .
The first is the most logical , “ soda . ”
It ’s the most popular in New England , the Mid-Atlantic ( where I ’m from ) , and the Southwest .
The term comes from the original name for carbonated beverages .
The next one is “ coke . ”
This one is interesting because it ’s the shortening of the world ’s most popular soda , Coca - Cola .
Talk about brand association .
A friend of mine from Texas ( the word is most popular in the South ) actually asks for a “ coke ” in her home town , and then when prompted to specify what kind , she ’ll say “ Sprite . ”
To me this is very counterintutive because Coke and Sprite are nothing alike , but that ’s just how the lingo has evolved .
The last one , and the bane of my existance , is “ pop . ”
In terms of geographical area , this one is by far the most popular .
The parts of the North that are n’t in New England , the Midwest , and the Northwest all predominantly use the term “ pop , ” as in short for “ soda pop . ”
Personally , this one has always just bothered me because soda is just “ soda . ”
Everyone has their own way of doing things I guess though .
One thing that should be noted is that this is a map that gives a percentage of use to each county .
The counties are not all equally populated , so these numbers really do n’t speak to the overall number of people in the country who use these terms , just regional approximations .
It would be interesting to see that data as well .

First Melyssa Cowburn ’s 5 - year - old child tried to bash in a baby ’s head with a hammer .
Then he set the shower curtain on fire .
The next day he plugged all the sinks and toilets in their apartment and flooded the place .
Cowburn and her husband had tried unsuccessfully to get their insurance company to pay for mental health treatment for the boy .
The difficulty she had keeping him under control had already helped drive her to attempt suicide last year .
Now she felt she had only one option :
She flew with her child to Nebraska last week and tearfully left him there .
This state has become notorious for being the one place in the country with a law whose wording allows parents to abandon children up to age 18 .
Its unique safe - haven law -- which was intended to let parents leave unwanted infants at hospitals without legal consequences -- took effect in September , and since then 35 children have been abandoned , almost all of them 11 or older .
The Nebraska Legislature has spent this week in a special session , frantically trying to revise the law .
It is expected to be amended today to allow abandonment only of infants up to 30 days old .
Advertisement
But children ’s advocates as well as parents like Cowburn say the state has done nothing to address the problem exposed by the safe - haven law : desperate families quietly struggling to raise mentally ill children with little help from the government .
“ There are parents like me who really need help , ” Cowburn said .
“ I do n’t know how to help him .
I do n’t know what else to do . ”
Nebraska ’s unicameral Legislature has vowed to address the problem when it meets for its regular session in January .
On Thursday , it created a special committee to formulate proposals during the next two months .
“ It has been a blessing in disguise , ” state Sen. Amanda McGill , who chairs the committee , said of the response to the safe - haven law .
“ It has brought to light a serious problem . ”
“ These parents were at wit ’s end , ” McGill said .
“ People do n’t want to give up their kids .
They just want to get them help . ”

The administration of Republican Gov. Dave Heineman , which faces a potential budget deficit next year , has been cool to the suggestion that the flood of abandoned children shows a need to patch holes in the state ’s safety net .
Todd Landry , head of the state ’s child welfare agency , said 75 % of the Nebraska children were receiving some type of assistance from the government .
“ We really want to emphasize to our families : Do n’t quit , ” Landry said .
“ I know that ’s really hard for families .
These are frustrating situations .
. . .
It can take many tries before a treatment works . ”
Every state has a safe - haven law , intended to allow mothers who might otherwise abandon unwanted babies in unsafe places to legally leave them at hospitals .
Nebraska became the last state to adopt such a policy when it passed its bill in February .
Unlike in other states , however , lawmakers did not set an age limit for abandoned children .
The bill ’s supporters say they could not have anticipated what happened when it went into effect .
On Sept. 13 , two boys , 11 and 15 , were dropped off by two families at hospitals in Omaha and Lincoln .
The parents said each child had behavioral problems ; one family feared the boy was in a violent gang but said child - welfare workers told the family they could not take him unless he committed a crime .

Soon the numbers snowballed .
Gary Staton , a father of 10 , left nine of his children at an Omaha hospital after his wife died .
A few children arrived from other states .
Teri Martin drove her 13 - year - old adopted son from Michigan to leave him in Omaha in hopes of scaring him straight .
Child - welfare officials in Michigan said the boy appeared to have been abused , and they removed Martin ’s three other children from her home .
The abandoned children were generally placed in foster homes or with relatives , though a few have required full - time residential treatment .
Some parents say it has been the only way to ensure that their child gets help .
Lavennia Coover ’s insurance covered only short hospital stays for her 11 - year - old son , who has bipolar disorder .
Despairing of getting help from the state in her rural northern Nebraska town , she trekked to Omaha last month and left her son at a hospital there .
Advertisement
“ I am tired of being labeled a bad parent by people in power who have no idea what my life is like in my home , ” Coover told the Legislature ’s Judiciary Committee this week .
Children ’s advocates have long complained that Nebraska does not give adequate support to troubled youth .
Its spending on child care and mental health is among the lowest in the nation , and its rate of foster care placement among the highest .
“ This is not just something that ’s come up lately , ” said state Sen .
Gwen Howard , a former state Health and Human Services case manager .
“ This is like a tsunami that ’s been building . ”
Kathy Moore , executive director of Voices for Children in Nebraska , pointed out that many who used the law were adoptive parents or guardians who took in children abandoned by biological parents .
She said the state had no programs to provide help to parents who frequently deal with traumatized children .

About four years ago , a crack addict in a North Carolina Wal - Mart handed her 16 - month - old son to Melyssa Cowburn and promised to return after buying diapers .
When the woman did n’t come back , Cowburn -- herself adopted -- became the boy ’s guardian .
“ I was 24 , ” said Cowburn , who asked that the boy not be named in this article .
“ I just thought , ‘ I ’m going to love this little guy , and it ’s just going to make everything better . ’ ”
That was n’t the case .
The child screamed for hours on end and kicked at her .
As he grew , he learned how to rip molding off doorways in their rented houses and stab Cowburn ’s cat .
He was routinely expelled from day - care programs for violence .
Cowburn said she took him to a hospital after one violent episode , and doctors diagnosed him with reactive attachment disorder , a rare condition that warps a child ’s personal relationships and stems from early abandonment .
She later learned that the boy ’s birth mother was schizophrenic .
Advertisement
Cowburn ’s husband , Adam , an ex-Marine , rejoined the military to pay for the child ’s medications .
He was deployed to Afghanistan last year .
Melyssa Cowburn returned to Omaha , where her mother lives .
At wit ’s end , she swallowed prescription pills one night and was rushed to the hospital .
Her 79 - year - old mother was unable to care for the boy while Cowburn recovered .
The child was placed into Nebraska foster care for several months .
The state said the child seemed to improve , but Cowburn said he simply returned with a new roster of curse words .
Cowburn ’s husband was deployed to Washington state , where the couple struggled to get insurance to cover medications .
Social workers there said they could not take the child unless the parents were abusing him .
In despair after the assault on a friend ’s infant , the fire and the flood , Cowburn took her boy back to Omaha and drove him to Immanuel Medical Center the night of Nov. 13 .
She told him she was taking him to the hospital so he could get better .
“ Maybe , ” the child said , according to Cowburn , “ you can find a little boy who ’s better . ”

“ I do n’t want anyone better , ” Cowburn said .
“ I want you . ”
She cried the entire drive back to her mother ’s home .

( Adds comments by Fingar , details )
WASHINGTON , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - U.S. economic and political clout will decline over the next two decades and the world will be more dangerous , with food and water scarce and advanced weapons plentiful , U.S. spy agencies projected on Thursday .
The National Intelligence Council analysis “ Global Trends 2025 ” also said the current financial crisis on Wall Street is just the first phase of a global economic reordering .
The U.S. dollar ’s role as the world ’s major currency would weaken to become a “ first among equals , ” the report said .
The outlook is intended to inform U.S. President - elect Barack Obama of factors that will influence global events .
It is based on a year - long global survey of experts and trends by U.S. intelligence analysts .
“ The next 20 years of transition to a new system are fraught with risks , ” said the report , which was more pessimistic about U.S. influence and the potential for conflict than the last outlook for 2020 .
Thomas Fingar , chairman of the intelligence council and deputy national director of intelligence for analysis , said harmful outcomes were not inevitable .
“ It is not beyond the mind of human beings , or political systems , ( or ) in some cases ( the ) working of market mechanisms to address and alleviate if not solve these problems , ” Fingar told reporters .
“ We could have a better world in 2025 . ”
China and India , following a “ state capitalism ” economic model , were likely to join the United States atop a multipolar world and compete for influence , the report said .
Russia ’s potential was less certain , depending on its energy wealth and internal investment .
But Iran , Turkey and Indonesia were also seen gaining power .
POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT
A world with multiple power centers has been less stable than one with a single or two rival superpowers , and there was a growing potential for conflict , the report said .
Global warming will be felt , and water , food and energy constraints may fuel conflict over resources .
“ Strategic rivalries are most likely to revolve around trade , investments and technological innovation and acquisition , but we cannot rule out a 19th century - like scenario of arms races , territorial expansion and military rivalries , ” the report said .
“ Types of conflict we have not seen for a while -- such as over resources -- could reemerge , ” it said .
Global wealth was seen shifting from the developed West to the energy - rich Gulf States and Russia , and to Asia , the rising center of manufacturing and some service industries .
Global rich - poor disparities would grow , leaving Africa vulnerable to increased instability .
A reordering of the world financial system was happening faster than the report ’s authors envisioned , Fingar said .
Last weekend ’s Group of 20 summit of advanced and major developing countries in Washington showed work had begun , he said .
A shift away from an oil - based energy system will be underway or complete by 2025 .
Better renewable technologies such as solar and wind power offer the best opportunity for a quick and low - cost transition , the report said .
There was a greater , but still small , risk of nuclear attack , based on spreading technologies and the weakening of international nonproliferation systems .
If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons , Fingar said , that could set off an arms race in the Middle East , which is considered in the report as an “ arc of instability . ”
The risk that militant groups would use biological weapons was greater than the risk of nuclear terrorism , the report said .
The appeal of terrorism could decline over the next two decades , particularly if Middle Eastern countries provide productive education and opportunities for their young people , the report said .
But with a growing population , the pool of potential terrorism recruits is likely to be larger , and access to dangerous weapons will rise .

In recent months , Robert Gates , the US secretary of defence , has received much praise for lowering the triumphalist rhetoric that marked the early phases of the so - called " war on terror " .
His emphasis on the need for " a sense of humility and an appreciation of limits " is sweet music to those who question the necessity of automatically using overpowering force to defend US national interests .
But in one area
Gates is not as humble or aware of limits as he aspires the military to be .
In his frequent pronouncements that hard power can't do it all , he emphasises that what 's needed is more soft power .
But it turns out that he means massive doses of soft power as interpreted , packaged and distributed by the Pentagon and its contractors .
True , in a speech last November , Gates did say another agency -- the state department -- should get more funding for its soft - power activities , which include public diplomacy programmes like its neglected educational and cultural exchanges .
Little noticed in Gates 's widely acclaimed remarks , however , was his statement : " Do n't get me wrong , I 'll be asking for yet more money for defence next year . "
Part of the money Gates intends to spend , as the Washington Post reported recently , is for a $ 300 m , three - year effort to " engage and inspire " Iraq 's population to support its government and US policies through a variety of programmes ranging from media products to entertainment ( an additional $ 15 m a year would be spent polling Iraqis ) .
This is a huge amount by soft - power standards .
The state department expects to spend just $ 5.6 m on public diplomacy in Iraq in fiscal 2008 .
The defence department money is to be distributed among four private contractors , including the Lincoln Group which , per arrangements with the Pentagon , covertly paid Iraqi newspapers to print articles composed by the US military but published as straight news items .

Jim Webb , the Democratic senator from Virginia , whose military and journalistic background makes him eminently qualified to speak about the use of soft power by the Pentagon , wrote in a letter to Gates : " At a time when this country is facing such a grave economic crisis , and at a time when the government of Iraq now shows at least a $ 79bn surplus from recent oil revenues , in my view it makes little sense for the US department of defence to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to propagandise the Iraqi people . "
Public - diplomacy specialists have also been put off by Gates 's indoctrination mission .
As one noted scholar informed me by e-mail : " Communication that is seen as propaganda does not attract and thus does not produce soft power . "
Critics point out that the defence department 's funding is not transparent , which could result in its programmes losing credibility when target audiences find out where the money really comes from .
This certainly turned out to be the case during the cold war , when the CIA was exposed as the covert financial supporter of intellectual magazines like Encounter that had been considered independent .
Already , the Iranian ambassador to Iraq , Kazemi Qomi , has complained : " Four large media companies are contributing to the Pentagon 's plan to provoke the Iraqi public opinion against the Islamic Republic and strain Tehran - Baghdad relations . "
Such " anti-Iranian propaganda " , the Iranian news agency FARS says , is " futile " .
The Pentagon 's costly soft - power initiative is not limited to foreign audiences , but includes the US as well .
It specifies the need to " communicate effectively with our strategic audiences ( ie Iraqi , pan- Arabic , international and US audiences ) to gain widespread acceptance of [ US and Iraqi government ] core themes and messages . "
According to Marc Lynch , a specialist in the Middle East media , making " American audiences ... a key target for manipulation through the covert dissemination of propaganda messages should be seen as scandalous , subversive of democracy and illegal . "
Scandalous it indeed is , but such homeland targeting is part of the defence department 's modus operandi , as the New York Times ' revelations about the military 's use of domestic - media commentators as propagandists for the Pentagon indicates ( the activity is currently being investigated by the federal communications commission ) .
Nothing is worse than the misapplication of hard power , as Gates has rightly suggested .
He seems unwilling to admit , however , that the same is true in the case of what the Pentagon interprets soft power to be .
ROTAN , HONDURAS ( Fortune Small Business ) -- Karl Stanley is a very happy man : he just found a dead horse .
The entrepreneur made the discovery while cruising in his submarine , the Idabel , 1,700 feet beneath the waters off Roatan , Honduras .
At that depth , amid jagged black boulders and hills of sediment , you can see some amazing creatures : lobsters with spindly arms as long as their bodies , silver - skinned fish the size of a cavalry saber , orange anglerfish with jaws locked in a perpetual grin .
But to see the really big beasts , you need some really big bait .
So eight hours earlier , Stanley had bought a tired old horse from a nearby stable , led it onto a boat , shot it in the head , tied cinder blocks to its hooves , and dumped it in the ocean .
The sea this morning was rough , and an unexpected lurch tossed the carcass overboard before Stanley had reached his intended spot .
In these murky depths , finding lost objects - even one as large as a horse - can be tough .
But there it is , the body stiff but intact , and a foot - long , clawless crustacean called an isopod crawling up its flank .
Then the main attraction glides slowly , sinuously into view : Hexanchus griseus , a deep - dwelling , six - gilled shark rarely seen by human beings .
At 14 feet , it is slightly longer than Stanley 's vessel .
Watching it through an acrylic dome window , on which the water is pressing with the weight of a locomotive , I find it hard to decide which I should be more concerned about : the dead horse , the giant shark , or the fact that Stanley built this submarine himself .
In the deep
Taking your customers this far down in an uninsured , homemade vessel may not seem like the smartest idea for a small business .
But that is exactly what Stanley , 34 , has been doing in Honduras for the past decade , taking advantage of a light regulatory environment to go deeper than any other tourist sub in the world .
Despite the disapproval of U.S. operators , a string of accidents , and a business model that barely keeps his head above water , Stanley remains stubbornly optimistic .
One of his favorite T - shirts reads : DON'T WORRY , I DO THIS ALL THE TIME .
Stanley can trace his obsession back to the age of 9 , when he read a children 's book about a team of preteen detectives who build a submarine to help solve an underwater mystery .
He started sketching plans for a craft of his own , and by 15 he had started construction in his parents ' backyard in Ridgewood , N.J. Stanley took the project with him to college in Florida , where he studied English literature ( he has no formal training in engineering ) .
The craft , dubbed C - BUG , took its maiden voyage the week he graduated .
A lot of would - be Captain Nemos start putting together subs in their backyards .
Few ever get them in the water .
The number who then turn them into a profitable business is minuscule .
But Stanley persevered .
Once he had proved the C - BUG could withstand dives of 70 feet , he trailered it to Fort Lauderdale and dove progressively deeper and deeper .
He got tows out to the ocean from local yachtsmen by offering them rides in the sub .
In 1998 , having gone down nearly 700 feet , Stanley felt ready to turn his sub into a business .
What kind of business ?
He had no idea .
So he signed up as an exhibitor at a local scuba - diving convention and sat alongside the C - BUG with a sign explaining that he was looking for ideas on how to use it .
One of the first attendees to bite was the owner of a resort on the sleepy island of Roatan , 30 miles north of mainland Honduras , who thought that the prospect of a sub ride might draw new customers to his hotel .
Stanley flew down and was instantly smitten with the location .
" You 've got the protection of the reef in case you need to ride out a storm , yet you can motor ten minutes offshore and be in deep water , " he says .
The C - BUG 's next dive was on Roatan , and this time Stanley had a paying passenger .
At the age of 24 , he had entered the ranks of professional submariners .
It has hardly been a risk - free enterprise .
On one dive a window cracked 600 feet down , spraying seawater on a passenger .
" That scared the crap out of me , " he admits .
( He has broken three more windows since . )
At other times the C - BUG has gotten stuck in a cave , been tangled in lobster traps , and suffered small onboard fires .
" I 've never thought that I was n't coming up , " he says .

Attention , convicts :
Time is running out to get applications into the pardon attorney at the Justice Department if you 're hoping that President Bush will be your decider .
Few of you should get your hopes up -- Bush has rejected a record number of requests for pardons and commutations .
In the last eight years , he has pardoned 157 people -- a miserly sum compared to his predecessors .
But you do n't have to give up entirely :
More are expected in the coming months , most notably for Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Before President Clinton went on a pardon spree for wealthy friends and campaign contributors at the end of his presidency , pardons and commutations were traditionally bestowed on average citizens who had successfully reformed their lives and given back to their communities after completing lengthy sentences .
Pardon experts believe that of the Bush prospects , the 1980s junk - bond king Michael Milken best fits the rich - and - famous description .
Most of the other top prospects for pardon listed below have , like Milken , been convicted and served prison time .
But not all .
People who are merely charged could be eligible for pardons , as Bush 's father demonstrated when he pardoned former Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger .
And Washington is abuzz with the prospect that Bush might issue pre-emptive pardons for government employees who could face trouble in the future stemming from their roles in his " war on terror . "
We 've rated potential pardonees ' chances from zero to four " Get of Jail Free " cards .
Sports
Marion Jones
The disgraced Olympic gold medalist returned five awards after she was sentenced to six months in jail in January for lying to federal agents about using steroids .
She was released on Sept. 5 . Jonesâ offense is considered mild , and her sentence was brief , but the president may not want to reward someone who cost the United States Olympic Gold .
Likelihood : Unlikely
Michael Vick
The Atlanta Falcons ' suspended quarterback is serving a 23 - month sentence in Leavenworth , Kan. , for criminal conspiracy relating to dog fighting .
Yuck .
There just is n't much of a pro dog - fighting lobby to pull for Vick .
Likelihood : No chance .
Barry Bonds
The former San Francisco Giants superstar who holds the MLB all - time record for home runs was indicted in November 2007 for lying about his involvement in a steroids scandal .
Bonds became a free agent last year but has been unable to find a team willing to sign him while under indictment .
As a former baseball team owner , Bush may be sympathetic to Bonds .
But let 's be honest -- who in baseball likes Barry ?
Likelihood : Unlikely
Texas
Florita Bell Griffin
As governor , Bush appointed Griffin to the oversight board of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs .
In 2000 , she was convicted of bribery , theft and money laundering .
In 2003 , a federal appeals court overturned a separate conviction for mail fraud .
Griffin has two things going for her : Bush and Texas .
Bush has pardoned more of his fellow Texans than residents of any other state .
Likelihood : Possible
Texas Border Patrol Guards
Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean , pictured with his wife , are serving sentences of 11 and 12 years , respectively , for the nonfatal shooting in the back of an unarmed Mexican drug runner in February 2005 .
A jury found the two border patrolmen then tried to cover up the shooting .
Their requests for a pardon have won support from numerous Republican congressmen including Rep. Duncan Hunter of California , who introduced the Congressional Pardon for Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean Act .
Bush left open the possibility of a pardon for both men during an interview with a Texas TV station .
Likelihood : Good Chance
Team Bush
Scooter Libby
Cheneyâs former chief of staff , who also served as assistant to the president , was convicted of perjury and obstructing the FBI 's investigation of the leak of former CIA officer Valerie Plame 's identity .
In June of 2007 he was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a hefty fine .
Bush commuted the prison time , but only a pardon will allow Libby to practice law again .
Likelihood : You Betcha !
James Tobin
Tobin was Bush 's 2004 New England campaign chairman and raised more than $ 200,000 for the president 's re-election bid .
He was indicted in October for making false statements to the FBI in connection with the bureau 's investigation of the plot to jam Democratic Party phones in New Hampshire in 2002 .
Tobin was convicted in 2005 for his actual role in that scheme , but that conviction was overturned on appeal in 2007 .
His fundraising prowess and the overturning of his earlier conviction -- in connection with the same case -- make him a good pardon candidate .
Likelihood : Good Chance
Tom Noe
Noe was a prominent Ohio Republican fundraiser for Bush - Cheney ' 04 .
He was sentenced to 27 months in a federal prison for illegally funneling money to the campaign .
Two months later , he was also found guilty of theft , money laundering , forgery and corrupt activity related to Ohio 's rare - coin investment scandal .
Noe may have had a shot if his only offense were connected to campaign funding .
But his Ohio crime was one of a number of nasty Republican scandals that badly damaged the party 's standing in the 2006 midterm election .
Likelihood : Unlikely
Congressman
Sen . Ted Stevens
Now that the 85 - year - old Alaska Republican , who was found guilty last month of corruption , has lost re-election , members of his party might push for a pardon for him -- after all , he spent the last 40 years in the Senate .
Stevens seemed to dismiss the need for a pardon while the votes were being counted ; late Tuesday , he was tight - lipped about the whether he would ask Bush for clemency .
Likelihood : Possible
Bob Ney
The former Republican congressman from Ohio was sentenced to two and a half years in prison after he acknowledged taking bribes from convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Ney was on the Abramoff - sponsored golfing trip to Scotland at the heart of the case against David Safavian , the former White House procurement officer who was also caught up in the scandal .
A pardon of Ney could refocus public attention on cushy relationships between Republicans and lobbyists over the last eight years -- relationships that a humbled GOP would rather forget .
Likelihood : No Chance
Randy Cunningham
The former Republican congressman from California pleaded guilty in 2005 to federal conspiracy charges to commit bribery , mail fraud , wire fraud and tax evasion .
He was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison and ordered to pay $ 1.8 million in restitution for all the fancy gifts he racked up from lobbyists .
" The Duke " has a pardon attorney , and a number of people have written to the Justice Department in support of clemency .
But Cunningham 's naked abuse of power tainted Republican rule and contributed to steep party losses in 2006 .
Likelihood : No Chance
Brent Wilkes
Wilkes , a defense contractor , was sentenced to 12 years in prison in February for furnishing Cunningham with yachts , vacations and other luxury items in exchange for lucrative contracts .
Wilkes cooperated with federal investigators in the Cunningham case , and that could help him win a pardon .
Likelihood : Possible
Kyle " Dusty " Foggo
Foggo was Wilkes ' childhood friend before he rose to become executive director of the CIA , the No. 3 position in the U.S. spy agency .
He was indicted in 2007 on several counts of fraud , conspiracy and money laundering in connection with Wilkes and admitted to steering a lucrative CIA contract to his pal .
Foggo remains under investigation by the CIA and other federal agencies .
But his cooperation with investigators and years of service in the clandestine agency once run by Bush 's father could make him a good candidate for clemency .
Likelihood : Possible
Team Abramoff
Jack Abramoff
The former Hollywood producer - turned - Republican lobbyist was at the center of the largest lobbying scandal in Washington , which erupted in 2005 .
Abramoff was convicted of fraud , tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials .
The sentence was reduced in September to four years in recognition of Abramoff 's cooperation with investigators .
That 's all the break he 'll get .
Abramoff was such a disaster for Bush and the GOP that the White House refused to release any photos in which the president and Abramoff appeared in the same room at the same time .
Likelihood : No Chance
J. Steven Griles
Griles served as Deputy Secretary of the Interior during Bush 's first term .
In March 2007 , he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges in connection with his 2005 Senate testimony regarding the Abramoff scandal .
Griles was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined $ 30,000 .
He was released this year .
Griles ' time served , combined with his senior position in the administration , make him a good candidate for a pardon .
Likelihood : Possible
David Safavian
The senior White House procurement officer in the Office of Management and Budget was convicted in 2006 for concealment , making false statements and obstructing justice in the Abramoff investigation .
He was sentenced to 18 months in prison , but the conviction was overturned in June .
A retrial is set for December .
Likelihood : Unlikely
White Collar
Michael Milken
The junk - bond king became the symbol of the ' 80s greed on Wall Street that led to insider - trading scandals and a stock - market crash .
Milken was sentenced to eight years for conspiracy and fraud charges and ordered to pay $ 200 million in fines .
But he was released in January 1993 , after less than two years in prison .
Milken , who was diagnosed with prostate cancer that year , has since devoted significant resources to philanthropy and created several foundations to support cancer research .
Milken , who is believed to be worth more than $ 1 billion , tried unsuccessfully to secure a pardon from President Clinton .
He is currently represented by Washington powerhouse attorney Ted Olsen , Bush 's longtime friend and first - term solicitor general .
Olsen also represented Armand Hammer , who received a pardon from former President George H.W. Bush .
Likelihood : Excellent Chance
The Smartest Guys in the Room
Former Enron executives Jeffrey Skilling , right , and Andrew Fastow , left , were convicted of multiple federal felonies in 2006 in connection to Enron 's downfall .
Skilling , who was Enron 's CEO , is serving a 24 - year - prison sentence at a federal penitentiary in Minnesota .
Fastow , the corporate CFO , is nearing the end of his six - year sentence .
Bush was friends with the now - deceased chairman , Kenneth Lay of Enron , which , of course was based in Texas .
But the president managed to distance himself from the company 's extraordinary collapse .
A point against pardons for these guys : Considering the current financial crisis , rewarding Enron 's failed leadership might not be smart .
Likelihood : Possible
Martha Stewart
Millions of glue - gun aficionados would love to see a pardon for the domestic doyenne who was convicted in 2004 of lying to investigators about a stock sale and served five months in a womenâs correctional facility .
Thousands of people have even signed a petition seeking a pardon for Martha .
It 's hard to see what would be in it for Bush .
But Martha 's spectacular book sales and daytime - TV ratings are testament to millions of other Americans ' ability to forgive .
Why not the president , too ?
( The question , of course , that all pardon applicants ask . )
Likelihood : Why Not ?
The video website YouTube is preparing to link up with Hollywood to show full - length films for free over the internet , it has emerged .
The site - already used by millions of people every day to watch short video clips - confirmed that it was in negotiations with major studios as it gets ready to launch an online movie service .
" Our goal is to offer maximum choice for our users , partners and advertisers , " the company said in a statement .
Free films , running with advertising , would mark a radical advance for the video - sharing website as it looks to profit from its massive popularity .
It is not clear which Hollywood studios are involved in the discussions .
But one report from the CNET news website suggested a YouTube movie service could arrive within 90 days .
The development is part of a drive to increase profits at the video website , which has struggled to meet financial expectations since Google bought it for $ 1.65 bn in 2006 .
YouTube contributors can now run advertising over their videos or add links to music and DVDs sales from iTunes and Amazon .
A movie deal would also build on a recent agreement with the TV network CBS whereby the broadcaster 's shows are screened online , with advertising , in return for a share of the revenue .
The decision to link up with the film industry is also driven by rival moves by websites which already show full - length films and high - quality TV .
The BBC's iPlayer has shown more than 160 m programmes in the past year , and Hulu , a website backed by the American networks NBC and Fox , which has a vast library of TV programmes and films , has rocketed in popularity since it launched last year .
The internet retailer Amazon has also started streaming some films on IMDb.com , the UK - based online film database that it bought 10 years ago .
The developments tap into the move towards on - demand viewing rather than traditional scheduling , according to Jon Gibs , vice president of the ratings company Nielsen Online .
" Consumers are increasingly relying on the web to catch up on content they missed when it aired on television , and the networks are beginning to capitalise on this trend . "
He said , as an example , that " anyone who did n't see Tina Fey 's impersonation of Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live had to log on and watch it or risk having nothing to say around the proverbial water cooler " .
For Hollywood , the change reflects shifting patterns of behaviour .
Although DVD sales remain relatively strong , with sales worth more than £ 2bn in the UK last year , recent figures from the research group Ipsos suggest that TV now accounts for just 55 % of all video watched by teenagers .
Not all of Hollywood is likely to be joining forces with YouTube , however .
Paramount and DreamWorks are unlikely to sign up since the website is locked in a billion - dollar lawsuit with their parent firm , Viacom , over allegations that YouTube encouraged copyright infringement .
The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module holds equipment bound for the space station ( Image : NASA / Kim Shiflett )
As NASA prepares to double the number of astronauts living aboard the International Space Station , nothing may do more for crew bonding than a machine being launched aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on Friday .
It ’s a water - recycling device that will process the crew ’s urine for communal consumption .
“ We did blind taste tests of the water , ” said NASA ’s Bob Bagdigian , the system ’s lead engineer .
“ Nobody had any strong objections .
Other than a faint taste of iodine , it is just as refreshing as any other kind of water . ”

“ I ’ve got some in my fridge , ” he added .
“ It tastes fine to me . ”
Delivery of the $ 250 million wastewater recycling gear is among the primary goals of NASA ’s 124th shuttle mission , which is due to launch at 1955 EST on Friday ( 0055 GMT on Saturday ) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
Meteorologists predicted a 70 % chance the weather would be suitable for launch .
With no technical issues , NASA managers told the launch team on Friday morning to fuel the shuttle for lift - off , a three - hour operation to pump 500,000 gallons ( 1.9 million litres ) of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the spaceship ’s tank for the 8.5 - minute climb into orbit .
If the shuttle lifts off on time , it would arrive at the space station on Sunday so astronauts could begin 11 to 12 days of home improvements .
Second toilet
In addition to the water recycler , Endeavour carries two small bedrooms , the station ’s first refrigerator , new exercise gear , and perhaps most important for a growing crew – a second toilet .
“ With six people , you really do need to have a two - bathroom house .
It ’s a lot more convenient and a lot more efficient , ” said Endeavour astronaut Sandra Magnus .
She will take over as a space station flight engineer from Greg Chamitoff , who has been aboard the outpost since the last shuttle flight in June .
NASA wants to make sure the water recycling system is working well before adding another three astronauts to the station ’s crew .
Reusing water will become essential once NASA retires its space shuttles , which produce water as a byproduct of their electrical systems .
Rather than dumping the water overboard , NASA has been transferring it to the space station .
Yesterday ’s waste
But the shuttle ’s days are numbered .
Only 10 flights remain , including a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope .
NASA is preparing to end the programme in 2010 , after which Russian Soyuz spacecraft will be the only way to ferry crew to the space station .
“ We ca n’t be delivering water all the time for six crew , ” said space station flight director Ron Spencer .
“ Recycling is a must . ”
NASA expects to process about six gallons ( 23 litres ) of water per day with the new device .
The goal is to recover about 92 % of the water from the crew ’s urine and moisture in the air .
The wastewater is processed using an extensive series of purification techniques , including distillation – which is somewhat tricky in microgravity – filtration , oxidation , and ionisation .
The final step is the addition of iodine to control microbial growth , Bagdigian said .
The device is intended to process a full day ’s worth of wastewater in less than 24 hours .
“ Today ’s drinking water was yesterday ’s waste , ” Bagdigian said .
Few of us would care if our house keys appeared in a photograph of the family picnic posted on the internet .
But we should be concerned because advances in digital imaging and optics means any photograph of a key posed a potential security threat , Stefan Savage , a computer science professor at the University of California , warns .
Professor Savage and two of his PhD students have developed a software program called Sneakey that can clone a key in " two to three minutes " after analysing a digital photograph .
Late in the summer and early in the fall , especially in years like this one with fewer than normal blooming agaves , nectivorous bats will visit and completely drain hummingbird feeders at night here in Tucson , Arizona .
Some time in early October , these bats will migrate south for the winter .
Two species of bats visit my hummingbird feeders here in Tucson , endangered Lesser Long - nosed Bats ( Leptonycteris curasoae yerbabuenae ) and threatened Mexican Long - tongued Bats ( Choeronycteris mexicana ) .
Both of these species look generally similar , and I sometimes have trouble telling them apart , especially with young bats , but they can often be distinguished when seen in profile .
Mexican Long - tongued
Bats have longer , narrower snouts and range in color from brown to grayish brown .
Lesser Long - nosed
Bats have shorter , broader snouts and range in color from a striking yellowish brown to cinnamon gray - brown .
Overall , the numerous bats at my hummingbird feeders seem to share them quite well , but I suppose that a few minor squabbles are inevitable .
Since these bats can't hover motionless like hummingbirds , they instead fly up to the feeders for a quick sip of sugar water with their long tongues and then fly off and circle around the feeder waiting for a chance to get another sip .
The bats each seem to have their own preferred feeding method , some of which are more effective than others .
This female Mexican Long - tongued
Bat below hovers briefly to sip nectar , while another bat , possibly a juvenile , prefers the lazy yet effective method of lying down on the feeder and sipping nectar at its leisure .
I observed a number of bats feeding while briefly lying down , which works but must leave them a bit sticky .
Another method is the semi- hover and semi-perch method favored by many of the bats .
Compared to the feet of birds , the feet of bats are backwards and not designed to allow them to perch upright .
Some of these bats do manage to perch upright for brief moments despite having rear legs designed for hanging upside down in mines and caves all day .
Using hummingbird feeders is a bit of a learning experience , and not every bat knows exactly where the best nectar is .
Some bats will correctly dip their tongues in the nectar holes , while others will somewhat cluelessly settle for licking up drops of splashed nectar on the plastic nectar tray .
This Lesser Long - nosed
Bat below looks especially clueless as it sits hovering on the sticky nectar tray and licks fruitlessly at the nectar bottle .
Hopefully it eventually managed to figure it out by watching the other wiser members of its bat colony .
Update :

The problem is , as vile and abhorrent as her actions were , she broke no laws .
So the prosecutor , desperate to nail her for something , charged her under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ( CFAA ) , a law which criminalized " cracking " and unauthorized access to computers .
The argument seems to be that Drew violated the Terms of Service of her MySpace account , therefore her use of the account was not authorized , therefore she was guilty of unauthorized access -- a criminal offense .
Stop and think about that : violation of a contractual agreement is now a criminal offense , not civil .

There are some expensive libraries that you can use to generate PDF files … but why bother with them , when there are good free alternatives like Zend_Pdf ?
In three steps , you can generate a fancy report :
Create a PDF template Insert data to template with Zend_Pdf Profit $ $ $
Since this is a quite repetitive task , let ’s also create a PDF generator class to help us .
In case you do n’t have Zend_Pdf , just download Zend Framework to get it .
Step 1
I wo n’t go into much detail with this , since it ’s essentially up to you :
Just choose your favorite application that ’s capable of creating PDF files , and create a PDF file for your report or whatever you ’re going to output .
You can insert your logo , labels for data etc. , just make sure you leave the area where you want the actual data from your application to show up empty .
Step 2
Now that you have an empty PDF template , you ’ll need to write some code that will insert the data from your application into the template and output the result .
At the very least , you will need to load the template and set a font to be able to write on the page :
$ pdf = Zend_Pdf :: load ( ' template.pdf ' ) ; $ page = $ pdf -> pages [ 0 ] ; $ font = Zend_Pdf_Font :: fontWithName ( ' Helvetica ' ) ; $ page -> setFont ( $ font , 12 ) ; // now we can write : $ page -> drawText ( ' Hello World ' , $ x , $y ) ; $ pdf = Zend_Pdf::load ( ' template.pdf ' ) ; $ page = $ pdf-> pages [ 0 ] ; $ font = Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName ( ' Helvetica' ) ; $ page->setFont ( $ font , 12 ) ; // now we can write : $ page ->drawText ( ' Hello World ' , $ x , $ y ) ;
So this one is pretty simple too .
The tricky part is figuring out $x and $y : you will need to find the specific location of each value – even though PDF has placeholder stuff , Zend_Pdf does n’t support it ( but hopefully in the future ) .
Now , you would probably end up with a lot of code that just says draw text here , draw text there and so on .
You might even have many kinds of PDFs that you wish to be able to create , so it would only seem natural that we create a class that can take care of the mundane PDF creation , based on something that ’s easy for us to edit … say , XML .
PDF generator
I ’ve created a class , CU_PdfGenerator , for this task .
You can define a template PDF file , define a font , define locations for each data key and define specific fonts for data keys if needed .
It ’s quite basic , but it does the job and it should be easy to extend to allow , say , different font colors .
Basically , you could do something like this :
$ generator = new CU_PdfGenerator ( ) ; $ generator -> setTemplate ( ' data/template.pdf ' ) -> setFont ( Zend_Pdf_Font :: fontWithName ( ' Helvetica ' ) , 12 ) ; // Some example data : $ data = array ( ' firstname ' => ' Peter ' , ' lastname ' => ' Pan ' ) ; //
Put the data in an array , as the generator can // do multiple pages of data with one index per page $ generator -> setData ( array ( $ data ) ) // Finally , set X and Y positions for the data : $ generator -> setPosition ( ' firstname ' , 10 , 10 ) ; -> setPosition ( ' lastname ' , 10 , 50 ) ; // Get resulting Zend_Pdf object : $ pdf = $ generator -> get Pdf ( ) ; $ generator = new CU_PdfGenerator ( ) ; $ generator->setTemplate ( ' data/template.pdf ' ) ->setFont(Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName ( ' Helvetica ' ) , 12 ) ; // Some example data : $ data = array ( ' firstname ' => ' Peter ' , ' lastname ' => ' Pan ' ) ; //
Put the data in an array , as the generator can // do multiple pages of data with one index per page $ generator -> setData ( array ( $ data ) ) // Finally , set X and Y positions for the data : $ generator->setPosition ( ' firstname ' , 10 , 10 ) ; ->setPosition ( ' lastname ' , 10 , 50 ) ; // Get resulting Zend_Pdf object : $ pdf = $ generator -> getPdf ( ) ;
One thing to note here is that I made the generator to use a different coordinate system for the Y position .
Normally , if you said y = 0 for positioning in a PDF , it would go to the bottom of the page .
I modified it so , that y = 0 means top , since I ’m more familiar with that way of positioning things .
The final $ pdf variable would contain a Zend_Pdf object with all the data applied .
You can use this to get the final PDF data for outputting with $ pdf-> render ( )
Using the generator with XML
Also , since I mentioned using XML , let ’s take a quick look at some code which can be used in together with the generator to parse the PDF settings from a simple XML document .
Basically , we ’d want to allow users to write all the small details of generating the PDF in XML : the template , the font family and size , the locations of the data on the pages and their fonts …
The resulting XML could look like this :
< pdf > < base > data/template.pdf </ base > < font family = " Helvetica " size = " 12 " /> < elements > < element key = " firstname " x = " 10 " y = " 10 " />
< element key = " lastname " x = " 10 " y = " 50 " > < font size = " 16 " /> </element > </elements > </ pdf > < pdf > < base>data/template.pdf </ base > < font family = " Helvetica " size = " 12 " /> < elements > < element key = " firstname " x = " 10 " y= " 10 " /> < element key =" lastname " x = " 10 " y= " 50 " > < font size = " 16 " /> </element > </elements > </ pdf >
That would equal the definition we did in code in the previous chapter , with the exception of the size 16 font for lastname .
Now , let ’s check out the code for parsing that :
$ xml = simplexml_load_file ( ' path/to/definition.xml ' ) ; $ fontSize = ( int ) $ xml -> font [ ' size ' ] ; $ fontFamily = ( string ) $ xml -> font [ ' family ' ] ; $ generator = CU_PdfGenerator :: create ( ) -> setTemplate ( ( string ) $ xml -> base ) -> setFont ( Zend_Pdf_Font :: fontWithName ( $ fontFamily ) , $ fontSize ) ; foreach ( $ xml -> elements [ 0 ] as $ element ) { $ key = ( string ) $ element [ ' key ' ] ; $ generator -> setPosition ( $ key , ( int ) $ element [ ' x ' ] , ( int ) $ element [ 'y ' ] ) ; if ( isset ( $ element -> font ) ) { $ family = $ fontFamily ; $ size = $ fontSize ; if ( isset ( $ element -> font [ ' family ' ] ) ) $ family = ( string ) $ element -> font [ ' family ' ] ; if ( isset ( $ element -> font [ ' size ' ] ) ) $ size = ( int ) $ element -> font [ ' size ' ] ; $ font = Zend_Pdf_Font :: fontWithName ( $ family ) ; $ generator -> setFontForKey ( $ key , $ font , $ size ) ; } } $xml = simplexml_load_file ( ' path/to/definition.xml ' ) ; $ fontSize = ( int ) $ xml - > font [ ' size ' ] ; $ fontFamily = ( string ) $xml -> font [ ' family ' ] ; $ generator = CU_PdfGenerator :: create( ) ->setTemplate ( ( string ) $xml->base ) ->setFont(Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName( $ fontFamily ) , $ fontSize ) ; foreach ( $xml - >elements [ 0 ] as $ element ) { $ key = ( string ) $element [ ' key ' ] ; $ generator -> setPosition ( $key , ( int ) $element [ 'x ' ] , ( int ) $element [ 'y ' ] ) ; if ( isset ( $element -> font ) ) { $ family = $ fontFamily ; $ size = $ fontSize ; if ( isset ( $ element - > font [ ' family ' ] ) ) $ family = ( string ) $ element -> font [ ' family ' ] ; if ( isset ( $element -> font [ ' size ' ] ) ) $ size = ( int ) $element - > font [ ' size ' ] ; $ font = Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName( $family ) ; $ generator->setFontForKey ( $key , $ font , $ size ) ; } }
The above with the XML would set up the generator to do about the same as the code - setup earlier , but modifying the reports would be much simpler since you can just edit the XML files and not have to worry about the code as much .
Conclusion
Generating PDF ’s is quite easy with the right tools .
The PdfGenerator here is a bit limited , but it should serve as a good starting point for you to expand further or write your own tool for the job .
I also wrote a similar approach on generating PDFs using RE_Pdf , which supports some better features that are n’t available in Zend_Pdf , such as word - wrapping text .
There ’s also a PHP library called dompdf , which can be used to convert HTML into PDFs , which could serve as a basic PDF generation tool as well .
How often do you go to the supermarket ?
When you go , do you always stick to your list or do you buy whatever looks good ?
Studies show that almost half of shoppers go to the store three to four times per week and purchase about 54 % more than they originally planned .
[ 1 ]
In order to save more money and time , some savvy shoppers choose to go to the store only once per month .
To some this may seem extreme , but all it takes is careful planning , efficient shopping , and some storage space .
Why make four or more trips per month when you can make just one ?
If you plan ahead to make just one trip a month , your savings will shock you at the end of the year .

Economics has less to do with money than power .
Modern economics is not rocket science .
Modern economics is a fraud .
Metrics such as �monetary aggregates � and the �velocity of money � are merely devices meant to divert attention away from the fraud in progress .
Focusing on such metrics has been a critical component in the success of the bankers � extraordinary shell game of modern economics .
But the current crisis has not only interrupted the bankers � confidence game , it has shed unexpected light on the precarious positions of those fleeced
The producers , savers , entrepreneurs who had previously accepted the banker�s credit based money as legitimate are now discovering they were but suckers in an opaque and cleverly constructed street game , sic Wall Street�s , designed to defraud the unsuspecting and vulnerable onlookers and players .
The greatest casualty of today�s unfolding crisis is the belief that bankers are performing a needed function in today�s world .
It is true that in credit driven capital economies founded on debt - based money issued by central banks , bankers are essential .
In confidence games , con-men always play a critical role ; the banker�s shell game of modern economics is no exception .
Modern economics is a system whereby bankers inserted compounding credit with debt - based paper money into every aspect of commerce ; and are thus able to live like parasites partying off the productivity of others ( gotta love those billion dollar bonuses ! ) .
Only now is this becoming obvious ; for only when a confidence game breaks down , does the truth become clear .
AAA SUBPRIME COLLATERIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS
The bankers con game began to disintegrate when US sub prime collaterized debt obligations were given the highest AAA ratings by rating agencies , i.e. Moody�s , Standard & Poor , Fitch , etc. ; and , when the AAA rated securities began to default , investor confidence in the bankers � global con game began to default as well .
The rest is history �or soon will be .
The AAA rating granted to sub prime CDOs is the same rating that is given to AAA US government treasuries .
According to the rating agencies , the creditworthiness of US sub prime borrowers is no different than that accorded to the US government �and unfortunately the credit agencies are right .
The major holders of US treasuries �China , Japan , Russia , sovereign wealth funds , pension funds , insurance companies and investors �will soon discover is that the US is no more able to pay its $ 13 trillion of dollars of debt than sub prime borrowers can pay the $ 1.3 trillion dollars owed on sub prime mortgages .
AAA SUBPRIME US TREASURIES DEMOCRATS �THE TAX AND SPEND PARTY VERSUS REPUBLICANS �THE TAX LESS AND SPEND MORE PARTY
Just as deficit spending stimulates economic activity ; so do tax cuts ; and when the two are simultaneously applied , the effect is exponentially enhanced .
Unfortunately , so , too , are the consequences .
The combination of US deficit spending and tax cuts during the Bush presidency caused an extraordinary expansion of the US economy , an expansion that affected the global economy as well .
Unfortunately , the US expansion was based on consumer credit and now that credit has turned into unpayable debt , the US expansion is affecting the world negatively .
The growing US debt is the number one problem facing the world today .
The US , the issuer of the world reserve currency , the US dollar , is the world�s number one debtor and its borrowing needs have now reached the point of threatening global economic stability .
The growth of US deficit spending combined with tax cuts has transformed the US into a debtor unable to pay down debt without borrowing more .
According to Hyman Minsky�s Financial Instability Hypothesis , debtors finance debt by either by hedge , speculative , or Ponzi finance .
The US is now using Ponzi financing to do so .
Hedge financing units are those which can fulfill all of their contractual payment obligations by their cash flows �Speculative finance units are units that ... cannot repay the principle out of income cash flows .
Such units need to �roll over� their liabilities : e.g. issue new debt to meet commitments on maturing debt .
For Ponzi units , the cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fulfill either the repayment of principle of the interest due on outstanding debts by their cash flows from operations ...
A unit that Ponzi finances lowers the margin of safety that it offers the holders of its debts .
The Financial Instability Hypothesis by Hyman Minsky , Working Paper No. 74 , May 1992 : Only by rolling its debt forward and borrowing is the US still able to pay its debts �and its ability to do so has now worsened considerably ; and the recent growth in US loan guarantees has made US repayment of its debt even more questionable From the Washington Post , October 18 , 2008 � the budget deficit -- the annual difference between government spending and tax collections - .. jumped from $ 162 billion last year to $ 455 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September , largely because of the cost of the stimulus package , as well as slowing tax revenues and rising expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan � it 's not hard to imagine the deficit rising to $ 1 trillion .
The inability of the US to pay its debt has grave implications for those who loan the US the trillions of dollars the US borrows .
With the US debt levels growing even as the US economy weakens , creditors may choose to not loan the US the vast sums of money the US is now committed to spending , a sum Goldman Sachs estimates to be $ 2 trillion in 2009 alone .
The marketplace has already taken notice : LONDON , Sept 24 ( Reuters ) - The cost of insuring 10 - year U.S. government
debt against default rose to a record high on Wednesday as investors fretted
over the feasibility of the government 's $ 700 billion plan to contain the
financial crisis .
Credit default swaps on 10 - year Treasury debt expanded to 29.2 basis
points -- its widest ever -- from 26.5 basis points on Tuesday , according to
CMA , a specialized data provider .
CMA said CDS on five - year widened to 22.0 basis points from 20.5 basis
points .
( Reporting by Emelia Sithole - Matarise THE IMF AND THE US Because the US , the world�s lender of last resort , is itself bankrupt , the world economy is in danger of collapse .
The IMF has now been asked to bail out Iceland , Pakistan , Hungary and Ukraine .
The US may very well be the next IMF client .
What has happened this fall has eclipsed everything that has gone before .
What will happen next year will eclipse what is now happening this fall .
The crisis is growing as the end - game of capitalism approaches its end irrespective of what central banks try to do .
This time the bankers overstepped themselves in such a way they have brought destruction not only on society but on themselves as well .
It is only right that they should suffer too�as , after all , it is they who caused our problems .
It is unfortunate that society is being forced to lessen the burden on bankers even as bankers continue to indebt society .
But , then again , that�s what government is for �to act as the bankers � agents in the continuing indebting of nations , businesses , producers and savers .
Markets will only be free when the virus of bankers � debt - based paper money is permanently removed from commerce and the present tyranny of banker - controlled government is ended .

Since their discovery , stem cells have been hailed as the ultimate answer for crippling and incurable diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and other conditions that leave vital organs like heart or nerves damaged beyond repair .
Researchers from the University of Cambridge , under the leadership of Professor Austin Smith , Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research at the University of Cambridge , recently published a paper ( 1 ) detailing a new technology that can transform adult stem cells into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS ) .
This technique is able to reliably reprogram adult cells into iPS rapidly and can forego the need to rely on mammalian embryos to generate pluripotent stem cells .
Working with stem cells has proved a much greater challenge than foreseen , however , as both scientific and ethical challenges confront stem cell research from all sides .
Stem cells are tricky to work with and although they are indefinite , can stop dividing at any time .
The best stem cells are also the cells with the least amount of differentiation ( or development ) .
These cells occur during embryonic development and the harvesting of such cells results in the death of the rest of the embryo .
The resulting loss of the embryo is the cause of the ethical dilemmas concerning the usage of stem cells and the development of stem cell research .
Embryonic stem cells have a great deal of potential but the restrictions put in place for federally funded research projects have limited their use and the controversy over the ethical issues has consumed a great deal of time in the science community .
This ethical dilemma can be bypassed altogether if adult mammalian cells are reprogrammed to form iPS , which are cells almost identical to those from embryonic stem cells but which come from adult tissue instead of embryos , and the same results can be obtained .
Credit : University of Cambridge 's Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research .
The technique for reprogramming relies on the usage of a combination of chemical inhibitors provided by Stem Cell Sciences , a company providing commercial use of stem cells and stem cell technologies .
These chemical inhibitors , including use of enzymes MEK and GSK3 in combination with a cell growth promoter and leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) provide the key to transition fully differentiated adult cells into cells that are indistinguishable from authentic embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Stem Cell Sciences developed this Culticell iSTEM ™ media range to overcome the limitations in current approaches to producing reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells .
Smith and his team developed this key step in the successful complete transfer of adult cells into iPS using this specific combination of enzymes , inhibitors and cellular growth indicators .
" This proprietary technique greatly facilitates the simple , most reliable and efficient route to obtaining authentic induced pluripotent stem cells and will form the basis for the industrialization of iPS cell production , ” noted Dr. Tim Allsopp , Chief Scientific Officer of Stem Cell Sciences .
“ This is an important validation of the technology Professor Smith and his team have developed and Stem Cell Sciences is very pleased to be working with Cambridge University and Professor Smith 's team on this important breakthrough .
" Stem Cell Pathway : Smith 's research centers on the regulatory processes and machinery that govern self - renewal and lineage programming in stem cells .
This picture represents the transition from an undifferentiated embryonic cell to different tissue cells .
Credit : University of Cambridge .
This breakthrough of complete transformation follows on the heels of previous studies in which progression to iPS was limited and extremely inefficient .
This process has greatly improved both the success and efficiency rate making a reliable source to generate iPS without depending on embryonic cellsStem cells are unique because they have the potential to be any number of various cell types .
They are undifferentiated cells , and if at the earliest stage of development , they have the ability to create a completely new individual .
As such , they can be directed to make any number of useful tissues , including nervous tissue , heart tissue or a new liver .
Research with stem cells can help us develop procedures like gene therapy , testing drugs with lessened need for animal and human test subjects , genetic disorder correction and replacement of damaged tissues or organs .
The possibilities are endless , applications in real world situations limitless and now the technology to propel us into the future of stem cell applications is very real .

La candidate républicaine à la vice - présidence américaine , Sarah Palin , a été piégée samedi 1er novembre par un humoriste québecois , membre du duo " Les justiciers masqués " , qui l'a contactée au téléphone en se faisant passer pour le président français Nicolas Sarkozy .
La conversation d'environ six minutes doit être diffusée lundi par une radio de Montréal , mais l'enregistrement a été mis en ligne sur le site des humoristes .
On y entend Mme Palin se déclarer ravie du coup de téléphone de son interlocuteur qui lui parle avec un fort accent français .
" Nous avons beaucoup de respect pour vous , John McCain et moi , et nous vous aimons " , lui dit -elle , en soulignant son admiration pour son épouse Carla Bruni-Sarkozy .
Au cours de la conversation , la gouverneur de l'Alaska caresse le rêve de devenir présidente des Etats - Unis d'ici huit ans .
Elle ne semble pas tiquer lorsque le faux Sarkozy , qui la flatte sur ses connaissances en matière de relations internationales , donne des noms fantaisistes aux premiers ministres canadien et québécois .
L'humoriste complimente aussi Palin pour un récent film pornographique américain mettant en scène une actrice lui ressemblant , en feignant de croire qu'il s'agit d'un documentaire sur sa vie .
" Ah , bien . Merci " , répond Palin .
La conversation s'achève lorsque l'humoriste informe son interlocutrice qu'elle vient d'être victime d'un canular téléphonique .
Elle pousse alors un " Oh " surpris et une collaboratrice raccroche rapidement .
Les services de Palin ont rapidement reconnu avoir été piégés .
" La gouverneur Palin n'a été que modérément amusée en découvrant qu'elle avait rejoint les rangs des chefs d'Etat , y compris le président Sarkozy lui-même , et des célébrités visés par ces imposteurs " , a réagi une porte - parole dans une réponse par e-mail .

Did Conor McGregor open Pandora 's
Box by trying to defend his early attempts to line - up his 2020 season by outing a private message exchange with UFC president Dana White ?
It appears McGregor has upset a number of people , including White , when he posted a private message exchange with the UFC head honcho .
McGregor 's tweet included parts of the exchange that included him saying he would n't be a fill - in fighter for the planned Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Tony Ferguson bout , which had been slated for UFC 249 earlier this year .
McGregor 's post went on to show he had requested a headlining bout with Diego Sanchez .
It was a fight that White was critical of , saying that he could lose his promoter 's license if he made such a fight .

Dana
White calls Conor McGregor 's post ' one of the dirtiest things you can do '
The actions of his biggest – albeit retired – superstar set White off at the UFC 253 post - fight press conference on Saturday .
White responded to a question about McGregor 's tweet , saying , “ This is some man -code stuff .
It ’s just something you do n’t do .
It ’s one of the dirtiest things you can do . ” McGregor doubled down on his commitment to eventually facing Diego Sanchez at some point , even after Sanchez lost to Jake Matthews at UFC 253 on Saturday .
He also seemed like he might be taking another shot at the UFC , by including a mention addressing " some promoters , " although that was n't specifically stated .

Justin Gaethje defends Dana
White , shoots down Conor McGregor 's claimsLate Sunday , interim UFC lightweight champion Justin Gaethje and his manager Ali Abdelaziz stood behind White , making pointed comments at McGregor , asserting that he turned down potential fights .
Gaethje is currently slated to unify his interim lightweight title with champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 254 on Oct. 24 on Fight Island .
Gaethje had wanted to either fight McGregor or wait for a shot at the winner of Nurmagomedov vs. Ferguson at UFC 249 .
McGregor instead fought Donald " Cowboy " Cerrone in January .
Gaethje waited .
Nurmagomedov fell out of the fight at UFC 249 .
McGregor did not want to be a back - up plan for that bout , so White enlisted Gaethje to battle Ferguson for the interim title .
Gaethje won at UFC 249 in May and now faces Nurmagomedov for the belt .
Meanwhile , McGregor announced his retirement in June , but then tweeted in the past few days that his next bout would be a boxing match opposite Manny Pacquiao .
In defending White , Gaethje and Abdelaziz wrote off McGregor as any sort of potential contender .

By Daniel Henninger - October 16 , 2008
If John McCain fails in the next 19 days to catch Barack Obama , his slow response to the financial hurricane of 2008 will be Exhibit A .
The betting here is that when the McCain campaign 's black box is recovered it will show he lost altitude during the six days from Sept. 24 , when Sen. McCain suspended his campaign , to Sept. 29 , when the House GOP defeated the first Paulson Plan to rescue the American financial system .
Neither Mr. McCain nor the GOP is likely to recover before Nov. 4 from those six dramatic days , when they did little to deal with Hurricane Fannie 's Category 50 financial crisis .
It has been said , fairly , that the Bush presidency began its fall from favor with the American people during Hurricane Katrina .
The first day that Katrina rolled over New Orleans , the federal government did nothing ; and for several days , did little more .
The Bush government 's eventual mobilization on the victims ' behalf earned the president no credit .
He did not recover from those first days of minimal participation in a massive crisis .
Call it Katrina Dysfunction Syndrome .
The McCain camp should have seen the symptoms .
On Wednesday Sept. 24 , Mr. McCain announced he was suspending his presidential campaign to return to Washington , likening the financial crisis to 9/11 .
Newt Gingrich praised the decision as akin to candidate Dwight Eisenhower 's dramatic " I will go to Korea " speech in October 1952 .
Arriving in Washington , Gen. McCain quickly discovered that his troops in the Republican Congress were in disarray .
Congressional Republicans had n't really been led by anyone for at least a year .
It was no surprise that the Paulson Plan , which indeed was controversial , broke the GOP into factions .
History in its wisdom may record who made the right and wrong calls through this period of financial ruin .
But make no mistake :
The infighting over the Paulson Plan among conservatives -- always looking for an excuse to bolt the McCain candidacy -- neutralized Mr. McCain at the exact moment that the U.S. electorate was focusing like a laser on the crisis .
The need for immediate action was manifest and undeniable .
On Wednesday Sept. 17 , formerly rock - solid money - market funds began to collapse .
Citing " market - wide liquidity issues , " a big Putnam fund announced it would distribute its assets to customers .
Other funds came under similar pressure .
That Thursday , the U.S. credit system , the economy 's most essential mechanism , began to lock up .
A Journal headline Friday morning Sept. 19 read : " U.S. Drafts Sweeping Plan to Fight Crisis as Turmoil Worsens in Credit Markets . "
That weekend , Goldman and Morgan Stanley abandoned their status as investment banks .
The next Thursday , the day after Mr. McCain 's dramatic announcement , the government seized Washington Mutual Bank and sold it to J.P. Morgan , the " largest failure in U.S. banking history . "
That weekend , a run began at giant Wachovia bank .
The U.S. 's financial levees had been breached .
The foundation of its daily lending superstructure was being undermined .
Amid all this , on Monday Sept. 29 , House Republicans voted to defeat the rescue plan .
Many of the GOP 's concerns were legitimate , notably the difficulty of later scaling back the abrupt expansion of federal power .
They did kill the Frank - Dodd slush fund for Acorn - like housing lobbies .
In no sense , though , was this a normal legislative exercise , with the luxury of time to debate a federalized prescription drug benefit or a Supreme Court nomination .
Flames were shooting out of the upper floors of the U.S. financial system .
Elected officials simply cannot announce that because of flaws in a planned rescue effort , they refuse to participate in the bucket brigade .
To a voter in Lorain , Ohio , this looked like an abdication .
Conventional wisdom holds that John McCain damaged himself by arriving in Washington without anything to contribute .
True .
It is also true , however , that the dug - in GOP opposition froze McCain between the party 's divided factions and their followers .
Obama could simply watch ; all eyes were on his opponent .
Over that span , the terrified stock market cratered , wiping out individual voter wealth .
Four very long days elapsed before Congress approved the plan , but as with Katrina , voters will only remember the days when the GOP did n't act .
The last thing the McCain campaign needed ( or Republicans in close races , such as Sen. Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina ) was to be seen by the American people heading for the locker room at crunch time with disaffected House Members .
The Real Clear Politics national poll average in the Sept. 22 - 24 period had McCain a mere three points behind Obama , who was at 48 % -- a statistical dead heat .
In the week since the congressional in - fighting , Sen .
Obama 's numbers have drifted above 50 % for the first time , and Sen. McCain 's have drifted downward .
In politics , the Katrina catastrophe principle -- do something ! -- trumps everything .
Republicans occupying or vying for the presidency have now violated it twice .
Live and learn .
The attackers were heavily armed with guns and grenades Investigators in the Indian city of Mumbai are beginning to piece together how gunmen carried out Wednesday 's series of deadly attacks .
The exact sequence of events remains unclear , but security personnel are establishing a picture of how the operation was planned and executed .
All the signs , officials say , point to a well - planned action carried out by a highly trained , determined group .
The men appeared to have surveyed their targets in advance and were well - versed in the use of weapons and explosives , a Indian commando said .
Their intention , he said , was " to create and spread terror " .
Investigators believe that a large group of men arrived in Mumbai from the sea around 2100 local time .
They believe that a larger ship - possibly a hijacked vessel , possibly an accomplice ship - brought them close to the shore before they switched to smaller dinghies .
Once ashore , they split into two- , three - and four - man groups to attack pre-selected targets .
Several of the attackers were caught on CCTV .
Footage showed mainly young men , carrying automatic weapons and large rucksacks .
Officials said the rucksacks contained grenades , extra ammunition , plastic explosives and food supplies .
Multiple attacks Reports suggest the attacks happened within minutes of each other .
By using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere
Unidentified commando in Mumbai
One of the first targets was the Chhatrapati Shivaji railway station , where at least two men fired automatic weapons and threw grenades at crowds of people waiting in the main hall .
A second group opened fire at Café Leopold , a popular restaurant , while a third seized Nariman House , a business complex housing a Jewish outreach centre , taking several people hostage .
A fourth group - or , some reports say , the same one that attacked the station nearby - struck the Cama and Albless hospital for women and children .
A number of drive - by shootings were also reported across the city .
By around 2200 local time gun fire was being reported at two of the city 's luxury hotels - the Oberoi - Trident and the Taj Mahal Palace .
Hundreds of troops have been deployed to sites around Mumbai Some guests managed to escape what they described as indiscriminate fire , while others sheltered in their rooms .
Others were shot - exactly how many remains unclear .
The gunmen were looking for Americans and Britons , guests trapped at the hotels said , and hostages were taken in both locations .
Gunfire and small blasts continued to be heard at both hotels over the next several hours , as Indian troops surrounded the buildings .
Fires broke out in both hotels .
' Trained somewhere '
In the early hours of Thursday , commando teams entered both hotels to try to find the gunmen .
Attackers at the Taj Mahal appeared familiar with the layout and moved continually around the building , firing their weapons .
They definitely appeared to have been trained , the commando said .
" Not everybody can fire the AK series of weapons , not everybody can throw grenades like that , " he said .
" By using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere . "
The commandos went through the hotels floor by floor and room by room to flush out the attackers and free trapped guests and staff .
Reports that particular locations had been made safe were several times followed by fresh bursts of gunfire and explosions , and the crisis entered a third day .
By Friday afternoon ( local time ) , Indian security forces said that they had control of the Oberoi .
Multiple bodies had been found , they said .
Later that night , troops regained control of Nariman House .
The bodies of five hostages were found inside .
In the early hours of Saturday , soldiers launched a renewed assault on the Taj Mahal Palace hotel .
By mid-morning , they said that three gunmen were dead and they believed the siege was over - although room - to - room checks were necessary to confirm this .

The researchers , Falk Leichsenring of the University of Giessen and Sven Rabung of the University Medical Center Hamburg - Eppendorf , both in Germany , reviewed only those studies in which the therapy had been frequent  more than once a week in many cases  and had lasted at least a year or , alternatively , had been 50 sessions long .
Further , the studies had to have followed patients closely , using strict definitions of improvement .
The investigators examined studies that tracked patients with a variety of mental problems , among them severe depression , anorexia nervosa and borderline personality disorder , which is characterized by a fear of abandonment and dark squalls of despair and neediness .
Psychodynamic therapy , Dr. Leichsenring wrote in an e-mail message , “ showed significant , large and stable treatment effects which even significantly increased between the end of treatment and follow - up assessment . ”
The review found no correlation between patients ’ improvement and the length of treatment .
But improve they did , and psychiatrists said it was clear that patients with severe , chronic emotional problems benefited from the steady , frequent , close attention that psychoanalysts provide .
“ If you define borderline personality broadly as an inability to regulate emotions , it characterizes a lot of people who show up in clinics , whether their given diagnosis is depression , pediatric bipolar or substance abuse , ” said Dr. Andrew J. Gerber , a psychiatrist at Columbia .
For some of those patients , Dr. Gerber said , “ this paper suggests that you ’ve got to get into longer - term therapy to make improvements last . ”
Some psychoanalysts were more surprised by where the paper appeared than by its results : most review papers in major medical journals have hundreds of studies to draw on , or certainly far more than 23 .
The new review is encouraging , they said , but also a reminder of how much more study needs to be done .
Dr. Barbara L. Milrod , a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College , who like Dr. Gerber is a clinical practitioner of psychodynamic therapy , said further research was crucial as a matter of survival for a valuable treatment .
“ Let ’s be real , ” Dr. Milrod said .
“ Major medical centers have been shutting down psychodynamic training programs because there is n’t an adequate evidence base . ”
Scroll for updates … Is ABC doing some West Coast whitewashing ?
… Wow , Even the LA Times sees Gibson ’s distortion …
Charlie Gibson had a chance to show that he could be fair , balanced , and P.D.S. - free with Sarah Palin ’s first major MSM interview .
Looks like he blew it .
Taking quotes out of context .
Getting basic facts wrong .
Engaging in distortionary hype .
And the reason we should watch the rest of this hatchet job is … what exactly ?
Also :
Guess this is good preparation for the kind of neutral , objective questions we ’ll get during the debates .
***
Interview excerpts here .
This is how Yahoo !
News is promoting the interview :
GIBSON : You said recently , in your old church , “ Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God . ”
Are we fighting a holy war ?
PALIN : You know , I do n’t know if that was my exact quote .
GIBSON : Exact words .
PALIN : But the reference there is a repeat of Abraham Lincoln ’s words when he said — first , he suggested never presume to know what God ’s will is , and I would never presume to know God ’s will or to speak God ’s words .
But what Abraham Lincoln had said , and that ’s a repeat in my comments , was let us not pray that God is on our side in a war or any other time , but let us pray that we are on God ’s side .
That ’s what that comment was all about , Charlie .
GIBSON : I take your point about Lincoln ’s words , but you went on and said , “ There is a plan and it is God ’s plan . ”
What she actually said :
“ Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right .
Also , for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending [ U.S. soldiers ] out on a task that is from God , ” she exhorted the congregants .
“ That ’s what we have to make sure that we ’re praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is God ’s plan . ”
Allahpundit rips Gibson :
Totally untrue , but that ’s what he gets for relying on the Associated Press , which took the liberty of bowdlerizing her quote mid-sentence in order to make it fit the narrative they were trying to build of her as some fundie who thinks she can read God ’s mind .
Here ’s my post on the subject from last Thursday .
Read it and see just how egregious the distortion here is .
More :
What ’s missing from the AP ’s version ?
Right — the beginning of what she said , the part that makes clear she ’s not asserting that we ’re doing God ’s will but simply praying that we are .
It ’s the difference between me saying “ McCain will win ” and “ I pray McCain will win . ”
The first is an assertion of fact / secret knowledge , the second is an expression of desire / hope .
The AP actually stoops to picking up the quote mid-sentence to make it better fit the stereotype of the holy - roller yokel claiming divine inspiration for Bush ’s Crusade .
Will Gibson acknowledge this egregious distortion ?
***
More reax …
Kathryn Lopez : “ Or was Charlie Gibson just condescendingly explaining the world to Sarah Palin ? ”
ORDER IT NOW
Commenter MNgirl : “ I just finished watching both ABC News and I was okay with it for the first 5 minutes but when Gibson looked down his little nose at her disapprovingly and said ‘ Why do n’t you tell me what you think the Bush doctrine is …… ’he lost me .
This one is going to backfire on the media once again .
He blew it , women hate being patronized and women watching that are only going to see him trying play “ gotcha ” with Palin and her fan club is going to grow .
What a jerk .
He gets a gift handed to him and the most he can do is patronize her and try to trick her .
Idiot . ”
Commenter jencab : “ This is a lame interview .
Charlie belittled her , chopped up her answers , seems repulsed , and sighed .
What the hell is that ?
I never seen him like this with any other politician .
Unbelievable . ”

DIG INTO CAMPAIGN DOLLARS DIG INTO CAMPAIGN DOLLARS USA TODAY 's interactive campaign finance tracker lets you examine and filter donations by state , date , amount and sector .
WASHINGTON  Despite attracting millions of new contributors to his campaign , President - elect Barack Obama received about the same percentage of his total political funds from small donors as President Bush did in 2004 , according to a study released today by the non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute .
The analysis undercuts Obama 's claim that his supporters " changed the way campaigns are funded " by reducing the influence of special - interest givers .
" The myth is that money from small donors dominated Barack Obama 's finances , " said Michael Malbin , the institute 's executive director .
" The reality of Obama 's fundraising was impressive , but the reality does not match the myth . "
About $ 156 million , or a quarter of Obama 's record - shattering campaign account , came from donors of $ 200 or less , according to the institute 's analysis of federal election reports through Oct. 15 .
That compares with $ 205 million , or about a third , from those who gave between $ 2,300 and $ 4,600 , the maximum allowed by law .
Forty - eight percent of Obama 's total take came from donors of $ 1,000 or more , compared with 56 % for John Kerry and 60 % for both Bush and John McCain , the analysis found .
The small - donor percentage is lower than figures previously reported in news stories because the institute 's analysis accounted for people who gave several small donations over the course of the election that added up to a larger sum , Malbin said .
Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said in an e-mail that the campaign had more than 3.95 million donors , and " 91 % of our contributions were in amounts of $ 100 or less .
…
There 's no doubt that small - dollar contributors played a critical and unprecedented role " in Obama 's victory .
The study said Obama brought in a total $ 638 million , the most ever raised in a political campaign , compared with $ 206 million by McCain , who accepted $ 84.1 million in taxpayer financing for the general election .
Obama reported 580,000 donors who gave more than $ 200 .
Donors giving $ 200 or less need not be disclosed , but the difference between the number of donors provided by the Obama campaign and the number reported in federal election records shows there were about 3.4 million of them .
McCain reported 170,000 donors of $ 200 or more .
Obama opted out of public financing , raising private money through November and significantly outspending McCain in battleground states .
When Obama announced in June that he would forgo public financing , he told supporters in a video message that " instead of forcing us to rely on millions from Washington lobbyists and special - interest PACs , you 've fueled this campaign with donations of $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , whatever you can afford . …
You 've already changed the way campaigns are funded , because you know that 's the only way we can truly change how Washington works . "
Meredith McGehee , a campaign - finance reform advocate at the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center , said Obama cannot claim " this election somehow created an alternative system for public finance . …
The data does n't show that . "
Obama did not accept contributions from political action committees or registered federal lobbyists , but many of his top fundraisers have keen economic interests in federal policies .

Is America the new Japan ?
Or more precisely , Japan circa 1990 , just as it was staggering into its Lost Decade .
As recently as six months ago , the notion that the United States would face a decade or more of Japanese - style economic malaise seemed preposterous .
But after the last few weeks of financial turmoil and political ineptitude , you could almost argue that America would be fortunate to end up with a downturn akin to Japan’s .
That ’s because in several key ways , Japan was much better equipped to withstand its financial lashing in the 1990s than Americans are today .
A little history : During the post - World - War - II era , the Japanese economy often lived up to its Homeric epithet : the Miracle Economy .
It rose from the ruins of the war to become the world ’s second - largest economy .
By the mid-1980s , America and Japan accounted for a staggering 40 percent of the global economy .
Picture Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone belting out “ We Are the World ” in some fancy karaoke bar in the Ginza .
Then , in 1986 , Japan shifted into overdrive .
It was a time of super - easy credit , frenzied financial speculation , and blistering industrial expansion .
During the second half of the 1980s , the Tokyo Stock Exchange ’s compass seemed permanently stuck on north .
Between 1986 and 1991 , Japan had expanded by roughly the equivalent of France ’s gross domestic product , then $ 956 billion .
Japan was also outshining the United States , whose consumers bought most of its products and whose military provided its protection .
In fact , its rise seemed to coincide with America ’s slide .
The United States appeared to be a spent power , done in by imperial overreach , as Paul Kennedy put it .
Anything we could do , Japan could do better .
We made Pintos ; they made Accords .
We made “ Ishtar ” ; they made Walkmans .
But mostly we made things like greenmail and leveraged buyouts and they made , well , a lot of stuff  widgets the world loved .
Chris Matthews just gave Rep. Michelle Bachmann , R - Outer Wingnuttia , all the rope she wanted yesterday on Hardball , and boy did she make a handy little noose with it .
First Matthews tried to get Bachmann to tell his audience , per Sarah Palin 's homage to " pro-American places , " what parts of America are anti-American .
She danced around the question and kept harking on the talking points programmed into her playback .
So then he tried another tack :
Matthews : How many Congresspeople , members of Congress are in that anti-American crowd you describe ?
Bachmann : [ Deer in the headlights ]
Matthews : How many Congresspeople you serve with -- I mean , there 's 435 members of Congress -- Bachmann : -- well right now -- Matthews : -- how many are anti-American in that Congress right now that you serve with ?
Bachmann :
You'd have to ask them , Chris , I 'm focusing on Barack Obama and the people he 's been associated with -- Matthews :
But do you suspect that a lot of the people you serve with -- Bachmann : -- and I 'm very worried about their anti-American nature .
Matthews : Well , he 's the United States Senator from Illinois , he 's one of the people you suspect as being anti-American .
How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American ?
You 've already suspected Barack Obama .
Is he alone , or are there others ?
Bachmann : [ Deer in the headlights ]
Matthews :
How many do you suspect of your colleagues do you suspect of being anti-American ?
Bachmann : I would say , what I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look -- I wish they would .
I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think the people would love to see an expose like that .
Right after the break , Katrina Vandenheuvel said precisely what needed to be said -- and with more passion than I 've ever witnessed from her on TV :
Chris , I fear for my country .
I think what we just heard is a congresswoman channeling Joe McCarthy , channeling a politics of fear and loathing and demonization and division and distraction .
Not a single issue mentioned .
This is a politics at a moment of extreme economic pain in this country that is incendiary , that is so debased , that I 'm almost having a hard time breathing , because I think it 's very scary .
Because this is a country I love , and this woman had no sense of the history of this nation , which is one of struggle , of trying to fulfill the great ideals of this nation , of movements that have brought about the civilizing advances of this country , and she does n't even know who Saul Alinsky is -- a community organizer who channeled the views of the people from below .
I think Barack Obama is going to win , and he 's going to have a lot of work because there is an extremism unleashed in this nation which you just heard on this program , which could lead to violence , and hatred , and toxicity .
And against the backdrop of the Great Depression we 're living through , it could lead -- and I do n't use this word lightly -- to a kind of American fascism , which is against the great values of this nation , and which people like that are fomenting .
Even Pat Buchanan was shaking his head , grimly acknowledging that he doubted that any member of Congress could be called anti-American .
Of course , Buchanan himself is no slouch when it comes to eliminationist rhetoric .
But this was stark and clear and unmistakable .
There 's already a site up urging members of Congress to Censure Bachmann for these remarks .
Go lend your voice .
UPDATE : Or you can comment on her Facebook Wall .
ActBlue candidate Elwyn Tinklenberg is running against Bachmann in a close race .
Your support could make the difference .
Don Siegelman 's case is exploding .
Here 's a partial transcript of Thom Hartmann 's interview with Don earlier today ( and , below that , AP 's article on US Attorney Leura Canary 's close involvement in his case , even after she " recused " herself ) .
Let 's remember , BTW , that Bush / Rove 's long crusade against Don Siegelman began with the theft of his re-election in 2002 , as Don himself has said ( and yet the media has all along refused to talk about it ) .
Those of you who are interested in that may find two essays on Don 's stolen re-election in Loser Take All - - one , on the political context of the theft , by Larisa Alexandrovna , the other , on the method used to steal the votes in Baldwin County , by James Gundlach .

Don Siegelman
Butch Dill / AP
Don Siegelman is talking to Thom Hartmann right now , about the Department of Justice 's cover - up / misconduct in his 2006 legal case / conviction .
Liveblogging ( please excuse the half - sentences ) :
Don :
There are new revelations that DoJ was involved in a cover -up of the unethical and seemingly criminal activity going on in the Alabama 's U.S. Attorney matters .
A juror had romantic fantasies of the FBI sitting at the U.S. Attorney 's desk at the trial ... it was n't disclosed , whether there were personal contacts ( she did have contact with the U.S. Marshall ) ... the DoJ finds out and they cover it up !
Conyers says the evidence raises " serious questions " about the U.S. Attorney in the Siegelman case , who , documents show , continued to involve herself in the politically charged prosecution long after she had publicly withdrawn to avoid an alleged conflict of interest relating to her husband , a top GOP operative and close associate of Bush adviser Karl Rove .
Conyers ' letter also cites evidence of numerous contacts between jurors and members of the Siegelman prosecution team that were never disclosed to the trial judge or defense counsel .
Recused US attorney
discussed Siegelman case
11/14/2008 , 3:23 p.m. ET
By BEN EVANS
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON ( AP ) - A U.S. attorney who recused herself from the corruption case against former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman because of potential political conflicts still closely monitored the case and communicated with prosecutors about it , according to information from a whistleblower .
The allegations that U.S. Attorney Leura Canary did n't completely stay out of the politically charged prosecution were detailed in a letter from House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers to Attorney General Michael Mukasey last week .
Siegelman - a Democrat - has alleged his prosecution was pushed by Republicans , including former White House adviser Karl Rove , a Texas strategist who was once heavily involved in Alabama politics .
Canary recused herself from the case because her husband is a longtime Republican strategist with strong ties to Siegelman 's political foes , including Rove and Republican Gov. Bob Riley .
She has consistently maintained that career lawyers handled the prosecution and that she obeyed a strict " firewall . "
Siegelman , who served one term as governor before losing to Riley in 2002 amid allegations of corruption , was convicted in 2006 on bribery and other charges .
He was sentenced to more than seven years in prison but released earlier this year when a federal appeals court ruled his appeal raised " substantial questions . "
Conyers cites one e-mail in which Canary forwarded prosecutors a letter from Siegelman to his supporters .
" Ya'll need to read because he refers to a ' survey ' which allegedly shows that 67 percent of Alabamians believe the investigation of him to be politically motivated , " she wrote .
" Perhaps grounds not to let him discuss court activities in the media ? "
The whistleblower , a legal aide in Canary 's office named Tamarah Grimes , also is quoted as saying Canary " kept up with every detail of the case . "
Canary 's office referred calls Friday to the Justice Department .
Justice spokesman Peter Carr said the agency would review the letter .
The agency is investigating Siegelman 's case and others in response to allegations of selective prosecution under the Bush administration .
According to Conyers , Grimes reported her allegations in a complaint filed with the Justice Department last year .
The complaint also cites what Grimes believed to be inappropriate contact between the prosecution team and jurors .
It includes e-mails in which a lead prosecutor says " a couple " of jurors were romantically interested in an FBI agent who worked closely on the case .
Jurors passed notes through U.S. Marshals asking whether the agent was married .
In his letter , Conyers , D - Mich . , noted that there are strict rules against even innocuous contacts with jurors and said the risk of juror bias was obvious .
Siegelman attorney Vince Kilborn said he was " appalled " by the new information , particularly because juror conduct is a key issue in the appeal .
" This is going to seriously undermine the government 's credibility , " Kilborn said .
But he called it " frustrating " that the information became available so late .
Oral arguments are scheduled before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Dec. 9 , and attorneys already have filed their briefs .
Prosecutors charged Siegelman with accepting and concealing a $ 500,000 contribution from former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy for the governor 's campaign to start a state education lottery .
In return , prosecutors said , Siegelman appointed Scrushy to a regulatory board .
Last year , a former Republican campaign volunteer from Alabama told congressional attorneys that she overheard conversations suggesting that Rove pressed Justice to prosecute and that Canary 's husband , Bill , suggested his wife would take care of Siegelman .
The prosecutors who handled Siegelman 's case have insisted that politics played no role , emphasizing that the former governor was convicted by a jury .
Nvidia dropped by today to demo some of the awesome things that the GeForce 9400 M in the new MacBooks can do that Intel 's integrated graphics just can't touch , and to discuss a few technical points .
Besides confirming that you 'll see it in other notebooks soon , they definitively answered some lingering questions about the chip 's capabilities :
It can support up to 8 GB of RAM .
It can do on - the - fly GPU switching .
And it can work together with the MacBook Pro 's discrete 9600M GT .
But it does n't do any of those things .
Yet .

Since the hardware is capable of all of these things , it means that they can all be enabled by a software / firmware / driver update .
Whether or not that happens is entirely up to Apple .
While you can argue that Hybrid SLI — using both GPUs at once — has a limited , balls - to - the - wall utility , being able to switch between the integrated 9400 M and discrete 9600M GT on the fly without logging out would obviously be enormously easier than the current setup , and allow for some more creative automatic energy preferences — discrete when plugged in , integrated on battery .
Hell , you can do it in Windows on some machines .

But since it 's Apple it 's also entirely possible we 'll never see any of this to come to pass — GPU - accelerated video decoding has totally been possible with the 8600M GT in the previous - gen MacBook Pros , and well , you know where that stands .

Self - publicist , Andrew Keen , reckons open source will be hit hard during the coming recession .
He 's wrong .
Open source will flourish .
What Andrew Keen lacks in rigour , he makes up in attention grabbing headlines .
Economy to Give Open - Source a Good Thumping is not really about open source , but about how business models that depend on giving away free content are unsustainable .
But the headline and Keen 's economic illiteracy make it worth my while taking a pop at his article .
He makes some huge blunders :
Mass unemployment and a deep economic recession comprise the most effective antidote to the utopian ideals of open - source radicals .
Open source is , at least for me , not about utopian ideals , but having control over my computers and my data .
So how will today 's brutal economic climate change the Web 2.0 " free " economy ?
It will result in the rise of online media businesses that reward their contributors with cash ; it will mean the success of Knol over Wikipedia , Mahalo over Google ( Nasdaq : GOOG ) , TheAtlantic.com over the HuffingtonPost.com , iTunes over MySpace , Hulu over YouTube Inc. , Playboy.com over Voyeurweb.com , TechCrunch over the blogosphere , CNN 's professional journalism over CNN's iReporter citizen - journalism ...
The hungry and cold unemployed masses are n't going to continue giving away their intellectual labor on the Internet in the speculative hope that they might get some " back end " revenue .
" Free " does n't fill anyone 's belly ; it does n't warm anyone up .
The economic illiteracy of this is staggering for someone who thinks he can opine on the future of the economy .
Now , Keen , listen up .
It works like this .
During a recession , more people are unemployed .
This means the cost of labour declines .
It means more people will be willing to work for less .
But there 's more .
Because of minimum wage laws and the way that people value their work is fixed , people do n't accept jobs below a certain level on salary .
This market inflexibility means people end up sitting at home .
Some may twiddle their thumbs , others will spend time ( in between spamming companies with their CVs ) creating content for media sites or contributing to open source projects .
Hence , during a recession the quantity and quality of work on open source projects is likely to increase .
I have n't read Keen 's book .
And if the mixed - up thinking in his blog entry is any guide to it , I certainly wo n't be .

Not getting enough politics ?
You 're not alone .
Who has ?
Thankfully tonight at 8 p.m. ( EDT ) Barack Obama will be on every TV channel there is .
And for a full 30 minutes .
Obama 's infomercial
Tonight 's the night Barack Obama goes the way of Richard Simmons , Matthew Lesko , and Miss Cleo .
He 's doing an infomercial .
Actually , he wo n't be everywhere .
It may seem like it .
He 's bought up the 8 - 8:30 p.m. time slot on CBS , NBC , FOX , and the Spanish speaking network Univision .
It would be easy to make some lame McCain 's - out - of - money joke like : to counterprogram Obama 's monstrous network TV grab , John McCain will run a 30 - second ad on an AM polka radio station in Zanesville , Ohio .
But that would be immature .
No ABC ?
Obama 's infomercial is not on ABC because apparently when the original deal was being put together the network did n't want to move its TV show " Pushing Daisies . "
This show is about a piemaker gifted with the mysterious ability to bring dead things back to life .
Perhaps the McCain campaign should appear on this show .
McCain ad
Actually , the Republican nominee has launched a TV ad that , will be seen by no one cause they 're out of money according to the McCain people , will alert voters to what Obama wo n't be discussing tonight .
It 's kind of the inside scoop .
The tell - all .
We attached the commercial below .
World Series delay ?
And you have to credit the McCain campaign team .
Trying to press a hot button , in announcing their new ad they claim that Obama 's infomerical is " delaying the World Series . "
McCain himself jumped on that yesterday stating , " No one will delay the World Series game with an infomercial when I 'm president . "
It 's America 's pastime .
How could an INFOMERCIAL preempt the World Series ?
With all the back and forth about anti-American views , preempting the World Series in the minds of some could be borderline .
No delay
Actually , it is n't getting delayed .
Ben Smith over at Politico cleared that up yesterday .
He spoke to the Fox account executive who is now rich set up the deal .
" Our first pitch for the world series is usually around 8:30 anyway – so we did n’t push back the game , it was really just about suspending the pre-game -- you know , Joe Buck , " said the account executive , Joe Coppola .
" That ’s all we did . "
Oh .
Preempting Joe Buck .
That 's actually an improvement .
If the Rays win tonight , perhaps they can give Obama 30 minutes on the house to preempt him again on Friday .
Just sayin' .
McCain ad
Back to the McCain ad : The campaign press release tells us that " Barack Obama will not tell Americans how his proposals to increase spending and increase taxes will only further hurt our economy .
With crises at home and abroad , Barack Obama does not have the experience America needs , and we cannot afford inexperienced leadership at this time . "
They say his ad will be run on national broadcast channels .
Obama 's message
What will Obama be talking about tonight anyway ?
ABC 's George Stephanopolous spoke to some people who know some people who know other people who say Obama will lead off the show and conclude the program discussing his agenda .
What 's in between ?
" However the rest of the time you might see other people , like a Warren Buffett or a Colin Powell , and other people the Obama campaign calls ' validators ' to give testimony on why Americans should vote for Obama , " writes Stephanopolous .
I talk to India four or five times a day .
Unfortunately , I am not trying to halt nuclear proliferation or negotiate a Kashmir settlement .
I am attempting to achieve far more difficult goals – making airline reservations , questioning a credit card charge , and , most daunting of all , begging to restore an Internet connection .
As in so many international negotiations , what we have here is “ a failure to communicate . ”
Basically , I ca n’t understand what they ’re saying , while they are equally baffled by my English language skills .
( By the way , a hint to outsourcing companies : Telling your Asian subcontinental employees to identify themselves as “ Kenny ” or “ Billy ” or “ Butchie ” simply does n’t work .
Just as calling myself Prabha or Mahatma will not trick anyone into asking for my chicken tikka recipe . )
As a result of these daily miscommunicatons , I have booked tickets to Altoona rather than Atlanta , found out that the charge for a case of tongue depressors was justified , and learned that my Internet account either a ) never existed b ) was canceled four weeks ago or c ) is working perfectly .
And yet I continue my daily phone calls , speaking to all those unfailingly polite people who have no idea what I ’m saying – and vice versa .
“ BUTCHIE : ” “ So , your account is T - Joe - 44 . ”
ME : “ Did you say B ? ”
BUTCHIE : “ No , G . ”
ME : “ Yes , C . ”
BUTCHIE : “ Of course .
Just a moment , please . ”
Pause .
More pause .
BUTCHIE : “ I am so sorry for the delay .
May I have your father ’s middle name ? ”
ME : “ Yes , it is Jack . ”
BUTCHIE : “ No . ”
ME : “ No ? ”
BUTCHIE : “ Yes , it is no , not Mack . ”
ME : “ No , it is not Zack , yes it is Jack . ”
BUTCHIE : “ Of course , still , it is not the correct name for account P - Doe - 34 . ”
Pause .
More pause .
BUTCHIE : “ Do I hear tears ? ”
ME : “ You hear tears . ”
BUTCHIE : “ Oh , good .
I am relieved . ”
ME : “ You are ? ”
BUTCHIE : “ Beers are better than tears , Although I do not drink ... ”
ME : “ I drink . ”
BUTCHIE : “ In that case I recommend a deodorant ... ”
Now , call me chicken .
Call me anything you want .
But after days of conversations like this , I realize that screams , threats , and curses do n’t do any good .
They merely result in a repeat of the same answers that made no sense to any of my questions that made no sense to Kevin or Butchie or Billy Joe .
That is why I have found it is much better to change my father ’s middle name to Mack , fly to Altoona and then find my way to Atlanta , come up with a use for 10,000 tongue depressors , and accept an Internet connection that provides me with more hiccups than a Hungarian dinner .
I have , however , established a close relationship with Butchie , even though he tells me my chicken tikka recipe is more Broadway than Bombay .
Or did he say “ Beltway ? ” Does n’t matter .
We understand each other .
I think .

The luxury world of the couture is an interesting place .
People are always on the search for the newest , most shocking art or fashion to impress their other rich friends .
The culinary world is no exception .
While there are still people who love their lobster and fillet mignon , many modern chefs like to experiment with the newest and craziest ingredients , while others like to reach back deep into the past - say , the middle ages - for inspiration .
As a result , there are some gourmet foods that are just too out there for the average man and woman to even begin to comprehend .
I invite you , my friends , to travel this weird world with me , the strange land of the couture gourmets .
10 . Ortolan
Eating a roasted bird is n't really that crazy , but the process leading up to the roasting of Ortolan birds has actually caused France to declare it illegal for humane reasons .
Ortolan birds are nocturnal , sparrow - like birds .
To prepare them for cooking , the live birds are trapped in a dark box .
The darkness messes with their eating schedule and causes them to continually eat until they are about two to three times their original size .
After a proper level of obesity has occurred , the birds are drowned in brandy or other liquor and then , finally , roasted .
Funny how a country that defends fois gras even finds this practice too barbaric .
If tortured animals make yummier meals , than this little guy must be quite a treat .

9. Canard à la Rouennaise ( Duck in Blood Sauce )
Have you ever ate a duck and thought , “ I could get so much more out of those bones and guts ? ”
If so , Canard à la Rouennaise is right up your alley .
Basically , the recipe takes a nice roast duck , then places the carcass in a press and crushes the juice out of everything left over .
The result is a very bloody , very rich “ sauce ” that can cost around $ 1000 a plate .
While the presentation may be quite interesting , as they crush the duck right at your table , I just can't understand paying that much for some blood .
I know a lot of people love marrow , but is n't this just too crazy ?

8. Huitlacoche ( Corn Fungus )
Corn smut is a fungus that destroys corn crops .
Like many indigenous people , early villagers decided to make the most out of a bad situation and ate the fungus that took over their crop .
Nowadays , the smut is considered to be quite a delicacy and sometimes costs more than corn itself .
This is the only thing on this list I have actually ate , of course , that 's probably because I do n't have the money to be a real gourmet foodie .
Surprisingly , it 's very delicious if you get it from a good restaurant - preferably one actually in Mexico .
It 's similar to mushrooms and quite has a nice aroma .

7. Durian
Many people claim durian is quite good .
The smell however , is one of the worst things on Earth .
It is said that you can smell the durian fruit stands from all the way down the street .
Some hotels and airports refuse to let people bring the fruit inside for fear that it will chase away their customers .
While many people hate the fruit - smell is closely associated with taste after all , many people are quite passionate about their love of durian .
The fruit is said to be strongly flavored and savory , with a custard - like texture .
Anthony Bordain may have described it the best when he said , " its taste can only be described as ... indescribable , something you will either love or despise .
... Your breath will smell as if you 'd been French - kissing your dead grandmother . "

6. Live Baby Octopus
[ YouTube Link ]
Here 's a food that would n't be so strange if it was served in any other manner .
Even other foods eaten alive , like shrimp are n't that strange , the main thing here is the whole life - threatening thing .
Live octopi can choke you with their moving tentacles .
It 's a real - life kill or be killed situation .
Dipping your dinner in alcohol is said to help knock them out momentarily and make them less deadly , but that is to be debated .
Truly skilled baby octopi eaters will barely chew their meals before gulping them down , but amateurs generally choose to chew them thoroughly - which can take up to 15 minutes .
As you can see in the video , eating the treat can be quite a challenge for a novice .

5. De Jaeger ( Snail Caviar )
French foodies flip over a lot of things , but two things they hold close to heart are caviar and escargot .
So a pair of snail farmers thought , “ why not combine them ? ”
The flavor is said to be delicate and quite nice , but from what I hear , most people still prefer caviar .
The process to making snail caviar is a carefully guarded secret by the couple who invented it .
We do know it involves very happy snails getting freaky in a huge barn and a hand review all of the eggs to make sure they are up to par .
Between there being only one supplier and requiring quite tedious harvesting , all done by hand , the price of the snail caviar is quite high - about $ 82 an ounce to be more specific .

4. Bird Nest Soup
Bird nest soup , as the name suggests , is created using nests created by the nests of cave swifts .
These specific birds create their nest from their own saliva , which hardens into a sort of shell .
When boiled , the nest creates a unique flavor and jelly - like consistency that is quite popular in many parts of Asia - at least , amongst those who can afford it .
The nests are one of the most expensive animal products consumed by humans .
Just one bowl of the soup costs between $ 30 and $ 100 American dollars .
Of the multiple species of cave swifts that create these nests , the most expensive nests come from in a red shaded and are said to have additional medicinal qualities .
These health benefits range from curing asthma to boosting the immune system to aiding digestion .
Like many medicinal meals from the East though , this has not been scientifically proven as of yet .

3. Balut ( Duck Fetus Egg )
Photo : Chadedwardxxx [ Flickr ]
Surely you 've heard the urban legend that someone bought a carton of eggs , cracked one open and found a chicken fetus inside ?
Well , this is sort of the same thing , except it 's not an urban legend and it's a duck instead of a chicken .
Oh yeah , and it's on purpose .
Basically , you take your fertilized egg , boil it and there 's your meal .
Most people seem to eat the egg around the fetus and then snack down the baby duckling bones and all .
The “ ripeness ” of the egg varies from country to country , but it can be eaten any time from being boneless and tiny to pretty much being baby ducks with tender bones and beaks .

2. Kopi Luwak ( Poop Coffee )
I must admit , it was hard to choose the ranking positions for this list .
It 's hard to compare duck fetus to corn fungus to killer octopi , but I have to say that coffee beans that have been partially digested definitely deserve a place in the top three .
If the title or photo of this one has n't given it away already , let me be clear .
Kopi Luwak is a very popular coffee blend right now , despite the fact that the beans get their special flavor by being eaten and then pooped out by a civet - a cute mammal from South - east Asia .
The coffee is one of the most expensive brews in the world , selling for between $ 120 and $ 600 a pound .
Because the digestive enzymes of the civets break down the proteins in the beans that ordinarily make coffee bitter , the blend is naturally sweeter .

1. Casu Marzu ( Maggot Cheese )
Casu Marzu is a sheep 's milk cheese loaded with writhing , live fly larva .
It is illegal in many countries for its obvious health dangers , but for some reason , foodies still actively seek it out .
Even worse , the cheese can become toxic after the maggots die , so it has to be eaten while they are still very alive .
The texture is rather creamy and it is generally served on Sardinian flat bread .
Dinners are expected to keep their hands over the cheese as they place it in their mouth because these larva can jump up to 15 cm - potentially right into dinner 's eyes .
This is one of the only things on this list that makes me want to throw up just by looking at it .
I mean , this is one food that almost makes Gordon Ramsay puke - that alone says how disgusting this specialty is .
Flies are filthy and eating the living bodies and excrement of their larva is just not right , regardless of where you 're from .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices continued to slip , tumbling below $ 3 a gallon for the first time in nearly nine months , according to a daily survey of credit card swipes released Saturday .
The average price of unleaded regular fell to $ 2.99 a gallon , down four and nine - tenths of a cent , according to the Daily Fuel Gauge Report issued by motorist group AAA .
Prices have fallen 30 cents in the last week and 86.4 cents , or 22 % , in the last 31 days .
The current national average is $ 1.12 , or 27.3 % , off the record high price of $ 4.11 that AAA reported July 17 .
The decline comes as hurricane season winds down and oil prices drop over concerns that a prolonged economic slump would curb demand for energy .
The last time the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline dropped below $ 3 a gallon was Jan. 25 , when it reached $ 2.99 .
Alaska has the most expensive gas with prices averaging $ 3.92 .
The cheapest gas is found in Oklahoma with prices averaging $ 2.58 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The case for a bailout of U.S. automakers came under sharp scrutiny on Tuesday at a congressional hearing that portrayed the Big Three as both short - sighted in their business strategies and central to the economy .
" Their board rooms in my view have been devoid of vision , " said Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn .
" They have promoted and often driven the demand of inefficient , gas guzzling vehicles , and dismissed the threat of global warming . "
Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , spoke as Congress kicked off the first of two days of hearings over whether the government should extend a lifeline to the nation 's troubled automakers .
The head of the powerful United Auto Workers union , testifying side by side with the industry 's top CEOs , said the failure of one automaker would shatter consumer confidence in the other two .
" If one of these companies goes into bankruptcy , I 'd be willing to bet it takes two , or possibly all three , with them , " said Ron Gettelfinger , president of the autoworkers ' union , said during questioning .
The industry , already struggling because of high labor costs and weak sales , is being stung as car buying grinds to a halt amid credit difficulties , job losses and fears of a recession .
The industry has been lobbying hard for a $ 25 billion loan from the $ 700 billion bailout slated for the finance sector .
One Republican lawmaker , Sen. Michael Enzi of Wyoming , said he was uncertain a bailout would work .
" We have little evidence this $ 25 billion will do anything to promote long - term success , " Enzi said .
But the industry and its advocates , as well as many experts , say that without federal help , General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) will likely go bankrupt within months , and that Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC could soon follow .
General Motors boss Rick Wagoner said his company was attempting to transform itself .
He ticked off a long list of innovations - from developing nine hybrid models for next year to rapid development of the Chevy Volt , a car that runs on just electricity .
" We felt we were well on the road to turning around the North American business , " said Wagoner .
" Since then , the industry and the economy has been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
It threatens the turnaround and GM 's financial survival . "
Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Nardelli , echoing Wagoner 's remarks , said the industry is suffering a " critical lack of liquidity " because of nation 's financial meltdown .
Nardelli said that closely - held Chrysler was burning through $ 1 billion a month in capital .
Ford 's chief executive , Alan Mulally , said he understands the need for the industry to reorganize and that Ford has been doing just that .
" Few companies have restructured more aggressively , " he said , adding that Ford has closed 17 plants and reduced its workforce by 51,000 workers .
" As a result of all of our actions , we were profitable in the first quarter of this year and well on our way to sustainable profitability before the economic and credit crisis hit , " said Mulally .
Ripple effects of a meltdown
Supporters of a bailout say that a bankruptcy could prove devastating to the economy .
They say nearly 2 million jobs are either directly or indirectly tied to the auto sector , and that Detroit is a pillar of American manufacturing .
" We can't afford to lose thousands of jobs , " said Sen. Robert Casey , D - Pa .
" What is a recession could become a depression if these companies fail in the next couple of months . "
Supporters also claim a loss in tax revenue of more than $ 100 billion over the next few years if the auto industry goes belly - up .
The industry says it needs the loans to hold it over until the economy improves , their new models can woo consumers and savings from labor contracts have a chance to kick in .
But critics say problems with the U.S. auto industry are systemic , and giving it $ 25 billion would only delay the inevitable .
They also say it would encourage other mismanaged businesses to seek government rescues .
They say bankruptcy would be the best option and allow automakers to shed expensive labor contracts and reorganize as smaller , more efficient firms .
So far , it appears unlikely the current Congress will let the industry borrow $ 25 billion under the bailout program .
While many Democrats support the move , most Republicans and some Democrats are against it .
Rather than grant $ 25 billion in new loans from the bailout , the Bush administration wants to modify $ 25 billion in loans originally targeted for automakers to use to make more fuel - efficient vehicles .
Some think the White House proposal stands a better chance of passing Congress .
" I think the proposal that the administration has made - to basically change the qualifications of the money that we have already appropriated - is a sound way to go forward , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , said Tuesday .
Are they good for it ?
One of the sharpest critics of an auto bailout , Republican Sen.
Richard Shelby of Alabama , drilled into the CEOs about the outlook for their businesses and how they would use bailout funding .
" Why should we believe your firms are capable of restructuring now when you were n't able to do it under more begin conditions ? "
Shelby asked .
" What would you do with the money if you were able to get $ 25 billion , and how would you pay this money back ? "
GM's Wagoner said the company 's current business model can work .
GM would continue with the Volt program and would use bailout funds to pay suppliers , he added .
Ford 's Mulally said his company has focused on building higher quality cars that get better gas mileage .
" We 'll come out the other side - we 'll be a turbo machine , " said Mulally .
For his part , Chrysler 's Nardelli said his company will soon be able to build cars as fast as Toyota .
" We will generate a profit , " Nardelli said .
Others were n't so sure a bailout was a good use of taxpayer dollars .
" I 'm skeptical you 'll get it back , " said Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland .
Barack Obama has tapped former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle to be his secretary of Health and Human Services , said Jonathan Cohn in The New Republic online , as well as his “ point person on health care reform . ”
And it ’s “ a perfect role for Daschle . ”
He ’s become a “ true wonk ” on health care in the past few years , and now he 's got a shot to realize his big idea for a Federal Reserve - like “ federal health board . ”
That ’s why Obama chose him , said Ezra Klein in The American Prospect online .
You do n’t pick someone with Daschle ’s clout and experience getting legislation through Congress unless you ’re serious about reforming health care .
When Bill Clinton tried , he chose two “ policy wonks ” — including Hillary Clinton — with scant Washington savvy .
Daschle was a “ Senate warhorse , ” but he ’s also “ very liberal ” on health care , said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
The bigger signal that Obama means business is that Sen. Max Baucus — who is “ more moderate , and cautious ” — released a “ policy blueprint ” that closely resembles Obama ’s plan .
If Democrats makes this a priority , that ’s where they ’ll start .
Daschle ’s ideas may be “ pretty far to the left , ” said Patrick Edaburn in The Moderate Voice , but thanks to the “ budgetary restraints ”
Obama is inheriting , it ’s unlikely he ’ll be able to try them out .
Picking Daschle may be “ a sop to the left ” — when Obama fails to enact universal health care , he can point to Daschle and “ say he tried . ”

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Circuit City Stores Inc. , suffering from declining sales , traffic and cash , said Monday that it 's shutting 155 U.S. underperforming stores in a last - ditch efforts to stay afloat before what some analysts predict may be an unavoidable bankruptcy .
Despite its efforts to reach out to its top vendors , remove its chief executive and explore a sale of the company earlier this year , Circuit City 's latest move -- after the financial meltdown that further exacerbated the declining U.S. economy and consumer confidence -- may not be enough to reverse sinking traffic and sales , analysts said .
Circuit City had been hurt by having stores in less - favorable locations than those of Best Buy Co. ; by increased competition from the likes of Wal - Mart Stores Inc. ; and by an earlier move to lay off higher - paid staff who were able to push more profitable sales , according to industry observers .
Cash and short - term investments declined 78 % to $ 92.5 million in the company 's most recently reported quarter , while short - term debt was $ 215 million .
" We believe that a bankruptcy filing is largely unavoidable , " said Bernstein & Co. analyst Colin McGranahan .
" We expect the remaining stores to be under continued pressures . "
In addition to store closings , Circuit City said that it 's reducing future store openings and renegotiating leases to help preserve cash after its liquidity deteriorated and vendors tightened payment terms for the electronics retailer .
The closings will result in a reduction of about 7,300 , or about 17 % in the company 's U.S. workforce , Richmond , Va.- based Circuit City CC , - 0.63 % said .
As a result of the closings , Circuit City 's exiting U.S. 12 markets , and management 's considering all available options and alternatives to restructure the business .
See MarketWatch First Take commentary .
The company also halted the opening of at least 10 locations that it had planned for this year , while suspending openings completely next year and asking landlords for lower rents on some of its leases .
" This decision was rational and necessary to attempt to conserve capital , but we are concerned recent actions taken by some vendors ( such as setting more restrictive payment terms and limiting credit ) will ultimately prove too challenging for [ Circuit City ] to overcome , " Standard & Poor 's analyst Michael Souers wrote in a note .
As of Oct. 31 , Circuit City had 712 stores and nine outlets in the U.S.
Its international segment operated through 770 retail stores and dealer outlets in Canada as of Sept. 30 .
The closed stores are located in states from New York to Texas .
Analysts estimate the number of store closings represent about 12 % to 13 % of Circuit City 's domestic sales .
Beaten down 92 %
Circuit City shares jumped 36 % to 35 cents a share in late - afternoon trading .
They 've still lost 92 % of their value this year amid Wall Street concerns the company 's declining operating results and liquidity may lead it to go under and eventually file for Chapter 11 protection .
Also higher were shares of larger rival Best Buy BBY , +1.51 % , on expectations that it will pick up additional market share as a result of Circuit City 's store closings .
Wal - Mart WMT , - 0.08 % , which is expanding its electronics business , will benefit as well , analysts said .
Declining consumer confidence and a significantly weakened retail environment have hurt Circuit City 's sales and gross profit - margin rate more than it had anticipated , the company indicated .
Some of Circuit City 's vendors , which also are facing tightened credit terms from their lenders , are asking for payment before they ship products and have limited the credit available for purchases -- including not giving the company the customary increases in credit line for holiday purchases .
That tightening in terms and credit availability is becoming " unmanageable , " Circuit City said .
Circuit City also has n't been able to collect an income - tax refund of about $ 80 million that it said it 's owed from the federal government .
" Since late September , unprecedented events have occurred in the financial and consumer markets causing macroeconomic trends to worsen sharply , " said James Marcum , acting president and chief executive of Circuit City .
" The weakened environment has resulted in a slowdown of consumer spending , further impacting our business as well as the business of our vendors .
The combination of these trends has strained severely our working capital and liquidity . "
Wo n't somebody think of the children ?
This mantra is being used with great effect by the Australian government to increase its control over what Australians see , watch and do - all , ostensibly , in the name of protecting the nation 's youth .
And a scheme that amounts to censorship is coming closer : the government has said that it wants to start live trials of ISP - level content filtering before Christmas .
In January , the government annouunced its $ A128.5 m ( £ 55.2 m ) Plan for Cyber - Safety - a content - filtering scheme based on the pre-election pledge of Kevin Rudd , who became prime minister last year .
His plan follows the failure of the A$ 189 m NetAlert scheme put in place by the government of John Howard , who was defeated in the last federal election .
The plan was put together by Australian Labor senator Stephen Conroy , the minister for broadband , communications and the digital economy , with the aim of protecting children from pornography and violent websites and the banning outright of illegal material .
Australians will be unable to opt out of the scheme .
Senator Conroy told the Australian media : " Labor makes no apologies to those that argue that any regulation of the internet is like going down the Chinese road .
If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the government is going to disagree . "
Keeping it clean
The scheme will require ISPs to offer a " clean - feed " web service to all homes , schools and public internet access points .
There will be two blacklists : one that blocks all illegal material , such as child pornography ; and the second which blocks a list of things deemed unsuitable for children , to be determined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
Only the latter blacklist will be optional .
What better rationale than children 's sensibilities to reassure people the trampling of their rights is worth it ?
The Australian government 's agenda on national censorship is based on an appeal to emotion - it does n't matter what it bans or censors , it can always claim it 's for the benefit of children .
However , the response has been largely hostile .
An online poll by the Courier - Mail newspaper in Queensland showed that some 86 % of respondents do not support the scheme .
And concerns that it is technically impossible to implement and will slow further Australia 's already slow internet speeds by as much as 30 % are just some of the fears .
Civil liberties groups say that the scheme is an infringement of Australians ' rights .
Colin Jacobs , who chairs the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , says : " I 'm not exaggerating when I say that this model involved more technical interference in the internet infrastructure that what is attempted in Iran , one of the most regressive censorship regimes in the world . "
Australia does n't have a good track record on censorship .
For example , the continued refusal by the attorneys - general of Australia to introduce an R18 + classification for videogames is just one issue in addition to the proposed filtering scheme .
When DH Lawrence 's Lady Chatterley 's Lover was first published in 1928 , Australia was not the only nation to ban the book .
But 40 years later , it remained one of the only countries where the ban was still in force .
Bret Easton Ellis 's American Psycho is still in effect banned in the state of Queensland - the book is classified a Category 1 publication , meaning it cannot be sold in the state and must be sealed in plastic before it is sold anywhere else .
And Australia 's previous attempt to censor the internet is nothing to be proud of .
In August last year , 16 - year - old Tom Wood was able to hack through the NetAlert filters , put in place by the previous government at a cost said to be A $ 84 m , in just half an hour ( Are web filters just a waste of everyone 's time and money ?
August 30 2007 ) .
When the Australian government was apprised of that , it added another filter ; Wood cracked that in 10 minutes .
Helen Coonan , the then communications minister , said at the time that " unfortunately , no single measure can protect children from online harm and ... traditional parenting skills have never been more important " .
But perhaps that has been rethought in favour of ever more ambitious filters .
While nobody would argue that it 's important for everyone to have access to child pornography , the counter - argument - that it 's more important to find the tiny number of people who access such content and prosecute them , while leaving everyone else alone - does n't seem to have occurred to the Australian government .
Who benefits ?
The Rudd government has released the results of a lab trial carried out last year by the ACMA , a closed - environment test of ISP - level content filters which tested the effect on network traffic and its effectiveness at identifying and blocking banned content .
While the filtering technology had improved since a trial in 2005 , what is clear is that a slower network is guaranteed .
Of the six ISP - level filters tested in July by the ACMA , the majority caused drops in speed between 21 % and 86 % .
The filters also proved inaccurate , with a significant number of innocuous pages blocked ( 1.3 % to 7.8 % ) and unsafe pages let through ( 2 % to 13 % ) .
What 's more , the scheme will only be applied to web traffic , meaning that peer - to - peer filesharing will not be filtered , despite accounting for an estimated 60 % of internet traffic in Australia .
The government has tried to get around these problems by pointing to Britain , Sweden , Canada and New Zealand , which all have similar filtering systems .
However , in those countries the filtering systems are not mandatory .
In the UK , BT 's CleanFeed system uses a list of thousands of sites hosting content such as child pornography provided by the UK - based Internet Watch Foundation ; the list is offered without compulsion to ISPs .
The Australian government is commited to pushing ahead with its trials , despite the overwhelmingly negative reaction .
Nobody seems to be benefiting from the move - except possibly the ISPs , who will be able to charge for additional filters .
The children the government is so keen to protect will simply see their internet speeds degraded .

If he says yes , then take his hand and walk him back here .
started to protest that she did n’t even know this guy .
In one fluid motion I grabbed her hair and pulled her face towards me .
‘ You are MY slut .
You do what I say without comment .
Of course you can always use your safe word ?
Do you want to use it ?
Looking at the floor , she slowly replied , ‘ No Sir , I go get him ’ .
And with that she opened the door and left the car .
I watched her hips sway as she walked the 50 yards or so to the store front .
As she talked to the I saw other shoppers eying her , wondering what someone dressed as she was could be there .
Then took the mans hand and started walking towards the car .
Once here they both got into the back seat .
I introduced myself and trying to more or less get to know the but he was all eyes for .
She sat sort of demurely hands on her lap .
‘- , suck this mans cock ’.
“ Yes , Sir ’ she replied as she leaned over and unzipped his pants .
The leaned back as she used first her hand on him , which was enough to get him hard , and then her mouth .
All I could was her head going up and down and his head leaned back and moaning .
needed to get into better position to deep throat him which put her ass closer to the front seat .
I leaned over , reached back and felt under her skirt from behind … wet very wet .
After only a few minutes the said that he could n’t take much longer .
As continued to beat his hard cock , she looked at me and asked , “ Where should he cum Master ’ .
I replied , you know the rules ’ .
And with that she deep throated the strange cock .
She moved her hot mouth up and down over it until he came in her mouth .. but .. according to the rules , no cum but her Master should ever be swallowed so …she let it first dribble out her mouth ( for that horny slut look ) and then opened the car door and spit it on the pavement .
The tried to make small talk but I more or less said we had to get going .

I feel the same way , because global warming hysteria has become a prime example of the truth versus propaganda problem .
It requires courage to oppose the “ established ” truth , although a lot of people – including top - class scientists – the issue of climate change entirely differently .
They protest against the arrogance of those who advocate the global warming hypothesis and relate it to human activities .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Timothy Geithner , the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , is expected to be tapped by President - elect Barack Obama to be the next secretary of the U.S. Treasury , NBC News and the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
NBC News said Obama was expected to announced his economic team on Monday in an effort to calm markets .
Geithner was considered a top prospect along with former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers for the Treasury post , which is in the forefront of efforts to tamp down the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
Geithner would take over from U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , with whom he has been working hand - in - glove for months while dealing with a crisis that continues to wrack financial markets worldwide .
“ This is an excellent choice .
He knows where all the bones are buried on Wall Street , ” said Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton , New Jersey .
Still a relatively youthful 47 , Geithner already has a lengthy stint at Treasury under his belt .
He joined the department in 1988 and worked his way up to under secretary for international affairs during the Clinton administration under former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and then under Summers , who succeeded Rubin as Treasury chief .
Investors gave his nomination an early endorsement .
Stock prices jumped higher within minutes of word flashing around the world that Geithner was expected to get the job -- a key one in any administration but especially sensitive given the crisis that is hurting everyone from pensioners to Wall Street titans as their wealth melts away .
A New York Fed spokesman refused to comment on the reports that Geithner will be tapped for Treasury .
His current job is also a highly sensitive one , since the New York Fed president is at the nexus of dealings between Wall Street and policy - makers at both the Treasury and the Fed , the U.S. central bank .
The head of the New York Fed also carries a permanent vote on the Fed ’s interest rate - setting committee , which would make the selection of a successor to Geithner at the Fed also of great interest to financial markets .

Silverlight 's DRM capabilities meet Netflix 's needs , apparently .
Netflix warns that this is beta software .

Talk about an unwelcome arrival .
The Government has unveiled a small piece of plastic which represents a big threat to our historic liberties .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , was showing off Britain 's first biometric ID cards yesterday .
From November , the cards will be issued to foreign students from outside the European Union and to marriage visa holders .
According to Ms Smith : " We want to be able to prevent those here illegally from benefiting from the privileges of Britain . "
The hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants who work in Britain 's black economy will find that reference to the " privileges of Britain " rather rich .
The truth is that irregular workers tend to go to extreme lengths to avoid any form of contact with the British state .
They do not consult doctors , complain to the police of routine mistreatment , or claim benefits because they fear being deported .
Rather than looking for another way to make life more difficult for such people ( the vast majority of whom are simply looking to better their lives in a country with a ready supply of work ) , the Government should be considering an amnesty , as proposed by Anthony Browne in this newspaper today .
That said , we should not be distracted from what is really going on here .
ID cards are not about migrant workers , but about all of us .
The Government is preparing for its planned nationwide roll - out of ID cards in 2011 by first imposing them on one of the most reviled groups in our society .
It is the thin edge of the wedge .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But we should not submit to such underhand tactics .
The stupidity of forcing through this costly scheme as Britain enters an economic downturn should be obvious .
The Government has stretched the public finances to the limit .
To embark on a £ 4.7bn ID card project at such a time is fiscally irresponsible .
The public mood has also hardened since the Government first hit upon the idea .
Who can have witnessed the carelessness with which the state has treated our personal data in the past year and still feel confident about handing over such sensitive information to officialdom ?
Yet the most powerful argument against ID cards remains one of principle .
The idea that we should routinely have to carry around a piece of card to prove who we are is an outrage .
Even if Britain was still economically booming and the Government had an impeccable record of protecting our personal information , these cards would be unconscionable .
Nothing has changed .
We do not need ID cards and anyone who wishes to defend our freedoms should stand up and tell the Government so with a clear voice .

America 's smaller banks are claiming they could be vulnerable to government - funded predatory takeovers as their larger rivals enjoy huge cash injections from a $ 250 bn ( £ 157bn )
Treasury bail - out .
The list of US banks signing up for government capital swelled to at least 19 today as middle - ranking names including State Street , Capital One and SunTrust announced they were issuing shares to the Treasury in return for about $ 17bn .
But critics have questioned whether the funds will be put to good use .
Lending remains sparse on the high street and there are fears that the recipients will simply hoard the money — or use it to buy smaller players .
Camden Fine , the chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America , said it was unfortunate that the US treasury had imposed few conditions on the way the money was used , other than a stipulation that dividend payouts to shareholders must not rise .
" When you have taxpayers ' money used by larger banks to purchase otherwise healthy banks , that just promotes the kind of consolidation that got us into this mess in the first place , " said Fine .
" These taxpayer funds are intended to unfreeze the credit markets and to open up local economies — not to help investors in one bank buy out investors in another . "
The latest group of recipients for handouts includes regional players such as First Niagara Financial in upstate New York , Ohio - based Huntington Bancshares and Chicago 's Northern Trust .
They join the nine top banks originally named by the treasury as targets for the recapitalisation programme such as Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America .
A Californian lender , City National Bank of Beverly Hills , made it clear it would consider using its $ 395 m capital infusion to make purchases .
Its chief executive , Russell Goldsmith , told the Los Angeles Times the money " clearly enhances our financial capacity to make acquisitions and to lend to a larger degree " .
The pace of deals in the banking industry has already picked up .
On Friday , Cleveland - based National City Bank agreed to a $ 5.6 bn buyout by a competitor , PNC , which is getting $ 7.7 bn from the Treasury .
Keith Horowitz , a banking analyst at Citigroup , said National City did not need capital but had found itself vulnerable as a result of the bail - out .
" We believe [ the bail - out ] in a perverse way pushed / forced National City 's management to sell the bank into a buyers ' market , " said Horowitz in a note to clients .
Banking shares surged on Wall Street today as the government injections began to kick in .
There is speculation that aid could be broadened to troubled insurers and even to struggling carmakers such as Ford and General Motors .
The assistant US treasury secretary , David Nason , hinted that wider handouts were possible .
" We started with the banks because that 's targeted with providing more credit to the economy , " he said Nason .
" There are a lot of industries coming in saying they need federal assistance so we 're willing to listen . "
See the scale of the damage at the Marriott in Islamabad
Enlarge Image
The owner of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad has denied that Pakistan 's top leaders had been due to dine there before Saturday 's huge bomb attack .
He was responding to comments by interior ministry chief Rehman Malik .
Mr Malik said the president , prime minister and military chiefs were going to eat there but changed venue at the last minute .
A suicide bomb devastated the hotel killing at least 53 people and injuring more than 266 people .
The Marriott owner , Sadruddin Hashwani , told the BBC there never was a booking for a government dinner at the Marriott hotel on the night of the bomb attack nor any plans for a government function .
Mr Hashwani owns a string of hotels in Pakistan and is one of the country 's most successful businessmen .
Earlier on Monday , Mr Malik told journalists that President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani were planning to dine at the Marriott before a late change of plan .
The function was not held at the Marriott , thus the whole leadership was saved

' We are all in pain and agony ' Pakistan troops ' repel US raid '
" The president and the prime minister changed the venue to the prime minister 's house .
The function was not held at the Marriott , thus the whole leadership was saved . "
He did not say why the dinner plans were changed .
In other developments , it was reported that Pakistani troops fired on US helicopters that violated Pakistani airspace near the border with Afghanistan on Sunday night .
Tensions between the US and Pakistan have risen in recent weeks amid US accusations that Pakistan is not doing enough to combat Taleban militants in the region .
And in Peshawar , capital of Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province , an Afghan diplomat was kidnapped and his driver killed , reports said .
Taleban suspects
The heavily guarded Islamabad Marriott was attacked at about 2000 ( 1500 GMT ) on Saturday .
CCTV footage of the moments before the blast show a six - wheeler lorry ramming the security barrier at the hotel gate .
The bomb - believed to have been detonated in the lorry - left a six - metre ( 20 ft ) crater .

Most of the dead were Pakistanis .
The Czech ambassador to Pakistan , one Vietnamese , a German and an American were among the dead , with an American and a Danish intelligence officer missing , presumed dead .
Residents of Islamabad have told the BBC there is now a climate of fear in the city with people too scared to go out .
The blast has prompted British Airways to cancel two flights to Pakistan " in light of the security situation " .
No-one has yet admitted carrying out the attack , but the Pakistani Taleban are thought to be the most likely perpetrators .
The Marriott was the most prestigious hotel in the capital , located near government buildings and diplomatic missions .
It is popular with foreigners and the Pakistani elite .

The hotel has previously been the target of militants .
Last year , a suicide bomber killed himself and one other in an attack at the hotel .
The BBC's Barbara Plett , in Islamabad , says the latest attack might have been retaliation for army bombardments of suspected Taleban targets with jet fighters .
Earlier on Monday , Pakistan 's government said it would take targeted action against the militants , promising raids in some " hotspots " near the border with Afghanistan .
Away from Islamabad , troops reportedly forced US helicopters out of Pakistani airspace in the tribal area of North Waziristan .
Our correspondent says that following a series of US raids on Pakistani territory earlier this month that it reserved the right to retaliate , with a series of warning shots the standard procedure .
In Peshawar , Afghan consul Abdul Khaliq Farahi was in a car in a city suburb when it was attacked by six unidentified men , officials say .
His driver died in the attack .

Toyota has launched trials of the UK 's first petrol - electric hybrid car that can also be plugged into the mains .
Soon drivers should be able to choose between the petrol pump and the electric socket to power one and the same car .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

The launch could mark a dramatic change in how drivers spend money on automotive " juice " , as the power generation industry - be they coal fired power stations such as Drax or nuclear power firms such as British Energy - enters the market .
Electricity company EDF
Energy is erecting " juice points " , or electric charging points , across London .
And it is not alone .
At this summer 's London motor show , Mayor Boris Johnson vowed to start rolling out charging points over the next couple of years , and the government is eager to support a gradual shift from oil - based to electric transport .
" We can see the future unfold ahead of us , " grins John Hutton , UK secretary of state for business , enterprise and regulatory reform .
Best of both worlds
Pure electric cars have been around for a long time , offering two pence a mile motoring , lower insurance , and exemptions from both road tax and congestion charges , says Nigel Wonnacott from the Nice Car Company during a drive through London 's congested streets .
It 's the best of both worlds
Toyota Motor 's head of hybrids , Koei Saga " Here we are , doing two miles per hour and there are all these performance cars ahead of us , doing exactly the same thing whilst spewing out fumes , " he says .
But so far , electric car ownership has been very much about accepting compromises in terms of speed and handling , as well as range .
The Nice car 's battery , which takes seven hours to charge , runs out of juice after about 40 miles , according to Mr Wonnacott , so owners chose to own a second car for longer journeys .
So far , Toyota 's existing hybrid technology , as used in its popular Prius models , has not offered a comparable alternative to electric cars .
Its batteries are charged by a petrol engine , and as such the Prius merely offers improved fuel economy on par with many modern diesel engines .
Mr Hutton believes in the electrification of transport
The plug - in hybrid aims to combine the benefits of the two .
While driving an early trial version in London , it became clear that the batteries run out after just six miles before switching to petrol , though this range could be extended relatively simply by adding more batteries , in accordance with customers ' taste for added weight , longer charge times and extra expense .
Nevertheless , put simply , the idea is that the plug - in hybrid can be used as a conventional electric car for urban commuting during the week , and then as a petrol - powered car for weekends away .
" It 's the best of both worlds , " grins Toyota Motor 's head of hybrids , Koei Saga .
Improved economics
Such a development would be bad news for the oil industry .
Our industries can jointly tackle the global challenge of climate change
Vincent de Rivaz , chief executive of EDF Group
EDF could complete the nuclear line - up in the UK Gradually , as ever more car journeys are powered by electricity rather than by internal combustion engines , the power generation companies will be chipping away at the dominance of oil majors such as ExxonMobil , Shell and BP .
And not just in the world of motoring , where the introduction of more powerful lithium - ion batteries is accelerating this shift towards electric power .
Public transport is changing too , with train companies increasingly squaring up to the airlines by offering fast and comfortable alternatives on ever more routes .
This " electrification of transport " is particularly good news for the nuclear industry , which will see its share of the overall energy mix grow dramatically in the years ahead , both in the UK and across the world , according to John Ritch , director general of the World Nuclear Association .
But renewable energy sources , such as wind or wave power , also stand to gain as the power they generate during stormy nights can be sold to commuters , who should even see their household energy bills come down as a consequence of more of the electricity that is being produced during the night finding a market .
" This may impact on the economics of new renewables , " according to Peter Hofman , director of sustainable future at EDF Energy .
Climate change
Though in the end ( leaving aside well publicised concerns about the safety , viability and cost of nuclear ) the main beneficiary of the switch from carbon - based to electric transport will be the environment .
Electric cars are good in cities , but not for longer trips
Though even with the current contribution from fossil fuels to UK power production , which is currently relatively high , Toyota 's plug - in hybrid offers a 40 % reduction in overall CO2 emissions compared with conventional petrol vehicles , according to Mr Hofman .
" With nuclear you could see reductions of up to 70 % , " he adds , hinting at well advanced plans to build a string of new nuclear plants in the UK .
Vincent de Rivaz , chief executive of EDF Group - the French state - controlled nuclear power giant that owns EDF Energy and that is currently in talks to buy the UK nuclear company British Energy - is eager to stress the benefits of a gradual switch from coal and gas to nuclear power .
" Alongside the energy sector , the transport sector is one of the main contributors to climate change , " he insists .
" Our industries can jointly tackle the global challenge of climate change . "

French film legend - turned - activist Brigitte Bardot took a swipe at Sarah Palin on Tuesday , saying the US vice - presidential candidate was a disgrace to women .
" I hope you lose these elections because that would be a victory for the world , " Bardot wrote in an open letter to Republican John McCain 's running mate in the November vote .
" By denying the responsibility of man in global warming , by advocating gun rights and making statements that are disconcertingly stupid , you are a disgrace to women and you alone represent a terrible threat , a true environmental catastrophe , " wrote Bardot .
( h/t David )
Chris Wallace -- like the rest of the Fox News world -- wants the world set up in easily definable terms : Liberals vs. Conservatives , Patriots vs. Pinheads , Red States vs. Blue States .
The Barack Obama presidential campaign is clearly crossing those boundaries and I think that Wallace does n't know how to cope with that .
Obama has taken Howard Dean 's 50 State Strategy and shown that Democrats can be competitive in traditionally red states .
In fact , so much so that Obama is actually within the margin of error in McCain 's home state of Arizona .
But for Wallace , it 's arrogant of Obama to advertise in states that Republicans have traditionally dominated .
Obama Campaign Manager David Plouffe argues ( and I believe correctly ) that it is more the arrogance on the part of the McCain campaign to think they did n't need to set up a ground game in these states than it is for Obama to simply believe that there were enough voters seeking change to make these states competitive :
WALLACE : First , let ’s talk about the thing I brought up with Rick Davis , the fact that you have decided to make a late push in North Dakota , in Georgia and even in McCain ’s home state of Arizona .
Is it there a touch of arrogance here ?
I mean , would n’t it make more sense to focus your resources , focus your advertising and everything on the states that you need to lock up 270 electoral votes ?
PLOUFFE : Well , Chris , we ’re doing everything we can in the core battlegrounds : Ohio , where Sen. Obama will be today ; Florida ; Virginia ; North Carolina ; Indiana .
All of those states we ’re doing everything we think we need to do to try and win .
In these three states , we ’ve been organizing for some time , the reason Georgia is so competitive right now is all the organizational groundwork we ’ve put in , why you ’re seeing early vote numbers in such large measures .
So , in North Dakota , Georgia , Arizona , we think all three of those are going to be close and there ’s benefit to having the playing field to yourself .
One of the reasons we ’re so strong in states like Indiana , North Carolina , Virginia , even in Florida , is the McCain campaign was arrogant .
They were asleep at the switch and thought those states would not be competitive .
So we had two - three months headstart , advertising , organizing .
So in North Dakota , Georgia and Arizona , we think we have the playing field to ourselves , we think all three will be close , and we ’re going to give it a shot to see how …now I think John McCain should be favored in all three of those states , but we think they ’re going to be very close and if you look at Georgia , the early vote there — similar to North Carolina – is just striking in terms of its composition .
And we think we ’re heading to a very close finish there .
Finally , is it me or is the whole term " arrogant " a codeword for " uppity " ?
How dare that Democrat think he 's going to get Georgia or North Dakota ?
Does n't he know that those are America - loving red states ?

It 's a small world : Fascinating images of life under the microscope
It looks like a tiny , blue , bug - eyed alien - its miniature spine visible through translucent skin .
But this fascinating image is actually a close - up of a chicken embryo and finalist in a ' small world ' photography competition .
It is just one of 115 incredible images that use microscopes and digital imaging software to capture views of nature which are invisible to the naked eye .
Blue wonder :
This extraordinary image of a chicken embryo was taken at Lisbon University , Portugal
Other worldly :
No , not a Martian landscape but a close - up of the anti-cancer drug Mitomycin
Moth wings that look like colourful bricks , soap that looks like a surreal Dali painting and a canyon landscape that is actually an anti-cancer drug are just some of the entries submitted from around the world .
They are all finalists in Nikon 's Small World competition , which for 34 years has celebrated this technique known as photomicrography .
Images are taken through microscopes , which magnify an image by at least 20 times using ordinary light , ultraviolet , infrared , electrons or X - rays .
Materials are often dyed so that their structure can be seen more clearly .
This surreal looking image shows the micro - flow pattern in a thinning soap film
Golden wonder :
Using fibre optics , this image shows the wing scales of a sunset moth
' Small World is regarded as the leading forum for showcasing the beauty and complexity of life as seen through the light microscope , ' a spokesman said .
' For over 30 years , Nikon has rewarded the world 's best photomicrographers who make critically important scientific contributions to life sciences , bio -research and materials science . '

The administration 's January 2008 letter to the House Foreign Affairs Committee -- made public by Representative Howard L Berman on Tuesday -- bring out the following :
The US has given no binding fuel - supply assurance to India .
The prime minister told the Lok Sabha on August 13 , 2007 that ' detailed fuel supply assurances ' by the US for ' the uninterrupted operation of our nuclear reactors ' are ' reflected in full ' in the 123 Agreement .
But the Bush administration has denied this .
Its letter to the House Committee states that the US will render help only in situations where ' disruptions in supply to India ... result through no fault of its own , ' such as a trade war or market disruptions .
' The fuel supply assurances are not , however , meant to insulate India against the consequences of a nuclear explosive test or a violation of nonproliferation commitments , ' the letter said .
The letter also reveals that the US has given no legally binding fuel - supply assurance of any kind .
No US consent to India 's stockpiling of lifetime fuel reserves for safeguarded power reactors .
The prime minister had told the Lok Sabha on August 13 , 2007 that , ' This Agreement envisages , in consonance with the Separation Plan , US support for an Indian effort to develop a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel to guard against any disruption of supply for the lifetime of India 's reactors . '
But the Bush administration 's letter to the House Committee makes clear that India will not be allowed to build such stocks as to undercut US leverage to re-impose sanctions .
US civil nuclear cooperation is explicitly conditioned to India not testing ever again .
The prime minister told the Lok Sabha as recently as July 22 , 2008 that , ' I confirm that there is nothing in these agreements which prevents us from further nuclear tests if warranted by our national security concerns .
All that we are committed to is a voluntary moratorium on further testing . '
Last year , he had told Parliament that , ' There is nothing in the Agreement that would tie the hands of a future Government or legally constrain its options to protect India 's security and defence needs . '
The Bush administration , however , has told the House Committee that India has been left in no doubt that all cooperation will cease immediately if New Delhi conducted a test .
The US has retained the right to suspend or terminate supplies at its own discretion .
The Bush administration letter plainly contradicts the prime minister 's assertion in Parliament on August 13 , 2007 that , ' An elaborate multi- layered consultation process has been included with regard to any future events that may be cited as a reason by either Party to seek cessation of cooperation or termination of the ( 123 ) Agreement . '
The letter states that the US right to suspend all supplies forthwith is unfettered .
The letter makes clear that the 123 Agreement has granted India no right to take corrective measures in case of any fuel - supply disruption .
Rather , India 's obligations are legally irrevocable .
It further indicates there is no link between perpetual safeguards and perpetual fuel supply .
Contrast this with what the prime minister claimed in Parliament on August 13 , 2007 : ' India 's right to take " corrective measures " will be maintained even after the termination of the Agreement . '
Or the prime minister 's repeated assurances to Parliament since March 2006 that India 's acceptance of perpetual international inspections will be tied to perpetual fuel supply .
The Bush administration 's letter states that the 123 Agreement fully conforms to the Hyde Act provisions .
In a press release recently , the Prime Minister 's Office made the following claim on July 2 , 2008 : 'he 123 Agreement clearly overrides the Hyde Act and this position would be clear to anyone who goes through the provisions . '
The letter assures Congress that the 'US government will not assist India in the design , construction or operation of sensitive nuclear technologies . '
That rules out not only the transfer of civil reprocessing and enrichment equipment or technologies to India even under safeguards , but also casts a shadow over the US granting India operational consent to reprocess spent fuel with indigenous technology .
Under the 123 Agreement , India has agreed to forego reprocessing until it has , in the indeterminate future , won a separate , congressionally vetted agreement .
On one issue , the 123 Agreement had held out hope for India in the future by stating in its Article 5 ( 2 ) that , ' Sensitive nuclear technology , heavy water production technology , sensitive nuclear facilities , heavy water production facilities and major critical components of such facilities may be transferred under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment to this Agreement . '
But the Bush administration 's letter to Congress states that the US government had no plan to seek to amend the deal to allow any sensitive transfers .
Contrast this with what the prime minister said in Parliament on August 17 , 2006 -- that India wanted the 'removal of restrictions on all aspects of cooperation and technology transfers pertaining to civil nuclear energy , ranging from nuclear fuel , nuclear reactors , to reprocessing spent fuel . '
Lest there be any ambiguity regarding this benchmark , he added : ' We will not agree to any dilution that would prevent us from securing the benefits of full civil nuclear cooperation as amplified above . '
Earlier , on August 3 , 2005 , he told the Lok Sabha that he had received 'an explicit commitment from the United States that India should get the same benefits of civilian cooperation as ( an ) advanced country like the United States enjoys . '

Gloom about the global economic outlook could limit the impact of any oil supply cuts OPEC might agree at an emergency meeting on Friday , and the group ’s president said output policy would prove a difficult balancing act .
The cartel is under pressure to reduce output at the Vienna meeting , with many OPEC ministers calling for a supply cut to help balance the oil market .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said oil stocks are high and some member countries are finding it hard to sell their oil .
“ There is excess of crude not able to be absorbed by the market , ” Khelil told reporters .
“ If ( Friday ’s ) decision goes too far , it will affect countries who are already affected by economic crisis . ”
“ If it does n’t go too far , then it will affect the producers who might end up in the category of people affected by the financial crisis , ” he added .
Turley : Blanket pardons would be ' final nail in Bush 's coffin ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 14 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush has consistently claimed executive privilege in response to attempts to investigate potentially illegal actions by his administration , and it now seems that he could continue to make that claim even after leaving office .
There is also speculation that Bush could issue blanket pardons for anyone who might have engaged in torture or other criminal activities under his orders .
On Wednesday , an article in the New York Times noted that President Truman had invoked executive privilege in 1953 , when he was no longer president , to avoid having to testify before the House Un- American Activities Committee .
Congress did not challenge that unprecedented claim , and legal cases involving Watergate and Iran - Contra have given it some tentative support .
" Can they really do that ? " MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow asked constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley on Thursday .
" This is very controversial , " Turley replied .
" Truman 's own people later questioned whether they actually did have the right that they invoked , and it 's really never been tested , it 's never gone to the Supreme Court .
I personally have considerable doubts about it . "
Turley explained that although federal law gives former presidents control over the release of presidential papers , what is being discussed here goes far beyond that .
He indicated his belief that " this idea that President Bush can continue to invoke executive privilege even against the position of a sitting president , I think is pretty shaky . "
" Ultimately , " Turley suggested , " a court may have two presidents in front of it , one a sitting , one an ex-president , taking rivaling positions on executive privilege .
In my view , the court would be insane to take the position of the former president over a sitting president as what is required to protect the office of the presidency . "
Turley noted , however , that a post - presidential claim of executive privilege could be highly effective as a delaying tactic , because " the Supreme Court would very likely take up the case , " so that the real question becomes " how much of a negative legacy does George Bush really want to leave . "
" This would be an incredible act , " Turley stated , " a very dysfunctional and negative attack on a sitting president .
...
But you know , this administration does not shy away from extreme positions .
...
Most of us would hope that they would have some adult supervision , but we have n't seen that in the last eight years on these claims . "
Turley also addressed the possibility that Bush might issue blanket pardons for anyone involved in torture under his administration .
" This is one of the most scary potentialities of the waning days of the Bush administration , " he commented .
" It would create a terrible precedent .
Effectively , the president would be pardoning the world . "
" If he did that , " concluded Turley , " I think that he would trigger a constitutional crisis where people would demand a constitutional amendment to limit the power of the president .
...
This would be the final , really , nail in the coffin for Bush . "

In a recent short article , I explained that capital flees from government ’s taxes and regulation .
The other side of the coin is that capital is attracted by government ’s subsidies .
The attraction of capital to activities that are being subsidized diverts production and employment into activities where they would not otherwise have gone had people been left free to decide the allocation of capital .
This redirection of capital invariably lowers social welfare .
Examples abound because subsidies take many , many forms .
The government subsidizes leisure and penalizes work using welfare and unemployment benefits .
( Human capital is attracted into these programs . )
It subsidizes visits to doctors and hospitals with Medicare and Medicaid programs .
It subsidizes alternative fuels , space flights , and the production of weapons of mass destruction , thereby attracting human and physical capital into the associated industries .
It subsidizes wars , attracting human and physical capital into destructive activities .
The list goes on and on because government is big , and government ’s main tool of social control is the subsidy .
Government subsidizes not only the production of certain items but also their financing .
It shoots with a double - barreled shotgun .
Government subsidizes loans .
It often sees to it that there are low - interest loans available for selected activities such as making autos , attending college , agriculture , home buying , and so on .
The list is very long .
The Federal Reserve , which is an arm of government , subsidizes the banking system .
When the Fed buys bonds ( or anything else ) , it provides banks with reserves that cost them nothing but which provide them the capability of making loans at interest .
The system subsidizes bank lending and thus credit creation across the nation .
This undermines other ways and means of channeling capital to borrowers , including capital markets .
Any government subsidy not only lowers social welfare but also creates production and financing imbalances .
For this reason , every subsidy carries within it the seed of dislocations and unemployment .
When subsidies ebb or are removed , the capital that has been unduly attracted to the subsidized activity must seek employment elsewhere .
While the eventual result is healthy , the temporary transitional phase is often painful .
If the subsidy for student loans is reduced , colleges and universities will experience a recession in demand .
Some students will enter the job market .
Some will borrow or obtain gifts from parents , who will then cut back on other purchases .
The entire economy may not be noticeably affected , however .
There will be no official " recession , " but a partial recession in the education industry will have occurred .
A recession , as usually thought of , is a period of reduced business activity and higher unemployment that is widespread over the entire economy .
One cause is the cessation or change in a subsidy or set of subsidies that have grown large enough to affect many parts of the economy .
Recessions are temporary .
If left alone , the capital , human and physical , moves toward other employment , and the recession disappears .
Prolonged recessions are enabled and encouraged by government attempts to shorten them .
They are prolonged when government restrictions of many kinds slow down and prevent labor mobility , discourage entrepreneurs from starting new businesses , prevent the unemployed from easily starting up new ventures , and prevent them from working at non-union jobs .
Numerous business firms would hire more labor were it not for restrictions that they face that begin with the minimum wage and cover a vast range of other measures that act as taxes on their expansion .
If the recession is treated with more of the same government medicine , then any number of bad results can and will occur .
If , for example , there are 2 million unemployed and government puts them to work building roads , social welfare will decline .
Capital will be drawn from higher - valued uses into uses that society was not choosing .
There will be too many roads , and not enough electricians or truck drivers or whatever other occupations would eventually be filled by the unemployed .
The skills the unemployed learn will not be of as much value to them when the road building ceases as it would if they had spent the time in other jobs .
Another way to understand recessions is to begin with how production and employment work in a free market .
Murray Rothbard gives a sound and clear explanation of production and the pricing of factors of production in Man , Economy , and State .
The following is my simplified version of the process he explains there .
Suppose we consider a single industry and good , which is the manufacture of pearls .
These steps suggest how the industry reaches a free market equilibrium .
The potential pearl consumers are willing to pay particular prices for particular quantities of pearls .
These are unobservable .
The pearl producers estimate what the consumers are willing to pay and how many pearls they will buy .
They do not know these magnitudes for sure , but they have data from the past and other ways of predicting the future sales .
The pearl producers hire ( or rent ) factors ( land , labor , capital ) to produce the pearls .
They compete with producers of all sorts of other goods in hiring these factors .
The production takes time , during which the land , labor , and capital have to be paid rental fees .
In steps 2 and 3 , the producers will pay for factors no more than what they think they can sell the pearls for to the pearl consumers .
Since all producers of all products are doing the same , an economy - wide factor price and quantity demanded of the factors are established in the factor markets .
The factor price and quantity demanded ( demands derived from estimates of what consumers demand of pearls ) are such that the discounted marginal value products ( DMVP ) of the factors across various products tend to be equated .
This equilibrizing occurs because if the DMVP in emerald production exceeds that in pearls , there is an incentive to shift production into emeralds and out of pearls .
Discounting is in the calculation only because it takes time before the product is sold to consumers and payment received ; discounting is a present value calculation that takes into account the time value of money .
The marginal value product refers to the worth of what a factor produces at the margin ( when one additional unit of product is produced ) .
The sum of factor prices paid to produce pearls ( called the factor costs ) tend to equate to the price that consumers pay for pearls .
This is a second equilibrizing tendency .
If this were not so , there would be an incentive either to produce fewer or to produce more pearls .
If factor costs exceeded the price consumers pay , the business would be losing money and cut production back .
In step 6 , costs come to equal price .
This is not because costs determine price .
It is because price determines costs that can be paid to produce at that price .
Capital gets paid the rate of interest in this process .
It gets paid for “ time , ” that is , deferring consumption and extending resources for the time it takes to produce the product .
The remaining price that is paid ( beyond paying interest on capital ) is paid for labor and land factors .
The labor theory of value does not describe the equilibration .
All costs are not reducible to labor costs .
There are land costs and also time ( capital ) costs .
Labor costs roughly account for 50 — 70 % of all revenues of all producers in modern economies .
From the point of view of this model , recessions are economy - wide events in which production in many markets is discovered to have gone into products that find no ready markets at the prices that entrepreneurs had estimated would be paid .
The mix of goods produced and / or their amounts do not match what consumers are willing to or able to buy at the pre-production estimated prices ( steps 1 and 2 above ) .
Unemployment of several kinds is one result .
Unemployed goods ( seen as excess inventories ) appear .
Prices drop so that these can be sold .
This reduces business income .
If the government has subsidized roadbuilding by drawing resources from society , and if society wants ice cream rather than roads , the ice cream manufacturers will discover that the purchasing power to buy the ice cream they have produced is lacking .
If the government has printed money to pay the roadbuilders , then prices will rise and the rest of society will find that they do not have enough purchasing power to pay for all the goods that other manufacturers have produced .
The reduced business earnings , once they are seen or foreseen by stock traders , cause stock prices to decline .
The longer and deeper the expected decline in earnings , the greater the stock price decline , all else equal .
The recession raises both business risk and uncertainty .
Investors demand a higher premium for investing in securities .
That too reduces stock prices .
At a lower scale of operations , operating leverage rises as fixed costs loom larger .
Uncertainty rises because of the added uncertainties involved in the economy reaching a new equilibrium with a changed product mix and changed production .
Producers do not know how long the adjustments will take or what their effects will be .
Unemployment of labor occurs as workers are laid off .
It takes time for them to shift to industries that are demanding labor .
Businesses take time discovering what lines of business may be profitable to pursue .
They have unemployed capital goods on their hands .
They take time changing over or adding to different lines of production that employ different kinds or mixes of capital goods .
The labor unemployment lasts for a while .
Under ordinary circumstances , it dissipates by itself as businesses discover products that consumers will buy and then hire workers to produce those products .
There is nothing that government can do to alleviate the process except to remove whatever prior interferences it had instituted that influenced the markets .
If it provides unemployment insurance , it slows the transition to new employment .
If it increases deficit spending , it withdraws capital from the private sector and slows the recovery .
If it pumps up the money supply , it can reduce unemployment but at the cost of distorting production , adding fuel to another eventual recession , and diverting labor into jobs and production that have low social value .
Shifts from one line of business to another that are caused by shifts in consumer demand occur continually in market economies .
They do not cause recessions unless the economy is undiversified and focused narrowly on only a few kinds of goods .
A recession is something that affects many industries simultaneously .
Its cause cannot be a shift away from cigarettes to cigars , or from bicycles to automobiles .
It has to have a source that affects many industries at once .
Something that distorts the relative prices ( or costs ) of the basic factors will do the trick ( see steps 3 — 6 above ) .
Something that causes many businesses to make errors in forecasting prices and quantities will do it .
Correlated errors are a sign of a cause that affects the whole economy .
One such source is a previous excess of credit introduced by the central bank and banking system through their ability to create money and credit .
Money maintains value as long as there is sufficient backing behind it .
An excess of money means money being created and circulated that lacks enough backing .
A clear signal of this is that the money loses value relative to goods , or that the prices of goods rise .
A less clear signal is that prices of goods do not decline when productivity improvements suggest they should .
Either signal means inflation is occurring .
The clearest signal of a prospective problem in the existing system is an excessive rise in credit issued by banks .
Credit creation by the central bank in conjunction with the banking system is not a free market process .
The following description applies to central bank credit creation .
Many businesses finance their production processes ( their rentals of land , labor , and capital ( step 3 ) ) by means of credit .
With credit made more widely available ( although its basis in money lacks sufficient backing ) , the cost of financing production falls .
Businesses that were rationed out of the market prior to the central bank stimulus find that loanable funds are available to them .
Businesses in general are induced to produce more product if they believe that their prospective profit margins are rising .
They believe this because they observe that their cost of capital has declined .
This point is a great divide in economic theory .
It is of critical importance for the Austrian trade cycle theory .
The Misesian point , which is that the central bank ’s money creation depresses the real rate of interest , is denied by economists who believe there is no money illusion .
They believe that since the money creation is destined to raise prices , the rate of interest will immediately rise to reflect the anticipated price level increase .
This is rational expectations applied to the money market .
Irving Fisher , having studied the connection between prices and interest rates , did not believe this .
Mises did n’t believe this .
Like Fisher , he argued that money rates first fell and only rose when the actual price changes influenced expectations .
Experimental evidence in support of Mises and for money illusion is provided here .
Even when a person overcomes his own money illusion , he cannot predict what others persons will do , and therein lies the core of a persistent money illusion .
The strongest argument presented by Mises is , I believe , the following , and it operates along similar lines :
" The price premium could counterpoise the effects of changes in the money relation upon the substantial importance and the economic significance of credit contracts only if its appearance were to precede the occurrence of the price changes generated by the alteration in the money relation .
It would have to be the result of a reasoning by virtue of which the actors try to compute in advance the date and the extent of such price changes with regard to all commodities and services which directly or indirectly count for their own state of satisfaction .
However , such computations cannot be established because their performance would require a perfect knowledge of future conditions and valuations .
The emergence of the price premium is not the product of an arithmetical operation which could provide reliable knowledge and eliminate the uncertainty concerning the future .
It is the outcome of the promoters ’ understanding of the future and their calculations based on such an understanding .
It comes into existence step by step as soon as first a few and then successively more and more actors become aware of the fact that the market is faced with cash - induced changes in the money relation and consequently with a trend oriented in a definite direction .
Only when people begin to buy or to sell in order to take advantage of this trend , does the price premium come into existence . "
A rational expectations theorist would argue that " people will learn , " and then they will impound inflation expectations more rapidly into interest rates and negate the efficacy of the Fed ’s policies .
Perhaps they will learn to some extent in a context of repeated trials with unchanged conditions .
But that does not characterize real - world economies and markets .
They are forever changing .
If there is central bank money creation , no one ever knows who will take down the money , when this will happen , what they will use it for , and how it will eventually affect prices .
Furthermore , computation of a price level is extremely difficult .
For this reason , interest rates can be driven down by a central bank ’s money creation .
Given then that businesses expand under the stimulus of credit creation by the central bank and banking system , and let us remember that this is not a free market scenario , the effects of these expansion decisions across different industries are not uniform .
Those firms that require and use relatively more credit benefit more from its lowered cost and greater availability .
Firms that are more capital - intensive in production benefit more as well .
These types of firms expand more .
Duration is a financial measure of the sensitivity of a good ’s value to a change in capital cost .
The values of assets and liabilities of long duration are more sensitive to credit costs than those of shorter duration .
Thus , long - term bonds fluctuate more in value for a given interest rate change than short - term bonds .
Long - lived capital goods fluctuate more in value than short - lived capital goods .
Since easier money and credit affect the values of the long - duration assets and claims relatively more , they benefit relatively more from the increased credit flows .
More credit therefore flows into the long - duration assets and claims like airplanes , factories , land , houses , and stocks .
The effects of all this across factor prices , product prices , assets , liabilities , and securities are complex .
No two companies have exactly the same mix of short - and long - term assets and liabilities .
The durations of the two sides of the balance sheet vary greatly across firms .
The responses of managements are hard to predict .
This complexity is again the reason why a rational expectations model will fail to capture the reality of the credit - induced business cycle .
Greater use of financial leverage accompanies the boom .
More firms expect profits from investing in long - term assets since the prices of this class of assets rise the most .
By financing them with the cheapest debt , which is short - term debt , the credit creation encourages a duration mis-match : borrowing short and lending ( or buying ) long .
This practice violates the standard and conservative financing rule , which is to match the maturities ( or durations ) of loans with the maturities ( or durations ) of the assets they finance .
It suffices to say that the U.S. has had two credit booms in the last 13 years .
The first was centered in technology and other stocks .
That bull market ended in 2000 .
The second focused on housing and other real estate .
That bull market ended in 2005 for housing , with effects on stocks and other securities extending to the present .
Each of these episodes is associated with central bank money creation followed by banking system credit creation .
Each has been followed by recession when neither the price structure nor the credit structure could be sustained .

Americans Fail the Test of Civic Literacy
If there is any presidential speech that has captured a place in popular culture , it is the Gettysburg Address , seemingly recited by school children for decades .
The truth is , however , Lincoln ’s most memorable words are now remembered by very few .
Of the 2,508 Americans taking ISI ’s civic literacy test , 71 % fail .
Nationwide , the average score on the test is only 49 % .
The vast majority cannot recognize the language of Lincoln ’s famous speech .
The test contains 33 questions designed to measure knowledge of America ’s founding principles , political history , international relations , and market economy .
While the questions vary in difficulty , most test basic knowledge .
Six are borrowed from U.S. government naturalization exams that test knowledge expected of all new American citizens .
Nine are taken from the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests that the U.S. Department of Education uses to assess high school seniors .
Three are drawn from an “ American History 101 ” exam posted online by www.InfoPlease.com.
Two were developed especially for this survey and the rest were drawn from ISI ’s previous civic literacy tests .
The results reveal that Americans are alarmingly uninformed about our Constitution , the basic functions of our government , the key texts of our national history , and economic principles .
Less than half can name all three branches of the government .
Only 21 % know that the phrase “ government of the people , by the people , for the people ” comes from Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address .
Although Congress has voted twice in the last eight years to approve foreign wars , only 53 % know that the power to declare war belongs to Congress .
Almost 40 % incorrectly believe it belongs to the president .
Only 55 % know that Congress shares authority over U.S. foreign policy with the president .
Almost a quarter incorrectly believe Congress shares this power with the United Nations .
Only 27 % know the Bill of Rights expressly prohibits establishing an official religion for the United States .
Less than one in five know that the phrase “ a wall of separation ” between church and state comes from a letter by Thomas Jefferson .
Almost half incorrectly believe it can be found in the Constitution .
Americans from all age groups , income brackets , and political ideologies fail the test of civic literacy .
Americans age 25 to 34 score an average of 46 % on the exam ; Americans age 65 and over score 46 % .
Americans earning an annual income between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 score an average of 46 % ; Americans earning over $ 100,000 score 55 % .
Liberals score an average of 49 % ; conservatives score 48 % .
Americans who go to church once a week score an average of 48 % ; Americans who never go to church score 50 % .
The Average Nationwide Grade on the Civic Literacy Test is an “ F ” Americans nationwide fail the civic literacy test , scoring an average of 49 % , or an “ F . ”
This table shows the average score achieved by various groups .
Overall average Mean score for all surveyed 49 % Score by age 18 to 24 47 25 to 34 46 35 to 44 49 45 to 64 52 65 + 46 Score by Gender Male 52 Female 45 Score by Race / Ethnicity White 51 Black 40 Hispanic 38 Asian 42 Multiracial 49 Other 42 Score by Marital Status Married 51 Single 48 Divorced or separated 47 Almost 40 % of Americans falsely believe the president has the power to declare war .
Score by Parental Status
Has one child or more 48 % Has no children 50 Score by Income Less then $ 30,000 40 $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 46 $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 51 $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 55 $ 100,000 + 55 Score by Party Identification Democrat 45 Republican 52 Independent 52 Other 46 Score by Political ideology Liberal 49 Moderate 51 Conservative 48 Score by Military Service Active or reserve 51 Never served 48 Score by Church Attendance More than once a week 48 Once a week 48 Once or twice a month 49 Seldom 51 Never 50
Widespread ignorance of our nation ’s history and institutions is a worrisome sign for our nation ’s future .
As we shall see , today ’s Americans share the conviction of the Founding Fathers that civic education is important — and they are right in this conviction .
Respondents who score in the top third in civic literacy , the survey shows , are more likely than those who score poorly on the test to participate in the civic life of their communities and country .

Gov. Sarah Palin 's husband plans to speak to an investigator looking into abuse - of - power allegations against the governor that could be potentially damaging to her U.S. vice presidential candidacy , Todd Palin 's lawyer said Saturday .
He previously refused to testify under subpoena in a separate probe .
Attorney Thomas Van Flein said he asked the investigator , Anchorage attorney Timothy Petumenos , to reserve the third week of October to interview Todd Palin , but a date has not been set because he is waiting to hear back from Petumenos .
Todd Palin refused to testify under subpoena last month in a separate investigation by the Alaska Legislature .
Petumenos is heading a parallel probe by the Alaska State Personnel Board into whether Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , acted improperly when she fired Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan this summer .
Both are looking into whether Palin , her husband and her aides pressured Monegan to fire a state trooper who was involved in a contentious divorce from Palin 's sister and then fired Monegan when he would n't dismiss the trooper .
Palin says Monegan was ousted over budget disagreements .
The McCain - Palin campaign has said that the Legislative Council 's investigation is being manipulated to damage the governor before the Nov. 4 election .
The investigator leading that probe , retired prosecutor Steven Branchflower , is due to release his findings Friday .
That release could be blocked by the Alaska Supreme Court , which will hear arguments this week in an emergency appeal by five Republican lawmakers trying to halt Branchflower 's report .
An Anchorage judge recently dismissed that lawsuit along with an attempt by several of the governor 's aides to quash subpoenas issued for their testimony in the Legislature 's investigation .
Todd Palin was not part of the attempt to quash the subpoenas , but the decision may affect whether he speaks to Branchflower .
Van Flein said the Supreme Court 's decision in the appeal next week is one of several factors that will go into deciding whether he does .
The two investigators could interview Todd Palin together or Branchflower could use Petumenos ' interview in his own investigation , Van Flein said , though Branchflower is scheduled to end his probe at least a week before the planned interview .
" I 've asked ( Branchflower ) to contact me so we can discuss things , " Van Flein said .
Sarah Palin originally agreed to cooperate with the Legislature 's investigation .
But after she joined the Republican ticket , she said the probe had become tainted by politics and filed a complaint against herself with the personnel board , which she says has the proper authority to investigate ethics allegations against the governor .

A novel cell division mechanism has been discovered in a microorganism that thrives in hot acid .
The finding may also result in insights into key processes in human cells , and in a better understanding of the main evolutionary lineages of life on Earth .
The study is published today in PNAS .
The research group at the Department of Molecular Evolution at Uppsala University has identified a completely new cell division machinery .
The discovery was made in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius , a microorganism belonging to the third domain of life , the Archaea , which originally was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone national park in Wyoming , USA .
Because of the extreme conditions , in which the cells grow optimally in acid at 80 ºC , the organism is of interest for a wide range of issues .
" They represent exciting model systems in theories for how life once may have originated in hot environments on early Earth , as well as in the search for life in extreme environments on other planets , " Professor Rolf Bernander explains .
He is the scientist behind the study , together with colleagues Ann- Christin Lindås , Erik Karlsson , Maria Lindgren and Thijs Ettema .
The researchers have identified three genes that are activated just prior to cell division .
The protein products from these genes form a sharp band in the middle of the cell , between newly segregated chromosomes , and then gradually constrict the cell such that two new daughter cells are formed .
" This is the first time in decades that a novel cell division mechanism has been discovered , and the gene products display no similarity to previously known division proteins , " Rolf Bernander says .
Two of the three proteins are instead related to eukaryotic so - called ESCRT - proteins , which play important roles in vesicle formation during intracellular transport processes , and which also have been implicated in virus budding , including HIV , from the cell surface .
The results are , thus , important not only for an increased understanding of the cell biology of archaea and extremophiles , but also for key cellular processes in human and other higher organisms , and for issues related to the origin and evolutionary history of these processes .

Paris lost out to London in the bid to host the 2012 Games
By Matt Slater
The head of the Paris bid team for the 2012 Olympics believes London 's budget problems stem from false promises made during the bidding process .
Last week Olympics minister Tessa Jowell caused alarm when she admitted the Government would not have bid if it had known a recession was coming .
This did not surprise ex-Paris 2012 boss Philippe Baudillon as he always felt London had talked down costs .
" Paris 's bid was much , much more precise , " said Baudillon .
Our vision for the Games is big - as it should be .
This project is fully on track
London 2012 spokeswoman
" London underestimated a lot of costs and we can now see the real costs were much higher than they were in the bid .
" The people from London 2012 were much better salesmen than the people from Paris .
But it is much more difficult when you have the contract and you 've made a lot of promises that are not linked to reality . "
London , largely thanks to a last - minute lobbying effort ahead of the final vote in Singapore , beat favourites Paris , Madrid , Moscow and New York for the right to stage the Games in 2005 .
But since then London 's organising committee and the Government have been dogged by arguments about the actual cost of the Games , particularly as the overall economic picture has worsened .
The London bid was very optimistic in terms of costs .
I say optimistic but I could use another word
Philippe Baudillon
Former Paris 2012 boss
This week alone there have been further negative headlines about Olympic sponsors dropping out and London venues being scrapped .
Jowell 's quickly clarified comments were seen as a statement of the obvious by some and an embarrassing gaffe by others .
For the 53 - year - old Baudillon , who now runs the French division of US media giant Clear Channel , the seeds of London 's current problems were apparent from the start of the bidding campaign .
He now sees London 's problems as two - fold .
" First , the London bid was very optimistic in terms of costs .
I say optimistic but I could use another word , " said Baudillon .
" And second , there is ( an economic ) crisis , which is unpredictable .
So you have a lot of problems with private finance and the budget .
" But it would have been easier for Paris to deal with the crisis because our bid was linked to ( former International Olympic Committee vice - president ) Dick Pound 's recommendations in 2003 about the size of the Games , the legacy and the use of temporary venues .
We worked hard on that .
" I am sure London will organise the Games perfectly because the British people are very good at that .
But London 's bid was not done on this basis , it was based on a huge operation to improve east London . "
The French proposal was far less ambitious , according to Baudillon , and elements of it - enlarging the Roland Garros tennis complex and building a new aquatics centre - have been pursued despite the shock failure to win the vote in Singapore .
This is evidence , he feels , of how the Paris bid was in tune with the city 's needs and would not have placed an unnecessary burden on the region 's tax - payers .
" The IOC itself has to realise you cannot use the Games to make revolutionary changes in a city or country , " he said .
" It is too expensive , too huge .
The times have changed .
Beijing is the last Games that can be done like that . "
OLYMPICS BLOG
Some of the influential people I talked to admitted that it really was " touch and go " whether the Cabinet would agree to a bid
BBC London 's Adrian Warner Baudillon 's remarks will be dismissed by some as sour grapes but many observers will know they contain more than a hint of truth .
For its part , London 's organising committee issued a statement that reiterated its commitment to delivering the project on time and within the revised budget .
It also pointed out the most recent IOC inspection awarded London 9.75 out of 10 for its work so far .
" Our vision for the Games is big - as it should be , " a London 2012 spokeswoman told BBC Sport .
" We have a world - class team in place across this large and complex project delivering our ambitions , not just for a truly memorable Games but a Games that leaves a lasting legacy for sport , and regenerates east London .
" This project is fully on track and we are getting on with the job . "

Performance gear - producing Patagonia , known for their forays into sustainable clothing produced with environmental ethics in mind , has produced the first recyclable - nylon shell and pants for technical outdoor wear .
The company has produced recyclable nylon gear before , in the form of pants and shorts , but these are the first shells produced in the industry that can be recycled .
Patagonia will provide recycling for their Shelter Stone products through their already - active Common Threads recycling program
Why is this important ?
Nylon is the last of four fabrics ( polyester , cotton , wool , and nylon ) that Patagona has focused on sourcing more sustainably since 1992 .
They ’ve had success with organics , alternative fibers and recycled content , and nylon was the final frontier , perhaps the most difficult , to produce in a way that created less of an environmental impact .
Not only are they producing recyclable content clothing , they ’re providing the means to recycle them through Common Threads , which is already accepting the aforementioned pants and shorts for recycling .
When this grows , recycled - content nylon will become available .
Toray , the textile manufacturer working with Patagonia , claims that creating new garments from recycled nylon will save 70 % of energy costs for garment production .
This is just one more step in the right direction for Patagonia .
The company ranks second overall and first in clothing manufacturers , in the Better World Shopping Guide .
Their outreach includes participation in 1 % for the Planet , Organic Exchange , and The Conservation Alliance , as well as awarding internships and grants to individuals and groups working towards sustainability .

McCain lies vs. McCain senility
September 27 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
Those are the only options .
Last night in the debate , McCain returned to the topic of earmarks , delivering this :
Denouncing government spending , he tossed in an example .
“ You know , we spent $ 3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue , ” he joked , but so rapidly that some viewers might have been confused , or wondered if the candidate was .
There are two problems with what he said .
First , there ’s this , from a Factcheck.org article last year :
Despite the fun McCain had ridiculing the bear project on the Senate floor , he did n’t actually try to remove it from the bill .
He did introduce several amendments , including three to reduce funding for projects he considered wasteful or harmful , but none removing the grizzly bear project appropriations .
And despite his criticisms , he voted in favor of the final bill .
The article also includes a discussion of the Bridge to Nowhere , noting McCain ’s opposition , and his failure to show up to vote on whether to divert the Bridge to Nowhere money to New Orleans following Katrina .
The attempt to divert the money to Katrina aid failed .
Instead , Congress removed Gravina ’s earmarks , tossing that money into Alaska ’s general transportation pot to be used however the state chose .
McCain was n’t there for that vote , either .
In light of the furor over the “ bridge to nowhere , ” Alaska ’s governor opted to use the money for other pursuits .
The bridge was never built , but McCain has been using it as his prime pork example since 2005 , even blaming it for the Minneapolis bridge collapse in August 2007 .
( He cited it as an example of a pet project that diverted money from necessary highway maintenance . )
Which brings us to his running mate .
During the debate , McCain once again returned to a theme of experience – seeming to forget that his running mate is supposed to be qualified to take over should something happen to the president – but why would he mention the Bear DNA study when Sarah Palin made a similar request ?
Palin , meanwhile , has requested $ 3.2 million to be spent in part researching the “ genetics of harbor seals , ” in one of the state ’s many requests for federal funding of research into Alaska ’s fauna .
So what else did Sarah Palin request your tax money for ?
Well , there was this :
$ 2 million : Bering Sea Crab Research and Management : Researches Bering Sea crab productivity and sustainability as necessary to restore crab stocks .
and this :
She ’s seeking $ 1 million , for instance , for a project to investigate rockfish fisheries , a request that , according to the Alaska document , was presented to and refused by Congress last year .
And , of course , that Bridge to Nowhere .
Both of them , actually .
John McCain would be a lot easier to take seriously if his choice for Vice President did not undercut every aspect of his campaign .
She is the Gateway Meme .
Scientists have for the first time regrown retina cells in live mammals .
The mouse study offers hope for similar success in human eye cells .
Located in the back of the eye , the retina 's role in vision is to convert light into nerve impulses to the brain .
Previous work had shown that retina nerve cells called Müller glia cells could be grown in a lab dish .
" This type of cell exists in all the retinas of all vertebrates , " said Tom Reh of the University of Washington , " so the cellular source for regeneration is present in the human retina . "
Reh said further study could lead to new treatments for human vision loss from retina - damaging diseases , like macular degeneration .
The research will be detailed this week in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Birds , which are warm - blooded like mammals , have some limited ability to regenerate retinal nerve cells .
But fish , which are cold - blooded , can generate all types of retinal nerve cells , Reh said .
Getting the cells to regrow in mice — considered a good model for human biology — was not easy , however .
The researchers injected a substance into the retina to eliminate ganglion cells ( a type of nerve cell found near the surface of the retina ) and amacrine cells .
Then by injecting the eye with some chemicals , including growth factors and insulin , they were able to stimulate the Müller glia cells to restart their dividing engines and begin to proliferate across the retina .
Many of the progenitor cells arising from the dividing Müller glia cells , the researchers observed , died within the first week after their production .
However , those that managed to turn into amacrine cells survived for at least 30 days .
" It 's not clear why this occurs , " the researchers wrote , " but some speculate that nerve cells have to make stable connections with other cells to survive . "

When a human foot washed up on the shores of British Columbia earlier this year , the sixth in a period of a few months , news stories were printed in national papers across the world .
The sick hoax – the result of a quickly devised prank , some seaweed in an old trainer - is an example of maximum horror hype from minimum effort .
It makes sense , right ?
The car in the lead cuts through the air creating less resistance for anyone who follows .
Birds do it , cyclists do it — even some hypermilers give it a try .
According to Daytona 500 lore , the phenomenon called drafting was " discovered " in 1960 when Junior Johnson won the race in his slower , older Chevrolet by closely trailing the faster , newer Plymouths out of the pits and sticking in their draft .
Since 1960 — or possibly for as long as people have been able to put two and two together — it ’s been assumed that if one moving vehicle is immediately following another moving vehicle , the follower has to use less energy to achieve the same speed .
Drafting ’s effect on car fuel economy was even tested by those meddling * Mythbusters * who found that driving in the wake of semi - truck did increase a car ’s fuel efficiency .
Unfortunately to achieve that fuel savings , the car had to drive dangerously close in the truck 's blind spot .
But if the prospect of slamming into the rear of semi does n't dissuade you , a recent study suggests that the conventional wisdom about drafting may be dead wrong .
" People who have studied schooling fish and flocking birds always postulate that they flock because the ones downstream can save energy , and the guy who 's at the front has to work harder .
Here 's a case where that gets turned on its head , ” Karl Leif Ristroph , a graduate student and
Physics and co-author of a new paper about the phenomenon of reverse drafting , told Scientificblogging.com .
In an experiment Ristroph conducted with NYU researcher Jun Zhang , the researchers placed two tiny flags with tiny mirrors attached in row .
They flowed in soapy water and used lasers and optical interferometry to measure the flags ' movement .
And here ’s the surprising part :
The flag in the lead flapped less and created less of a drag than the one drafting behind it .
Even more interestingly , the flag in front flapped less when it did have a follower then when it was alone .
“ That was completely unexpected , "
Ristroph said .
Applying this phenomenon to streets filled with tons of steel propelling at breakneck speeds is difficult .
But passing attempts at logic might suggest that if two objects in motion are the same or similar size , the object in the lead may benefit more from drafting than the one following .
So leading the pack could potentially save you gas .
Knowing this wo n’t make driving down the highway with a SUV
riding up on your rear feel any more comfortable .
But it does suggest that whoever created the laws of Physics may have had a sense of humor .
And if you want to get better gas mileage , it ’s probably best to keep it safe and stick to the basics .

America Votes , but First It Must Wait in Long Lines Candidates campaign nonstop as America votes .
Nov. 4 , 2008  -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama kept campaigning right through Election Day , although scenes from crowded polling places today indicated that voters did not need any last - minute encouragement .
Across the country voters are turning out in what could be historic numbers , in some cases spending hours in serpentine lines waiting for a chance to vote .
In an indication of how intensely fought this campaign has been , both candidates kept holding large rallies and television interviews even as voters swarmed to their polling sites .
In the past , presidential candidates have halted their campaigns on Election Day .
McCain voted early in Phoenix before heading off for some last - minute get - out - the - vote efforts in New Mexico and Colorado , two states where the GOP presidential pick is trailing but hopes to pull out narrow victories .
" I promise you if I 'm elected president , I will never let you down , " an energized McCain told a crowd in Colorado .
" I think we ought to hear one more time ' drill , baby drill , ' " he cheerfully suggested and the crowd obliged with the campaign 's chant .
In the battleground state of Pennsylvania , where McCain is trailing , the Republican National Convention placed robocalls using quotes from Sen. Hillary Clinton criticizing Obama .
The GOP in Pennsylvania is running ads reminding voters of Obama 's relationship with his former controversial minister , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
After voting at a Chicago school , Obama spent the morning campaigning in Indiana before returning to Chicago to conduct television interviews broadcast via satellite to the swing states of Florida , Pennsylvania , Colorado , Virginia , Ohio , North Carolina , Nevada and Missouri .
Lines at polling stations around the country indicate the election could result in record turnout numbers .
Kim Wooten , 44 , waited in line for 75 minutes to vote at a fire station in Rosslyn , Va. , and said she would cast her vote for Obama .
" I 'm ready for a change , " she said .
" To be honest , I was n't really energized about either candidate , but I 'm voting Democratic this time . "
Wooten was one of thousands voting in Virginia , long considered a Republican stronghold but which has been leaning toward Obama in the polls .
Polls in the state close at 7 p.m. ET , one of the earliest closing times in the country , and could , according to Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden indicate the direction of results throughout the night .
" The polls are going to close and by 9 ET -- you will have Virginia , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Ohio , by that time .
...
You 're going to know whether you 're going to be up a long , ... long night or if it 's going to be a short night , " Biden said .
Obama , who could become the nation 's first black president , voted with his two young daughters in Chicago before he plunged into a final round of campaigning in Indiana .
" I voted , " the Democratic presidential candidate said , holding up the validation slip he was given after turning in a ballot at the Shoesmith School in his Chicago neighborhood .
Obama voted at the same polling station as William Ayers , the former 1960s radical who became a flashpoint in the campaign when the McCain campaign accused Obama of " palling around " with terrorists .
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan also voted at that site .
Farrakhan became a GOP target after he endorsed Obama .
In Delaware , Biden , Obama 's running mate , went to the polls with his mother before getting on a plane to meet up with Obama in Chicago .
Sarah Palin , McCain 's running mate , arrived in Anchorage , Alaska , overnight and voted in her hometown of Wasilla .
She is expected to fly to Phoenix to join McCain in time to watch the results come in .
After voting , Palin noted that the result would be historic , implying that the voters would elect either the country 's first black president or the first female vice president .
" It bodes so well the progress our country is making , " Palin said .
She also said she was delighted that she was cleared of any wrongdoing in the firing Alaska 's top police officer .
" You did n't believe us , " she told reporters .
" I told you we 'd done nothing wrong . "
In Florida , a swing state marginally leaning Republican , voters in some cities were confronted with long lines , while others found shorter queues in areas that had high early voter turnout .
By some estimates nearly 50 percent of Florida 's likely voters had cast absentee or early ballots .
" If Obama gets elected , I 'll definitely go back [ to Iraq ] because they are going to test him , " said a 40 - year - old Air Force colonel who voted Republican in Sarasota , Fla. , and asked that his name not be used .
" Obama 's done nothing except get endorsed by Oprah .
McCain will bring troops home in an orderly fashion . "
Today 's vote caps a long - fought and record - breaking campaign between two candidates who were both written off early in their candidacies and whose races for the White House have been nothing short of history making .
" The election is historic by any standard .
Barack Obama might become the first African - American president .
One woman , Hillary Clinton ran and nearly secured her party 's nomination ; another , Sarah Palin , could potentially be the first female vice president , " said Matthew Dowd , an ABC News political consultant .
" We 're seeing a great generational shift . "
By almost every quantifiable measure -- from the $ 640 million Obama raised in the month of October , to the nearly $ 1 billion combined the campaigns have spent , to 9 million newly registered voters -- records have been shattered .
Yet another record may fall before the day is over as turnout is heavy and could surpass previous voting turnout records .
The existing turnout records were set in 2004 when more than 122 million Americans went to the polls , and in 1960 when 64 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot .
All eyes are now on a handful of battleground states that can turn the election or signal a sea change in American politics .
While McCain faces a tough road to the necessary 270 electoral votes , victories in tightly contested Florida , Ohio and Virginia could significantly shift the electoral map in his favor and result a win .
Polls close earliest in Virginia -- at 7 p.m. ET -- and in Indiana , some polls close at 6 p.m. ET ( that 's 7 p.m. ET ) .
" The first thing to look at is Virginia , " said Dowd .
" If Obama has the lead there , you know the outcome of the race .
If McCain wins or it's too close to call , anything can happen . "
The election comes in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and at a time when 85 percent of the populace believes America is on the wrong track .
Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin Both Claimed Sexism Was a Factor
The candidates have spent almost two years staking their positions on a broad swath of issues , but in the lead - up to Election Day , voters said the economy trumped everything
Obama retained an overall lead in the most recent ABC News / Washington Post poll , 54 percent to 43 percent , among likely voters interviewed Wednesday through Saturday .
The candidates ' identities , as much as where they stand on issues , have been a mainstay of the campaign .
McCain , a bona fide war hero and long - serving lawmaker , would be the oldest first - term president if elected .
Obama , a virtually unknown Illinois junior senator when he announced his candidacy , will be the first black president if he wins .
Since Obama was pitted against former first lady Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York during the Democratic primaries , America 's best principles and worst prejudices have been confronted and debated .
Sexism became an issue , first when Clinton argued that sexist treatment in the media and electorate had scuttled her chances at the nomination , and more recently when Palin complained that focus on her $ 150,000 GOP - bought wardrobe would not have been an issue if she were a man .
McCain goes into today 's voting a decided underdog trailing in the polls .
But with a flailing economy and an unpopular Republican president , some have argued that the deck is stacked against him , or any Republican nominee .
" People are looking for great meaning and significance in this election .
Given the state of economy , I do n't think it 's a surprise that Obama is leading , " said ABC News political consultant Torie Clarke , a former assistant secretary of defense during the first term of the Bush administration .
Obama did more than just tap into growing feelings of resentment .
He offered a candidacy centered around hope and optimism , and , in perhaps the greatest and most calculated flip - flop of his campaign , forwent public financing allowing him to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from donors contributing small amounts of money .
Former 1960s Radical William Ayers Became an Issue
McCain too changed course .
In the final weeks of the campaign , the Arizona senator struck a more negative tone and along with Palin began attacking Obama on his relationships and judgment .
In the third and final presidential debate , McCain assailed Obama for his relationship with 1960s radical William Ayers and his campaign began aggressively using auto - dialed calls to voters , known as " robocalls , " to relay negative messages , frequently focusing on the Democrat 's experience and readiness for the White House .
That strategy did n't seem to achieve the desired effect , with voters responding in polls in the race 's final weeks that they were turned off by the negative ads and attack tactics .
Obama has in recent weeks consistently led in national polls and the electoral math as it stands clearly favors him .
Buoyed by newly registered voters , blacks and young people , Obama has found support even in states once considered Republican strongholds .
But things are far from absolute and both supporters and opponents of Obama note that anything can happen .

Sustainable Living ... in Laos and Hawaii WE KNEW WE WERE GETTING CLOSE when the boot tracks on the trail changed to barefoot prints .
My hiking partner and I had just endured 15 miles of grueling hiking over two days on the Kalalau Trail and we could think of nothing more pleasant than dropping our heavy packs and getting out of the drenching rain .
We had just arrived in a very remote valley where rumors of a sustainable community have been circulating since the 1970s .
Other hikers on the trail told us that we'd most likely find the permanent inhabitants living in the forest near the beach .
It was n't long before we made contact with the friendly natives .
My partner was the first to locate the telltale smoke rising from a cliff overhang .
When we came towards their camp they welcomed us in with an offer to join them in a locally produced meal they were just taking off the fire .
We accepted .
In the disposable society of this modern age it is difficult to find truly sustainable communities anymore .
Some would argue that they are now extinct like the dinosaurs or the dodo bird , but I 'll beg to differ .
Although one would have to venture deep into the Amazon or New Guinea highlands to find truly uncontacted people who still live off the land , they do exist in isolated pockets .
Sad to think that only a century ago almost everyone on the planet lived a sustainable existence where virtually no pollution or non-biodegradable waste was produced .
Today the trash dumps of the world have become eyesore mountains and the cities are choking on atmospheric pollution .
Fed up with the concrete jungle I accepted passage to the ASEAN Tourism Forum in Vientiane , Laos primarily so I could travel after the show and search for my prophesized sustainable community .
I found one in Southeast Asia , then I found another in the most unlikely place of all - in the United States of America on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i .
From Muang Noi to Kalalau
The official name is People 's Democratic Republic of Laos , but there is no democracy for the people in this so - called republic that has been ruled by one party since 1975 .
Despite singular communist rule - one of the last true socialist states to survive - the people of Laos are happily devoted Buddhists .
Called the Jewel of the Mekong River , Lao PDR is one of the least visited countries in Southeast Asia and remains among the most pristine .
Neighboring China is an economic powerhouse , as are upcoming border countries Thailand and Vietnam , while the final two neighbors , Cambodia and Burma , are poor but contain incredible ruins to attract tourism dollars .
Landlocked Laos relies on pristine natural scenery and the kindness , smiling and generosity of its people to lure in precious foreign currency .
Outside the two tourism cities of Vientiane and Luang Prabang life moves pretty slow in Laos .
Over 80 % of the population lives a quiet existence on small family plots of land .
The agrarian people have an intimate relationship with nature , in fact most Laotian people are more familiar with the genitals of a pig than the controls of a television set .
Only now are a few hilltribe villagers getting their first glimpse of television and a distorted image of things to come .
The glow of a television at night draws people inside where they sit quietly in a mesmerized state .
An apt description would be moths to the flame .
Other villages still have no televisions or electricity and at night people sing and tell stories to each other .
This is where I wanted to be .
Being in a village where there are no motor vehicles undoubtedly changes the atmosphere of a place - for the better .
Things slow down , people stop and talk in the middle of the road , while noxious fumes and obnoxious noises are relegated to the outhouse .
Muang Noi in northern Laos fit the bill .
Only accessible by riverboat or footpath , this village on the River Ou exudes charm amid a cathedral landscape of vertical rock formations .
Fortunately roads have never reached Muang Noi and likely never will .
All commerce travels on boats or the backs of men and women .
A network of footpaths leads to outlaying villages that are completely sustainable .
Animals co-exist with humans in bamboo and palm leaf huts .
Men and women share in the chores of tending the fields , feeding the animals , and looking after the children .
From what I observed village elders settled disputes in a polite and nonviolent manner .
After all , about 90 % of all Lao people profess Theravada Buddhism as their religion .
One unique aspect of Laotian Buddhism is the " Calling for Rain " image , which depicts the Buddha standing with his hands held rigidly at his side with fingers pointed downward towards the soil .
Indeed , living sustainably in Laos has influenced Buddhist thought and portraiture .
Modern travelers are welcome to Muang Noi as well as the outlaying villages .
Local entrepreneurs will arrange tours to caves and waterfalls , take you hiking or on river trips , or construct a bamboo raft for you to float downstream the old fashioned way .
Travel writer Bruce Northam and I choose to do all we could during our weeklong stay .
Both of us agree now it was the homemade raft trip down the River Ou that defined our " authentic travel moment " in Laos .
As a testament to living sustainably we even defied the motorboat on our journey out !
Navigating a bamboo raft is no easy task .
The watercraft rides low in the water with little draft for maneuverability or speed .
Basically we just floated along with the current .
Several times we hit rapids and there was little we could do but steer the raft straight into the current .
A few times we hit a rock and went spinning out of control .
Within the biggest rapids the raft went completely underwater and we found ourselves waist deep in water .
Our daypacks were floating on the surface of the water only attached to the raft by the twine I tied around them before we left .
Needless to say we were soaked and so were our packs , but what an exhilarating ride we shared !
Leaving Laos was sad , but all good things must come to an end .
Besides , I had another adventure coming up , this one to the middle of the North Pacific Ocean .
I had heard of a " lost tribe " living in the secluded Kalalau Valley in Kaua'i and I felt it necessary to investigate .
It seems that if people were living in the valley full time it must be a sustainable community .
Native Hawaiians had densely populated Kalalau Valley in prehistory .
It was only in 1919 that the isolated canyon was finally abandoned .
Since Kalalau is the largest valley on the Na Pali coast ( Na Pali meaning " the cliffs " ) , it was prized by the native people for its fertility of soil and abundant fresh water .
Two sacred heiau platforms flank the valley on either side of the river .
The valley remains a recognized sacred place on the island of Kaua'i .
In the early days , seafaring Hawaiians used canoes to travel around Kaua'i and out to neighboring island Ni'ihau .
Regular trade throughout Kaua'i and to the isolated canyons on the Na Pali coast were commonplace .
Like days of old , kayaks still ply the Na Pali water route .
Today dinner cruises and commercial adventure trips navigate the scenic shoreline .
Similar to the villagers of lore , modern campers can set up their tents on old Hawaiian agricultural terraces .
Wild plantation crops such as coffee , guava , mango , bananas , tobacco , oranges , taro , lemons , limes , eggplant , and squash grow wild in the Kalalau Valley .
I was told there were community gardens with radish , basil , rosemary , lettuce , and marijuana .
Feral animals such as goat and freshwater prawns could also be killed and eaten .
With so much abundance it seemed logical that a sustainable community could exist .
Now I just had to endure the long hike to get there .
Getting into Kalalau Valley is its saving grace .
The only land route in and out is a strenuous 11 - mile scenic path .
The isolation and difficulty of getting there allows a few dozen permanent residents to lead a mostly sustainable lifestyle .
But it is illegal to do so .
Helicopters with Department of Land and Natural Resources ( DLR ) agents can arrive at any time and give tickets to squatters .
Zodiac rafts and kayaks can arrive via the ocean , but only in the summer months when the north shore swells let up .
However the DLR agents wish to make their raids - by air , boat or trail - the lawless citizens of Kalalau can detect their tormentors coming several critical minutes ahead of time and immediately evacuate to their protective hiding places .
According to a Hanalei local named Kevin the raids are like a scene from " Planet of the Apes . "
When the oppressive DLR agents move in ( the Apes I presume ) the jungle people warn each other first before they scatter and hide .
They entrench themselves so deep into the foliage that rarely do any get caught .
" Like animals , " notes Kevin .
The main casualty of the DLR raids thus far has been the 400 - book library , airlifted out and destroyed .
Kevin tells me the collection is back up to 100 books now .
As much as the DLR has tried to clear the valley of illegal campers - and they have been trying for 30 years - it is virtually impossible to evict the permanent residents .
Thus one of the most unique sustainable communities in the Western world continues to exist .
Going to Laos and Kalalau was a reassuring lesson for me that indeed the best things in life are often the simplest .
Living sustainably is a goal we should all try to achieve - at least in part .
It 's not too hard to reduce our garbage load , recycle , compost , or even grow a portion of our own food .
In my opinion even the smallest effort is a big help .
After all , the planet is being rapidly consumed by the parasite known as the human race .
Practicing sustainability in the modern world can lessen our impact and very likely aid in leaving a renewable planet for future generations .
A Laotian Buddhist would say it 's our karmic duty .
A Kalalau hippie would wholeheartedly agree .

Apple 's iPhone is making multitouch all the rage on mobile phones but laptop makers are not rushing to add the technology to traditional notebooks .
Multitouch , which lets users control applications through gestures on a screen , may not be the best interface for laptops because of the size and placement of the screen .
In addition , there 's little integration between touchscreens and most software .
" You do n't see a lot of touchscreen notebooks because it is not intuitive to reach up and start touching the screen when there is a good keypad , " says Paul Moore , senior director product management at Fujitsu , one of the world 's biggest laptop makers .
Some pundits , such as Computerworld columnist Mike Elgan , argue that
computer interfaces of the future will likely blend multitouch with gestures and physics ( using accelerometers to detect bumps , shakes or the device 's orientation in space ) .
Already , many computing devices are using some or all of these techniques .
Nintendo's
Wii uses physics — the location and movement of the controller through space — to control actions on screen while multitouch is becoming the interface of choice for smartphones like
Google 's Android and Samsung 's Instinct .
On small screens , multitouch makes sense for tasks such as expanding views , making edits and manipulating objects onscreen .
But move up to a notebook , and the technology begins to lose out on ease of use .
So far , touch interface on conventional laptops has been largely confined to the touchpad .
Earlier this week Synaptics , which provides touchpads to a number of mobile and PC makers , introduced new gestures such as the two - finger flick , which allows users to flick horizontally or navigate through documents and images and " ChiralRotate " that lets users move one finger in a circular motion to rotate images and graphics .
These gestures will be available to current owners of Synaptics touchpads ; users can just update the drivers from the company 's website to get the new capabilities .
" These are going to be our baseline touchpad features and we wo n't be charging users any premium for it , " says Linda Cecil , product marketing manager for PC products at Synaptics .
While interesting , gesture - based touchpad interfaces are unlikely to make a big dent in the way users interact with their computers , says
Anthony Andre , professor of human factors and ergonomics at San Jose State University and principal of Interface Analysis Associates , a Bay Area usability consulting firm .
" Touchpads are a fairly limiting interface because the size of them is fairly small to begin with , " says Andre .
" Once you are constraining your gestures , touch is no longer such a natural thing to do . "
That 's where multitouch , which gives users the freedom to interact with the entire screen could be a winner .
But for multitouch to be truly useful , it has to be well integrated with applications and offer users some value beyond a cool factor .
" I do n't think there 's inherently anything great about multitouch unless it is mapped to a functionality , " says Andre .
" Multitouch on notebooks would be a lot more interesting if manufacturers identified the top five things that are arduous to do with a keyboard and would be easier to do with multitouch , " says Andre .
That 's why notebook makers are waiting for Microsoft 's Windows 7 OS , the successor to Vista .
Earlier this year , Microsoft showed off the multitouch interface for Windows 7 but with the operating system unlikely to be released before 2010 , it will be a while before laptop buyers can see it on their screens .
Slowing adoption is a lack of standard touch gestures used universally across manufacturers and applications .
With the wide diversity of devices available , users are never sure what a particular touch gesture on their laptop will translate into , says Andre .
It 's a little like the voice commands system available in cars today , he says .
" Most drivers never use it because they do n't know what commands are available and how to activate them , " says Andre .
" Similarly with touch gestures there is nothing intuitive about what 's natural and what 's allowed or not . "
Multitouch may be a better suited for convertible PCs that transform from a notebook to a tablet PC when the screen is rotated .
" If you put a notebook in a slate mode , you are talking about a platform that is more gesture friendly than the clamshell , " says Moore .
Fujitsu plans to introduce multitouch into some of its 12 - inch screen notebooks in the middle of next year when it hopes the technology will be a little more mature , says Moore .
But the company is still betting it will be convertibles and tablets featuring multitouch that will find greater adoption among users , rather than traditional notebooks .
Meanwhile , Lenovo and Dell have restricted touch technology to either touch - sensitive controls for volume and multimedia use or to tablet PCs .
" Increasing the amount of touch technology we have on our consumer laptops is certainly something we 're looking at , " says a Lenovo spokesperson while acknowledging that a touchscreen in a traditional notebook is not part of the company 's lineup for now .
Even HP which has been among the first to introduce the Touchsmart range of PCs is unlikely to have a touchscreen - based notebook for another 18 months , according to a recent report .
Multitouch notebooks will truly take off only when business applications are created to make touch a part of the user interface , says Moore .
Currently , touch interfaces seem to be limited to applications involving photo editing or scrolling through documents , but when used in software for verticals such as insurance , healthcare and automotive , it could have enough of an impact to get PC makers to add it more enthusiastically to their products .

With the economy tanking , the holidays this year loom like the ghosts of Christmas past .
Thank goodness for great beer .
No , I ’m not talking about chugging a couple of sixers to blunt the bad news .
I ’m talking about holiday beer : stony stuff to sip and savor and share with friends .
Since Roman Catholic monk - brewers in medieval times began creating their best beers of the year to honor the Christ child , the tradition of making great holiday beers has survived .
Even the mightiest purveyors of light lagers make extra effort , and some of those — Michelob Celebrate , for instance — are excellent .
But the real stars come from American craft brewers and from abroad .
Which beers are the best ?
To find out , I sat down with friends last week , and in a couple of hours we tasted our way through a couple of dozen .
Here are some suggestions , ranging on my scale from four stars ( stellar , not to be missed ) to three ( very good , worth a try ) :
Four stars
Brrr , Widmer Bros. , Portland , Ore .
This is Widmer ’s first Christmas ale in four years .
It was worth the wait ; 7.15 percent alcohol by volume , hoppy nose , wild chocolate malt taste , dry finish .
Absolutely excellent .
Our Special Ale , 2008 , Anchor Brewing , San Francisco .
This 5.5 percent alcohol ale is the true American holiday classic .
Anchor founder Fritz Maytag revived the idea of a holiday beer when he launched this beer in 1975 .
It ’s brewed in the English “ wassail ” style , a brown ale spiced with — well , the spices are secret , but it ’s fun to guess .
Maybe allspice and grains of paradise ?
Santa ’s Little Helper Imperial Stout , Port Brewing , San Marcos ( San Diego County ) .
This Santa ’s a stunner : 10 percent alcohol , inky black , licorice nose , dry finish .
A perfect fireside sipper .
Stille Nacht , de Dolle Brouwers , Esen , Belgium .
It ’s hard to find this 12 percent heart - stopper , and if you find an older version , buy it .
This dark , fairly sweet beer only improves with age .
Three - and - a - half stars
Affligem Noel , Affligem , Opwijk , Belgium .
Sure , Affligem is now owned by giant Heineken , but this Christmas ale — spicy , mildly sweet , strong ( 8.5 percent ) — is a good example of the Belgian holiday style .
Bitch Creek Double ESB , Grand Teton , Victor , Idaho .
This 7.5 percent alcohol treat marks Grand Teton ’s 20th anniversary .
It ’s a strong version of the brewery ’s prizewinning Bitch Creek ESB .
Comes in a 33.5 - ounce , wax - sealed , flip - top bottle .
A great gift .
Firestone Walker XII , Firestone Walker , Paso Robles .
This jaw - dropping , 12 percent beer is n’t a holiday beer — it just came out at this time of year .
But what a great beer .
It ’s a blend of several beers , mostly barrel - aged .
Dark and luscious , it will improve over several years like a great cabernet .
The Firestone Walker 10 , marking the brewery ’s 10th anniversary , is a classic , if you can find it .
Jubelale , Deschutes , Bend , Ore. Each year this spiced , 6.7 percent ale improves .
It has been a fascinating taste voyage as Deschutes brewers adjust the spice and malt .
This year ’s strikes an excellent balance .
N’Ice Chouffe , Achouffe , Belgium .
I ’m a big fan of Achouffe ’s beers , and this Christmas special is typical .
Big malt presence , dry finish with warming alcohol that lingers on the tongue .
It ’s 10 percent alcohol by volume .
Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale , Sierra Nevada Brewing , Chico .
This is a great beer and easily found .
It ’s made in the style of an India pale ale , 6.8 percent , lots of malt , plenty of hops .
No wonder it has won so many prizes .
Three stars
2 Below Winter Ale , New Belgium , Fort Collins , Colo .
Another unusual beer from the makers of Fat Tire .
2
Below has a mild , floral hop nose ; it finishes dry with a bit of spice .
Winter Bock , Gordon - Biersch , San Jose .
This is the only German - style lager in the list , but it ’s a great one .
Brewer Dan Biersch was trained in Germany , and all of his beers are authentic .
This is a 7.5 percent , strong beer in the German double bock style .
Malt to die for , a bit of hops .
A real winter sipper .
AND A FINAL NOTE :
In your hunt for that perfect holiday elixir , there ’s a brand - new book that can help .
It ’s “ Christmas Beer : The Cheeriest , Tastiest , and Most Unusual Holiday Beers , ” by Don Russell , Universe Publishing , New York , $ 19.95 .
Russell , who writes the Joe Sixpack column for the Philadelphia Daily News , combed the world for great holiday beers .
He came up with an awesome selection .
It ’s a great , informative read .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama cautioned supporters
Thursday against becoming complacent during the final days leading up to the election , noting he lost the New Hampshire primary despite a lead in the polls .
After debating Sen. John McCain , Sen. Barack Obama says there 's still plenty of campaigning to be done .
" For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky and think this is all set , I just [ have ] two words for you : New Hampshire , " the Democratic presidential nominee said during a fundraiser breakfast in New York .
" You know I 've been in these positions before where we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked .
And so that 's another good lesson that Hillary Clinton taught me . "
About 10 hours after debating Sen. John McCain , Obama urged top campaign contributors at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan to not be overconfident , despite leading in a number of national polls .
A CNN Poll of Polls calculated Wednesday showed him leading 51 percent to 42 percent .
" We 've got 19 days , " Obama said .
" We 're going to have to work absolutely as hard as we 've ever worked in our lives in order to just to get to the start of what is going to be a very difficult and very challenging but ultimately a very fulfilling four years where we can get this country back on track . "
Watch more of Obama 's comments »
Hours later , Obama spoke to a crowd in Londonderry , New Hampshire , lashing out at McCain 's debate tactics .
" Well , New Hampshire , last night we had a debate .
I think you saw a bit of the McCain attack strategy in action , " he said .
" But here 's what Sen .
McCain does n't seem to understand :
With the economy in turmoil and the American dream at risk , the American people do n't want to hear politicians attack each other -- you want to hear about how we 're going to attack the challenges facing middle - class families each and every day . "
Obama urged McCain to " debate our genuine differences on the issues that matter " rather than making the Arizona senator 's campaign " all about me . "
" The truth is , this campaign is about you .
It 's about your jobs .
It 's about your health care .
It 's about your retirement .
It 's about your children 's future , " he added .
Watch Obama discuss the economy »
McCain , speaking at an event in Downington , Pennsylvania , on Thursday , touched on his debate performance .
" We had a good debate last night .
It was a lot of fun .
... I thought I did pretty well , " he said to loud cheers .
McCain reiterated his position for taking America forward as economists say a recession is all but inevitable .
" We can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change ... I 'll take us in a new direction , " he said .
" Our troubles are getting worse , our enemies watch and we have to fight , and that 's what I 'll do for you ...
I 'm not afraid of the fight , I 'm ready for it . "
McCain also urged voters there to help him win Pennsylvania -- a state where a CNN Poll of Polls shows Obama leading his counterpart 50 percent to 40 percent .
" I need your vote .
We will carry Pennsylvania .
...
We need your help .
...
It 's a close race , my friends , " he said .
McCain also responded to Obama 's assertions that his crowds are unruly and use dangerous language to describe the Illinois senator .
" I can not tell you about how proud I am of you , " he said .
It was a line that he used in Wednesday night 's debate .
iReport.com : Obama survived knock - out punch
Obama and McCain are scheduled to speak Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith dinner , a political tradition that dates back to 1945 .
It honors the first Catholic ever nominated for president and was begun by Francis J. Spellman , the archbishop of New York 's Roman Catholic Archdiocese at the time .
The Republican presidential nominee will also appear on the " Late Show with David Letterman , " after canceling an earlier appearance , which left the host fuming .
Also Thursday , McCain 's running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , sounded a note of triumph about Wednesday 's presidential debate while campaigning in Bangor , Maine .
" They [ Obama and Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden ] look to the past because they 'd rather run against the current administration , it sounds like , and that strategy though , thankfully , it 's really starting to wear very very thin , " Palin said .
" As John McCain reminded Barack Obama last night , if he wanted to run against George Bush , he had his chance four years ago .
This year , the name on the ballot is John McCain -- and America knows that John McCain is his own man , he is the maverick . "
Though Maine has trended Democratic for nearly two decades , the McCain campaign is making a push in the state 's rural 2nd Congressional District , which is allotted one electoral vote independent of how the state votes at large .
Despite the McCain camp 's efforts , the Republican National Committee has stopped running advertisements in the state .
Palin later traveled to Elon , North Carolina .
At an afternoon rally at Elon University , near Greensboro , Palin pressed the audience to stand firm against accusations of negative campaigning , and told them to pay " close attention " to Obama 's record .
" It 's not mean - spirited and it's not negative campaigning when you call someone out on their record , " she said .
" So do n't let anyone , do n't let them make you believe that you 're being negative or mean - spirited or unpatriotic or unfair when you are asking about somebody 's record , OK ? "
After the rally , Palin continued on to a fundraiser at a home in Greensboro .
Biden is traveling to Los Angeles , California , taping appearances on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno " and the " Ellen Degeneres Show . "
CNN political producer Ed Hornick contributed to this report .

Microsoft plans one more release of the beta for its Internet Explorer 8 browser early next year .
After that , Microsoft plans to release the final version of IE8 .
The new Microsoft browser is expected to favor Internet standards in default mode , rather than Microsoft 's standards .
The final IE8 will have new features , including a privacy mode .
Microsoft has announced that its final update of the current beta Internet Explorer 8 browser will be released in next year 's first quarter -- after which it will launch the final release .
Some observers had been expecting the final update to be released this year .
After one more update of beta IE8 early in 2009 , the next public release is " typically called a ' release candidate , ' " Internet Explorer General Manager Dean Hachamovitch explained earlier this week on a company blog .
The release candidate , he noted , indicates the end of the beta period .
' Complete and Done '
" We want the technical community of people and organizations interested in Web browsers to take this update as a strong signal that IE8 is effectively complete and done , " he added .
" They should expect the final product to behave as this update does . "
Practically speaking , he noted , this means testers should feel comfortable testing sites and services with the early 2009 beta release , he said , making changes if needed for customer experience and reporting any critical issues back to Microsoft .
The final release , Hachamovitch said , will be delivered after the company responds to any feedback on critical issues .
He added that " we will be very selective about what changes we make between the next update and final release . "
However , a posting by a Microsoft technical manager earlier this year noted that IE 8 will be more favorably disposed to Internet standards , rather than proprietary Microsoft standards , as in the past .
So browsing with the default settings could cause problems for pages and services designed for earlier IE versions .
The default mode will include greater compatibility with W3C Internet guidelines , CSS 2.1 , and HTML 5 , as well as improved support for AJAX techniques .
An upcoming add - in from Microsoft can be used by developers so their pages are displayed according to IE7 .
New Privacy Features
Hachamovitch reported that Microsoft has been going through extensive data on IE8 's performance .
This includes 20 million IE sessions , hundreds of hours of usability lab sessions , thousands of threads from user forums , and hundreds of hours " listening and answering questions in meetings with partners and other important organizations . "
He added that this does n't include data from users who choose to say yes to report a Web page problem when IE 8 has crashed or otherwise failed to perform correctly .
The additional time before final release will allow Microsoft to tweak any bugs and finalize several expected new features .
News reports indicate that the additions are primarily in the area of privacy .
For instance , one feature could include include private browsing so users can control whether the browser saves their history and other related data .
Some observers have referred to this as porn mode .
( CNN ) --
Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield , from which they will carry out training flights for several days , the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday .
Russia 's Tupolev TU - 160 , pictured here in 2003 , is a long - range strategic bomber .
The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela 's Libertador military airfield and " will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters , after which they will return to the base , " Interfax reported , citing the Russian Defense Ministry .
Col .
Alexander Drobyshevsky , a ministry spokesman , told Interfax that NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13 - hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic .
" All flights by air force aircraft have been and are marked by strict conformity to the international rules on the use of air space over neutral waters , " Drobyshevsky told Interfax .
The U.S. will monitor the Russian training , said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the information .
On Monday , Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean .
The declaration came in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia 's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia , a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO .
Russia on Monday denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia , although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia , and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington .

Earlier this month , Chavez said Venezuela would welcome the Russian air force , according to Russian news agency Novosti .
" If Russian long - range bombers should need to land in Venezuela , we would not object to that either .
We will also welcome them , " Chavez said on September 1 , according to Novosti .

This is another oldskool tool , but still relevant !
TCP and UDP still work in the same way and firewalls / edge devices are still often configured wrongly .
Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass .
Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway .
If the gateway allows the traffic , it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message .
If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic , it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response .
To get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop - counts .
We do this in the same manner that traceroute works .
Once we have the gateway hopcount ( at that point the scan is said to be bound ) we can begin our scan .
It is significant to note the fact that the ultimate destination host does not have to be reached .
It just needs to be somewhere downstream , on the other side of the gateway , from the scanning host .

The three way Senate race in Minnesota took another bizarre turn this weekend , leaving all three candidates with a viable shot at becoming Minnesota 's next Senator .
Before I delve into the details , lets take a look at the current state of the race :
Donate : Al Franken ( D ) , Dean Barkley ( I ) , Norm Coleman ( R )
And our Senate to Presidential correlations :
VFA Projection [ 10/18 ] VFA Projection [ 11/2 ]
Dem Rep Dem - Rep Dem Rep Dem - Rep President 49.98 43.71 6.27 53.61 40.67 12.94 Senate 38.61 40.15 - 1.54 40.90 39.32 1.58 Pres - Sen 11.37 3.56 7.81 12.71 - 1.35 14.06
Norm Coleman is now polling slightly worse than John McCain , while Franken continues to lag behind the levels established by Obama .
If you take the numbers above at face value , Coleman is losing 1.35 % of McCain 's vote and Barkley appears to be making up the difference between Franken and Obama .
If these trends were to continue , Barkley would likely be eliminated but recent events have left the election wide open .
Heading back to last Monday ( 10/27 ) , Paul McKim , founder and former CEO of Houston - based Deep Marine Technology , filled a lawsuit alleging that an ally funneled $ 75,000 to the Colemans .
Reading directly from the Star Tribune article on the subject , " A Texas businessman has filed a lawsuit alleging that Minnesota multimillionaire Nasser Kazeminy used his Houston marine company to funnel $ 75,000 to Sen .
Norm Coleman last year via a Minneapolis insurance company that employs the senator 's wife . "
The Coleman campaign immediately went to work trying to kill the story , but the DFL may have gotten the best of him :
This suit was later withdrawn , but it did n't end there .
The Coleman campaign responded with a lawsuit of their own ; on Thursday October 30th , Norm Coleman filed a defamation lawsuit against Al Franken .
The Coleman campaign concluded that " Mr. Franken ha[d ] chosen to push the lines of believability far beyond the bounds of the truth . "
The " truth " Coleman is questioning relates to an ad released by Franken citing Norm Coleman as the " fourth most corrupt senator in Washington . "
Franken responded by saying this : " Our ads are factual and true , even if Norm Coleman does n't like being held accountable for his conduct .
Every time someone tries to hold Norm Coleman accountable , he runs to court to try to weasel his way out of it .
And none of the three prior times he 's done this has he been successful , and he wo n't be this time , either . "
To be fair the report Franken appears to be citing does not explicitly rank corrupt Senators , but they did place Norm Coleman , along with three other Republican senators in the " Dishonorable Mention " category .
Here 's where it gets interesting .
The lawsuit filled on Monday by Paul McKim was refiled again Thursday evening , just hours after Coleman 's defamation charge .
The Coleman campaign responded by calling the suit " false and defamatory ... My wife has been devastated by this .
She 's angry -- and she has a right to be -- and so am I .
So Coleman 's wife can be angry but Al can't ?
Seems semi-hypocritical but that 's not the most interesting nugget from the quote .
The use of " defamatory " was likely intended to cascade into the suit filed against Franken , and it may have worked .
If you do a google search for " Coleman Franken Defamatory " the results are roughly split between the two cases , but the issue still lingers .
The Coleman campaign tried to kill the issue again Friday night by saying the premise of the suit was " baseless and [ contained ] false claims ... being used to influence the outcome of the election . ''
Still sensing the urgency Coleman tried to link the funneling charge to Franken ; " If my opponents have any shred of decency left in this campaign -- stop attacking my family . "
Franken 's campaign , specifically Colleen Murray released a statement rebutting Coleman 's charge ; Franken had nothing to do with the lawsuit .
In fact the plaintiff justified the timing of the suit by stating that it has " absolutely nothing to do with politics . "
In any case the Coleman campaign released a new ad overtly linking Franken to the money funneling suit :
If the Coleman campaign is going to make a connection that just blatantly does n't exist they should at least be consistent .
" Yesterday , Coleman 's statement segued from the [ Star Tribune ] receiving a pre-filing ' copy of these false allegations ' to Franken ' running vicious , untrue attacks against me ' on filing day . "
I also thought Norm was done with negative ads , but apparently it 's not politically convenient anymore .
Al Franken and Norm Coleman clearly have a fight on their hands , but Barkley remains unscathed .
Within the entire body of this article Barkley 's name was not mentioned .
When the last debate occurs later today , Barkley can reside above the fray while Franken and Coleman undoubtedly duke it out .
If Barkley strikes the right cord he may very well be able to peel off 5 % from each of his opponents and sneak away with a victory .
We likely wo n't know the result of the whole lawsuit situation or the debate until the actual votes are counted .
The Future of Ephemeral Conversation
When he becomes president , Barack Obama will have to give up his BlackBerry .
Aides are concerned that his unofficial conversations would become part of the presidential record , subject to subpoena and eventually made public as part of the country ’s historical record .
This reality of the information age might be particularly stark for the president , but it ’s no less true for all of us .
Conversation used to be ephemeral .
Whether face - to - face or by phone , we could be reasonably sure that what we said disappeared as soon as we said it .
Organized crime bosses worried about phone taps and room bugs , but that was the exception .
Privacy was just assumed .
This has changed .
We chat in e-mail , over SMS and IM , and on social networking websites like Facebook , MySpace , and LiveJournal .
We blog and we Twitter .
These conversations — with friends , lovers , colleagues , members of our cabinet — are not ephemeral ; they leave their own electronic trails .
We know this intellectually , but we have n’t truly internalized it .
We type on , engrossed in conversation , forgetting we ’re being recorded and those recordings might come back to haunt us later .
Oliver North learned this , way back in 1987 , when messages he thought he had deleted were saved by the White House PROFS system , and then subpoenaed in the Iran - Contra affair .
Bill Gates learned this in 1998 when his conversational e-mails were provided to opposing counsel as part of the antitrust litigation discovery process .
Mark Foley learned this in 2006 when his instant messages were saved and made public by the underage men he talked to .
Paris Hilton learned this in 2005 when her cell phone account was hacked , and Sarah Palin learned it earlier this year when her Yahoo e-mail account was hacked .
Someone in George W. Bush ’s administration learned this , and millions of e-mails went mysteriously and conveniently missing .
Ephemeral conversation is dying .
Cardinal Richelieu famously said , : If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man , I would find something in them to have him hanged . ”
When all our ephemeral conversations can be saved for later examination , different rules have to apply .
Conversation is not the same thing as correspondence .
Words uttered in haste over morning coffee , whether spoken in a coffee shop or thumbed on a Blackberry , are not official pronouncements .
Discussions in a meeting , whether held in a boardroom or a chat room , are not the same as answers at a press conference .
And privacy is n’t just about having something to hide ; it has enormous value to democracy , liberty , and our basic humanity .
We ca n’t turn back technology ; electronic communications are here to stay and even our voice conversations are threatened .
But as technology makes our conversations less ephemeral , we need laws to step in and safeguard ephemeral conversation .
We need a comprehensive data privacy law , protecting our data and communications regardless of where it is stored or how it is processed .
We need laws forcing companies to keep it private and delete it as soon as it is no longer needed .
Laws requiring ISPs to store e-mails and other personal communications are exactly what we do n’t need .
Rules pertaining to government need to be different , because of the power differential .
Subjecting the president ’s communications to eventual public review increases liberty because it reduces the government ’s power with respect to the people .
Subjecting our communications to government review decreases liberty because it reduces our power with respect to the government .
The president , as well as other members of government , need some ability to converse ephemerally — just as they ’re allowed to have unrecorded meetings and phone calls — but more of their actions need to be subject to public scrutiny .
But laws can only go so far .
Law or no law , when something is made public it ’s too late .
And many of us like having complete records of all our e-mail at our fingertips ; it ’s like our offline brains .
In the end , this is cultural .
The Internet is the greatest generation gap since rock and roll .
We ’re now witnessing one aspect of that generation gap : the younger generation chats digitally , and the older generation treats those chats as written correspondence .
Until our CEOs blog , our Congressmen Twitter , and our world leaders send each other LOLcats – until we have a Presidential election where both candidates have a complete history on social networking sites from before they were teenagers – we are n’t fully an information age society .
When everyone leaves a public digital trail of their personal thoughts since birth , no one will think twice about it being there .
Obama might be on the younger side of the generation gap , but the rules he ’s operating under were written by the older side .
It will take another generation before society ’s tolerance for digital ephemera changes .
This essay previously appeared on The Wall Street Journal website ( not the print newspaper ) , and is an update of something I wrote previously .
Posted on November 24 , 2008 at 2:06 PM • 53 Comments
This is how the candidates spent their day yesterday .
Obama worked with four families that are facing very difficult times and presented his policies on the economy , health care , job creation , and education .
He spent 30 minutes talking about the change we need to make to ensure a brighter future .
Obama listened to these families ’ fears and worries ; about how one had to put off an operation because they really could n’t afford it .
He talked about his tax cuts for 95 % of American Families .
How companies have an obligation to their workers when they make promises about pension programs .
That law should be enacted to prevent companies from reneging on these promises , so that people can retire with dignity .
To receive what they have worked their entire life for .
His well thought out policies , whether you agree or disagree with them , puts the average American first , not big corporations .
His campaign is about the big issues facing each of us everyday – not once did we hear McCain , Palin or Republicans .
“ There is not a Liberal America , there is not a Conservative America , there is only the United States of America . ”
This is one of his most powerful quotes during his program while he made his case to all of us .
He means it when he says he is his brother ’s keeper .
Obama has pledged to always listen even if he disagrees and admits he will not be a perfect President .
No matter what you believe in , I think most people value honesty , which seems to be in short supply lately .
Now to show you a contrast , how did John McCain and Sarah Palin spend their day yesterday .
John McCain slammed
The Los Angeles Times Wednesday for refusing to release a videotape that the newspaper ’s editors say shows Barack Obama praising a Chicago professor who served as a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization when it was a U.S. - designated terror group .
Speaking to two Florida radio stations , the Republican presidential candidate suggested a double standard in reporting by the newspaper and said if he were hanging out with neo - Nazis he ’d bet the tape would be made public .
The Times says it is standing by its promise not to show the tape , which it got from an anonymous source .
The newspaper also has not provided a transcript of the 2003 farewell party for University of Chicago professor Rashid Khalidi .
Among others in attendance at the soiree were former Weather Underground founders William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn .
“ Apparently this is a tape with a dinner that Mr. Ayers … was at , and also … one of the leading spokespersons for the PLO .
Now , why that should not be made public is beyond me , ” McCain told La Kalle radio .
“ I guarantee you , if there was a tape with me and Sarah Palin and some neo - Nazi or one of those , you think that that tape would n’t be made public ?
Of course , Americans need to know , particularly about Ayers , and also about the PLO .
So hopefully there will be enough pressure on the L.A .
Times that it ’ll come out , but its really unfortunate that we have to go through this , ” McCain continued .
Palin too lambasted the newspaper for its inaction .
“ If there ’s a Pulitzer Prize category for excelling in cow - towing , then the LA Times , you ’re winning , ” she said .
That is a big difference , one is working on the problems and difficulties facing America and the other is worried about a tape being released .
It boils down to , one of them wasted an entire day trying to smear the other candidate .
Now which one is actually concerned about you ?
Which one is listening to your concerns and fears ?
My parting thought is one of Obama ’s quotes :
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time .
We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for .
We are the change that we seek .

November 21 , 2008
Dear Mr. President Elect : On October 17 , 2008 PRG published an open letter to the candidates callingfor them to make preparations to end the six - decade truth embargo regarding an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race .
This letter reiterates that request .
Your staff is now aware that letters , faxes and emails are arriving at your former Senate office and the Washington , DC transition headquarters .
In general this correspondence will ask of you the following :
1 ) demand a full briefing from your military services and intelligence agencies regarding what they know and what they are doing about extraterrestrial related phenomena .
If you are told you do not have the proper clearance for this information , replace that person with someone who has read the Constitution .
2 ) press for open and comprehensive congressional hearings to take testimony from scores of government witnesses who have already come forward with extraordinary evidence and are prepared to testify under oath .
3 ) formally acknowledge the extraterrestrial presence and finally end the truth embargo after 61 years .
4 ) make available for open development technologies which have been secretly studied and reverse engineered for decades with unlimited black budget funding .
These technologies are derived from extraterrestrial vehicles and are now essential to overcome the environmental , economic and societal challenges of our time .
PRG is well aware of your intention to launch a high technology “ New Deal ” code named “ New Apollo Project ” to restore America ’s economy .
This massive program to subsidize green technology development , create jobs , expand the manufacturing base and reverse the trade imbalance will be likely accompanied by legislation prohibiting overseas hiring and offshore manufacturing .
All well and good , but it will not be enough .
The challenges are too great and the response to these challenges too long delayed .
It is essential the paradigm breaking technologies hidden in unacknowledged special access programs and sequestered behind the extraterrestrial truth embargo be included .
If you are in need of counsel to assist you in these matters , you have but to turn to your transition co-chair , John Podesta .
His efforts to end the truth embargo and release all relevant government documents date back to at least 1993 and the Rockefeller Initiative .
PRG believes he is fully aware of the extraterrestrial presence and is committed to creating more open , transparent governance .
In this he is in sync with the chief financial backer of his Center for American Progress think tank , George Soros .
Reach out to your party ’s allies within the military services and intelligence agencies .
When you take office conduct the necessary meetings with the cross agency committees managing the extraterrestrial presence issue .
In the spring of 2009 , before the truth embargo becomes your embargo , initiate the most profound event in human history and begin rebuilding the trust of the American people in their government and the standing of your country in the world .
Respectfully ,

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Wednesday he will break off from campaigning to help on a Wall Street rescue plan and asked that a Friday night debate with Democratic rival Barack Obama be postponed .
McCain , in a statement to reporters , said he would suspend his campaign on Thursday to return to Washington and called on Obama to join him , saying he had spoken to the Democrat about doing so .
He said he did not believe a current $ 700 billion banking rescue plan proposed by the Bush administration would pass the U.S. Congress in its current form .
He urged President George W. Bush to call for a bipartisan meeting of congressional leaders , including him and Obama , to try to find an agreement .
“ It ’s time for both parties to come together to solve this problem , ” the Arizona senator said .
“ We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved . ”
He added : “ I am directing my campaign to work with the Obama campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates to delay Friday night ’s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis . ”
McCain and Obama , an Illinois senator , face off in the presidential election on November 4 .
McCain said it was essential to pass legislation to deal with what he called a “ historic crisis . ”
“ If we do not , credit will dry up , with devastating consequences for our economy .
People will no longer be able to buy homes and their life savings will be at stake .
Businesses will not have enough money to pay their employees .
If we do not act , ever corner of our country will be impacted .
We cannot allow this to happen , ” he said .
The Bush administration is pressing Congress to approve the rescue plan , saying it is needed to avert serious consequences for the financial industry and the wider economy .
Imagine :
You have been selected as one of the first six people to go to Mars and your sole mission is to set up a manned outpost on the Red Planet .
Forget the science , forget the long - term goal to spread humanity amongst the planets , your one and only task is to survive .
If you live long enough to put your boot print in the Martian regolith , or long enough to eat your first meal , sleep to see your second sol or celebrate your proto - colony ’s first home cooked meal , it ’s a bonus .
You have to survive long enough to give mankind a foothold to begin living on Mars .
Assuming you and your five crew have set up camp .
You ’ve landed next to all the basic supplies you ’ll need for the next few years , plus the equipment to build a sustainable settlement .
The pressure of making it through the first day is off .
You have a routine , and everyone appears to be doing well .
How will you fill your time ?
No doubt simply living will fill all your waking hours , but humans being humans , you ’ll want to make your experience unique , you ’ll want to have some fun .
Whether it ’s taking some time to think about Earth and your family , or it ’s taking a hike up the nearest mesa to claim the early Mars World Record of “ climbing the highest , ever . ”
If you could take 5 things to Mars with you ( ignoring the essentials like water , food , toothbrush , socks , iPod ) , what would they be ?
Assuming cost and weight is n’t an obstacle ( I ’ll be a billionaire and I ’ve chartered a SpaceX Falcon 9
Heavy just to transport “ personal items ” ) here ’s my top five luxury items I ’d take to Mars with me …
In a recent Universe Today article , I discussed Buzz Aldrin ’s views on colonizing Mars .
Aldrin believes we should send a small number of people to the Red Planet to set up the first manned outpost with the intent to send more in the future .
However , the first group of planetary pioneers should n’t expect to come home .
So , if you were going to Mars on a one - way trip , what luxury / useful items would you like to take with you ?
Here ’s a list of five I think would be useful / interesting …
5. Photographs / videos of home
This one might not be very surprising , but it would be essential for your well - being .
I ’m sure there is a serious psychological reason for remembering “ home ” when in an unfamiliar situation ( like … um , being on Mars ) , but critically I ’d like to remember what my loved ones looked like and to remember what green looks like .
Let ’s face it , you wont see vibrant green leaves any time soon , and the only thing that will come close to green salad in your dinner bowl will be mould .
Also , be sure to bring your own camera to Mars .
If you do n’t live to tell the tale of your first few days on Mars , at least you ’ll have a legacy in images of what it ’s like to have lived on an alien world ( you ’ll spring to the top of the ranks of “ famous – but deceased – Mars photographers ” ) .
4. Barley seeds , bamboo , hemp … grapes ?
You ’ll certainly have a supply of terrestrial seeds for growing food and other useful plants ( possibly for a natural form of life support etc. ) , but what about seeds of plants with not - so - obvious applications ?
Take bamboo for example , it ’s a flexible , tough and easy - to - grow building material .
You can build everything from housing to furniture with fully grown bamboo plants .
An added bonus with bamboo is its growth rate , if the conditions are right , bamboo can grow up to 1 ft ( 0.3 metres ) per day .
Depending on the growing conditions initially , and depending on whether you are able to create a nutritious soil from Mars regolith ( Phoenix thinks Mars “ soil ” is more soil - like than we gave it credit for ) , you could have a bamboo forest inside your Mars greenhouse very soon ( possibly solving the “ green issue ” described in # 5 ) .
For more about the uses of bamboo in Mars construction , check out the Mars Homestead Project .
Hemp is also another fantastic plant that can be used in a whole range of industrial processes .
From fabricating paper and clothing to being an ingredient for food , hemp is a fast - growing resource .
Some varieties of hemp also have medicinal applications ( and some obvious recreational applications … ) .
And what about barley and wheat ?
You ca n’t climb / drive all the way up Olympus Mons celebrating the feat without a cold beer can you ?
Also , if there was ever a better excuse to drink copious amounts of wine , this is it ( so plant some vines in your greenhouse ) .
Red wine contains an anti-oxidant called resveratrol linked with helping the human body fight off the damaging effects of free radicals and radiation .
As you ’d be exposed to a higher - than - normal level of solar radiation ( as Mars does n’t have a protective magnetic field or thick atmosphere ) , regular wine drinking sessions would be in order .
Get working on setting up Mars ’ microbrewery / winery ; if you ’re going to be on this alien world for the rest of your days , you may as well live comfortably ( and a little drunk ) …
3 . War of the Worlds audio
A must for all those who had the bejesus scared out of them when they were a kid .
Whether you take the original 1938 broadcast ( with Orson Welles narrating ) , a show that terrified thousands during a special Halloween broadcast in the US , or the 1976 Jeff Wayne musical version , it ’s up to you .
The 1938 version was a 60 - minute show presented in a documentary style , leading many to think there was actually a Martian invasion under way in New Jersey .
Both versions are based on H. G. Wells ’ novel The War of the Worlds which depicted a Martian invasion in Woking , England in the 19th Century ( please , do n’t think about taking Steven Spielberg ’s painful 2005 movie version , it ’s just not the same ) .
The Jeff Wayne musical has famous tracks such as “ Forever Autumn ” and “ Thunder Child ” or the hard - hitting theme “ The Eve of War ” ( “ Da Da daaaaaa , Da Da daaaaaa “ ) that could be played throughout your habitat ’s sound system , or blasted out over the Martian planes ( but it would have to be loud , the Mars atmosphere is less efficient at propagating sound waves ) .
The Phoenix Mars Lander also has H. G. Wells ’ original War of the Worlds text on the “ Visions of Mars ” CD board , so at least you ’ll be able to make the trip to Vastistas Borealis to pull the CD off the deck of the lander .
So do n’t worry about bringing the book with you .
Why would you want to go through the hassle of doing all this ?
You mean apart from the awesomeness of being able to have War of the Worlds pumping at full volume , on Mars ?
Well , as you are invaders from Earth , I ’m sure that if there is any Martian life on the planet , they ’ll appreciate the irony .
2. Dune Buggy
Mars has the same land area as the Earth .
Plus there ’s no vast volumes of water ( such as oceans ) .
This makes Mars a driver ’s heaven .
Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity have been spinning their wheels on the planet for the last few years , generally without too many hitches .
Admittedly they are slow movers , careful not to bump into any rover - sized boulders , but they get around with apparent ease .
There is little doubt that the first manned expedition to Mars will include a wheeled vehicle of some description , but many of the Mars carts currently being designed are bulky , crawling limps of awkward - looking wheels and axles ( think a bigger version of the Apollo lunar buggies ) .
How about modifying a dune buggy to carry one or two suited colonists purely for recreational use ?
Mars has ample regions of sand and barchan dunes – ideal for an adrenaline - filled romp in low - G at high speed .
There also appears to be large areas of frozen , sandy plains – a great opportunity to eventually race neighbouring colonies when they start popping up around the planet .
How about zooming along at the bottom of the deepest valley in the Solar System , Valles Marineris , or scooting up the side of the highest mountain , Olympus Mons ?
Forget the rocket - racing league , this will be the Mars Dune Buggy Championships !
1. Golf clubs
Want to swing like Tiger Woods ?
Well now you have the perfect chance .
Whether you ’re a golfer or not , it would be hard not to be excited about the possibility of thwacking a golf ball on the surface of Mars .
However , you probably would n’t be able to walk between shots , this is n’t your average round ( you might need # 2 to transport you from tee - to - pin ) .
On the 1971 Apollo 14 mission to the Moon , Alan Shepard became the first person to play extraterrestrial golf , firing a ball a little under 200 meters over the lunar surface .
He had to do a one - handed drive as the space suit was too restrictive for a normal grip on the club .
Then in 2006 , cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin launched a ball on a million - mile orbital trip from the space station as a marketing stunt for a Canadian golf club manufacturer .
So the next step would be a drive on the Martian surface , and with the help of the Mars gravity and thin atmosphere , even my horrible golfing skills will be well hidden .
Watch the NASA video of Alan Shepard tee shot off on the Moon :
Watch the NASA video of Mikhail Tyurin tee shot off the space station :
Usually golf club drivers are angled for shallow strikes ( ~10° ) , sending the golf ball across the fairway , countering air drag with lift .
On Mars , as the atmosphere is so thin , the angle would need to be increased toward an optimum ( for a vacuum ) angle of 45° .
On Earth , Tiger Woods can regularly achieve a tee - shot distance of over 300 meters .
On Mars , with a surface gravity 38 % ( approximately 1/3 ) that of the Earth , and very tenuous atmosphere , a similar Woods drive ( with a more lofted golf club , at 45° , say ) would easily clear 1 km ( 1000 meters , or 0.62 miles ) .
So generally , assuming you are able to execute a good golf swing inside your Mars space suit , you can expect your golf drives to be three times longer than on Earth .
Awesome .
All packed ?
Let ’s go !
In conclusion ?
If a manned expedition to Mars does become a reality , in all likelihood the space agency responsible will have plans for a return trip ( despite the cost , a “ survive or die ” mission would probably be politically , and morally , unacceptable ) .
But in case it is a one way trip , be sure to have everything with you ( as you wo n’t be coming back to collect it ) …
McCain camp hits up Russian envoy
On a day on which McCain campaign manager Rick Davis hinted that Obama was taking foreign money , the Russian Mission to the United Nations has released a standard - issue fundraising letter gone a bit astray :
It was addressed to the Russian envoy to the U.N. , Vitaly Churkin , at the mission 's address , but without his title .
As the Russian newswire RIA - Novosti tells it :
Russia 's permanent mission to the UN has received a letter from U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain asking for financial support of his election campaign , the mission said in a statement on Monday .
" We have received a letter from Senator John McCain with a request for a financial donation to his presidential election campaign .
In this respect we have to reiterate that neither Russia 's permanent mission to the UN nor the Russian government or its officials finance political activities in foreign countries , " the statement said .
According to Ruslan Bakhtin , press secretary of the Russian mission , the letter dated September 29 and signed by McCain , was addressed to Vitaly Churkin , Russia 's envoy to the UN , and arrived on October 16 .
The ambassador 's title was not included in the letter , and was not clear why the letter had taken over two weeks to arrive .
Enclosed was a request for a donation of up to $ 5,000 to McCain 's election campaign to be returned with a check or permission to withdraw the money from the donor 's credit card until October 24 .
Bakhtin confirmed the story to Politico , and would n't comment on the added oddity of the error coming from the anti-Russian McCain .
" We just find it amusing , " he said .

8,000 Beduin stake their claim as the lost tribe of Barack Obama
He has a host of relatives in exotic locations from Hawaii to Kenya , and during his run for the American presidency he discovered that he had an aunt living in Boston .
Now Barack Obama is being claimed by not one but as many as 8,000 Beduin tribesmen in northern Israel .
Although the spokesman for the lost tribe of Obama has yet to reveal the documentary evidence that he says he possesses to support his claim , people are flocking from across the region to pay their respects to the “ Bedu Obama ” , whose social standing has gone through the roof .
“ We knew about it years ago but we were afraid to talk about it because we did n’t want to influence the election , ” Abdul Rahman Sheikh Abdullah , a 53 - year - old local council member , told The Times in the small Beduin village of Bir al - Maksour in the Israeli region of Galilee .
“ We wrote a letter to him explaining the family connection . ”
Mr Obama ’s team have not responded to the letter so far but that has not dampened Sheikh Abdullah ’s festivities .

Mass extinction , rainforests rapidly disappearing , clouds of pollution spreading across the globe and whopping carbon footprints are only a few of the incredible environmental quandaries we ’re facing today , and the numbers will blow your mind .
We produce enough trash to circle the globe hundreds and hundreds of times , and the amount of money wasted on the Iraq war could have solved many of the world ’s problems .
It ’s not all bad news , though : we ’ve got thousands of years worth of geothermal power at our fingertips , and the potential of renewable energy is amazing indeed .
Here are 15 of the most mind - boggling green facts and statistics , from a patch of plastic trash in the Pacific to the exploding human population .
Oxygen - starved dead zones that cannot sustain life now cover an area roughly the size of the state of Oregon .
Spanish researchers also recently found that many species die off at oxygen levels well above what is now considered uninhabitable , suggesting that the extent of dead zones in coastal areas is greater than previously known .
Dead zones are caused by excess nitrogen from farm fertilizers , factory and vehicle emissions , sewage and other pollution runoff .
1 % of Australia ’s untapped geothermal power potential could provide enough energy to last 26,000 years .
Sure , we ’ve got a long way to go before we ’re actually able to use that energy , but the fact that such energy is available paints a much brighter picture of our energy future , especially since geothermal power is one of the lowest priced forms of renewable energy .
The Australian Geothermal Energy Association reports that current government policy allows up to 2200 megawatts of geothermal energy to be developed by 2020 , which would represent 40 % of the government ’s current renewable energy target .
The Australian government has also announced that they will invest $ 50 million to help develop geothermal power .

Only 1 % of China ’s 560 million city residents breathe air that is considered safe by the European Union .
And , this severe air pollution problem , which has led to cancer becoming China ’s leading cause of death , is no longer affecting the Chinese people alone .
China ’s dirty air is spreading across the globe as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides spewed by the country ’s many factories and coal - fired power plants fall as acid rain upon South Korea and Japan .
The heavy brown clouds of pollution that hover over Asia are now spreading as far as to the west coast of the U.S. Much of the particulate pollution over Los Angeles originates in China .
The Wall Street bailout is costing taxpayers around $ 700 billion and growing .
Yet , just 4 % of the Wall Street bailout could end world hunger .
Though the problem is often touted as insurmountable , in truth , global food insecurity could be completely solved by creating agricultural programs that would cost about $ 30 billion a year .
854 million people in the world – one in seven – do not get enough food to be healthy , making hunger the number one risk to health worldwide .
Less than 1 % of the world ’s freshwater is readily available for human use .
The amount of water that ’s safe for us to use is declining sharply due to pollution and contamination .
87 % of freshwater resources are used for agriculture , as much of 60 % of that is wasted due to inefficient watering systems .
With the population boom and global warming , we ’re going to be fighting over water by mid-century .
In fact , in Asia – where water has always been considered an abundant resource – per capita availability of freshwater has declined by 40% - 60 % between 1955 and 1990 , and most Asian countries are expected to have severe water shortages by 2025 .
Despite these problems , many people – Americans and Australians in particular – are wasting water as if it will always be plentiful .
The average American uses far more water than citizens of other countries – about 550 liters per day .
The average American household uses 300 gallons of water daily , with many wasting thousands of gallons every year on lawn irrigation .
America is the queen of trash .
Every day in the U.S. , we produce enough trash to equal the weight of the Empire State Building .
We throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour , produce enough styrofoam cups annually to circle the earth 436 times and trash enough office paper to build a 12 - foot wall form Los Angeles to New York City .
We throw away 570 disposable diapers each second , and toss out enough aluminum cans to rebuild our commercial air fleet every three months .
Each year we fill enough garbage trucks to stretch from Earth halfway to the moon .
And of course , not all trash even makes it to the landfill .
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch , which is a swirling vortex of waste and debris in the Pacific Ocean , covers an area twice the size of the continental U.S. and is believed to hold almost 100 million tons of garbage .
The Iraq War has cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 3 trillion , and according to The Washington Post , that ’s a conservative estimate .
A website called 3trillion.org lets you go on a shopping spree with that money , and EarthFirst.com found that we could have spent that money on all of the following and much more : universal health care for every American , switching all of the U.S. to run on solar power , building a national rapid transit system , cleaning up pollution in major cities , achieving universal literacy , repairing the damage done by Hurricane Katrina , providing non-violent leadership training for 10 million leaders across the world and buying new clothing , shoes , coats and school supplies for 10 million children .
20 to 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide every year .
Only 11.4 % of that is recovered for “ recycling ” , and of that amount , very little actually ends up getting recycled .
The crew of 60 Minutes recently followed a container of e-waste that was supposed to be headed for recycling , that was instead illegally dumped in China .
Toxic chemicals like cadmium , lead , mercury , chromium and polyvinyl chlorides from these discarded electronics contaminate poor Hong Kong communities like Guiyu , which has been found to have the highest levels of cancer - causing dioxins in the world .
And , the problem is getting worse by the day : electronic waste is the fastest - growing waste stream worldwide .
Americans throw out about 130,000 computers every day , and over 100 million cell phones annually .
Within 10 years , wind power could provide 20 % of America ’s power .
North Dakota alone could theoretically produce enough wind - generated power to meet the needs of more than a fourth of U.S. electricity demand .
And , offshore wind turbines have the potential to produce as much power as all of the power plants in the United States .
America definitely needs a new modernized power grid to harness wind energy , but as T. Boone Pickens points out , “ If the government commits to modernizing our nation ’s power grid in the same fashion that we modernized our highways , we can make some serious progress in a relatively short time . ”
Recycling one ton of paper saves 17 trees , 2 barrels of oil , 4,100 kilowatts of energy , 3.2 cubic yards of landfill space and 60 pounds of air pollution .
Recycling one aluminum can saves enough electricity to power a TV for three hours , and aluminum cans can be recycled an unlimited number of times .
Recycling a ton of glass saves the equivalent to 9 gallons of oil .
Increasing steel recycling by 50 % would save the energy equivalent to 7 nuclear power plants .
These statistics show just how important recycling really is , and how much we need to ramp it up .
The human population on earth has grown more in the last 50 years than it did in the previous 4 million years .
It took almost all of human history – until the early 1800s – to reach a global population of 1 billion .
Today , we ’re at over 6.7 billion and adding an estimated 74 million people to the planet every year .
In fact , the United Nations believes that we ’ll reach 9 billion by 2050 .
Such a large population will put a huge strain on already stretched resources , making severe food and water shortages far more likely .
One in four mammals is at risk of extinction .
Marine mammals in particular face even steeper odds , with one in three threatened .
Humans are mostly to blame as we ’ve encroached upon their habitats , polluted the earth and hunted far too many of them .
The problem is especially bad in Asia , where agricultural expansion and development of infrastructure has led to a staggering statistic : 79 percent of the continent ’s primate species face extinction .
Across the world , 78 percent of marine mammals are threatened by accidental deaths such as getting caught in fishing nets intended for other species .
At least 50 million acres of rainforest are lost every year , totaling an area the size of England , Wales and Scotland combined .
More than 50 percent of all living creatures on the earth reside in tropical rainforests , so with rainforest destruction they ’re disappearing at a rate of 100 species per day .
Experts believe that 5 to 10 percent of tropical rainforest species will become extinct by during the next half - century .
They ’re also projecting that half of the remaining Amazon rainforest may be destroyed by the year 2030 .
The World Wildlife Fund concluded that 55 percent of the world ’s largest rainforest stands to be severely damaged from agriculture , drought , fire , logging and livestock ranching over the next 22 years .
Average temperatures will increase by as much as 12 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at the current pace .
Even a temperature rise of just 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit would create a catastrophic domino effect , wiping out hundreds of species , bringing extreme food and water shortages and causing floods that would displace hundreds of millions of people .
These findings by an expert panel of scientists leave little doubt that humans are to blame for global warming , and affirms that current greenhouse gas emissions are totally unsustainable .
A rise in temperature of 7.2 degrees in this century would see the world warm as much in 100 years as it did during the last 15,000 years since the end of the last ice age .
If the entire world lived like the average American , we ’d need 5 planets to provide enough resources .
Even if you ’re the most dedicated treehugger out there , if you ’re American , your carbon footprint is still double the per-capita average of most of the world .
Though America would have to reduce our carbon - emitting habits by 83 % in order to be sustainable , that ’s not quite as insurmountable as it sounds .
A shift toward renewable energy , conservation , more efficient waste management and greater concentrations of people living in dense urban communities will go far toward decreasing our carbon footprint as a nation .

With the sharp stock - market decline for Citigroup rapidly becoming a full - blown crisis of confidence , the company ’s executives on Friday entered into talks with federal officials about how to stabilize the struggling financial giant .
In a series of tense meetings and telephone calls , the executives and officials weighed several options , including whether to replace Citigroup ’s chief executive , Vikram S. Pandit , or sell all or part of the company .
Other options discussed included a public endorsement from the government or a new financial lifeline , people involved in the talks said .
The course of action , however , remained uncertain on Friday night , these people said , and other options may yet emerge .
But after a year of gaping losses and an accelerating decline in share price , Citigroup , which has $ 2 trillion in assets and operations in scores of countries , is running out of time , analysts said .
In June , leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints made a fateful decision .
They called on California Mormons to donate their time and money to the campaign for Proposition 8 , which would overturn a state Supreme Court ruling that permitted gay marriage .
That push helped the initiative win narrow passage on election day .
And it has made the Mormon Church , which for years has striven to be seen as part of the American mainstream , a political target .
Protesters have massed outside Mormon temples nationwide .
For every donation to a fund to overturn Proposition 8 , a postcard is sent to the president of the Mormon Church .
Supporters of gay marriage have proposed a boycott of Utah businesses , and someone burned a Book of Mormon outside a temple near Denver .
“ It ’s disconcerting to Latter - day Saints that Mormonism is still the religious tradition that everybody loves to hate , ” said Melissa Proctor , who teaches at Harvard Divinity School .

As an indication of how seriously the Mormon leadership takes the recent criticism , the council that runs the church -- the First Presidency -- released a statement Friday decrying what it portrayed as a campaign not just against Mormons but all religious people who voted their conscience .
“ People of faith have been intimidated for simply exercising their democratic rights , ” the statement said .
“ These are not actions that are worthy of the democratic ideals of our nation .
The end of a free and fair election should not be the beginning of a hostile response in America . ”
Jim Key , a spokesman for the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center , said barbs by gay marriage activists were directed at church leadership , not individual Mormons .
“ We ’re making a statement that no one ’s religious beliefs should be used to deny fundamental rights to others , ” he said .

Proposition 8 opponents estimate that members of the Mormon Church gave more than $ 20 million to the effort to pass the measure , though that is difficult to confirm because records of campaign donations do not include religious affiliation .
For years , church leaders have tried to blunt the assertion that Mormonism is somehow out of the political and cultural mainstream .
The backlash over gay marriage carries risks and rewards toward that goal .
To support Proposition 8 , the Mormon Church entered into a coalition with other religious organizations , including evangelical groups that have tended to view Mormons warily .
It was a Catholic bishop , Mormon officials said , who requested the Mormon Church bring its members into the fight .
Now those groups are rallying behind the embattled church .
“ Being against gay marriage puts the church right in the mainstream of American religious behavior , ” said Quin Monson , a political science professor at Brigham Young University .

But the outrage directed toward the church could hurt its efforts to expand .
“ The backlash is going on all over the country , ” said Jan Shipps , a prominent scholar of modern Mormonism who is an emeritus professor at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis .
“ There are people who had a lot of respect for the Mormons who now say , ‘ Well , they ’re just like the Christian right . ’ ”
That ’s ironic , Shipps said , given that the Mormon Church has a more tolerant stance on homosexuality than some evangelical groups .
The church has pointedly declined to state that homosexuality is a choice .
And it has cautioned against programs that purport to “ cure ” same - sex attraction , even though Mormon theology holds that marriage is a divine relationship between men and women that continues into the afterlife .
Also , Shipps said , though the church had been riding high ever since the successful 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , the gay marriage fight and other recent setbacks have forced the church to deal with skepticism over its faith and history .

First there was former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ’s unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination .
Many in the church were shocked that Romney ’s Mormon faith was a source of discomfort for some voters .
“ Latter - day Saints were just amazed to think there was such bigotry in the country , ” church spokesman Michael Otterson said .
And a raid on a polygamous breakaway sect in Texas last spring was a reminder of the church ’s practice of multiple marriages in the 19th century , even though the Mormon Church has long renounced polygamy .
“ That whole story in Texas was probably much worse for the church ’s image than Proposition 8 , ” Monson said .
Advertisement
Some have suggested that Mormons might have been eager to cement partnerships with other churches , especially because evangelical voters were particularly distrustful of Romney ’s faith .
But Otterson dismissed that possibility .
“ That kind of thinking would never even factor into the thinking of church leadership , ” he said .
“ The church could n’t remain silent on a pivotal issue like this . ”

method_missing magic - emulating Groovy's " it " in Ruby
2 Oct , 2006
Inspired variously by :
I 've cooked up a shortcut for generating simple blocks , meaning that rather than
people.select { |x | x.name.length > 10 }
I can write such things as :
people.select(&its.name.length > 10 )
Disclaimer : I think this is more " cool hack " than useful tool ; it 's probably too much of an alien artifact to be useful in real life .
And it 's not generally applicable , like " it " in Groovy .
And really , it 's not that much more verbose to use a block .
Aaaaaanyway ...
The trick is that the above is parsed as
people.select(&( its.name.length .>( 10 ) ) )
The " its " method creates a MessageBuffer object , which records the messages ( method invocations ) sent it 's way :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > require ' message_buffer ' => true irb( main ) :002:0 > its => #< MessageBuffer:0x6b40b44 @messages= [ ] > irb( main ) :003:0 > its.name.length < 10 => #< MessageBuffer:0x6b3e678 @messages= [ [ : name ] , [ : length ] , [ :<, 10 ] ] >
Now , the " & " operator coerces it 's argument to a Proc , and MessageBuffer #to_proc generates a Proc that replays all the recorded messages .
Q.E.D .
The full source - code is fairly short , so I 'll include it inline :
class MessageBuffer instance_methods .each do |m| undef_method m unless m =~ /^( __|respond_to|inspect ) / end def initialize @messages = [ ] end def method_missing ( * message ) @messages << message # record the message self # return self so we can keep recording end def __replay_all_messages__(obj ) @messages.inject( obj ) do |obj , message| obj.__send__(*message ) end end def to_proc proc { |x| __replay_all_messages__(x ) } end end def its MessageBuffer.new end
GOP Telegraphing Their Own Fraud By Accusing Dems ?
The recent raid of the Nevada offices of ACORN was outrageous to suggest the voter registration organization was illegally registering duplicate voters to aid a candidate who is leading in national polls by double digits .
If ACORN was so stupid to risk their own credibility and muck up an election in which Barack Obama has been pulling away from rival John McCain anyway , they ’d have to either be total fools – or perhaps framed to look evil by those actually doing the tampering ?
This suddenly stepped - up enforcement of voter integrity issues since McCain has fallen behind in polls is stunning .
Since 2000 , we ’ve seen numerous alarming reports by government agencies and watchdog groups furiously publishing evidence of voting improprieties and have seen nothing done about it .
The bipartisan HAVA recommendations have gone ignored and unimplemented .
The 500 page Conyers Report detailed questionable tactics , long lines , intimidation and disinformation robo-calls , deceptive registration cards and most glaringly , hackable electronic voting machines ( EVMs ) .
A separate independent GAO report confirmed the 2004 election was decided on vulnerable equipment .
Independent audits have demonstrated the machines are as much as 10 % off even without intentional tampering due to glitchy technology , but public demonstrations have proven the hardware and software were and are sucesptible to foul play .
The same machines are scheduled for use in a district near you November .
So why only now is the case for voting integrity enforcement being made ?
Just a coincidence ?
Indeed , the DOJ attorney firing scandal for which former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is currently being investigated was based on the ponderous push for federal prosecutors to pursue voter fraud cases – whether they existed or not .
Worse still , the evidence recovered by BBC - TV reporter Greg Palast shows that vote - caging tactics were being used by Karl Rove ’s senior assistant Tim Griffin , with damning database lists loaded with minority voters sent directly from RNC headquarters to George W. Bush ’s campaign .
So Republicans have been successful in 2000 and 2004 disenfranchising voters by the millions using suppression , voter purges and challenges , phone - jamming schemes and well - placed friends in high places .
But the plot ironically includes accusing the Democrats of stealing votes .
Though both sides have indeed been involved in fraud historically , the difference in recent times is startling , with Democrats sitting atop mounds of evidence yelling at the top of their lungs to a deaf media and public .
They have seen little if any enforcement while absurd GOP claims have been brought into court , stretching all plausibility and in some cases being instantly thrown out in minutes .
Today we see a troubling report accusing ACORN of fraudulent registrations in several key battleground states , including a raid on ACORN ’s Nevada offices .
The NY Post reported today that a young man was registered 72 times by ACORN for loose cigarettes and $ 15 , yet failed to interview any ACORN spokespersons , despite the slew of media appearances by top level representatives defending ACORN practices , workers and credibility made yesterday .
What we ’re seeing here is the same smokescreen used by the GOP / RNC when they are engaged in wrongdoing – they accuse the opposition of same .
This is a clarion call that the RNC is underway committing vote fraud .
We ’ve already seen deceptive direct mail pieces from the McCain campaign in Florida going out to elderly Democrats and resultant lawsuits brought by the Obama campaign .
Based on the disgraceful , unpresidential rhetoric being used by McCain himself to tie Barack Obama to William Ayres , it is little surprise that they will again seek to slime and sleaze their way through America to try to win the White House while the economy continues to tumble .
What we see in the mirror can be different from what others perceive when they look at us .

When you look at yourself in a mirror , what you see depends on the quality of that mirror .
Similarly , our mental images of ourselves help determine how we react to daily highs and lows of life .
If we think of ourselves as worthwhile and valued , that quality will come across to other people .
Molded by both internal and external forces , our self - image makes a huge difference in how we feel and act .
Think about how you would describe yourself to a stranger .
Would you emphasize your keen sense of humor or physical features you 're fond of ?
Or would you spend more time on supposed " trouble spots ? "
Your answer largely depends on your mental image of yourself .

Why does it matter how you see yourself ?
Keeping our bodies healthy through proper diet and exercise improves how we feel physically and enhances our quality of life .
Our mental wellness is equally vital for attaining personal fulfillment .
A healthy state of mind fosters a positive self - image , which then encourages balanced relationships and sound decision - making skills [ source : American Psychological Association ] .
But a healthy body and mind do n't operate independently -- we should nurture both because they affect each other .
If all of this sounds a little too Zen for your taste , consider this .
In a study of teenage girls ' self - image , participants who rated themselves as socially unpopular were 69 percent more likely to gain weight than those who considered themselves popular [ source : Psychiatric Annals ] .
Other research has found that people with a positive self - image are less likely to engage in unprotected sex as well .
What are the elements that create our self - image ?
Focus often turns to how we compare our bodies to ideal physiques .
But body image is just one part of the complete picture .
Our personal experiences , relationships , choices and attitudes all contribute to the whole .
It 's essentially how we evaluate our strengths and weaknesses , as well as how we define our character .
To get a better understanding of this mind - body connection , let 's take a closer look at one of the most measurable facets of our mental picture : body image .
Mushroom Enzyme Could Make Clean Fuel Cells
October 9th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Even the most environmentally - conscious among us use batteries containing toxic heavy metals on a daily basis .
But a discovery made by chemists at Oxford University could one day lead to cleaner batteries for everyone .
The researchers recently discovered that an enzyme produced by fungi growing on rotten wood can be used as a cheap and efficient catalyst in fuel cells .
Laccase ( the mushroom enzyme ) has been shown to have an equal catalytic performance to platinum in speeding up reactions on fuel cell electrodes .
The Oxford chemists believe that current batteries could eventually be replaced by portable power sources from laccase - coated electrodes .
The prototype laccase fuel cell will produce 400 milliamps for 2,500 hours — enough for an average MP3 player .
However , the researchers ultimately hope to create cell phone - sized batteries created using laccase from genetically - modified fungi .
Such batteries would last for 20 recharges .
Batteries produce 200,000 tons of unrecycled waste each year — much of it consisting of heavy metals .
If laccase - based fuel cells become a reality , we can feel just a little bit less guilty about using battery - powered electronics .

The BBC has obtained unprecedented filming access in the area where plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced .
It spent a day with Sellafield 's decommissioning manager Euan Hutton as the Cumbrian nuclear plant is ripped apart .
It is the end of the road for British Nuclear Fuels , the monolithic government body that for decades was synonymous with the UK nuclear industry .
On November 24th an international consortium of private companies takes over the running of Sellafield , cleaning up half a century of nuclear waste .
Nuclear Management Partners ( NMP ) - representing companies from the US , France and the UK - begins a multi-billion pound contract that could turn into the biggest procurement deal signed by the UK government .
DAYTON , Ohio  Senator John McCain astonished the political world on Friday by naming Sarah Palin , a little - known governor of Alaska and self - described “ hockey mom ” with almost no foreign policy experience , as his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket .
Ms. Palin , 44 , a social conservative , former union member and mother of five who has been governor for two years , was on none of the widely discussed McCain campaign short lists for vice president .
In selecting her , Mr. McCain reached far outside the Washington Beltway in an election year in which the Democratic presidential candidate , Senator Barack Obama , is running on a platform of change .
“ She ’s not from these parts , and she ’s not from Washington , but when you get to know her , you ’re going to be as impressed as I am , ” Mr. McCain told a midday rally of 15,000 people in a basketball arena here shortly before Ms. Palin , with her husband and four of her children , strode out onto the stage .
Within moments , Ms. Palin made an explicit appeal to the disappointed supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton by praising not only Mrs. Clinton but also another woman who has been on a major presidential ticket , Geraldine A. Ferraro , Walter F. Mondale ’s Democratic running mate in 1984 .
Our understanding of the history of Earth and its inhabitants is undergoing a radical change .
The gradual processes of geologic change and evolution , it is now clear , are punctuated by natural catastrophes on a colossal scale - catastrophes resulting from collisions of large asteroids and comets with Earth .
It is , to use the popular term , a " paradigm shift . "
This " new catastrophism , " is not unlike the revolutions brought about by the heliocentric solar system of Copernicus , or Darwinian evolution , or the big bang .
In retrospect , such revolutionary ideas always seem obvious .
On reading the Origin of Species , Thomas Huxley remarked simply : " Why did n't I think of that . "
Now , looking at the Moon , we find ourselves wondering why it took so long to ask whether the process that cratered its surface is still going on . [...]
The long time scale between major impacts has implications for public policy .
Governments do not function on geologic time .
On the North Dakota prairie near the town of Grand Forks , lie the abandoned ruins of America 's ballistic missile defense system .
...
Built in accordance with the ABM treaty , the Grand Forks facility was meant to defend our retaliatory capacity .
It was declared operational in 1975 - and decommissioned the same year .
National leaders had been persuaded by some scientists that the Grand Forks facility would meet the threat to our intercontinental ballistic missile fleet , even though other scientists warned that the system was dangerous and ineffective .
It was closed because the money to operate it was needed for other projects that were deemed to be more urgent .
The lesson of Grand Forks is as old as human history : societies will not sustain indefinitely a defense against an infrequent and unpredictable threat .
Governments often respond quickly to a crisis , but are less well suited to remaining prepared for extended periods .
Even on the brief scale of human lifetimes , resources are eventually diverted to more immediate problems , or defenses are allowed to decay into a state of unreadiness .
According to news accounts , in the great flood of 1993 , the U.S. Corp of Engineers prepared to close the massive iron gates in the vast complex of levees on the Mississippi and its tributaries only to discover that some of the gates had been removed and sold for scrap .
Periodic inspections had been suspended to save money .
Indeed , civilization will do well to survive long enough to be threatened by a major asteroid impact ; our own destructive impulses of the unanticipated consequences of our technologies seem likely to do us in first .
It is unrealistic to expect governments to sustain a commitment to protection against a rare occurrence when they are constantly under pressure to respond to some perceived immediate crisis .
Particularly now [ 1994 ] , with nuclear weapons being dismantled by the major powers , any talk of a nuclear defense against such an unlikely hazard as cosmic collisions will be seen as an effort by the weapons community to sustain itself .
The risk of diversion of any mitigation system to military uses must be regarded as a more immediate hazard . [...]
Given the frequency of past collisions , major impact is unlikely to occur in the next century . [...]
Discussion of mitigation may serve one public purpose .
It is important that devastation not be accepted as inevitable , otherwise society might prefer not to know when it is coming .
An asteroid interception workshop hosted by NASA in 1992 concluded that available technology can deal effectively with a threatening asteroid , given warning time on the order of several years .
That conclusion validates the view that current efforts should concentrate on detection and orbit determination .
The challenge of science is to identify objects that threaten Earth and work out the timetables for their arrival .
Here the challenge is straightforward and technical . [...]
The emphasis has properly been on impacts that would be expected to have global consequences .
Even for objects too small to produce more than local effects , however , it has been pointed out that an impact might be misidentified as a nuclear explosion .
Misidentification would be most likely among nations that have recently joined the ranks of " nuclear powers " and would therefore be expected to have less sophisticated means of verification .
It is more than a hypothetical concern .
We recall that the 1978 South Indian Ocean anomaly , detected by a Vela satellite , was suspected at the time of being a South African - Israeli nuclear test .
In spite of the failure to find any confirming evidence from intelligence sources or atmospheric monitoring , it created international tensions that lasted for years .
At the time , there were suggestions that it might have been an artifact produced by micrometeorite impact on the Vela satellite itself , but little serious consideration seems to have been given to the idea that the satellite had observed the fireball from an asteroid impact in the atmosphere .
A 1990 satellite observation of an apparent asteroid impact fireball over the Western Pacific has been described by Reynolds ( 1993 ) .
The danger of misidentification , which grows as weapons proliferate among less sophisticated nations , is meliorated in part by publicizing the possibility .
The only sure means of avoiding an unfortunate response , however , would be for everyone to know the impact is coming .
Which again places the emphasis on detection .
Efforts to persuade governments to invest significant resources in evaluation of the hazard of asteroid impacts must overcome what has been called the " giggle factor . "
Clearly , elected officials in Washington are not being inundated with mail from constituents complaining that a member of their family has just been killed or their property destroyed by a marauding asteroid . [...]
Congressional involvement has been confined to the Committee on Science , Space and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives , whose current chair , George Brown of California , has maintained an interest in the asteroid issue for several years .
The committee directed NASA to conduct two international workshops on the asteroid threat . [...]
In March of 1993 , the Space Subcommittee held a formal hearing to examine the results of the two workshops .
Some members remain skeptical that the threat is real .
But even among those who recognize that it is only a question of when a major impact will occur , there was no sense of urgency . [...]
The frequency of impacts of objects of various sizes is known only to limited precisions .
In particular , objects up to several meters in diameter explode in the atmosphere without reaching the surface .
Although the energy released in these explosions may be many times greater than that released by the Hiroshima bomb , they most frequently occur over the ocean or sparsely inhabited regions of Earth and go unreported . [...]
Congress is unlikely to take any action in the absence of public pressure .
Once the public understands that Earth and the life on it have been shaped by cosmic collisions ( and the process is continuing ) , they will be more likely to support the science needed to evaluate the threat .
The scientific community must , therefore , concentrate on public education . [...]
All of this creates a dilemma .
While it is important to inform the public , it is dangerous to encourage fear mongering .
...
Scientists would do well , for example , to avoid such terms as " near miss . "
The public understands " near - miss " as the draft of wind from a truck that passes as you step off the curb - not a truck that went by six hours earlier . [...]
Even in such staid newspapers as the New York Times and Washington Post , articles may include a well - reasoned discussion of relative risk , but the headline writers find " doomsday rock , " " space bullets " and " killer comet " irresistible .
These headlines exploit the excessive fear engendered by events people feel powerless to control .
The image of an indifferent mountain of stone and metal guided by the immutable laws of physics toward an inevitable rendezvous with Earth , is the stuff of nightmares .
Remarkably , however , Nature has apparently provided a non-threatening demonstration .
The impact of comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 on the back side of Jupiter in July of 1994 provides an historic opportunity to educate the public without terrorizing anyone .
Shoemaker - Levy 9 , in its last pass by Jupiter , broke into a string of 21 major pieces .
The energy released by the impacts of the full string will be equivalent to about a billion megatons of TNT .
Although the pieces will impact on the side of Jupiter away from Earth , millions of amateur astronomers will be watching to see the flashes reflected from Jupiter 's moons .
A few hours later , the rotation of Jupiter will bring the impact region into view .
There is great disagreement about what will be seen , but no one suggests that it will not be spectacular .
The asteroid - comet community needs only to insure that everything is fully and accurately explained ; the message will take care of itself : ( 1 ) the energy deposited by the cosmic impacts is enormous ( 2 ) this is a process that is still going on .
The risk of diversion of any mitigation system to military uses must be regarded as a more immediate hazard .
There is evidence that there were two massive bolide explosions which occurred over South America in the 1930's .
One seems to have occurred over Amazonia , near the Brazil - Peru border , on August 13 , 1930 , whilst the other was over British Guyana on December 11 , 1935 .
It is noted that these dates coincide with the peaks of the Perseids and the Geminids , although any association with those meteor showers is very tentative .
The identification of such events is significant in particular in that they point to the need for re-assessment of the frequency of tunguska - type atmospheric detonations .
This week marks the golden anniversary of what is arguably the most spectacular meteorite fall ever seen .
At 10:40 a.m. on February 12 , 1947 , a incredibly bright fireball seared its way across the sky of eastern Siberia and rained around 70 tons of iron meteorites onto the rugged landscape .
Because it was so well documented , the Sikhote - Alin fall proved a great boon to meteorite science .
( from Sky Publishing Corporation and George Zay )
Women have miscarried ; crops have been neglected ; wills have been made ; comet - proof suits of clothing have been invented ; a cometary life insurance company ( premiums payable in advance ) has been created ... all because an almanac maker ... thought proper to insert , under the week commencing June 13 , ' About this time , expect a comet ' .
The puzzled astronomers were left in a state of tantalizing uncertainty as to what had become of it .
At the beginning of the year 1866 this feeling of bewilderment gained expression in the Annual Report of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society .
The matter continued , nevertheless , in the same state of provoking uncertainty for another six years .
The third period of the perihelion passage had then passed , and nothing had been seen of the missing luminary .
But on the night of November 27 , 1872 , night - watchers were startled by a sudden and a very magnificent display of falling stars or meteors , of which there had been no previous forecast ... [ source ]
The summer of 1871 had been excessively dry ; the moisture seemed to be evaporated out of the air ; and on the Sunday above named the atmospheric conditions all through the Northwest were of the most peculiar character .
The writer was living at the time in Minnesota , hundreds of miles from the scene of the disasters , and he can never forget the condition of things .
There was a parched , combustible , inflammable , furnace - like feeling in the air , that was really alarming .
It felt as if there were needed but a match , a spark , to cause a world - wide explosion .
It was weird and unnatural .
I have never seen nor felt anything like it before or since .
Those who experienced it will bear me out in these statements .
At that hour , half past nine o'clock in the evening , at apparently the same moment , at points hundreds of miles apart , in three different States , Wisconsin , Michigan , and Illinois , fires of the most peculiar and devastating kind broke out , so far as we know , by spontaneous combustion .
In Wisconsin , on its eastern borders , in a heavily timbered country , near Lake Michigan , a region embracing four hundred square miles , extending north from Brown County , and containing Peshtigo , Manistee , Holland , and numerous villages on the shores of Green Bay , was swept bare by an absolute whirlwind of flame .
There were seven hundred and fifty people killed outright , besides great numbers of the wounded , maimed , and burned , who died afterward .
More than three million dollars ' worth of property was destroyed .

" At sundown there was a lull in the wind and comparative stillness .
For two hours there were no signs of danger ; but at a few minutes after nine o'clock , and by a singular coincidence , precisely the time at which the Chicago fire commenced , the people of the village heard a terrible roar .
It was that of a tornado , crushing through the forests .
Instantly the heavens were illuminated with a terrible glare .
The sky , which had been so dark a moment before , burst into clouds of flame .
A spectator of the terrible scene says the fire did not come upon them gradually from burning trees and other objects to the windward , but the first notice they had of it was a whirlwind of flame in great clouds from above the tops of the trees , which fell upon and entirely enveloped everything .
The poor people inhaled it , or the intensely hot air , and fell down dead .
This is verified by the appearance of many of the corpses .
They were found dead in the roads and open spaces , where there were no visible marks of fire near by , with not a trace of burning upon their bodies or clothing .
At the Sugar Bush , which is an extended clearing , in some places four miles in width , corpses were found in the open road , between fences only slightly burned .
No mark of fire was upon them ; they lay there as if asleep .
This phenomenon seems to explain the fact that so many were killed in compact masses .
They seemed to have huddled together , in what were evidently regarded at the moment the safest places , far away from buildings , trees , or other inflammable material , and there to have died together .
( p. 372 )
Another spectator says :
" Much has been said of the intense heat of the fires which destroyed Peshtigo , Menekaune , Williamsonville , etc. , but all that has been said can give the stranger but a faint conception of the reality .
The heat has been compared to that engendered by a flame concentrated on an object by a blow - pipe ; but even that would not account for some of the phenomena .
For instance , we have in our possession a copper cent taken from the pocket of a dead man in the Peshtigo Sugar Bush , which will illustrate our point .
This cent has been partially fused , but still retains its round form , and the inscription upon it is legible .
Others , in the same pocket , were partially melted , and yet the clothing and the body of the man were not even singed .
We do not know in what way to account for this , unless , as is asserted by some , the tornado and fire were accompanied by electrical phenomena " ( 373 ) .
" It is the universal testimony that the prevailing idea among the people was , that the last day had come .
Accustomed as they were to fire , nothing like this had ever been known .
They could give no other interpretation to this ominous roar , this bursting of the sky with flame , and this dropping down of fire out of the very heavens , consuming instantly everything it touched .

A civil engineer , doing business in Peshtigo , says :
" The heat increased so rapidly , as things got well afire , that , when about four hundred feet from the bridge and the nearest building , I was obliged to lie down behind a log that was aground in about two feet of water , and by going under water now and then , and holding my head close to the water behind the log , I managed to breathe .
There were a dozen others behind the same log .
If I had succeeded in crossing the river and gone among the buildings on the other side , probably I should have been lost , as many were . "
In Michigan , one Allison Weaver , near Port Huron , determined to remain , to protect , if possible , some mill - property of which he had charge .
He knew the fire was coming , and dug himself a shallow well or pit , made a thick plank cover to place over it , and thus prepared to bide the conflagration .
I quote :
" He filled it nearly full of water , and took care to saturate the ground around it for a distance of several rods .
Going to the mill , he dragged out a four - inch plank , sawed it in two , and saw that the parts tightly covered the mouth of the little well .
' I calculated it would be touch and go , ' said he , ' but it was the best I could do . '
At midnight he had everything arranged , and the roaring then was awful to hear .
The clearing was ten to twelve acres in extent , and Weaver says that , for two hours before the fire reached him , there was a constant flight across the ground of small animals .
As he rested a moment from giving the house another wetting down , a horse dashed into the opening at full speed and made for the house .
Weaver could see him tremble and shake with excitement and terror , and felt a pity for him .
After a moment , the animal gave utterance to a snort of dismay , ran two or three times around the house , and then shot off into the woods like a rocket . "
" Not long after this the fire came .
Weaver stood by his well , ready for the emergency , yet curious to see the breaking - in of the flames .
The roaring increased in volume , the air became oppressive , a cloud of dust and cinders came showering down , and he could see the flame through the trees .
It did not run along the ground , or leap from tree to tree , but it came on like a tornado , a sheet of flame reaching from the earth to the tops of the trees .
As it struck the clearing he jumped into his well , and closed over the planks .
He could no longer see , but he could hear .
He says that the flames made no halt whatever , or ceased their roaring for an instant , but he hardly got the opening closed before the house and mill were burning tinder , and both were down in five minutes .
The smoke came down upon him powerfully , and his den was so hot he could hardly breathe .
" He knew that the planks above him were on fire , but , remembering their thickness , he waited till the roaring of the flames had died away , and then with his head and hands turned them over and put our the fire by dashing up water with his hands .
Although it was a cold night , and the water had at first chilled him , the heat gradually warmed him up until he felt quite comfortable .
He remained in his den until daylight , frequently turning over the planks and putting out the fire , and then the worst had passed .
The earth around was on fire in spots , house and mill were gone , leaves , brush , and logs were swept clean away as if shaved off and swept with a broom , and nothing but soot and ashes were to be seen " ( 390 ) .
In Wisconsin , at Williamson 's Mills , there was a large but shallow well on the premises belonging to a Mr. Boorman .
The people , when cut off by the flames and wild with terror , and thinking they would find safety in the water , leaped into this well .
" The relentless fury of the flames drove them pell - mell into the pit , to struggle with each other and die - some by drowning , and others by fire and suffocation .
None escaped .
Thirty - two bodies were found there .
They were in every imaginable position ; but the contortions of their limbs and the agonizing expressions of their faces told the awful tale " .
( 386 )
James B. Clark , of Detroit , who was at Uniontown , Wisconsin , writes :
" The fire suddenly made a rush , like the flash of a train of gunpowder , and swept in the shape of a crescent around the settlement .
It is almost impossible to conceive the frightful rapidity of the advance of the flames .
The rushing fire seemed to eat up and annihilate the trees . "
They saw a black mass coming toward them from the wall of flame :
" It was a stampede of cattle and horses thundering toward us , bellowing , moaning , and neighing as they galloped on ; rushing with fearful speed , their eyeballs dilated and glaring with terror , and every motion betokening delirium of fright .
Some had been badly burned , and must have plunged through a long space of flame in the desperate effort to escape .
Following considerably behind came a solitary horse , panting and snorting and nearly exhausted .
He was saddled and bridled , and , as we first thought , had a bag lashed to his back .
As he came up we were startled at the sight of a young lad lying fallen over the animal 's neck , the bridle wound around his hands , and the mane being clinched by the fingers .
Little effort was needed to stop the jaded horse , and at once release the helpless boy .
He was taken into the house , and all that we could do was done ; but he had inhaled the smoke , and was seemingly dying .
Some time elapsed and he revived enough to speak .
He told his name - Patrick Byrnes - and said : ' Father and mother and the children got into the wagon .
I do n't know what became of them .
Everything is burned up .
I am dying .
Oh !
Is hell any worse than this ? ' " ( 383 )
When we leave Wisconsin and pass about two hundred and fifty miles eastward , over Lake Michigan and across the whole width of the State of Michigan , we find much the same condition of things , but not so terrible in the loss of life .
Fully fifteen thousand people were rendered homeless by the fires ; and their food , clothing , crops , horses , and cattle were destroyed .
Of these five to six thousand were burned out the same night that the fires broke out in Chicago and Wisconsin .
The total destruction of property exceeded one million dollars ; not only villages and cities , but whole townships , were swept bare .
But it is to Chicago we must turn for the most extraordinary results of this atmospheric disturbance .
It is needless to tell the story in detail .
The world knows it by heart .
I have only space to refer to one or two points ...

The fire - marshal testified : " I felt it in my bones that we were going to have a burn . "
He says , speaking of O'Leary 's barn :
" We got the fire under control , and it would not have gone farther ; but the next thing I knew they came and told me that St. Paul 's church , about two squares north , was on fire " .
( 163 )
They checked the church - fire , but - " The next thing I knew the fire was in Bateham 's planing - mill . "
A writer in the New York Evening Post says he saw in Chicago " buildings far beyond the line of fire , and in no contact with it , burst into flames from the interior . "
It must not be forgotten that the fall of 1871 was marked by extraordinary conflagrations in regions widely separated .
On the 8th of October , the same day the Wisconsin , Michigan , and Chicago fires broke out , the States of Iowa , Minnesota , Indiana , and Illinois were severely devastated by prairie - fires ; while terrible fires raged on the Alleghenies , the Sierras of the Pacific coast , and the Rocky Mountains , and in the region of the Red River of the North .
The Annual Record of Science and Industry for 1876 , page 84 , says :
" For weeks before and after the great fire in Chicago in 1872 , great areas of forest and prairie - land , both in the United States and the British Provinces , were on fire . "

I quote again from Sheahan & Upton 's work :
" The huge stone and brick structures melted before the fierceness of the flames as a snow - flake melts and disappears in water , and almost as quickly .
Six - story buildings would take fire and disappear for ever from sight in five minutes by the watch ...
The fire also doubled on its track at the great Union Depot and burned half a mile southward in the very teeth of the gale - a gale which blew a perfect tornado , and in which no vessel could have lived on the lake ...
Strange , fantastic fires of blue , red , and green played along the cornices of buildings " [ " History of the
Chicago Fire " 85 , 86 ] .
Hon. William B. Ogden wrote at the time :
" The fire was accompanied by the fiercest tornado of wind ever known to blow here " [ Ibid 87 ] .
" The most striking peculiarity of the fire was its intense heat .
Nothing exposed to it escaped .
Amid the hundreds of acres left bare there is not to be found a piece of wood of any description , and , unlike most fires , it left nothing half burned ...
The fire swept the streets of all the ordinary dust and rubbish , consuming it instantly " [ Ibid 119 ] .
The Athens marble burned like coal !
" The intensity of the heat may be judged , and the thorough combustion of everything wooden may be understood , when we state that in the yard of one of the large agricultural - implement factories was stacked some hundreds of tons of pig-iron .
This iron was two hundred feet from any building .
To the south of it was the river , one hundred and fifty feet wide .
No large building but the factory was in the immediate vicinity of the fire .
Yet , so great was the heat , that this pile of iron melted and run , and is now in one large and nearly solid mass " [ Ibid 121 ] .
The amount of property destroyed was estimated by Mayor Medill at one hundred and fifty million dollars ; and the number of people rendered houseless , at one hundred and twenty - five thousand .
Several hundred lives were lost .
" What eyewitnesses described was more like a holocaust from heaven than an accidental fire started by a nervous cow .
And in fact , according to a theory propounded by Minnesota Congressmen Ignatius Donnelly , the devastating fires of 1871 did fall from above , in the form of a wayward cometary tail .
During it 's 1846 passage , Biela 's comet had inexplicably split in two ; it was supposed to return in 1866 , but failed to appear .
Biela 's fragmented head finally showed up in 1872 as a meteor shower .
" Donnelly suggested the separated tail appeared in 1871 and was the prime cause of the widespread firestorm that swept the Midwest , damaging or destroying a total of twenty - four towns and leaving 2,000 or more dead in its wake .
Drought conditions that fall no doubt contributed to the extent of the conflagration .
" History today concentrates on the Chicago Fire alone and largely overlooks the Peshtigo Horror , as it was then called .
It ignores altogether Biela 's comet and it's unaccounted - for tail .

The fact of a perceived danger at these epochs , signified historically by a global rise in eschatological concern , is now understood in various academic quarters as marking some kind of physical dislocation ( climate ? disease ? ) which causes economic and social activity to be widely deranged , even to the point of collapse of civilized society , leading then to revolution , mass migration and war , amplified on a global scale .
The occasions of such breakdowns in civilization are of course a matter of serious concern and their systematic study has been taken up in America ( and elsewhere ) at such institutes as the Center for Comparative Research in History , Society and Culture at the University of California , Davis ( Goldstone , 1991 ) .
To the " enlightened " however , the eschatology remains an anomaly and secure connections with celestial inputs have generally still to be made .
We should recall however that many , as usual on these occasions of breakdown , would see " blazing stars threatening the world with famine , plague and war ; to princes ' death ; to kingdoms many curses ; [ and ] to all estates many losses ... "
The three earliest of these epochs are of course the periods of Inquisition and of the great European witch - hunts ( which spilled over to America ) when ecclesiastical and secular administrators alike would discourage any ( astrological ) notion that the celestial sphere interfered with terrestrial affairs .
The separate stories of scientific revolutionaries like Copernicus , Kepler , Bruno , Galileo and Newton now bear witness to the ferocity with which the most acceptable cosmic viewpoint ( of the time ) was imposed .
Indeed , these separate stories are still being adjusted and Newton , it is now realised , was constrained by his times to work under conditions of rather considerable censorship .
The acceptable part of his scientific output was of course published and has proved its worth repeatedly over 300 years .
The unacceptable part however dealt with " blazing stars " and eschatology and remained unpublished for some 250 years .
One of the first to examine this material ( Keynes 1947 ) was so taken aback by the contrast as to dub Newton not so much " the first of the age of reason " as " the last of the magicians , the last of the Babylonians and Sumerias " .
Thus it was the Founding Fathers of the Royal Society in Restoration England who hit upon the " enlightened " step of deriding the cosmic threat and public anxiety ; and it is not without significance today that English - speaking nations ultimately stood firm and prospered as others faltered at the last and briefest of the above epochs ( Goldstone , loc cit ) .
Accordingly , it is largely an Anglo - Saxon " achievement " that cosmic catastrophes were absolutely discarded and the scientific principle of uniformitarianism was put in place between 200 and 150 years ago .
Last night we watched Super Comet - After the Impact , a Discovery Channel special that basically takes the comet that wiped out the dinosaurs and put into modern times .
They added some cheesy drama , following the struggles of several individuals or groups , before , during , and after the impact , to show how people would react to such a global cataclysm .
They used the same type of cometary body assumed to have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs , the same size , same impact location , and utilized all the computer modeling they have done on this past event to try to show what might happen ( and to show what they think happened then ) .
Not terribly creative and suggests that they really do n't know all the effects of such an impact and are just putting things together from what little they have been able to figure out about that one impact , some ( or much ) of which may be just speculation , though I 'm sure that there is some good science going on there .
This show highlights what we have already noted in this series of articles : the difference between the American School of Asteroid impacts that happen only at millions of years intervals and the British School which posits that showers of much smaller objects occur with great frequency in between those millions of years events .
The cheesiest part of this " docu- drama " was , of course , the depicted foibles of the humans experiencing the event .
But , in a way , even those depictions were useful .
The one guy who simply could n't grasp the nature of the event , kept traveling " home " ( which happened to be the site of the impact ) even when it was clear that there was no home left .
His emotions basically drove him to his own death .
Other people continued to act as if the world was still the same place and suffered thereby , though they learned to cope .
What was clearly evident was that it was lack of knowledge about such events that was the chief problem for all of them .
During the course of the show , one of the experts made the remark " WHEN it happens , " as though he - and the rest of them - knew for a fact that this was on the agenda for our near future .
The very fact that so many scientists are working on these problems , including a large number of them studying the possible human reactions and behaviors and how to deal with masses of people , should warn us that there IS something they are n't telling the masses in the headlines of our daily newspapers , though certainly they are " testing " public reactions with shows such as Super Comet - After the Impact .
On my desk , before me , I have a book out of the more than 30 volumes and scores of papers on the topic of comet and asteroid impacts that I have collected in the course of this study .
The title of this book is Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids edited by Tom Gehrels , with 120 contributing authors , published by the University of Arizona Press in 1994 .
There is something in this book that I want to bring to your attention before we get on to our main catastrophe of the day : Mrs. O'Leary 's Cometary Cow .
The volume mentioned above , Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids , which we note was published in 1994 , ( in reaction to the impending Comet Shoemaker - Levy event vis a vis Jupiter ) , contains a paper beginning on page 1225 , ( yeah , it 's a BIG book ! ) , that is written by Robert L. Park of The American Physical Society , Lori B. Garver of the National Space Society and Terry Dawson , a staffer for the House Committee on Science , Technology , and Space working for the Committee 's then Chairman , Rep. George Brown ( See him listed HERE ) .
The following is a condensation of the main points of this paper :
This guy had a lot of faith in human beings , did n't he ?
He thought that all scientists had to do was to tell the public the truth and they would get enough support to fund cataloging the dangerous asteroids in earth - crossing orbits .
He also thought that this was the main problem : asteroids that could be seen and listed .
What seems obvious to me is that someone else took the " Lesson of the Grand Forks Facility " in an entirely different way .
The question that comes to my mind is this : are the Elite Powers creating a War On Terror as an immediate and constant pressure on the public to get the needed support for the stockpiling of nuclear weapons so they will have them to use on asteroids ?
You know , kind of a benevolent lie with a million or so innocent Iraqis being sacrificed to sustain it .
Kind of like the Madeleine Albright thing :
In 1996 then - UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright was asked by 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl , in reference to years of U.S. - led economic sanctions against Iraq , " We have heard that half a million children have died .
I mean , that is more children than died in Hiroshima .
And , you know , is the price worth it ?
" To which Ambassador Albright responded , " I think that is a very hard choice , but the price , we think , the price is worth it .
" So , is there somebody at the top who thinks that stockpiling nuclear weapons is a good thing for planetary defense of a cosmic nature ?
There is another way to ask the question : are the Powers That Be using the threat of asteroids on lawmakers to get them to agree to backing the phony War on Terror in order to obtain and retain the support of the masses when what they are really doing is just planning on a fascist take - over of the world ?
Notice that the paper above also said :
It 's hard to tell what goes on in the minds of deviants .
One thing I think we can be sure of is that the threat of cometary bombardment is real and immediate , and that comes from the science .
Sadly , it does not come from our leaders who , even if they are aware of some threat and are stockpiling nuclear weapons to use to divert inbound asteroids or comets , have n't bothered to make the threat clear to the masses of humanity via science as they very well could .
Scanning through this almost 1300 page volume which collects pretty much all the then scientifically acknowledged data on comet and asteroid impacts reveals that there was some pretty interesting thinking going on prior to Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
We 've come a long way in our understanding since then ; well , some have .
The U.S. school is still pretty much stuck in the " single massive asteroid at vast timescales " ; probably due to political pressures to keep the real issues covered up .
I noted that Shoemaker had a paper in the volume where he said there were only 140 known impact craters on the earth .
He completely ignored the Carolina bays which have been reclaimed for what they are by Richard Firestone , Allen West and Simon Warwick - Smith in The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes : Flood , Fire , and Famine in the History of Civilization .
I understand that there are over 50,000 of those critters .
That 's scary !
We also note the remark in the above paper : " The frequency of impacts of objects of various sizes is known only to limited precisions .
In particular , objects up to several meters in diameter explode in the atmosphere without reaching the surface . "
Obviously , this guy was n't part of the the same crowd that hung out with Brigadier General S. Pete Worden , who said that he believes " we should pay more attention to the ' Tunguska - class ' objects - 100 meter or so objects which can strike up to several times per century with the destructiveness of a nuclear weapon , " reported in the previous article : Thirty Years of Cults and Comets
In any event , the authors of the above quoted paper had a generally open attitude toward the public and educating them that no longer seems to be the perception of our ruling elites .
Speaking of General Worden and his obscure remark , after publishing the last installment of the present series , several members of the SOTT Forum did a little digging on the question and came up with some very interesting finds .
It seems that there were two events in the 1930s that equalled the Tunguska event :
This article was printed in IMO 's December 1995 edition of the WGN Journal .
It was written by Duncan Steel of the Anglo - Australian Observatory .
Then there is this :
There are more , of course , but this just tells us that there are many things going on here on the Big Blue Marble that we are n't aware of .
That 's what Victor Clube is saying in his narrative report to the USAF and Oxford that sent me off on this topic .
So , let 's return to Clube and our historical review :
The next period of cometary activity that Clube refers to is that which encompassed the American Revolution ( 1775 - 1783 ) and the French Revolution ( 1789 - 1799 ) and the mid-nineteenth century crisis .
I 'm going to skip the two revolutions for the moment and go directly to the mid-nineteenth century period because it is intensely interesting and leads us into our topic of the day .
In trying to find some details about the mid-nineteenth century crisis mentioned above , a whole lot of things turned up that I 'm sure we all learned in history class in school , but it just never was put together in a way that made it look as interesting as it does now !
What happened then was , of course , the " Industrial Revolution . "
But it was kind of like the Renaissance in that it overlapped a lot of other interesting events .
The Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism began , more or less , toward the end of the eighteenth century .
The nineteenth century was a turbulent epoch beginning with a stock market crash in 1825 then moving on to the Panic of 1847 , a collapse of British financial markets associated with the end of the 1840s railroad boom .
The crisis of 1847 could have been more disastrous except that it was cut short by economic revival following the California gold strike of 1849 .
After a period of prosperity , there began a series of wars and revolutions .
There was the first Italian War for Independence in 1857 , and then the American Civil War of 1861 , the Polish Insurrection of 1863 , Napoleon the Second 's Mexican adventure and the campaign against Denmark in 1864 which started the Prussian Wars led by Bismarck .
Bismarck attacked Austria in 1866 and won a victory over France in 1871 .
The , there was the Republican uprising in Spain which toppled Queen Isabella from the throne .
Finally , there was the last of Louis Napoleon 's adventures which culminated in the crashing of the Empire in 1871 .
There was Civil War in France following the downfall of the Second Napoleon , and the people ( Paris Communards ) seized power .
They were soon crushed and order was restored in the Third Republic , and the revolutionary tide receded for the rest of the century .
It is interesting to consider the other events that were occurring at this time .
Industrial capitalism was being spread with missionary zeal everywhere .
Western investors roamed the globe looking for openings to establish trade and to invest in anything that could be bought or sold .
In the process , millions of people were redistributed in the greatest mass migrations in history from the Old World to the New .
Science became the handmaiden of industry and capitalism .
The volume of world trade was 1.75 billion dollars in 1830 and it rose to 3.6 billion in 1850 , skyrocketing to 9.4 billion in 1870 .
So , Clube is right .
For about twenty - five years , the entire Western world was bubbling cauldron of war and revolution and people taking advantage of wars and revolution to make money .
When it was all over , the imperial powers of Europe that were to rule the world until 1914 , were firmly ensconced .
More than that , the United States as a federal , capitalist entity , had been forged at Appamattox .
There were obviously other things going on at that time .
In the period from 1830 to 1860 there was apparently an enormous upsurge in religious fervor .
The imminent return of Christ was being predicted everywhere !
Manuel de Lacunza , a Catholic priest in South America wrote ( under the pen name of Juan Josafa Ben - Ezra ) a book entitled The Coming of Messiah in Glory and Majesty , which was published in Spain in 1812 .
He believed that Jesus was coming very , very soon .
William Miller ( Seventh - Day Adventists ) declared that Christ was coming and predicted 1844 as the date .
Edward Irving of England and Johann Bengel in Germany almost simultaneously came to the conclusion that the prophecies of Daniel pointed to the time of the end being right then ; Mason in Scotland , Leonard H. Kelber in Germany and many , many others preached about the Second coming .
Spiritualist Andrew Jackson Davis gave 157 lectures in 1845 about the new era , which Edgar Allen Poe attended regularly .
The Spiritualism Craze began with the Fox sisters in 1848 .
Mourant Brock , of the Church of England , noted that the craze for eschatology had spread through all of Europe and extended to India .
( See : The Story of Prophecy by Henry James Forman ) .
As Clube notes , this religious fervor parallels cosmic events .
In 1843 , there appeared one of the greatest comets of history .
The Great Comet of 1843 formally designated C/1843 D1 and 1843 I , was discovered on February 5 , 1843 and rapidly brightened .
It was a member of the Kreutz Sungrazers , a family of comets resulting from the breakup of a parent comet ( X/1106 C1 ) into multiple fragments in about 1106 .
These comets pass extremely close to the Sun - within a few solar radii - and this is why they often become very bright .
C/1843 D1 moved rapidly toward an incredibly close perihelion of less than 830,000 km on February 27 , 1843 , at which time it could be seen in broad daylight just a degree away from the Sun !
It swung around and passed close to earth on March 6 , 1843 , and seemed to manifest its greatest brilliance the following day .
It was last observed on April 19 , 1843 .
At that time this comet had passed closer to the sun than any other known object .
The American Journal of Science and The New York Tribune devoted special sections to this comet at the time .
You could say that " comet fever " was pandemic !
The Great Comet of 1843 - still unnamed - developed a tail over 2 Astronomical Units in length , the longest known cometary tail until measurements in 1996 showed that Comet Hyakutake 's tail was almost twice as long .
In 1857 , an anonymous German astrologer predicted that a comet would strike the earth on June 13 of that year .
The impending catastrophe became the talk of all of Europe .
The French astronomer , Jacques Babinet , tried to reassure people by stating that a collision between the earth and a comet would do no harm .
He compared the impact to " a railway train being hit by a fly " .
His words , apparently , had little effect .
The Paris correspondent for the American journal , Harper 's Weekly , wrote : Let 's back up just a minute here , to 1826 .
In 1826 , comet 3D / Biela was discovered by Wilhelm von Biela .
It has become known as Comet Biela or Biela 's Comet .
This comet had been first seen in 1772 by Charles Messier and again in 1805 by Jean - Louis Pons .
It was von Biela who discovered it in its 1826 perihelion approach ( on February 27 ) and calculated its orbit , discovering it to be periodic with a period of 6.6 years which is why it was named after him and not Messier or Pons .
It was only the third comet ( at the time ) found to be periodic , after the famous comets Halley and Encke .
French astronomer M. Damoiseau subsequently calculated its path , and announced that on its next return the comet would cross the orbit of the earth , within twenty thousand miles of its track , and about one month before the earth would arrive at the same spot !
When the comet came in 1832 , the earth did , indeed , miss it by one month .
It returned again in 1839 and 1846 .
In its 1846 appearance , the comet was observed to have broken up into two pieces .
It was observed again in 1852 with the two parts being 1.5 million miles apart .
Each part had a head and tail of its own .
The comet did not come in 1852 , 1859 , or 1866 .
The Edinburgh Review notes about this strange state of affairs :
The meteors were radiating from the part of the sky where the comet had been expected to cross in September .
In other words , the trajectory was the same , and the earth intersected it , but the velocity was somewhat altered .
The American Journal of Science said they fell like snowflakes .
Professor Olmstead , a mathematician at Yale University estimated 34,640 shooting stars per hour .
The New York Journal of Commerce wrote that no philosopher or scholar has ever recorded an event like this .
These meteors became known as the Andromedids or " Bielids " and it seems apparent that they indicated the death of the comet .
The meteors were seen again on subsequent occasions for the rest of the 19th century , but have now faded away .
Is that all there is to that ?
Maybe not .
As it happens , on Sunday , the 8th of October , in the year 1871 , at half past nine o'clock in the evening , events occurred which caused the death of hundreds of human beings , and the destruction of vast amounts of property , across three different States of the American Union , sending millions of people into fits of the wildest alarm and terror .
The following passages are extracted from the History of the Great Conflagration , Sheahan & Upton , Chicago 1871 . [ source
No doubt that this story came to the attention of Victor Clube !
Ten years later , there was the Great Comet of 1881 ( C/1881 K1 ) , discovered by the Australian amateur astronomer , John Tebbutt .
All we hear about this comet nowadays is that it was one of the first comets photographed and studied scientifically .
However , this comet following so closely on the events of ten years previously obviously got a few people thinking . , published a book in 1882 , entitled Ragnarok , wherein he proposed that a giant comet had passed close to the earth in past ages .
The intense heat from the comet had set off huge fires that raged across the face of the globe .
He suggested that the comet had dumped vast amounts of dust on the earth , triggered earthquakes , leveled mountains , and initiated the ice age .
He even explained some of the miracles of the Bible in terms of his comet , proposing that the standing - still of the sun at the command of Joshua was possibly a tale commemorating this event .
Donnelly 's readers were thrilled by his descriptions of the " glaring and burning monster " in the sky , scorching the planet with unearthly heat and shaking the land with " thunders beyond all thunders " .
Possibly inspired by Donnelly ( not to mention what was obviously going on in the heavens ) , Camille Flammarion wrote The End of the World in 1893 in which he recounted a fictional collision between the earth and a comet fifty times its size .
Flammarion 's lurid prose ensured that his book was an immediate sensation !
( Flammarion , it should be noted , was a friend and associate of , and greatly influenced by , Allan Kardec , the French Pedagogue , medical student , linguist and researcher of " spirit communications . "
He was also a friend of Jules Violle the probable true identity of the legendary alchemist , Fulcanelli . )
Well , all that was a pretty interesting diversion into history , now was n't it ?
Does n't seem quite so dull and boring anymore , eh? Okay , time to return to Victor Clube 's narrative .
I think that what he is writing will make a whole lot more sense now !
If short - period bombardment of our planet by comets or comet dust is a reality ( as it increasingly appears to be ) ; and the effects of such an event are deleterious in the extreme ; and if we are in fact overdue for a repeat performance of such a visitation ( which also appears to be the case ) ; what effect might public awareness of this have on the status quo on the planet at present ?
Would the bogus " war on terror " not become instantly obsolete and would people across the planet not immediately demand that their political leaders reassess priorities and take whatever action possible to mitigate the threat ?
And if those political leaders refused to do so and it became known that that this grave threat to the lives of billions was long - standing and common knowledge among the political elite ( with all that that implies ) , what then ?
Revolution ?
One last hurrah before the 6th extinction ?
Who knows .
We only know that this knowledge , in its fullest explication , is being suppressed and marginalized .
The reasons for the psychological games and ploys may be interesting to investigate .
so that is what we will look at next :
Why is Humanity so Deaf , Dumb and Blind ?
Do I have to be able to draw well to be a good designer ?
This by far , is one of the most frequent questions designers always ask of me .
Furthermore , “ I ca n’t be a designer cos I ca n’t draw ” is also one of the most frequent reasons people give for not being a designer or any type .
I myself had to deal with this when I started my career in design as my sketching skills at that time were very poor .
However , after almost 10 years in this business , I like to give my take on this perennial question .
What is pretty unbelievable is that I have seen famous designers ( who shall remain nameless ! ) create terrible sketches but end up with great designs , and great sketches that are hopeless designers .
Therefore my answer to this question really is “ Yes ” and “ No ” .
Essentially you would only need to draw or sketch well enough to communicate your concept on paper without you having to explain what it is .
You do n’t have to win the beauty contest , but you WILL have to do well enough so that a fellow designer ( or if you want it to be tougher on yourself , a non-designer ) can understand what you are attempting to communicate .
Notice the key word here ?
It ’s not drawing , draw , design , or sketch , it communicates .
A good sketch communicates an idea clearly and succinctly .
Sketching is also one part of the design process that makes up a successful design .
Strong understanding in proportions , colors , and manufacturing processes are other important elements that can make or break a design .
So do n’t despair if your sketching ability , at this time , is not up to par , as you will have a chance to refine it in the downstream design process .
Before we go on let us take a look at the different kinds of sketches so as to not confuse yourself when you go crazy over somebody ’s apparently great work .
Thumbnail or Napkin sketch
Source : Core77
A thumbnail sketch is a very basic sketch that has an almost childlike quality to it .
This type of sketch is mainly about getting your ideas down on paper as quickly as possible without too much care about proportions and beauty .
It is often pretty rough focusing only on the key “ big ” idea .
Thumbnails sketches are often the most frequently used sketch technique used to communicate ideas .
You can learn more about the importance of thumbnail sketches here at Steelcase ’s 360 E - Zine .
Emotion Sketch

Emotional sketches are the main source of what I like to call “ sketch discouragement ” !
These are the sketches people go ga - ga over and the main source of a designer ’s spine - tingling sensation as well as frustration .
Also called Inspirational sketches , such sketches are often used to set the tone of a design , brand language or product range .

Emotional sketches are also very difficult to do .
Simply because an emotional sketch is extremely form orientated , and used as a means to communicate emotion .
Hence the designers who create emotional or inspirational sketches are often called “ form monsters ” and have the uncanny ability to turn an emotion or expression keyword into a line , form or silhouette .
However , one if you look closely into such sketching style you would realize such sketches do n’t actually communicate a lot of information .
If you look at the example above , can you ask yourself how does the door open ?
Where is the door handle ?
The side mirrors ?
Its because such sketches are meant to convey just the look or feel of a product and nothing more .
It intentionally or unintentionally leaves out things like mechanical fixtures , part lines , or assembly information etc .
The best emotional sketch designers are actually able to convert their sketches into great products , but unfortunately , you be also surprised to know most cannot and remain in just form or concept development .
Information Sketch
The information sketch is perhaps the level at which what most designers , who are worried about their sketching ability , should aspire to .
It ’s the minimum type of sketch level that would allow other designers to understand what you are trying to draw .
I drew this to describe to my client ’s engineering department , how the design ’s different parts all came together .
Carl does probably some of the best informational sketches I have seen .
Waaay better than mine !

There are a lot of tangent lines , exploded views , transparent layering , a little color here and there , but all in all you can easily tell almost right away what is going on .
Right now so how do we do it ?
How do we get to the level we are satisfied with ?
Or how do we just improve our sketching ability ?
No gentle reader I will not leave you high and dry !
Tomorrow , in part 2 , I will list 10 tips that has helped me improve my sketching ability !
So do stay tuned and please keep in touch !

Iceland .
It ’s a land of sheep , the northern lights , volcanoes with unpronounceable names ( try saying Eyjafjallajökull ) , majestic waterfalls , craggy mountains , and otherworldly landscapes .
To me , it is one of the most beautiful places on earth .
How can such a tiny island have such a diverse and beautiful terrain ?
It changes every few feet — from verdant fields , snowy mountains , and brilliant glaciers to looking like Mars .
It never ceases to amaze me .
I had high expectations when I first visited .
I ’d seen movies and pictures in magazines of a land with jagged mountain peaks , volcanoes with desolate lava fields , rolling hills with grazing sheep , and glaciers that stretched for miles .
Iceland lived up to all those expectations .
Now , a year does n’t go by when I do n’t visit ( see ya again in September ! ) .
Sure , the country has seen an explosion in tourism in recent years and it ’s gotten a lot more expensive but most of the tourists concentrate in the south near Reykjavik .
Once you head out of the capital region , it ’s mostly you and nature ( I only saw three other tourists in my week in the Westfjords … during peak season ) !
So , in honor of the Iceland guide I just published today , here are my favorite things to see and do in Iceland that will convince you to book your ticket :
1. Visit Reykjavík
This hip capital is awash in thriving cafes , high - energy clubs , friendly pubs , and a brightly colored old town with rows of wooden houses clustered together .
It ’s more like a giant small town than a city .
Though it ’s super small , it ’s worth a few extra days to really get a feel for the art and café culture of the city .
And if you ’re a night owl , you ’ll love the party life ( Icelanders know how to drink ) .
I love this city and never find myself bored here .
From reading in cafés to wandering the coastline to enjoying drinks with my friends , Reykjavik sucks me in during ever visit .
2. Explore the Westfjords
The Westfjords is a large peninsula in northwestern Iceland with tons mountains and a coastline heavily indented by fjords .
It ’s one of the most raw parts of Iceland and my favorite region .
Few people live here and fewer visit , though Icelanders make their way here on summer vacation .
It ’s an area of tiny towns , fishing villages , mountains , waterfalls , and lakes .
In the summer months , puffins and whales call it their home .
In the winter , many of the roads are closed by ice and snow for several months .
But you ’ll find tiny towns , deep fjords , and beautiful hikes all to yourself .
It ’s not easy to get around but locals will let you hitch rides with them easily because bus service here can basically be non-existent .
Be sure to eat at Tjöruhúsið in Ísafjörður for an all you can eat , catch of the day buffet .
Delicious !
3. Soak in a Relaxing Lagoon
Most people soak in the Blue Lagoon .
This huge , milky - blue spa is fed by mineral - rich heated seawater from the nearby geothermal plant .
Though it ’s the most expensive one , you cannot deny that Iceland ’s most famous geothermal pool is the country ’s top tourist attraction .
But there are so many other hot pools in the country .
Reykjavik has their local one , in the north there is the Myvatn Nature Baths , and on the way to Vik there ’s the famous “ secret ” ( but not so secret ) mountain springs .
You ’ll find plenty of free hot springs all around the island .
Use the website Hotpot Iceland to find them .
4. See The Golden Circle
The Golden Circle is the popular tourist route that includes Gullfoss waterfall , Geysir , and Thingvellir National Park .
They make an easy day trip from the capital or airport , so people on a short layover always visit this area .
You can easily drive the whole ring in a day .
Along the way , there are a few farms where you can stop and see Icelandic horses .
Tehya re also all free to enjoy !
The main sites are :
Gullfoss – Fed by Langjökull , Iceland ’s second biggest glacier , this is one of the most photographed waterfalls in the country .
While not the biggest or most majestic , its V shape is unique and powerful to watch .
Iceland ’s most famous waterfall tumbles 105 feet into a steep - sided canyon , kicking up a wall of spray .
On sunny days , the spray creates shimmering rainbows over the gorge .
This is a truly amazing spectacle and a rewarding scene after a nice hike .

Geysir – A famous hot spring in Haukadalur Valley .
Geysir itself seldom erupts anymore , but nearby Strokkur spouts 15 - 20 meters of water about every 10 minutes .
There are also numerous strikingly colored hot pools in the area along the path .
If you want to hike up the mountains nearby ( takes 20 minutes to get to the top ) , you ’ll be rewarded with picturesque views of farmland .

Thingvellir –
This place is full of hiking trails and stunning camping grounds , but its big draw is that it ’s the only place in the world where you can see two major tectonic plates drifting apart above sea level .
Walking through the park takes a good 1 - 2 hours , but the landscape is so gorgeous ( and it ’s not a difficult walk ) .
You can also go scuba diving between the plates and there are some good guided walks .
If you have a vehicle , take Highway 1 east from the city until you hit Route 35 .
Follow that north to Gullfoss .
The journey will be just under 2 hours .
On your way back to Reykjavik you can stop at Geysir and Thingvellir via Route 37/365 .
If you are not returning to Reykjavik , do Gullfoss last so you can continue on Highway 1 around the island .
5. Watch the Northern Lights
From September to April , the Northern Lights become more visible here .
These dancing lights are one of the greatest natural wonders in the world .
To witness the aurora borealis in all their glory in Iceland requires patience , luck , and darkness .
The country towns in the north are the best place to see the lights , especially during periods of “ low ” activity .
If the lights are really strong , you can sometimes see them in Rekjyavik .
6. Visit Jökulsárlón ( The Jökulsár Lagoon )
Located in the southeast of Iceland , this ice floe is only a couple of decades old and now one of the most popular attractions in the area country .
Breiðamerkurjökull Glacier retreated very quickly from 1920 to 1965 , leaving this breathtaking lagoon behind , which is up to 190 meters deep .
Icebergs float in the lagoon all year .
I enjoy just sitting and listening to the ice blocks crash into each other on their way out to sea .
You can also take boat trips around the lagoon .
The lagoon is located right on Highway 1 about 5 hours from Reykjavik if you ’re heading east ( counter - clockwise ) around the island .
There is free parking available .
7. Do a Glacial Trek
During the winter months , the glaciers get a bit sturdier , and groups of tourists are led across them .
There ’s no better way to see the glaciers than to walk on them , releasing your inner Arctic explorer .
Vatnajökull is one of the most popular glaciers to hike , though there are others around the country , as well .
Some tour companies that offer glacial expeditions are Extreme Iceland , Icelandic Mountain Guides , Trek Iceland .

My love for Iceland became an obsession as I ’ve drawn back by the people and the raw natural beauty of the terrain .
Do n’t let the high prices scare you away from Iceland .
There ’s plenty of ways to save money while you ’re there .
Get inspired , take advantage of the cheap flights , head north away from the crowds , and sit in a hot springs while watching the northern lights !

Over the years , I ’ve tolerated a lot of operating system abuse .
Earlier in my career , I tended to keep my mouth shut ( mainly because I did n’t know any better ) , but over time , the annoyances have been building up into a crescendo of anger , such that at the end of the day I consistently find myself red-faced , foaming at the mouth , and screaming adjective interjection adjective noun , exclamation1 at my monitor .
As the blood boils and the temper flares at the inanity I find myself forced to endure , I ’ve consoled myself by deciding that I would some day vent my frustrations to the world at large .
This is that rant .
The Actors
I ’ve used variants of two main operating systems .
I ’ve decided to give them fake names to protect the guilty .
The first operating system , the older of the two , is known as Eunuchs .
The first time I used Eunuchs , I found it strange and cryptic .
I could n’t understand its attachment to the command line , nor could I grasp why so many developers and universities were so enamored with it .
My very first paid programming project involved me writing a deployment tool that was used to release Eunuchs applications to production .
However ( and I found this quite strange at the time ) , the developers wanted the tool written in that other operating system , so they could get a nice usable GUI for it .
That other operating system , which I ’ll call MacroHard Windows , was all about the GUI .
Their command line was terrible , and it is terrible still .
Back then , being paid to write a GUI deployment tool , I did n’t see why that mattered .
I ’ve written a lot of code since then , both in Eunuchs and with MacroHard tools , and I ’ve decided that MacroHard is appropriately named .
It ’s hard .
Really hard .
The Rant
Windows is the worst development environment on the face of the planet
To be clear , I mean that without the slightest hint of exaggeration .
For example , I understand times were hard in the early days of computing .
I never had the opportunity to work on the ENIAC , but apparently it once went almost 5 days without a failure , something I have yet to achieve on any MacroHard platform .
The first time I ever programmed anything , it was a blackjack program on my calculator .
Programming on Windows makes me yearn for those halcyon calculator days of yesteryear .
For example ?
Eunuchs has files and processes .
Sure , it has pipes and sockets and runtime process information too , but those are just files , really .
Sure it has network servers and daemons and startup commands , but those are nothing more than processes , and configuring them means putting a bunch of stuff in a bunch of files .
If you want to manage them , you use file commands .
Or process commands .
Yes , sometimes they ’re cryptic , and sometimes the names of things look like they were invented by 19 year old kids whose idea of social interaction was playing World of Warcraft , but it ’s really not that hard to figure out once you get the hang of it .
Windows has files and processes and registry hives and COM + catalogs and IIS metabases and app pools and Active Directory stores and Windows services and performance counters and event logs and global assembly caches .
If you want to manage them , you open a barely usable GUI , and if you click into enough nested dialog boxes , you might get lucky and find the setting you need .
Or you buy “ enterprise ” tools to manage them like Macrohard Operations ManagerTM , which has an entirely different maze of dialog boxes to follow .
A colleague once put it better than I possibly could :
The solution to MacroHard problems is to buy more MacroHard solutions .
Somehow , far too many IT executives have been sold on the idea that this is easier for people to understand .
It is n’t .
Oh sure you can script these multitude of entities that Windows supports , if you have a new enough version of Windows .
Of course , every component has a different scriptable interface .
Hell , even IIS has multiple scriptable interfaces .
You can use ADSI or WMI , but only WMI if you ’re configuring an IIS 6.0 server .
You can use C++ or VB to use ABO ( admin base objects ) , or C++ to use specialized COM interfaces .
And sometimes , the canonical UIs that MacroHard want you to use interact with the subsystem you ’re trying to script in such a way as to effectively remove any confidence in your scripts .
For example , it ’s possible to script your way into a disabled Windows service , where apparently the only way to remove the service is to shut down the services MacroHard Management Console Snap - InTM .
If you ’re a Eunuchs developer , you may want to re-read that last sentence , because it probably does n’t appear even remotely possible to you that having a GUI open could prevent you from scripting the removal of a daemon .
But are n’t you being too hard on MacroHard ?
I suppose there are some things that MacroHard has done better than Eunuchs .
For example , MacroHard has Active Directory , which is an enterprise - ready LDAP security solution , not something you get out of the box in Eunuchs .
And with Active Directory comes Windows Integration , where a bunch of applications that MacroHard wrote are integrated into the operating system in such a way that they automatically authenticate based on your Windows login .
For example , they wrote one application ( a particularly bad one , but quite widely used ) called Internet Destroyer .
It ’s possible , as a web developer , for you to set your web site up requiring integrated Windows authentication .
Anyone using Internet Destroyer to visit your website will automatically authenticate against your domain controller , which is occasionally quite handy .
However , the magic that makes that work is sometimes too obscure to fathom .
For example , you can set up system - wide database settings in Windows called DSN’s .
The DSN gives you two ways to connect to the database – using Windows Authentication , or using a SQL login .
MacroHard also has a component called perfmon , that collects performance information for you , which has an option to log that information to a database given a DSN .
Strangely , using a SQL login does n’t work with perfmon , although good luck finding documentation that says so .
If you ’re a Eunuchs developer , you might want to re-read that last sentence , since it probably does n’t appear even remotely possible that a process can’t connect to a database using a connection string with a database login .
Ok , but why are you really mad ?
I ’m mad because once upon a time , I wanted to know why a build failed , and that build happened to be using the MacroHard test framework called MHTest , as opposed to the open source alternatives , which are known for their annoying insistence to tell you why your build fails when it does fail .
Here ’s what I got with MHTest :
Test Failure : VerifyLogFilePath
At first I just found it amusing that MHTest told me what failed , but not why it failed .
After all , that annoyance only manifests itself on the command line ; if I used Visual Studio to run the MHTests , it ’ll give me more information .
After a while , I thought it ’d be nice to see how much of our code was actually covered by MHTest .
Naturally , I tried to integrate that feedback into our build , which meant calling it on the command line .
It turns out that MHTest ’s code coverage spits out a binary file .
If you want to interpret it , you ’ll need to use Visual Studio .
But the good news is that , unlike the open source alternatives , MHTest randomly adds files to your projects and only works if you add magic GUIDs to your project files .
This is actually a great feature if , like me , you get billed by the hour and you want large checkins to pretend that you accomplished a lot .
I ’m mad because I wanted to run both versions 1 and 2 of Powershell on my machine ( Powershell is MacroHard ’s attempt at a less sucky command line ) , so that we could test against both versions , but MacroHard wo n’t let you run both on them on one machine .
I ’m mad because , for years , I thought that the Windows command line would randomly hang , but recently I discovered that if you accidentally click a mouse in a command window while it ’s running a process spitting out console messages , and you happen to be in Quick Edit Mode ( which is a Windows command line euphemism for completely unusable , but less so than the alternative ) , then the process will be paused , until you right click in the same command window .
I ’m mad because I like to test websites with multiple versions of Internet Destroyer , but without some crazy hackery , it ’s not possible to run multiple versions on one machine .
I ’m mad because I installed MacroHard .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 , which forced me to close down every application on my machine – yes , forced , not asked – and reboot my machine , only to find out that it ’s buggy enough that MacroHard feels compelled to supercede it with .
NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 Service Release 1 .
I ’m mad because when I finally figure out the right combination of nested modal dialog boxes to pop up to configure IIS , I find a text box into which I cannot paste and from which I cannot copy , and whose ‘ OK ’ button is only enabled after accidentally clicking in the upper left hand quadrant of grayspace on the form .
I ’m mad because when I want to add a keyboard shortcut to Visual Studio I get a box showing me 3.87 commands at a time ( out of hundreds ) from which to select the command to assign the shortcut to , with no way to expand my view .
I ’m mad because I have absolutely no clue what error 0×00001ad59add means , and I am the goddamned system administrator I ’m supposed to contact .
Mainly I ’m mad because I love software development , and MacroHard has done much to lessen the joy that comes with hacking .
Reasons for optimism
Eunuchs is indeed an ironic name , given that modern derivatives can claim a veritable biblical list of progenitors : Eunuchs beget Minix , which beget Linux , which beget Knoppix …
Those children have traditionally been considered as a better server platform than MacroHard , although MacroHard has made unfortunate inroads ( in part thanks to one good thing MacroHard did – they were the first to realize that a “ server ” did n’t have to mean big iron ) .
But the traditional advantage of MacroHard came from its desktop market , where until recently it had no competitors .
It is one of the ironies of our industry that the competitor that now exists is the same one which MacroHard , in its infancy , was commissioned to help , and that the competitor now runs a derivative of Eunuchs .
OS X is becoming the de facto operating system for those who want to continue having fun developing software , but who like pretty and usable GUIs .
It will never have much of a server market , but it does n’t matter : what you develop on a Mac can be deployed to a Linux server with only minor gotchas like filename case - sensitivity .
Many developers have never needed GUIs , or have been satisfied with the uglier ( but improving ) ones found in the Linux world , and they continue to have fun developing software .
But I understand now why those developers who acted as the customers for my first paid project wanted a GUI : the command line is absolutely essential to development , but GUIs are helpful from time to time as well .
Large portions of the Linux world have understood that principle for a long time , but it took Apple ’s expertise on usability and their operating system ’s Eunuchs heritage to provide the first OS that was both user - friendly and developer friendly .
Unfortunately for MacroHard , they are too weighted down by the enormous size of Windows to respond effectively .
It took them five years to get Vista out the door , and that was only after removing every interesting feature from it .
And even now , nobody uses it .
As a software consultant with a history of working on MacroHard platforms , you ’d think I ’d know something about Vista , but honestly , I have n’t even seen it .
The development world is changing , and that ’s a good thing .
I have a feeling that the future of software development will be much more fun than it is now .

This is reprinted from the Mises Institute with permission .
An MP3 audio recording of this article , read by the author , is available for download .
One of the fatalities of publishing at a rocket pace is that some amazing treasures get overlooked .
So this column , perhaps the first of a series , covers some titles in the Mises Store that have not received much attention in the praiseworthy swirl of mania over Rothbard ’s Mystery of Banking and America ’s Great Depression , and Mises ’s Causes of the Economic Crisis , titles which speak directly to the moment .
I ’ll start with an unlikely title here , a book by an author you have never heard of .
His name is Faustino Ballvé .
He was from Mexico , a working economist whose intellectual life was changed completely when Mises visited the country and lectured .
Mises and Ballvé carried on an extensive correspondence after .
Ballvé continued to read and correspond for years .
Finally the professor sat down and wrote a primer on economics .
The result was Essentials of Economics , first in Spanish and then translated to English .
Nowhere does this book specifically say that it is free - market oriented or Austrian or Misesian .
To Ballvé , this is just good economics , and he presents it as such .
He organizes the book in a very clear manner .
What is economics ?
What is the market .
The role of the entrepreneur .
Capital , labor , and wages .
Money and credit .
And so on .
The tone is clear and calm but never boring .
Effervescent is a word I would use .
Another word is elegant .
Clearly Leonard Read of FEE was mightily impressed because he used scarce resources to put this book by an unknown into print and to promote it very heavily .
There is a certain generation out there for whom this book was very important .
Then … it went away .
Until this year .
Now it is in print again , and the result is glorious .
After you read Economics in One Lesson , this is an excellent book to take you to the next level .
Hazlitt covers the general lessons and applications , but this book zeros in on particular aspects of theory that are essential for stage two .
Essentials focuses on positive theory but anyone who learns economics this way is immediately confronted with the reality that this is not the economic theory propounded in the business press or accepted by the government .
The major theoretical apparatus that these people use has its origin in the work of John Maynard Keynes , whose major assumption is that the price system does n’t work properly ; it needs to be goaded and prodded this way and that , with policy experts at the helm .
The theory has been failing for nearly three - quarters of a century but no matter : Keynesianism is like a virus that never goes away .
So it is something you must learn about .
There is the wonderful treatment of Keynes ’s book by Henry Hazlitt called The Failure of the New Economics .
But you might not be interested in a line - by - line critique .
What you want is the overview of what it is and what is wrong with it .
That ’s where this gem by V. Orval Watts comes in : Away from Freedom .
It was written in 1952 , a highly significant year because it was from a time in which Keynesian theory was entrenching itself deeply into economics departments around the country .
It was a time of heartbreak for anyone trained in the old classical style , because they began to see economic science turned on its head .
Instead of offering a defense of economic freedom , it began to be used as a cover for state intervention in economic life .
Instead of telling government officials what is not possible , economists were urging the state to do more — a departure from centuries of progress in science .
Professor Watts took his PhD from Harvard ( in a “ nobler era , ” says Rothbard ) and taught in the Ivy League circuit for years before moving to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and finally following Leonard Read to FEE .
He wrote this while there .
It burns with anti-Keynesian passion , for he is ever aware of the implications of the theory being propounded in college classrooms : it meant the end of economic freedom .
This book explains where Keynesian theory goes wrong and shows why fiscal fine - tuning and monetary manipulation cannot achieve their desired ends .
It is especially interesting coming from someone who watched as all his former colleagues fell for the wizardry associated with Keynesianism .
He wrote this book as a desperate plea for them to turn away from fallacy and back to the truths that took centuries to build up .
And so here we have what is surely the first full - blown smash attack on the economics of Paul Samuelson , whose principles became the leading textbook for decades , despite its persistent sneering at laissez - faire and its off - handed and implicit defense of socialism .
Watts ’s account depends heavily on one of the great anti-Keynesian books of all times , but one you have probably never heard of : The Economics of Illusion by L. Albert Hahn .
He was a banker in Germany in the 1920s , and he was of the view that monetary inflation was the key to preventing economic slumps .
Then he saw where this line of thinking led .
Germany ’s economy was utterly destroyed through hyperinflation , which in turn led to dictatorship and war and social collapse .
Imagine what it must have been like for him to see these errors of the 1920s ascend to the status of scientific theory in the England and the United States in the 1930s .
He set out to try to stop it with this book , which shows how Keynesian policy can create temporary booms that always end in bust .
The prosperity generated through macroeconomic planning amounts to a mirage — the “ economics of illusion , ” he called it .
Mises thought very highly of this book , as did Watts and Hazlitt and many others .
It was hugely influential in creating the anti-Keynesian backlash , a true foundational text , one that ironically appeared in English the same year as Mises ’s Human Action .
Perhaps that is why it has been overlooked ?
It is hard to say , but Joseph Salerno confirmed my sense of the book ’s importance .
It turns out to have had a big influence on his thinking as well .
Finally , the great W.H.
Hutt wrote
The Keynesian Episode as a comprehensive critique of the Keynesian hubris that it had somehow refuted Say ’s law .
Hutt was trained in the classical tradition but his virtuosic performance in this book shows why the Austrians have traditionally claimed him .
Hutt writes in an old - fashioned and high style of English that is a far cry from the rhetorical dazzle of Watts , but students of economics will appreciate his sobriety and precision .

According to the * News Register* , Evergreen " exudes the gung - ho patriotism that is associated with the company founder , a political conservative who enjoys close ties with the federal government and military . "
No kidding .
Back in the late ' 80s , the company " acknowledged one agreement under which his companies provide occasional jobs and cover to foreign nationals the CIA wants taken out of other countries or brought into the United States . "
More recently , Evergreen 's parent company flew Bill O'Reilly into Kuwait in 2006 , according to SourceWatch .
But rest easy : The Oregonian reports that the company struck out with its sales pitch .
UPDATE : As several commenters have pointed out , Evergreen 's offer is particularly weird , since the state does its voting by mail .
Voters get ballots sent to them , and can then return them to county election offices by 8 pm on Tuesday .
Perhaps that 's where Evergreen was looking to keep the peace .

Galinsky coaches aspiring reality TV stars out of an unassuming storefront in Alphabet City and is fueled by ethos and unbridled confidence .
He is positive he can make anyone a reality star .
The program is a hybrid unscripted school / TVpilot and is both authentically oblivious and accidentally gangster .
This bizarre invention of his , follows offbeat bands of unexpected characters on the road to reality TV stardom .
The best part of all – ' Galinsky Graduates ' are really being cast in major reality TV shows .

Yesterday , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to warn him that California was suffering a liquidity problem and needed federal assistance in order to avoid insolvency .
Below is the text of that letter .
First of all , let me commend you for your leadership to enact emergency economic stabilization legislation .
This credit crisis has the power to grind the U.S. economy to a halt if swift and decisive action is not taken immediately .
The federal rescue package is not a bailout of Wall Street tycoons – it is a lifeboat for millions of Americans whose life savings , businesses , retirement plans and jobs are at stake .
I have communicated this message to the entire California Congressional delegation and will continue to press for passage of an emergency rescue plan .
Like many other states , California is feeling the enormous effects of this crisis on our economy .
California ’s economy is dynamic and resilient , but also uniquely sensitive to national and international economic conditions and fluctuations in the financial markets .
The credit crisis has frozen investment and commerce , forcing businesses and families to stop purchasing goods and services .
This has resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs and billions of dollars in lost tax revenue to the state .
Most immediately , California and a number of other state and local governments are experiencing the lack of liquidity in the credit markets firsthand .
Many states and local governments have been unable to secure financing for bond offerings and for routine cash flow used to make critical payments to schools , local governments and law enforcement .
While some states may be able to absorb a delay or obtain high - interest financing through private banks , California is so large that our short - term cash flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states .
We expect to issue $ 7 billion in Revenue Anticipation Notes for short term cash flow purposes in a matter of days .
Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis that restores confidence and liquidity to the credit markets , California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the Federal Treasury for short - term financing .

The ( static ) dependencies problem — your compiler can't generally help you with finding dependencies on properties , or even tell you what property names are used in your system .
He suggests using a registry of permissible property names as one solution .
I strongly considered that approach for Wyvern , but wound up relying on a mix of dynamic tracing and static analysis to get me the dependency graph , and it 's been " accurate enough " for my needs .
In particular , synthesizing property names on the fly happens about as ( in ) frequently as Reflection happens in Java .
So for the most part the dependencies issue is as tractable as it is in Java : " tractable enough " .

Substituting actions Fowler suggests that it 's difficult to replace an existing property access with an action .
This is only true in the Java implementation ( hence , true for my game ) .
In languages like Python , Ruby and JavaScript 1.5 that support property - access syntax for getters and setters this is a non-issue .
Note : Today 's entry is a technical article : it is n't funny .
At least not intentionally .
Update , Oct 20th 2008 : I 've added an Updates section , where I 'll try to track significant responses , at least for a week or so .
There are three entries so far .
Today I thought I 'd talk about a neat design pattern that does n't seem to get much love : the Properties Pattern .
In its fullest form it 's also sometimes called the Prototype Pattern .
People use this pattern all over the place , and I 'll give you a nice set of real - life examples in a little bit .
It 's a design pattern that 's useful in every programming language , and as we 'll see shortly , it 's also pretty darn useful as a general - purpose persistence strategy .
But even though this pattern is near - universal , people do n't talk about it very often .
I think this is because while it 's remarkably flexible and adaptable , the Properties Pattern has a reputation for not being " real " design or " real " modeling .
In fact it 's often viewed as a something of a shameful cheat , particularly by overly - zealous proponents of object - oriented design ( in language domains ) or relational design ( in database domains . )
These well - meaning folks tend to write off the Properties Pattern as " just name / value pairs " – a quick hack that will just get you into trouble down the road .
I hope to offer a different and richer perspective here .
With luck , this article might even help begin the process making the Properties Pattern somewhat fashionable again .
Time will tell .
Before I tell you anything else about the Properties Pattern , let 's review some of the most popular techniques we programmers have for modeling problems .
I should point out that none of these techniques is tied to " static typing " or " dynamic typing " per se .
Each of these modeling techniques can be used with or without static checking .
The modeling problem is orthogonal to static typing , so regardless of your feelings about static checking , you should recognize the intrinsic value in each of these techniques .
You know all about this one .
Class - based OO design is the 800 - pound gorilla of domain modeling these days .
Its appeal is that it 's a natural match for the way we already model things in everyday life .
It can take a little practice at first , but for most people class modeling quickly becomes second nature .
Although the industry loves OO design , it 's not especially well liked as an academic topic .
This is because OO design has no real mathematical foundation to support it — at least , not until someone comes along and creates a formal model for side effects .
The concepts of OOP stem not from mathematics but from fuzzy intuition .
This in some sense explains its popularity , and it also explains why OOP has so many subtly different flavors in practice : whether ( and how ) to support multiple inheritance , static members , method overloading vs. rich signatures , and so on .
Industry folks can never quite agree on what OOP is , but we love it all the same .
Relational database modeling is a bit harder and takes more practice , because its strength stems from its mathematical foundation .
Relational modeling can be intuitive , depending on the problem domain , but most people would agree that it is not necessarily so : it takes some real skill to learn how to model arbitrary problems as relational schemas .
Object modeling and relational modeling produce very different designs , each with its strengths and weaknesses , and one of the trickiest problems we face in our industry has always been the object - relational mapping ( ORM ) problem .
It 's a big deal .
Some people may have let you to believe that it 's simple , or that it 's automatically handled by frameworks such as Rails or Hibernate .
Those who know better know just how hard ORM is in real - world production schemas and systems .
XML provides yet another technique for modeling problems .
Usually XML is used to model data , but it can also be used to model code .
For instance , XML - based frameworks such as Apache Ant and XSLT offer computational facilities : loops or recursion , conditional expressions and setting variables .
In many domains , programmers will decide on an XML representation before they 've thought much about the class model , because for those domains XML actually offers the most convenient way of thinking about the problem .
The kinds of data that work well with XML modeling tend to be poorly suited for relational modeling , and vice - versa , with the practical result that XML / relational mapping is almost as infamously thorny as O/R mapping .
And as for XML / OO mapping , most of us tend to treat it as a more or less solved problem .
However , in practice there are several competing ways of doing XML / OO mapping .
The W3C DOM and SAX enjoy the broadest use , but they are both sufficiently cumbersome that alternatives such as JDom and REXML ( among others ) have gained significant followings .
I mention this not to start a fight , but only to illustrate that XML is a third modeling technique in its own right .
It has both natural resonances and surfaces of friction with both relational design and OO design , as one might expect .
I 'm not claiming that these three modeling schools are the only schools out there – far from it !
Two other obvious candidates are Functional modeling ( in the sense of Functional Programming , with roots in the lambda calculus ) and Prolog - style logical modeling .
Both are mature problem - modeling strategies , each with its pros and cons , and each having varying degrees of overlap with other strategies .
And there are still other schools , perhaps dozens of them .
The important takeaway is that none of these modeling schools is " better " than its peers .
There are tradeoffs involved with each school , by definition — otherwise all but one would have disappeared by now .
Sometimes it makes sense to use multiple modeling techniques in the same problem space .
You might do a mixed XML / relational data design , or a class - based OO design with Functional aspects , or embed a rules engine in a larger system .
Choosing the right technique comes down to .
For any given real - world problem , one or two modeling schools are likely to be the most convenient approaches .
Exactly which one or two depends entirely on the particulars of the problem .
By convenient , I mean something different from what you might be thinking .
To me , a convenient design is one that is convenient for the users of the design .
And it should also be convenient to express , in the sense of minimalism : all else being equal , a smaller design beats a big one .
One way of looking at this is that the design should be convenient for itself !
Unfortunately , most programmers ( myself included ) tend to use exactly the wrong definition of convenience : they choose a modeling technique that is convenient for themselves .
If they only have experience in one or two schools , guess which techniques they 'll jump to for every problem they face ?
This problem rears its head throughout computing .
There 's always a " best " tool for any job , but if programmers do n't know how to use it , they 'll choose an inferior tool because they think their schedule does n't permit a learning curve .
In the long run they 're hurting their schedules , but it 's hard to see that when you 're down in the trenches .
Modeling schools are just like programming languages , web frameworks , editing environments and many other tools : you wo n't know how to pick the right one unless you have a reasonably good understanding of all of them , and preferably some practice with each .
The important thing to remember is that all modeling schools are " first class " in the sense of being able to represent any problem , and no modeling school is ideal for every situation .
Just because you are most comfortable solving a problem using a particular strategy does not mean that it is the ideal solution to the problem .
The best programmers aim to master all available techniques , giving them a better chance at making the right choices .
With this context in mind , I claim that the Properties Pattern is yet another kind of domain modeling , with its own unique strengths and tradeoffs , distinct from all the other modeling schools I 've mentioned .
It is their first - class peer , inasmuch as it is capable of modeling the same broad set of problem domains .
After we 've finished talking about the Properties Pattern in exhausting detail , I think I 'll have convinced you of the pattern 's status as a major school of modeling .
Hopefully you 'll also start to have a feel for the kinds of problems it 's well - suited to solve – sometimes more so than other schools , even your current favorite .
But before we dive into technical details , let 's take a brief peek at a fascinating comparison of Property - based modeling to class - based OO design .
It 's a non-technical argument that I think has some real force behind it .
Douglas Hofstadter has spent a lifetime thinking about the way we think .
He 's written about it perhaps more than anyone else in the past century .
Even if someone out there has beaten him in sheer quantity of words on the subject , nobody has come close to rivaling his style or his impact on programmers everywhere .
All of his books are wonderfully imaginative and are loads of fun to read , but if you 're a programmer and you have n't yet read Gödel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid ( usually known as " GEB " ) , then I envy you : you 're in for a real treat .
Get yourself a copy and settle in for one of the most interesting , maddening , awe - inspiring and just plain fun books ever written .
The Pulitzer Prize it won does n't nearly do it justice .
It 's one of the greatest and most unique works of imagination of all time .
Hofstadter made a compelling argument in GEB ( thirty years ago ! ) that property - based modeling is fundamental to the way our brains work .
In Chapter XI ( " Brains and Thoughts " ) , there are three little sections titled , andthat together form the conceptual underpinnings of the Properties Pattern .
In these little discussions Hofstadter explains how the Prototype Principle relates to classic class - based modeling .
I wish I could reproduce his discussion in full here — it 's only three pages — but I 'll have to just encourage you to go read it instead .
His thesis is this : Hofstadter offers several supporting examples for this thesis , but I 'll paraphrase one of my all - time favorites .
It goes more or less as follows .
Imagine you 're listening to announcers commenting on an NFL ( American football ) game .
They 're talking about a new rookie player that you do n't know anything about .
At this point , the rookie – let 's say his name is L.T. – is just an instance of the class " football player " with no differentiation .
The announcers mention that L.T. is a running back : a bit like Emmitt Smith in that he has great speed and balance , and he 's great at finding holes in the defense .
At this point , L.T. is basically an " instance " of ( or a clone of ) Emmitt Smith : he just inherited all of Emmitt 's properties , at least the ones that you 're familiar with .
Then the announcers add that L.T. is also great at catching the ball , so he 's sometimes used as a wide receiver .
Oh , and he wears a visor .
And he runs like Walter Payton .
And so on .
As the announcers add distinguishing attributes , L.T. the Rookie gradually takes shape as a particular entity that relies less and less on the parent class of " football player " .
He 's become a very , very specific football player .
But here 's the rub : even though he 's a specific instance , you can now use him as a class !
If Joe the Rookie comes along next season , the announcers might say : " Joe 's a lot like L.T. " , and just like that , Joe has inherited all of L.T. 's properties , each of which can be overridden to turn Joe into his own specific , unique instance of a football player .
This is called prototype - based modeling : Emmitt Smith was a prototype for L.T. , and L.T. became a prototype for Joe , who in turn can serve as the prototype for someone else .
Hofstadter says of The Prototype Principle : Again , it 's a three - page discussion that I 've just skimmed here .
You should go read it for yourself .
Heck , you should read the whole book : it 's one of the greatest books ever written , period , and every programmer ought to be familiar with it .
Hopefully my little recap of Hofstadter 's argument has convinced you that my calling it the " Universal Design Pattern " might just possibly be more than a marketing trick to get you to read my blog , and that the rest of this article is worth a look .
The Properties Pattern is unfortunately big enough to deserve a whole book .
Calling an entire school of modeling a " design pattern " is actually selling it short by a large margin .
Hence , if this article seems excruciatingly long , it 's because I 've tried to cram a whole book into a blog , as I often do .
But look on the bright side !
I 've saved you a bunch of time this way .
This will go much faster than reading a whole book .
Even so , do n't feel bad if it takes a few sittings to get through it all .
It 's still a lot of information .
I considered splitting it into 3 articles , but instead I just cut about half of the material out .
( Jeff and Joel : seriously .
I cut 50 % . ) I assume I 've already convinced you that this pattern is worth learning about , or you 'd have left by now .
I 'm showing you these use cases not to draw you in , but to show you some of the very different ways the pattern can be used .
We could probably find hundreds of examples , but I 'll focus on just a handful of real - world uses that I hope will illustrate just how widespread and flexible it is .
Before we start , there are two things to keep in mind .
The first is that people have different names for this pattern , because even though it 's quite commonplace , there has n't been much literature on it .
One paper calls it Do - It - Yourself Reflection .
Another article calls it Adaptive Object Modeling .
See Further reading for the few links I could dig up .
Whatever name you use , once you know how to look for it , you 'll start seeing this pattern everywhere , wearing various disguises .
Now that we have a common name for it , it should be easier to spot in the wild .
The second thing to keep in mind is that the Properties Pattern scales up : you can choose how much to use it in your system .
It can be anything from simple property lists attached to a few of your classes to make them user - annotatable , up through a full - fledged prototype - based framework that serves as the foundation for modeling everything in your system .
So our examples will range from small ones to very big ones .
One nice small - scale example of the pattern is the Eclipse Java Development Tools ( JDT ) : a set of classes that model the Java programming language itself , including the abstract syntax tree , the symbol graph and other metadata .
This is used by the Eclipse backend to do all the neat magic it does with your Java code , by treating Java source code as a set of data structures .
You can view the javadoc for this class hierarchy at help.eclipse.org .
Click on JDT Plug - in Developer Guide , then Programmer 's Guide , then JDT Core , then .
This package defines strongly - typed classes and interfaces that Eclipse uses for modeling the Java programming language itself .
If you click through any class inheriting fromyou'll see that it has a property list .'s javadoc comment says : I like this example for several reasons .
First , it 's a very simple use of the Properties pattern .
It does n't muck around with prototypes , serialization , metaprogramming or many of the other things I 'll talk about in a little bit .
So it 's a good introduction .
Second , it 's placed smack in the middle of a very , very strongly - typed system , showing that the Properties pattern and conventional statically - typed classed - based modeling are by no means mutually exclusive , and can complement one another nicely .
And third , their property system itself is fairly strongly typed : they define a set of support classes such as , andto help place some constraints on client property values .
I 'm not a huge fan of this approach myself , since I feel it makes their API fairly heavyweight .
But it 's a perfectly valid stylistic choice , and it 's useful for you to know that you can implement the pattern this way if you so choose .
At the other end of the " how far to go with it " spectrum we have the JavaScript programming language , which places the Prototype Principle and Properties Pattern at the very core of the language .
People love to lump dynamic languages together , and they 'll often write off JavaScript as some sort of inferior version of Perl , Python or Ruby .
I was guilty of this myself for over a decade .
But JavaScript is substantively different from most other dynamic languages ( even Lisp ) , because it has made the Properties Pattern its central modeling mechanism .
It borrowed this heritage largely from a language called Self , and some other modern languages ( notably Io and one other language that I 'll talk about below ) have also chosen prototypes and properties over traditional classes .
In JavaScript , every user - interactible object in the system inherits from , which has a built - in property list .
Prototype inheritance ( think back to our example of the Emmitt Smith instance having been the prototype for the L.T. instance ) is a first - class language mechanism , and JavaScript offers several kinds of syntactic support for accessing properties and declaring property lists ( as " object literals " ) .
JavaScript is often accurately described as the world 's most misunderstood programming language .
Armed with our newfound knowledge , we can start to see JavaScript in a new light .
To use JavaScript effectively , you need to gain experience with a whole new School of Modeling .
If you simply try to use JavaScript as a substitute for ( say ) Java or Python , you 'll encounter tremendous friction .
Since most of us have precious little actual experience with property - based modeling , this is exactly what happens , and it's no wonder JavaScript gets a bad rap .
In addition to how centrally you want to use the Properties pattern in your system , you can also decide how recursive to make it : do your properties have explicit meta- properties ?
Do you have metaprogramming hooks ?
How much built - in reflection do you offer ?
JavaScript offers a few metaprogramming hooks .
One such hook is the recently - introduced , which lets you intercept a failed attempt to invoke a nonexistent function - valued property on an object .
Unfortunately JavaScript does not offer as many hooks as I 'd like .
For instance , there is no corresponding __noSuchField__ hook , which limits the overall flexibility somewhat .
And there are no standard mechanisms for property - change event notification , nor any reasonable way to provide such a mechanism .
So JavaScript gets it mostly right , but it stops short , possibly for performance reasons , of offering a fully - extensible metaprogramming system such as those offered by SmallTalk and to some extent , Ruby .
Before we move on to other uses of the Property Pattern , let 's put JavaScript ( and its central use of the pattern ) into perspective , by comparing it to another successful language .
First : JavaScript is not my favorite language .
I 've done a lot of JavaScript programming over the past 2 years or so , both client - side and server - side , so I 'm as familiar with it as I am with any other language I 've used .
JavaScript in its current incarnation is not the best tool for many tasks .
For instance , it 's not great for building APIs , and it 's not great for Unix scripting the way Perl and Ruby are .
It has no library or package system , no namespaces , and is missing many other modern conveniences .
If you 're looking for a general - purpose language , JavaScript leaves you wanting .
But JavaScript is the best tool for many other tasks .
As just one example , JavaScript is an outstanding language for writing unit tests — both for itself , and also for testing code in other languages .
Being able to use the Properties Pattern to treat every object ( and class ) as a bag of properties makes the creation of mock objects a dream come true .
The syntactic support for object literals makes it even better .
You do n't need any of the silly frameworks you see coming from Java , C++ or even Python .
And JavaScript is one of the two best scripting languages on the planet , in the most correct sense of the term " scripting language " : namely , languages that were designed specifically to be embedded in larger host systems and then used to manipulate or " script " objects in the host system .
This is what JavaScript was designed to do .
It 's reasonably small with some optional extensions , it has a reasonably tight informal specification , and it has a carefully crafted interface for surfacing host - system objects transparently in JavaScript .
In contrast , Perl , Python and Ruby are huge sprawls , all trying ( like C++ and Java ) to be the best language for every task .
The only other mainstream language out there that competes with JavaScript for scripting arbitrary host systems is Lua , famous for being the scripting language of choice for the game industry .
And would n't you know it , Lua is also a language that uses the Properties Pattern as its central design .
Its centralstructure is remarkably similar to JavaScript 's built - in , and Lua also uses prototypes rather than classes .
So the world 's two most successful scripting languages are prototype - based systems .
Is this just a cosmic coincidence ?
Or is it possible that a suitably designed class - based language could have been just as successful ?
It 's hard to say .
I 've used Jython as an embedded scripting language for a long time , and it 's worked pretty well .
But I 've personally come to believe that the Properties Pattern is actually better suited for extensibility than class - based modeling , and that prototype - based languages make better extension languages than class - based languages .
That 's effectively what 's happening with embedded scripting : the end - users are growing and extending the host system .
In fact I was convinced of it before I even knew JavaScript .
Let 's take a look at another interesting " Who uses it ? " example : Wyvern .
My multiplayer game Wyvern takes the Properties Pattern quite far as well , although in some different directions than what we 've discussed so far .
I designed Wyvern long before I 'd heard of Self or Lua , and before I 'd learned anything about JavaScript .
In retrospect it 's amazing how similar my design was to theirs .
Wyvern is implemented in Java , but the rootclass has a property list , much like JavaScript ' sbase class .
Wyvern has prototype inheritance , but since I 'd never heard of prototypes before , I called them archetypes .
In Wyvern , any game object can be the archetype for any other game object , and property lookup and inheritance work more or less identically to the way they work in JavaScript .
I arrived at this design after scratching my head for months ( in late 1996 ) over how to build the ultimate extensible game .
I wanted all the game content to be created by players , and I came up with dozens upon dozens of detailed use cases , in all of which I wanted players to be able to extend the game functionality in surprising new ways .
In the end I arrived at a set of interleaved design patterns , including a rich command system , a rich hooks / advice system , and several other subsystems I 'd love to document someday .
But the core data model was the Properties Pattern .
In some ways , Wyvern 's implementation is more full - featured than JavaScript's .
Wyvern offers more metaprogramming facilities , such as vetoable property change notifications , which gives in - game objects tremendous flexibility in responding to their environment .
Wyvern also supports both transient and persistent properties , a scheme I 'll discuss below .
On other ways , Wyvern just made different decisions .
One big one is that Wyvern 's property values are statically typed .
The property names are always strings , just like in JavaScript , but the values can be various leaf types ( ints , longs , booleans , strings , etc. ) , or functions ( a trick that was n't easy in Java ) , or even archetypes .
But despite the differences , Wyvern 's core property - list infrastructure is a lot like that of JavaScript , Self and Lua .
And it 's been a design I 've been fundamentally happy with for over ten years .
It 's met or exceeded all my original expectations for enabling end - user extensibility , particularly in its ability to let people extend the in - game behavior on the fly , without needing to reboot .
This has proven extraordinarily powerful ( and popular with the players . )
Where Wyvern clearly got the pattern wrong was in its lack of support for syntax .
As soon as I decided to use the Properties pattern centrally in my game , I should have decided to use a programming language better suited for implementing the pattern : ideally , one that supports it from the ground up .
I eventually wound up using Python ( actually , Jython ) for a ton of my code , and it was far more succinct and flexible than anything I wrote in Java .
But I was foolishly worried about performance , and as a result I wound up writing at least half the high - level game logic in Java and piling on hundreds of thousands of lines ofandcode .
And now the system is hard to optimize ; it would have been much easier if I 'd had a cleaner separation of game - engine infrastructure from " scripty " game code .
Even if I 'd done the whole game in Python , I 'd still have had to implement a prototype inheritance framework to enable any object to be able to serve as the prototype for any other object .
I realize I have n't really explained why prototype inheritance works so well , except for my brief mention of mock objects for unit testing .
But to keep this article tractable , I had to delete several pages of detailed examples , such as " Chieftain Monsters " that could be programmatically constructed by adding a few new properties to any existing monsterWhen I told you this pattern was big enough for a book , I meant a big book .
Without the examples handy , all I can do is say that using JavaScript / Rhino ( or Lua , once it became available on the JVM ) might have made my life easier .
Or heck , writing my own language might have been the best choice for a system that large and ambitious .
In any case , live and learn .
It 's a lot of code , but Wyvern is still a properties - based , prototype - based system , and it has amazing open - ended flexibility as a result .
We 've been through the two big examples now ( Wyvern and JavaScript ) .
I 'll close this " Who Uses It " section with just a few more key examples .
Lisp features a small - scale example of the Properties Pattern : it has property lists for symbols .
Symbols are first - class entities in Lisp .
They 're effectively the names in your current namespace , like Java 's fully - qualified class names .
If Java classes all had property lists , it would still be a small - scale instantiation of the Properties pattern , but it would open up an awful lot of new design possibilities to Java programmers .
Similarly , Lisp stops short of making everything have a property list , but to the extent it offers property lists they 're exceptionally useful design tools .
Emacs Lisp actually makes heavy use of the Properties Pattern , inasmuch as essentially every one of its thousands of configuration settings is a property in the global namespace .
It supports the notion of transient vs. persistent properties , and it offers a limited form of property inheritance via its buffer - local variables .
Unfortunately Emacs does n't support any notion of prototypes , and in fact it does n't have any object - orientation facilities at all .
Sometimes I want to model things in Emacs using objects with flexible property lists , and at such times I find myself wishing I were using JavaScript .
But even without prototypes , Emacs gains significant extensibility from its use of properties for data representation .
Keep in mind that there are , of course , big tradeoffs to make when you 're deciding how much to use the Properties pattern ; I 'll discuss them in a bit .
I 'm not criticizing any of the systems or languages here for the choices they 've made ; all of them have been improved by their use of this pattern , regardless of how far they decided to take it .
Earlier I described XML as a first - class modeling school .
Now that we have more context , it 's possible to view XML as being an instantiation of the Properties Pattern , inasmuch as it uses the pattern as part of its fundamental structure .
XML 's view of the pattern is two - dimensional : properties can take the form of either attributes or elements , each kind having different syntactic and semantic restrictions .
Many folks have criticized XML for the unnecessary complexity of this redundant pair of property subsystems , but in the end it does n't really matter much , since two ways to model properties is still better than zero ways .
So far we 've seen various policies around static checking : Eclipse ( strong / mandatory ) , JavaScript / Lua ( very little ) , and Wyvern ( moderate ) .
XML offers what I think is the ideal policy , which is that it lets you decide for yourself .
During your initial domain modeling ( the " prototyping " phase — a term now loaded with Even More Delicious Meaning ) , you can go with very weak typing , opting for nothing more than simple well - formedness checks .
And for many problems , this is as much static checking as you 'll ever need , so it 's nice that you have this option .
As some of your models become more complex , you can choose to use a DTD for extra validation .
And if you need a really heavy - duty constraint system , you can migrate up to a full - fledged XML Schema or Relax NG schema , depending on your needs .
XML has proven to be a very popular modeling tool for Java programmers in particular — more so than for the dynamic language communities .
This is because Java offers essentially zero support for the Properties Pattern .
When Java programmers need access to the pattern , the easiest approach is currently to use XML .
The Java / XML combination has proven reasonably powerful , despite the lack of syntactic integration and numerous other impedance mismatches .
Using XML is still often preferable to modeling things with Java classes .
Even Eclipse 's AST property lists might have been better modeled using XML and a DOM : it would have been less work , and the interface would have been more familiar .
And as for Apache Ant : JSON - style JavaScript objects for build files would have been exactly what they needed , but by the time they 'd realized they needed a plug - in system , the damage was done .
As Mozilla Rhino becomes better documented , and as more Java programmers begin to appreciate the usefulness of JSON as a lightweight alternative to XML , JavaScript may begin to close the gap .
Rhino provides Java with the Properties Pattern much more seamlessly than any XML solution .
I 've already mentioned that it 's superior ( even to XML ) for unit tests and representing mock test data .
But it goes deeper than unit testing .
Every sufficiently large Java program , anything beyond medium - sized , needs a scripting engine , whether the authors realize it or not .
Programs often have to grow to the size of browsers or spreadsheets or word processors before the authors finally realize they need to offer scripting facilities , but in practice , even small programs can immediately benefit from scripting .
And XML does n't fit the bill .
It 's yet another example of programmers choosing a School of Modeling because they know it , rather than learning how to use the right tool for the job .
So it goes .
Last example : Google 's Bigtable , which provides a massively scalable , high performance data store for many Google applications ( some of which are described in the paper – click the link if you 're curious . )
This particular instantiation of the Properties Pattern is a multidimensional table structure , where the keys are simple strings , and the leaf values are opaque blobs .
Hardcore relational data modelers will sometimes claim that large systems will completely degenerate in the absence of strong schema constraints , and that such systems will also fail to perform adequately .
Bigtable provides a nice counterexample to these claims .
That said , explicit schemas are useful for many domains , and I 'll talk more about how they relate to the Properties Pattern in a bit .
This would probably be a good time to mention Amazon 's Simple Storage Service , but I do n't know anything about it .
I 've heard they use name - value pairs .
In any case , I hope these examples ( Eclipse AST classes , JavaScript , Wyvern game objects , Lisp symbols , XML and HTML , and Bigtable ) have convinced you that the Properties pattern is ubiquitous , powerful , and multifaceted , and that it should be part of any programmer or designer 's lineup .
Let 's look in more depth at how it 's implemented , its trade - offs , and other aspects of this flexible design strategy .
At a high level , every implementation of the Properties Pattern has the same core API .
It 's the core API for any collection that maps names to values :
There are typically also ways to iterate over the properties , optionally with a filter of some sort .
So the simplest implementation of the Properties Pattern is a Map of some sort .
The objects in your system are Maps , and their elements are Properties .
The next step in expressive power is to reserve a special property name to represent the ( optional ) parent link .
You can call it " parent " , or " class " , or " prototype " , or " mommy " , or anything you like .
If present , it points to another Map .
Now that you have a parent link , you can enhance the semantics ofandto follow the parent pointer if the specified property is n't in the object 's list .
This is largely straightforward , with a few catches that we 'll discuss below .
But you should be able to envision how you 'd do it without too much thought .
At this point you have a full - fledged Prototype Pattern implementation .
All it took was a parent link !
From here the pattern can expand in many directions , and we 'll cover a few of the interesting ones in the remainder of this article .
There are two main low - level implementation considerations : how to represent property keys , and what data structure to use for storing the key / value pairs .
The Properties pattern almost always uses String keys .
It 's possible to use arbitrary objects , but the pattern becomes more useful with string keys because it trivially enables prototype inheritance .
( It 's tricky to " inherit " a property whose key is some opaque blob - we usually think of inheritance as including a set of named fields from the parent . )
JavaScript permits you to use arbitrary objects as keys , but what 's really happening under the covers is that they 're being cast to strings , and they lose their unique identity .
This means JavaScriptproperty lists cannot be used as be a general - purpose hashtable with arbitrary unique objects for keys .
Some systems permit both strings and numbers as keys .
If your keys are positive integers , then your Map starts looking an awful lot like an Array .
If you think about it , Arrays and Maps share the same underlying formalism ( a surjection , not to put too fine a point on it ) , and in some languages , notably PHP , there is n't a user - visible difference between them .
JavaScript permits numeric keys , and allows you to specify them as either strings or numbers .
If your object is of type Array , you can access the numeric keys via array - indexing syntax .
JavaScript syntax is especially nice ( compared to Ruby and Python ) because it allows you to use unquoted keys .
For instance , you can sayand the symbols name , age and favorite_days are NOT treated as identifiers and resolved via the symbol table .
They 're treated exactly as if you 'd written :
You also have to decide whether to require quoting values .
It can go either way .
For instance , XML requires attribute values to be quoted , but HTML does not ( assuming the value has no whitespace in it ) .
You will need to decide how to represent " property not present " .
In the simplest case , if the key is n't in the list , the property is not there ( but see Inheritance further on ) .
If a property is frequently removed and re-added , it may make sense to leave the key in the list with a null value .
In some systems , you may needto be a valid property value , in which case you 'd need to use some other distinguished ( and reserved ) value for this micro-optimization to work .
The simplest property - list implementation is a linked list .
You can either have the alternating elements be the keys and values ( Lisp does this ) , or you can have each element be a struct containing pointers to the key and value .
The linked list implementation is appropriate when : Logically a property list is an unordered set , not a sequential list , but when the set size is small enough a linked list can yield the best performance .
The performance of a linked list is O ( N ) , so for long property lists the performance can deteriorate rapidly .
The next most common implementation choice is a hashtable , which yields amortized constant - time find / insert / remove for a given list , albeit at the cost of more memory overhead and a higher fixed per-access cost ( the cost of the hash function . )
In most systems , a hashtable imposes too much overhead when objects are expected to have only a handful of properties , up to perhaps two or three dozen .
A common solution is to use a hybrid model , in which the property list begins life as a simple array or linked list , and when it crosses some predefined threshold ( perhaps 40 to 50 items ) , the properties are moved into a hashtable .
Note that we 'll often refer to property sets as " property lists " ( or " plists " for short ) , because they 're so often implemented as lists .
But it 's fairly unusual for the order to matter .
In the rare cases when it matters , there are usually two possibilities : the names need to be kept in insertion order , or they need to be sorted .
If you need constant - time access and want to maintain the insertion order , you can't do better than a LinkedHashMap , a truly wonderful data structure .
The only way it could possibly be more wonderful is if there were a concurrent version .
But alas .
If you need to impose a sort order on property names , you 'll want to use an ordered - map implementation , typically an ordered binary tree such as a splay tree or red / black tree .
A splay tree can be a good choice because of the low fixed overhead for insertion , lookup and deletion , but with the tradeoff that its theoretical worst - case performance is that of a linked list .
A splay tree can be especially useful when properties are not always accessed uniformly : if a small subset M of an object 's N properties are accessed most often , the amortized performance becomes O ( log M ) , making it a bit like an LRU cache .
Note that you can get a poor - man 's splay tree ( at least , the LRU trick of bubbling recent entries to the front of the list ) using a linked list by simply moving any queried element to the front of the list , a constant - time operation .
It 's surprising that more implementations do n't take this simple step : an essentially free speedup over the lifetime of most property lists .
With prototype inheritance , each property list can have a parent list .
When you look for a property on an object , first you check the object 's " local " property list , and then you look in its parent list , on up the chain .
As I described in the Overview , the simplest approach for implementing inheritance is to set aside a name for the property pointing to the parent property list : " prototype " , " parent " , " class " and " archetype " are all common choices .
It 's unusual ( but possible ) to have a multiple - inheritance strategy in the Properties pattern .
In this case the parent link is a list rather than a single value , and it's up to you to decide the rules for traversing the parent chains during lookups .
The algorithm for inherited property lookup is simple : look in my list , and if the property is n't there , look in my parent 's list .
If I have no parent , return .
This can be accomplished recursively with less code , and but it 's usually wiser to do it iteratively , unless your language supports tail - recursion elimination .
Property lookups can be the most expensive bottleneck in a Properties Pattern system , so thinking about their performance is ( for once ) almost never premature .
If you delete a property from an object , you usually want subsequent checks for the property to return " not found " .
In non-inheritance versions of the pattern , to delete a property you simply remove its key and value from the data structure .
In the presence of inheritance the problem gets trickier , because a missing key does not mean " not found " – it means " look in my parent to see if I 've inherited this property .
" To make the problem clearer , assume you have a prototype list called Cat with a property named " friendly - to - dogs " , whose value defaults to the boolean .
Let 's say you have a specific cat instance named Morris , whose prototype is Cat : Let 's say Morris has a nasty run-in with a dog , and now he hates all dogs , so we want to make a runtime update to his friendly - to - dogs property .
Our first idea might be to delete the property , since a missing key or null value are often interpreted asin a boolean context .
( This is true even in class - based languages like C++ or Java , in which afunction will returnif the internalfield is non -. )
However , Morris does not have a copy of " friendly - to - dogs " in his local list : he inherits it from Cat .
So if yourmethod does nothing but delete the property from the local list , he will continue to inherit " friendly - to - dogs " , which will irk him ( and you ) endlessly until you figure out where the bug is .
You ca n't delete " friendly - to - dogs " from the Cat property list , or all of your cats will suddenly become dog-haters , and you 'll have outright war on your hands .
( Note that in some settings this is exactly what you want to do , illustrating the inherent universal trade - off between flexibility and safety . )
The solution for Morris is to have a special " NOT_PRESENT " property value thatsets when you delete a property that would otherwise be inherited .
This object should be a flyweight value so that you can check it with a pointer comparison .
So to account for deletion of inherited properties , we have to modify our property - lookup algorithm to look in the local list for ( a ) a missing key , ( b ) a null value , or ( c ) the NOT_PRESENT tag .
If any of these apply , the property is considered not present on the object .
[ Note : the semantics of null values are up to the system designer .
You do n't have to makevalues mean " not there . "
Either way is fine .
]
One logical consequence of prototype inheritance as we 've defined it is that reads and writes work differently .
In particular , if you read an inherited property , it gets the value from an ancestor in the prototype chain .
But if you write an inherited property , it sets the value in the object 's local list , not in the ancestor .
To illustrate , let 's add a " night - vision " property to our Cat prototype .
Its value is expected to be an integer representing how well the cat can see in the dark .
Let 's say that the default value is 5 , but our hero Morris has been eating his carrots , so we want to set his " night - vision " property value to 7 .
Thecode does not need to check the parent chain : it simply adds the key / value pair { " night - vision " , 7} to Morris 's local property list .
If we set the property on Cat , then all cats would have Morris 's super - vision , which is n't what we want .
This asymmetry is normal .
Back in our L.T. / Emmitt Smith example , when we were adding properties to L.T. , we did n't want to modify Emmitt !
It 's just how the pattern works : you override inherited values by adding local properties , even when the override is a deletion .
Many implementations of the pattern offer " frozen " property lists .
Sometimes ( e.g. for debugging ) it 's useful to flag an entire property list as read - only .
Ruby supports this via the " freeze " method on the built - in rootclass .
In any sufficiently large , robust implementation of the Properties pattern , you should include the option to freeze your property lists .
If you offer a " freeze " function , you should think about whether you want to offer a " thaw " as well .
The decision depends on whether you want to offer programmers additional protection , or you just want to lock them up and throw away the key .
My personal view is that Java programmers tend to overuse the " freeze " function when they start with Ruby .
For that matter , they tend to overuse " final " in Java .
I mentioned before the trade - off between flexibility and safety .
When you use the Properties Pattern , you 're consciously choosing flexibility over safety , and in many domains this is the right choice .
In fact , safety can be viewed as a kind of optimization : something that should ideally be layered on , functioning behind the scenes rather than being interleaved with the user APIs and flexible data model .
A nice ( and simple to implement ) compromise on safety and flexibility is to offer aproperty attribute , as JavaScript does .
There are certain properties ( such as the parent pointer ) that are less likely to need to change as the system evolves , so it 's probably OK to lock them down early on .
Doing this on a property - by - property basis is much less draconian .
Even better , you should consider making theproperty attribute non-inheritable , so that subtypes can choose their own policies without compromising the integrity of the supertypes .
We 're more or less done with inheritance : it 's not very complicated .
There are a few other inheritance - related design issues that I 'll cover in upcoming sections .
Performance is one of the biggest trade - offs of using the Properties Pattern .
Many engineers are so concerned with performance ( and its attendant paradoxes and fallacies ) that they refuse to consider using the Properties pattern , regardless of the situation .
As it happens , the pattern 's performance can be improved and mitigated in several clever ways .
I wo n't cover all of them here , but I 'll touch on some of the classics and one or two new approaches .
Make sure your string keys are interned .
Most languages provide some facility for interning strings , since it 's such a huge performance win .
Interning means replacing strings with a canonical copy of the string : a single , immutable shared instance .
Then the lookup algorithm can use pointer equality rather than string contents comparison to check keys , so the fixed overhead is much lower .
The only downside of interning is that it does n't help much when you 're constructing a property name on the fly , since you still need to hash the string to intern it .
That 's not much of a downside , so as a rule , you should always intern your keys .
A large percentage of property names in any system are accessed as string literals from the source code ( or are read from a configuration file and can be interned all at once when the file is read ) , and interning works in these common cases . : do n't use case - insensitive keys .
It 's performance suicide .
Case - insensitive string comparison is really slow , especially in a Unicode environment .
If you know all the properties in a given plist at compile - time ( or at runtime early on in the life of the process ) , then you might consider using a " perfect hash function generator " to create an ideal hash function just for that list .
It 's almost certainly more work than it 's worth unless your profiler shows that the list is eating a significant percentage of your cycles .
But such generators ( e.g. gperf ) do exist , and are tailor - made for this situation .
Perfect hashing does n't conflict with the extensible - system nature of the Properties pattern .
You may have a particular set of prototype objects ( such as your built - in monsters , weapons , armor and so on ) that are well - defined and that do not typically change during the course of a system session .
Using a perfect hash function generator on them can speed up lookups , and then if any of them is modified at runtime , you just fall back to your normal hashing scheme for that property list .
If you have lots of memory , and your leaf objects are inheriting from prototype objects that are unlikely to change at runtime , you might try copy - on - read caching .
In its simplest form , whenever you read a property from the parent prototype chain , you copy its value down to the object 's local list .
The main downside to this approach is that if the prototype object from which you copied the property ever changes , your leaf objects will have the now - incorrect old value for the property .
Let 's call copy - on - read caching " plundering " for this discussion , for brevity .
If Morris caches his prototype Cat 's copy of the " favorite - food " property ( value : " 9 Lives " ) , then Morris is the " plunderer " and Cat is the plundered object .
The most common workaround to the stale - cache problem is to keep a separate data structure mapping plundered objects to their plunderers .
It should use weak references so as not to impede garbage collection .
( If you 're writing this in C++ , then may God have mercy on your soul . )
Whenever a plundered object changes , you need to go through the plunderers and remove their cached copy of the property , assuming it has n't since then changed from the original inherited value .
That 's a lot of stuff to keep track of , so plundering is a strategy best used only in the direst of desperation .
But if performance is your key issue , and nothing else works , then plundering may help .
Another performance speedup technique is to take your N most commonly used properties and turn them into instance variables .
Note that this technique is only available in languages that differentiate between instance variables and properties , so it would work in Java but not in JavaScript .
This optimization may sound amazingly attractive , especially during your first round of performance optimizations .
Be warned : this approach is fraught with pitfalls , so ( as with nearly all performance optimizations ) you should only use it if your profiler proves that the benefits will outweigh the costs .
The first cost is API incompatibility : suddenly instead of accessing all properties uniformly through a singleinterface , you now have specific fields that have their own getters and setters , which could potentially have massive impact in your system ( since , after all , these are the most commonly - accessed properties ) .
And unless you 're using Emacs , your refactoring editor probably is n't smart enough to do rename - method constrained on argument value .
You can mitigate the API problem by continuing to go through theinterface , and have them check the argument to see if it's one of the hardwired fields .
This will result in an increasingly large switch - statement ( or equivalent ) , so you 're trading API code maintenance for API simplicity .
It also slows down the field access considerably , which offsets the performance gain from using a field .
The next cost is system complexity : you have twice as many code paths through every part of your system that deals with the Properties pattern .
Does inheritance still work the same ?
What about serialization ?
Transient properties ?
Metaprogramming ?
What about your user interface for accessing and modifying property lists ?
You face a huge code - bloat problem when you split property access into two classes : plist properties and instance variables .
The next cost is accidentally getting it wrong : how do you know what the most - accessed properties are ?
You may do some runtime profiling and see that it's one set , but over time the characteristics of your system might change in such a way that it 's an entirely different set .
Realistically you will have to instrument your system to keep track , on a regular basis , of which properties are accessed at a rate beyond your tolerance threshold , so you can convert them to fields as well .
This is n't a one - off optimization .
But all these costs pale in comparison to the big one , which is extensibility : instance variables are set in stone .
It will be a vast amount of work to try to give them parity with your plist properties : change - list notifications , the ability to override them or remove them , and so on .
It 's likely that you will wind up sacrificing at least some flexibility for these fields .
So use this optimization with extreme caution .
The last performance optimization I 'll mention is more about conserving memory than CPU .
If you 're worried about the overhead of a per- object property - list field , even if it 's usually , then you can implement property lists using a separate , external data structure .
I do n't know what it 's normally called , so I 'm calling it the Refrigerator , since you 're basically putting yellow stickies all over it .
The idea is that you do n't need to pay for the overhead of property lists when very few of the objects in your system will ever have one .
Instead of using a field in each class with a property list , you maintain a global hashtable whose keys are object instances , and whose values are property lists .
To fetch the property list of an object , you go look to see if it's on the Refrigerator .
The property list itself can follow any of the implementation schemes I discussed in Representations above .
I first heard this idea from Damien Conway in roughly 2001 at a talk he gave .
He said he was considering using it for Perl 6 , and I thought it was pretty clever .
I do n't remember what he called it , and I do n't know if he wound up using it , but consider this idea to be his gift to you .
Thanks , Damien !
Brendan
Eich came up with astoundingly clever performance optimization for the Properties Pattern , which he told me about back in January .
I was ready to publish this article , but I told him I 'd hold off until he blogged about his optimization .
Every once in a while he'd ping me and tell me " any day now .
" Brendan , it 's October , dammit !
Needless to say , I 've only scratched the surface on performance optimization of the Properties pattern .
You can get arbitrarily fancy .
The point I 'm trying to get across is that you should n't despair when you discover your system is unacceptably slow after designing it to use the Properties pattern .
If this happens , do n't panic and throw out your flexibility – go optimize !
The game of optimization can be fun and rewarding in its own right .
Just do n't do it before you need it !
While implementing Wyvern , I discovered that making changes to a persistent property list is a wonderful recipe for creating catastrophes .
Let 's say some player casts a Resist Magic spell , which boosts her " resist - magic " integer property value by , oh , 30 ( thirty percent ) .
Then , while the spell is active , the auto - saver kicks in ( writing her enhanced " resist - magic " property value out to the data store along with the rest of her properties ) , and then the game crashes .
Voilà – the player now has permanent 30 % magic resistance !
It does n't have to be a game crash , either .
Any random bug or exception condition ( a database hiccup , a network glitch , cosmic rays ) can induce permanence in what was intended to be a transient change to the plist .
And when you 're writing a game designed to be modified at runtime by dozens of programmers simultaneously , you learn quickly to expect random bugs and exception conditions .
The solution I came up with was transient properties .
Each object has ( logically speaking ) two property lists : one for persistent properties and one for transients .
The only difference is that transient properties are n't written out when serializing / saving the player ( or monster , or what - have - you . )
Wyvern 's property - list system has typed values .
I have n't talked about Properties Pattern type systems yet , but in a nutshell my property values can be ints , longs , doubles , strings , booleans , archetypes ( which is basically any other game object ) , or " bean " ( JavaBean ) properties .
My early experimentation yielded the interesting rule that non-numeric transient properties override the persistent value , but numeric properties combine with ( add to ) the persistent value .
A simple example should suffice .
If you have a persistent boolean property " hates - trolls " ( and who does n't , really ? ) , and you accidentally ingest a Potion of Troll Love , then the potion should set a transient value of { " hates - trolls " , } on your character .
It overrides the persistent value .
There 's no combining going on ; it just replaces the original .
However , for our " resist - magic " int property , if you put on a ring of 30 % magic resistance , it should ( by default ) add to your current value , which may be a combination of innate resistance and resistances conferred from other magic items and spells .
This numbers - are - additive principle applied pretty uniformly across my entire code base and property corpus , so it 's built into the lookup rules for Wyvern 's property lists .
must get both the transient and persistent ( possibly inherited ) values for " foo " and add them before returning the result .
I experimented with different approaches for representing transient properties .
Originally I used a kind of hungarian - notation , prefixing transient property names with an @ -character ( " @foo " ) and keeping them in the same hashtable as the persistent properties .
One advantage of " @ " was that it was invalid character in XML attribute names , so it was originally impossible for me to accidentally serialize a transient property .
Eventually I migrated to keeping them in separate ( lazily created ) tables .
This made it easier to deal with interning names ( not having to prepend " @ " all the time ) and generally made bookkeeping easier .
I do n't remember all the trade - offs involved with the decision anymore ( it was about 7 years ago ) , so you 'll have to retread that road yourself if you decide to offer transient properties in your system .
Transient properties introduce their own version of deletion problem .
You can't just remove the property from the transient list , since the lookup algorithm will just look for it in the persistent list .
And you do n't want to remove it from the persistent list ; that defeats the purpose of using transients .
The solution is similar to what I did for deleting inherited properties : you insert a placeholder into the transient list saying " NOT_PRESENT " , and as long as that placeholder is in the list , it 's as if the object does n't have the property .
Note that this implies the existence of two similar API calls : for deleting a transient property from the transient list , andfor temporarily hiding a property from the persistent list .
Persisting property lists is a huge topic ; I 'll just touch on the basics .
For starters , XML and JSON ( and for that matter , s- expressions ) are all perfectly valid choices for serialization format .
You can probably imagine how this works , so I wo n't beat it to death .
Text - based formats have big wins in readability , maintainability , and bootstrapping ( you do n't need to create special tools to read and write them ) .
For performance – both for network overhead and disk storage – you might want to consider designing a compressed binary format .
One easy way to test whether this will be a win for you is to take the intermediate approach of gzipping your data to see how well it compresses , and whether it produces a discernable blip in performance .
Wyvern initially used a filesystem trie - like structure for storing its data , but as the number of distinct objects grew to several hundred thousand , I had to switch to a database .
You can use an RDBMS , but you 're in for a world of hurt if you try to map the Properties pattern onto a relational schema .
It 's a tricky problem , and probably is n't one that you want to solve yourself .
I wound up using an RDBMS and just shoving the XML - serialized property list into a text / clob column , and denormalizing the twenty or thirty fields I needed for queries into their own columns .
This gets me by , but is n't a happy solution .
What you really want is a hierarchical data store optimized for loose tree structures : in a word , an XML database .
At the time I was designing Wyvern 's persistence strategy ( 1998 - ish ) , XML databases were pure vaporware , and even after a few years they were still fairly exploratory and unstable .
Today things are different , and there are many interesting options for XML databases , ranging from 100 % free ( e.g. Berkeley DBs ) through 100 % expensive ( e.g. Oracle XML ) .
You might also look into Object databases , but I 've never heard of anyone coming through that experience with anything but battle scars to show for it .
Querying goes hand - in - hand with persistence : once you have a bunch of objects in a data store , you 'll want to ask questions about them .
Producing a High Score List is a good example : you want to compute a function of some set of properties across all the players in your database .
If you 're just using the filesystem , you 're stuck with grep or its moral equivalent on Windows , which is likely to be painfully slow .
So do n't do that .
If you 're using an RDBMS , and you 've serialized your property lists into a single row - per - object clob or text column , then you can use ( My ) SQL 's LIKE and RLIKE operators , or their equivalents , to do free - text searches .
However , your property lists are likely to be hierarchical ( e.g. player inventory is a bag , which has its own properties and collection of objects it 's holding ) , and free - text search does n't understand hierarchy .
So this approach is really just a faster version of grep .
Querying is the biggest reason for using an XML database , since it gives you XPath and XQuery as expressive languages that work on XML data about as well ( give or take ) as SQL works on relational data .
Because you have the advantage of working in " these days " ( 2008 + ) as opposed to " those days " ( 1998 ) , you now have the interesting option of using JavaScript / JSON and JQuery .
I do n't know much about it , but what little I do know seems promising .
One final approach , which may not scale very well unless you can find a way to parallelize it , is to simply load all the objects into an instance of your server , and use programmatic access to walk the objects and construct your query results manually .
Although it requires some infrastructure to make it work ( and to make it not crash your system , once you have enough objects ) , it has the major benefit of giving you a full programming language , which can be useful if you 're doing a complex query and your XPath / XQuery skills are n't up to par .
Data integrity , a.k.a.
Safety , is one of the two biggest trade - offs ( the other being performance ) you make when you choose to use the Properties pattern .
In the absence of a schema , your system is open to property - list corruption through bugs and user error ( e.g. typos ) .
Interestingly , in big companies I 've worked at that have strong schema constraints , they still always seem to run into data - integrity problems , so it 's not clear how much the schema is really helping here .
A schema can certainly help with navigability and performance , but no schema can completely avert data corruption problems .
As soon as you notice you 've got bad data , you need to do what many people in the industry term a " backfill " : you have to run through all the existing data and fix the problem .
Sometimes this is as simple as running a SQL update on a single column .
And sometimes it involves writing a complex program that painstakingly computes the inverse of whatever bogus operation created the bad data in the first place .
And sometimes backfills require just winging it , since the lost data may be irrecoverable and you need to use heuristics to minimize the damage .
No matter how you store your data and how careful you are about replicating it and backing it up , this kind of thing can happen at pretty much any scale .
The Properties pattern does n't really introduce anything new to the backfill landscape ; all the usual options apply .
You 'll just need to be mindful that user error ( especially mis-typed property names ) can make backfills a bit more commonplace , so you should plan to spend a fair amount of time developing a convenient backfill infrastructure for your system .
I should mention , embarrassing as it is , one other option , which I call " lazy backfill " , and I 've used it extensively .
Sometimes I 'll notice a data - corruption issue that needs fixing but does n't really justify a day of my time to fix all at once .
So I have a small subsystem in place for player logins and map loads : I iterate through the property lists looking for properties that I 've flagged ( hardwired in the code ) as " bad data " , and I call helper backfill functions on the fly to fix just that property list .
This is obviously a hack , and it also imposes some minor performance overhead ( probably not detectable via profiling ) on logins and map loads , but I 'll be honest : it 's served me well , and I 've fixed at least 20 % of my data - corruption problems this way .
I 've already touched on this a little here and there .
Eclipse 's AST property lists use an interesting type system that provides a reasonable amount of metadata for each property , although ( I think ) it stops short of allowing properties to have their own property lists .
JavaScript properties have a small , fixed amount of metadata .
Each property has a set of flags .
The flags include ( ca n't modify the value ) , ( can modify the value but can't delete the key ) , ( key does n't show up in iterators but can be read directly ) , and others depending on the implementation .
Wyvern has its own Java - like flavor of typed properties , largely because I implemented the system in Java long before the advent of auto - boxing , and I needed a convenient way of dealing with primitive types vs. object types .
If I were to do it all over again , I probably would n't go that route .
I would want some sort of scheme for metaproperties ( aka " property attributes " ) — perhaps in a separate per-object metaproperty - list .
But I 'd simplify the interface and get rid of all the primitive - typed versions of all my has / get / set inherited / persistent / transient property calls .
I wo n't go into any further detail about type systems , except to say that ( a ) you can use them to any degree you desire ; there 's nothing intrinsic to the Properties Pattern that precludes them , and ( b ) Duck Typing becomes fairly crucial to systems that are designed fully around the Properties Pattern , so if your language has any structural - typing support it 'll help .
Wyvern has a Map Editor that allows you to create and edit objects .
Since all the game objects are property lists that use the prototype inheritance pattern , the conventional JavaBean approach does n't work , since the JavaBeans API ( which is more or less designed for this problem , except with instance fields ) uses Java reflection , and my properties do n't have individual getters and setters .
Wyvern wound up with something very similar to a JavaBeans property editor , except it knows how to read , write and display my GameObject property lists .
It was n't a huge amount of work , but it 's something you should keep in mind as you decide whether to use the Properties pattern in your system .
If you need a GUI for object edits , you 'll probably need to do some custom UI work .
I 've talked about the main problems imposed by the Properties pattern : performance , data integrity , and navigability / queryability .
They 're all trade - offs ; you 're sacrificing in these areas in order to achieve big wins in flexibility and open - ended future extensibility for users you may never meet .
( You also get huge wins in unit - testability and prototyping speed , but I assume these benefits are obvious enough that I do n't need to dwell on them . )
One other problem is reversability : it 's hard to back out of the Properties pattern once you commit to it .
Once people start adding properties , especially if they 're using programmatic construction of key names , you 'll have trouble on your hands if you want to try to refactor the whole system to use instance fields and getters / setters .
So before you use this pattern , you should put your system through a prototyping phase ( ironically enough ) to determine whether it will work out as it scales .
I was n't able to find much , but here are some interesting articles and papers on the subject .
Dealing with Properties [ Fowler 1997 ]
Prototype - based programming ( Wikipedia ) Do-it - yourself Reflection [ Peter Sommerlad , Marcel Rüedi ] ( PDF ) Prototype pattern ( Wikipedia ) Self programming language ( Wikipedia ) Refactoring to Adaptive Object Modeling : Property Pattern [ Christopher G. Lasater ]
Oct 20th 2008 : The comments on the article are outstanding .
People have pointed out lots of further reading , as well as well - known systems ( Atom , RDF ) that make extensive use of the pattern at their core .
Thanks , folks !
This is great stuff .
Oct 20th 2008 : Martin Fowler sent me a link to a 1997 paper he wrote on the topic .
It 's in the Further Reading section .
Well worth a read .
He mentions a few important considerations that I left out :
Overall , Martin 's take on the pattern is " avoid it when possible " , which is sound ( if conservative ) advice .
My take is that everyone 's doing it anyway , so we should formalize it .
I 've used it as the central data model for my 500,000 - line multiplayer game for 10 years , and I assert that the benefits vastly outweigh the problems .
I also witnessed the pattern's use in Amazon 's Customer Service Tools database for some 5 years , and again , the benefits vastly outweighed the downsides .
You just have to know what you 're getting into before you dive in , which is sort of the point of my article .
Oct 20th 2008 : Fellow Googler Joe Beda mentioned that IE4 originally supported arbitrary attributes on HTML elements , which dramatically extended the flexibility for web developers .
Today , no browsers support it , though John Resig claims HTML 5 will fix this .
In the meantime , developers use fake css classes and hidden elements ; it 's a mess .
I actually deleted a pretty large rant about this problem from the article .
But yeah .
It 's a problem .
When you do n't provide the Properties Pattern to people , they find horrible workarounds , which is much worse than anything that can go wrong if you simply support it directly .
( Joe mentioned that it posed serious technical problems with the cache , though , so I would n't assume it 's trivial to add the support back in to browsers today . ) I have n't covered the whole landscape for this pattern .
There are concurrency issues , access - control issues ( e.g. in Wyvern , some properties , such as email address , can only be read by very high - level Wizards ) , documentation issues , and a host of other considerations .
Let me summarize what I think are the key takeaways .
First : this is a critically important pattern .
I call it the " Universal " design pattern because it is ( by far ) the best known solution to the problem of designing open - ended systems , which in turn translates to long - lived systems .
You might not think you 're building that kind of system .
But if you want your system to grow , and have lots of users , and spread like wildfire , then you are building exactly that kind of system .
You just have n't realized it yet .
Second : even though people rarely talk much about this pattern , it 's astoundingly widespread .
It appears in strongly - typed systems like Eclipse , in programming and data - declarative languages , in end - user applications , in operating systems , and even in strongly typed network protocols , although I did n't talk about that use case today .
( Nutshell : a team I know using CORBA got fed up and added an XML parameter to every CORBA API call , defeating the type system but permitting them to upgrade their interface without horking every existing client .
Bravo ! ) Third : it can perform well !
Or at least , " well enough " .
The playing field for potential optimizations is nearly unbounded , and with enough effort you can reduce just about everything to constant time .
Finally , it 's surprisingly versatile .
You can use it on a very small scale to augment one teeny component of an existing system , or you can go the whole hog and use it for everything , or just about anything in between .
You can start small and grow into it as you become more comfortable with the pattern .
The Properties Pattern is not " just " name / value pairs , although the name / value pair certainly lives at the heart of the pattern .
If you believe Hofstadter , the Properties Pattern ( using the Prototype Principle ) is an approach to modeling that complements class - based modeling : both are fundamental to the way our brains process symbolic information .
I suspect that if you 've read this far , you 'll start seeing the Properties Pattern everywhere you look .
It 's embedded in many other popular patterns and systems , from Dependency Injection to LDAP to DNS .
As legacy systems struggle to evolve to be more user configurable and programmable , you 'll see more and more of your favorite software systems ( and , I hope , languages ) incorporating this pattern to varying extents .
Again : I was n't able to find much literature about this pattern .
If you happen to know of books , papers or articles that expound on it in more detail , please link to them in the comments !
I hope you found this interesting and potentially useful .
It was definitely more work than my typical posts , so if it does n't go over well , I 'm happy to go back to the comedy routine .
We 'll see .
preinstalled tend to be a lot happier than those who upgraded from XP , especially those who failed to run the upgrade advisor .
The same is true of .
Even after following all advice from the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor , I still had to jump through hoops to re-enable my connection to PCMag 's Virtual Private Network after upgrading from Vista .
Even the biggest Vista fans , the ones who 've never experienced any upgrade tribulations , have to admit that User Account Control ( UAC ) can be a pain in the neck .
Fortunately Microsoft made some significant improvements in it for Windows 7 .
Why User Account Control ?
Vista was designed to be significantly more secure than XP , and UAC is a cornerstone of its security scheme .
The point of UAC is to make sure no system - level changes occur without an Administrator 's permission .
Even if you normally use an Administrator account , all of your day - to - day activity happens at the low - privilege Standard level .
Before a nasty virus ( or a useful application ) can do something potentially dangerous like writing to the Windows folder , it has to get permission .
UAC pop-ups in Vista are especially shocking because of what 's called " secure desktop mode . "
The screen blanks out briefly , then everything except the UAC pop - up goes dim .
Anything else you were doing is out of reach until you respond to the pop-up .
This prevents sneaky programs from meddling with the UAC dialog , but it can be an unpleasant shock .
Less frightening but equally annoying is the " I just told you ! " scenario .
You launch a program and UAC immediately asks if you want to run this program .
D'oh !
Of course you do !
Users can really get steamed about this , even Administrator users who merely have to click Yes .
Imagine the frustration of a Standard user who must type an Administrator password or ( more likely ) go track down a supervisor to enter the password .
One time in a thousand this precaution might prevent a malicious program from launching , assuming ( and it 's a big assumption ) that the user was alert enough to choose No .
The other 999 times it 's just a pain .
In the Engineering Windows 7 blog , Microsoft 's engineers trot out the notion that requiring a UAC confirmation for every sensitive action is good , because it " forces malware or poorly written software to show itself and get your approval before it can potentially harm the system . "
That same rationale gave us old - style ( and now obsolete ) personal firewalls that deluged us with incomprehensible pop-up queriesugh !
In fact , Microsoft 's designers admit that UAC can't really keep out malware , because users do n't know enough to correctly respond to its prompts .
Most users just click
Yes and allow the program to do what it was going to anyhow .
Microsoft 's own figures show that users click Yes about 90 percent of the time .
That 's usually the correct answer , but Joe User can't distinguish a scary UAC prompt about a perfectly valid program from a scary UAC prompt about a malware attack . 
Big Ideas
In the Windows 9 blog , Microsoft Engineers congratulate themselves on the fact that UAC has made program developers leery of techniques that unnecessarily require Administrator privilege .
( Thanks , guys , but could n't you have found a way to whip developers into line without torturing users ? )
Eventually , though , they fess up to UAC 's problems .
For example , their research shows that Windows itself accounts for about 40 percent of all UAC prompts .
No , really !
A Windows component tries to do something important and UAC stops it until you give the okay .
They say we " can expect fewer prompts from Windows components " in Windows 7 .
Their goals for improvement with Windows 7 were to :
Reduce unnecessary and redundant UAC queries
Make customers confident that they 're in control
Make UAC prompts more informative
Offer better and more obvious control over UAC
The beta showed some progress toward these goals and the Release Candidate even more .
UAC in the final Windows 7 is significantly less irksome that of Vista .
Clearer Choices
Where a Vista UAC prompt announces " Windows needs your permission to continue , " Windows 7 may ask , " Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer ? " or " You 'll need to provide administrator permission to rename this folder . "
Microsoft says focus groups showed these modified messages are easier to understand .
Vista users had the option to shut down UAC ; Windows 7 offers alternatives short of total shutdown .
By tweaking a simple slider , users can select from four different notification levels .
From the most to the least restrictive , they are :
Level 4 .
Always notify me when programs try to install software or make changes to my computer and when I make changes to Windows settings .
Level 3 .
Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer .
Do n't notify me when I make changes to Windows settings .
Level 2 .
Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer ( do not dim my desktop ) .
Do n't notify me when I make changes to Windows settings .
Level 1 .
Never notify me when programs try to install software or make changes to my computer or when I make changes to Windows settings .
Level 3 is the default .
At this level , program - initiated system changes trigger UAC prompts , but configuration changes made by the user do not .
Crank it up to level 4 , and even user - initiated changes can trigger UAC , as in Vista .
Level 2 is the same as level 3 , except that it does n't dim the desktop .
That makes it less shocking , but without the benefit of the secure desktop there 's a faint possibility that malware could finagle its way into the process and interfere with UAC .
I used to think that level 1 meant UAC is off , but the Help clarifies that it only turns off the pop-ups .
For Administrator users , all programs good and badcan make system changes without hindrance .
For Standard users , any action that would have triggered a UAC pop - up will just fail silently .
Ouch !
A Microsoft user study revealed that users who got more than one UAC prompt during a Windows session were a lot more likely to report the prompts as irritating .
( I could have told them that . )
They also found no measurable difference in malware defense between levels 3 and 4 .
That 's why they chose the less - strict level 3 as the default , and that 's why you should leave it set to the default . 
Resisting Key Stuffing
Earlier this year , security experts reported that the UAC settings dialog in Windows 7 beta was vulnerable to attack .
If the UAC level was set to anything but the maximum , a user - mode program could turn it entirely off by " key stuffing " sending simulated keystrokes to the UAC control dialog .
Security Watch blogger Larry Seltzer points out that this attack only works if you 're running in Administrator mode .
UAC is supposed to encourage everyone to run as a Standard user .
Seltzer goes on to note that the same sort of attack could do a lot more damage if applied to other Control Panel applets .
Microsoft did n't ignore the problem , but fixed it by forcing the UAC dialog to run as a high - integrity process which , they say , " prevents all the mechanics around SendKeys and the like from working . "
It seems to be true ; the UAC settings dialog completely ignored a small program I wrote to send fake keystrokes and mouse clicks .
I 'd still be happier if any attempt to lower the protection level would always trigger a UAC pop-up with the desktop dimmed that would be hard to break .
My UAC Wish List
UAC in Windows 7 is improved , but still somewhat annoying .
I do n't think it should ever ask whether to allow elevated privileges for a known , valid program , and certainly never for a Windows component .
Many security vendors use whitelist databases identifying millions of known good programs ; surely Microsoft has the resources to do the same .
If it 's not a known program , UAC could examine all of its behaviors , not just the fact that it needs elevated privilege , and make a considered decision to allow or block it .
Do n't foist that responsibility off on the user !
Now that would be a classy version of UAC .
The much - maligned Windows Firewall is also showing some new tricks ; I 'll look at those next .
100,000 - euro birthday bash for pope 's brother : report Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday October 26 , 2008
Print This Email This BERLIN ( AFP ) 
A diocese in southern Germany plans to spend 100,000 euros ( 130,000 dollars ) on a birthday bash at the Vatican for the Pope Benedict XVI 's elder brother , a magazine report said Sunday .
Georg Ratzinger , who is himself a priest , turns 85 on January 15 and wants Mozart 's Mass in C - Minor performed for him in the world - famous Sistine Chapel , German weekly Focus reported .
The diocese of Regensburg in Bavaria is flying in a 90 - person choir plus 37 musicians from an orchestra in Linz , Austria for the performance , the magazine said .
The bill is causing some irritation in Regensburg where the diocese 's main sources of income are church tax and rent on properties that it owns , the magazine said .
DUNEDIN , Fla. , Nov. 25 ( UPI ) --
A cat named Charley is credited with saving his owner from a fast - moving fire in their home in Dunedin , Fla .
John Griffin said the cat climbed on his face and clawed at him until he got out of bed and ran from the burning house , the St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times reported Tuesday .

" He 's a good cat , " said Griffin , 52 , who escaped the burning one - story wood - frame home along with Charley and a family dog , none of whom were injured .
Flames were shooting 45 feet high and blistering the sides of the homes on either side of Griffin 's house when firefighters arrived , the Times reported .
" The entire sky in this area of Dunedin was lit up .
It was pretty spectacular , " said Dunedin Fire Chief Bill McElligott .
Fire investigators said the blaze , which apparently started in a shed , appears suspicious , but has not been ruled arson .
As early voting in the US presidential
elections gets underway , ES&S iVotronics touch - screen electronic
voting machines have been observed in four separate states
flipping the votes - mostly from Barack Obama to John McCain but
sometimes to third party candidates too .
This has already occurred
during early voting in the states of West Virginia , Tennessee , Missouri
and Texas .
A county clerk in West Virginia invited a video crew to watch his
demonstration of the reliability of the disputed voting machines but
instead he saw the machine flipping the votes , as critics claimed .
He
put this down to the faulty calibration of the voting machine .
However ,
even after he recalibrated the machine it continued to flip votes .
Watch the video here :
This
is further evidence that the electronic voting machines that will be
used in the 4 November election are not reliable and accurate - that
they are prone to malfunction and may not record the actual vote
winner .
Democrats are not the only people who are worried .
Stephen
Spoonamore , a Republican security expert , explains why electronic
voting is inherently unsafe in an eight part series of interviews .
You
can watch Part 1 , and access Parts 2 to 7 , here .
Writing in the New Statesman way back in 2004 , reflecting
on criticisms of the electronic voting systems used in the presidential
election that year , Michael Meacher MP pointed out that statisticians ,
academics and political analysts had highlighted significant voting differences
between electoral districts that used paper ballots and those that used
electronic systems .
These can not be explained by random variation .
The
investigators found a much larger variance than expected and in every
case it favoured George W Bush over John Kerry .
In Wisconsin and Ohio ,
the discrepancy favoured Bush by 4 per cent , in Pennsylvania by 5 per
cent , in Florida and Minnesota by 7 per cent , in North Carolina by 9
per cent and in New Hampshire by a whopping 15 per cent .
Research by the University of Berkeley , California , revealed
election irregularities in 2004 in Florida .
These irregularities , all
of which were associated with electronic voting machines , appear to
have awarded between 130,000 to 260,000 additional votes to Bush .
The discrepancies between paper and electronic voting could be the
result of simple technological glitches .
But some experts detect
something more sinister : outright vote fixing by interference with
voting machine and tabulation software .
Meacher
reported that Diebold company voting machines and optical scanners may
not be tamper - proof from hacking , particularly via remote modems .
Diebold machines were used in counting a substantial proportion of the
2004 votes and will be used again in next week 's presidential poll .
Two US computer security experts , in their book Black Box Voting ,
state that " by entering a two - digit code in a hidden location , a second
set of votes is created ; and this set of votes can be changed in a
matter of seconds , so that it no longer matches the correct votes " .
This is entirely possible , according to Clinton Curtis , a Florida
computer programmer .
He has confirmed that in 2000 he designed an
undetectable programme for Republican congressman Tom Feeney .
It was
created to rig elections by covertly switching votes from one candidate
to another to ensure a predetermined ballot outcome .
See a video of his
sworn testimony here .
As Robert F Kennedy Jr , nephew of JFK , has exposed ,
the US is one of the few democracies that allow private , partisan
companies to secretly count votes using their own proprietary software .
Moreover , the vast majority of western democracies have independent
Election Commissions to oversee voting methods and corroborate the
results .
The US does not .

Most election ballots next week will be tallied or scanned by four
private companies - Diebold , Election Systems & Software
( ES&S ) , Sequoia Voting Systems and Hart InterCivic .
According to Kennedy :
Three of the four companies
have close ties to the Republican Party .
ES&S , in an earlier
corporate incarnation , was chaired by Chuck Hagel , who in 1996 became
the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Nebraska in
twenty - four years - winning a close race in which eighty - five percent
of the votes were tallied by his former company .
Hart InterCivic ranks
among its investors GOP loyalist Tom Hicks , who bought the Texas
Rangers from George W. Bush in 1998 , making Bush a millionaire fifteen
times over .
And according to campaign - finance records , Diebold , along
with its employees and their families , has contributed at least
$ 300,000 to GOP candidates and party funds since 1998 - including more
than $ 200,000 to the Republican National Committee .
In a 2003
fund - raising e-mail , the company 's then - CEO Walden O'Dell promised to
deliver Ohio's electoral votes to Bush in 2004 . "
Is it right and proper for partisan pro-Republican companies to count the votes ?
It is certainly not objective and impartial .
Kennedy recounts how computer scientists at Johns Hopkins and Rice
universities conducted an analysis of the Diebold voting machine
software source code in July 2003 .
" This voting system is far below
even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts ...
( it is ) unsuitable for use in a general election , " the scientists
concluded .
" With electronic machines , you can commit wholesale fraud with a
single alteration of software , " Avi Rubin told Kennedy .
He is a
computer science professor at Johns Hopkins who received $ US7.5 million
from the National Science Foundation to study electronic voting .
" There
are a million little tricks when you build software that allow you to
do whatever you want .
If you know the precinct demographics , the
machine can be programmed to recognize its precinct and strategically
flip votes in elections that are several years in the future .
No one
will ever know it happened . "
Electronic voting machines not only break down frequently , their
security and integrity is also easily compromised , says Kennedy :
" In
October 2005 , the US Government Accountability Office issued a damning
report on electronic voting machines .
Citing widespread irregularities
and malfunctions , the government 's top watchdog agency concluded that a
host of weaknesses with touch - screen and optical - scan technology ' could
damage the integrity of ballots , votes and voting - system software by
allowing unauthorized modifications '... Locks protecting computer hardware
were easy to pick .
Unsecured memory cards could enable individuals to
' vote multiple times , change vote totals and produce false election
reports .'
An even more comprehensive report
released in June by the Brennan Center for Justice , a nonpartisan think
tank at the New York University School of Law , echoed the GAO's
findings .
The report - conducted by a task force of computer scientists
and security experts from the government , universities and the private
sector - was peer - reviewed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology .
Electronic voting machines widely adopted since 2000 , the
report concluded , " pose a real danger to the integrity of national ,
state and local elections . "
While no instances of hacking have yet been
documented , the report identified 120 security threats to three widely
used machines - the easiest method of attack being to utilize corrupt
software that shifts votes from one candidate to another .
There is no evidence that the voting machine malfunctions , flaws and
security risks identified in the 2004 ballot have been fully corrected
in time for the 2008 vote .
This calls into question whether the 4
November ballot will reflect the will of the American people .
As Kennedy concludes :
" You
do not have to believe in conspiracy theories to fear for the integrity
of our electoral system :
The right to vote is simply too important -
and too hard won - to be surrendered without a fight .
It is time for
Americans to reclaim our democracy from private interests . "

Obesity on airlines is becoming a big issue .
Just a couple weeks ago a flight attendant was ruled too fat to fly , and of course the overweight passenger debate is always one that flares up people ’s opinions .
There are two schools of thought .
The first is from the view of the passenger stuck next to an overweight one who takes up more than their fair share of space ; a lot of people believe that they should have to pay for a second seat .
But the second opinion comes from overweight passengers themselves , who believe that they have a right to more space .
According to Reuters , today the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the direction of the latter , declaring that obese people have the right to two seats for the price of one on flights within Canada .
The original decision had been made by the Canadian Transportation Authority , who claimed that people that are “ functionally disabled by obesity ” deserve to have two seats for one fare .
The Canadian airlines went to appeal , but the high court declined to hear it , meaning that the decision now stands .
Do you think the official decision is a fair one ?

There are many tales about aliens and ghosts , which may sometimes seem rather weird .
Nevertheless , according to a survey , people are more likely to believe in the supernatural than in God .
The results of a survey showed that 54 percent of British people believe in God , while 58 percent believe in ghosts and aliens .
It turned out that women believe in the supernatural more than men .
The survey showed that women were more likely to visit a medium .
Researchers surveyed 3,000 people .
About 25 percent of respondents reported at least one paranormal encounter .
It is worth noting that this year the National Archives presented reports about detailed UFO sightings that the Government kept record of .
One of such reports states about a fisherman who said he had been taken to an alien spacecraft and , because of his age , aliens released him .
In 2007 researchers carried out a survey , which showed a decrease in moral standards , which is mainly due to draw backs in religious beliefs .

Sarah Palin :
My favorite sign was ' I am Joe Mama ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This
At a rally in Leesburg , Virginia on Monday , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin spoke enthusiastically about the variations on " Joe the Plumber " with which many of her supporters have recently been identifying themselves .
However , she may have overstepped the bounds of good taste when she suggested that among her favorite signs was one reading " I am Joe Mama . "
" I really got to hand it to Joe the Plumber , " Palin began .
" A lot of folks around the country , they identify with Joe , and we see posters even here today .
We saw posters recently -- Doug the barber , and Christine the florist , and Cindy the citizen .
We 've got Joe the plumber 's son , Jack the hunter , Vickie the realtor .
Yes ! "
" One of my favorites last night , it was ' I am Joe Mama , ' " Palin concluded , to laughs and shouts from the audience .
It seemed clear from the intonation with which Palin said the phrase and the laughs it received that she knew it was meant to mock the ethnic pronunciation of " Your mama . "
Done knock - up style the joke might read :
Did you hear Joe was here ?
Joe who ?
Joe mama .
One poster at the liberal message board Democratic Underground quickly suggested , " There is the sound clip for the day .
Fantastic .
She is a total idiot . "
Another added , " The expression ' You mama ! ' coming out of that mouth is shocking enough .
Puerto Rican dialect annuciates [ sic ] the " y " as " j " ...
Talk about shooting 2 moose with one bullet . "
Palin's use of an ethnic accent is reminiscent in some ways of an incident in 2007 where Hillary Clinton was accused of making fun of southerners because she had adopted a southern accent to recite a verse of a gospel hymn during an appearance at a black church .
However , in Clinton 's case the charges were of pandering to her audience , not of racism -- and even those charges were shown to be misplaced .
One critic suggested at the time , " Andrea Mitchell , while narrating the segment on the political duel between Obama and Hillary in Selma , Alabama this weekend portrayed Obama as having authentic appeal , while picturing Hillary resorting to heavy - handed political tactics .
But that heavy hand turned to flat out mocking with part of her speech that has been placed online .
Clinton , once a resident of the Governor 's mansion in Arkansas , tried to fake a southern accent and it came across as a cheap and nasty ploy . "
Talking Points
Memo then came to her defense , writing under the headline " Yet Another Wingnut Sliming Of Hillary Proven To Be Bogus " that " Hillary was actually quoting the hymn lyrics of someone else -- while clearly and very openly imitating ( not very well , it turns out ) the cadences she thought the lyrics would traditionally have been delivered in .
There was nothing phony about it at all . "

Mr Obama said national security and the US economy would be top priorities US President - elect Barack Obama has promised to rebuild his country 's " moral stature in the world " .
In his first television interview since the election , Mr Obama told CBS he would pull troops out of Iraq , shore up Afghanistan , and close Guantanamo Bay .
" I 'm going to make sure that we do n't torture , " he said of the prison camp .
Mr Obama also promised to do " whatever it takes " to stabilise the US economy , including rescuing the struggling auto industry and assisting homeowners .
On Saturday , he said the US was facing " the greatest economic challenge of our time " and urged Congress to help with " at least a down - payment on a rescue plan that will create jobs " .
His advisers later said he would support the co-ordinated response to the global financial crisis agreed by the G20 on Saturday .
' No torture '
The BBC's Sarah Morris in Washington says Mr Obama appeared relaxed in the interview he gave to CBS 's 60 Minutes programme .

He answered questions about national security , the economy and about future appointments to his administration ahead of his inauguration on 20 January .
Mr Obama said getting a national security team in place as soon as possible was one of his top priorities , " because transition periods are potentially times of vulnerability to a terrorist attack " .
When asked about his promise to withdraw from Iraq , he said that as soon as he takes office he will " call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff , my national security apparatus , and we will start executing a plan that draws down our troops " .
" Particularly in light of the problems that we 're having in Afghanistan , which has continued to worsen .
We 've got to shore up those efforts , " he added .
Mr Obama also said a top priority would be " to stamp out al - Qaeda once and for all " and that capturing or killing Osama Bin Laden was " critical " to US security .
He later confirmed that he intended to close the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , and " make sure that we do n't torture " .
" Those are part and parcel of an effort to regain America 's moral stature in the world , " he explained .
Mr Obama pledged to help for the struggling US auto industry
The president - elect went on to discuss how he had been talking to top economic advisers about how to create jobs and get the economy back on track .
He said he intended to put into place new stimulus packages and help for the troubled US auto industry and struggling homeowners .
He said the consensus among economists from both the left and right was that " we 're going to have to spend money now " to get the economy moving again .
" And that we should n't worry about the deficit next year or even the year after ; that short term , the most important thing is that we avoid a deepening recession , " he added .
Mr Obama also confirmed he had met his former Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton , last week , but refused to comment on speculation linking her to the post of secretary of state in his cabinet .
However , he did say the Republican Party would be represented .
Dog delay
For the last portion of the interview , Mr Obama was joined by his wife , Michelle , who talked about her priorities as First Lady and how her family would cope with the pressures of living in the White House .
The primary focus for the first year will be making sure that the kids make it through the transition
Michelle Obama Mrs Obama said she was looking forward to moving to Washington , where the family would be under one roof again after 18 months , during which her husband had been travelling around the country .
" The primary focus for the first year will be making sure that the kids make it through the transition .
But there are many issues that I care deeply about , " she said .
" I care about military families and the work - family balance issue . "
Mrs Obama also revealed that their daughters , Malia and Sasha , would have to wait at least two more months for the puppy which her husband publicly promised them on election night .
" We 're on call mode on the dog front .
Because the deal with the dog was that we would get the dog after we got settled .
Because as responsible owners we - I do n't think it would be good to get a dog in the midst of transition , " she said .
" We cut that deal with the kids before America knew about it .
So they 're good with it , " she added .

STUDY CONFIRMS GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS THREATEN HUMAN FERTILITY
By Jeffrey Smith
November 14 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
Los Angeles , CA . - A long - term feeding study commissioned by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety , managed by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health , Family and Youth , and carried out by Veterinary University Vienna , confirms genetically engineered ( GM ) corn seriously affects reproductive health in mice .
Non-GMO advocates , who have warned about this infertility link along with other health risks , now seek an immediate ban of all GM foods and GM crops to protect the health of humankind and the fertility of women around the world .
Feeding mice with genetically engineered corn developed by the US - based Monsanto Corporation led to lower fertility and body weight , according to the study conducted by the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna .
Lead author of the study Professor Zentek said , there was a direct link between the decrease in fertility and the GM diet , and that mice fed with non-GE corn reproduced more efficiently .
In the study , Austrian scientists performed several long - term feeding trials over 20 weeks with laboratory mice fed a diet containing 33 % of a GM variety ( NK 603 x MON 810 ) , or a closely related non -GE variety used in many countries .
Statistically significant litter size and pup weight decreases were found in the third and fourth litters in the GM - fed mice , compared to the control group .
The corn is genetically engineered with genes that produce a pesticidal toxin , as well as genes that allow it to survive applications of Monsanto ’s herbicide Roundup .
A book by author Jeffrey M. Smith , Genetic Roulette , distributed to members of congress last year , documents 65 serious health risks of GM products , including similar fertility problems with GM soy and GM corn :
Offspring of rats fed GM soy showed a five - fold increase in mortality , lower birth weights , and the inability to reproduce .
Male mice fed GM soy had damaged young sperm cells .
The embryo offspring of GM soy - fed mice had altered DNA functioning .
Several US farmers reported sterility or fertility problems among pigs and cows fed on GM corn varieties .
Additionally , over the last two months , investigators in India have documented fertility problems , abortions , premature births , and other serious health issues , including deaths , among buffaloes fed GM cottonseed products .
The principle GM crops are soy , corn , cottonseed and canola .
GM sugar from sugar beets will also be introduced before year ’s end .
Mr. Smith , who is also the Executive Director of the Institute for Responsible Technology says , “ GM foods are likely responsible for several negative health trends in the US .
The government must impose an immediate ban on these dangerous crops . ”
He says , “ Consumers do n’t need to wait for governmental action .
They can download a free Non-GMO Shopping Guide .
Monsanto press offices in the UK and USA were unable to provide a comment on the findings for journalists yesterday .
The Institute for Responsible Technology ’s Campaign for Healthier Eating in America mobilizes citizens , organizations , businesses , and the media , to achieve the tipping point of consumer rejection of genetically modified foods .

The number of people killed in a plane crash in central Mexico City in which Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino died has risen to 13 .
The ministry plane - a Learjet - burst into flames as it came down during rush - hour in the financial district at about 1900 local time ( 0000 GMT ) .
US and British experts would help in a " meticulous and detailed " probe which could take weeks , officials said .
Correspondents describe Mr Mourino , who was 37 , as a rising political star .
" We have 13 bodies .
We are investigating to see if another woman has also died , " prosecutor Miguel Angel Mancera told Mexican television .
President Felipe Calderon paid tribute to Mr Mourino , whom he called " one of my closest collaborators and one of my best and closest friends " .
A former assistant attorney general , Jose Luis Santiago , and other senior advisers were also killed .
Profile : Juan Camilo Mourino
The cause of the crash remains unknown , and Mr Calderon said his government would " carry out all necessary investigations to find out the causes of the tragedy " .
At a news conference , Communications Minister Luis Tellez appeared to rule out any signs of foul play .
" So far , we have not detected any indications that suggest a hypothesis other than that it was an accident , " he said .
Mr Mourino had been in charge of security during the government 's violent battle with Mexico 's powerful drug cartels , and his death is a big blow , says BBC Americas analyst Warren Bull .
About 3,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence since the start of the year , and the country 's kidnapping rates are among the highest in the world .
' Enormous explosion '
The interior ministry officials had been returning to Mexico City from an event in the city of San Luis Potosi when the plane went down .
Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said the crash had killed all those on board .
He added that more people might have died on the ground as a number of cars were destroyed when the plane crashed .
" It 's likely that we will find other bodies in the vehicles , " Mr Ebrard told Mexican television .
At least 40 people were admitted to hospital with injuries .
" The explosion was enormous , " an eyewitness told AFP news agency .
" The flames reached higher than the buildings on La Reforma " , the witness added , referring to the main street in the city 's financial district .
Police and ambulances attended the crash scene as firemen battled to bring the blaze under control .
Correspondents say Mr Mourino had come under recent pressure over allegations he had acted improperly by signing government contracts on behalf of his family 's car fuel business while in office .
Mr Mourino had denied any wrongdoing .
Mr Santiago , who had previously been in charge of pursuing extraditions against drug smugglers , had reportedly been the target of at least one planned assassination attempt .

It 's true .
Every hero really does become a bore at last .
And now it 's Senator John McCain 's turn .
McCain , Arizona 's most charismatic political figure for most of the past decade , has touched bottom .
Only a war in the Persian Gulf can save his senatorial seat , which comes up in the 1992 election .
Clearly , McCain realizes he is in peril .
For the past two weeks , he has been popping up on talk shows giving callers the benefit of his military expertise .
Info John McCain
McCain has been attempting to slither away from his designation as one of the " Keating Five " for months .
He has not been successful .
There is too much baggage and too many connecting wires to Charles Keating .
The only thing that will make enough voters forget McCain 's part in the savings - and - loan heist is an all - out war against Iraq .
McCain 's central role in the Keating affair has become notorious .
Of all the senators involved , McCain is the most culpable .
The revelations about his relationship with Keating have totally eroded McCain 's political base .
Even a dumpling like state Senator Jerry Gillespie of Mesa might defeat McCain if the two were matched against each other in this year 's Republican primary .
That 's exactly how far down McCain has slipped .
Of all the members ' behavior of the " Keating Five , " McCain 's was the most odious .
Only a war could make people forget how McCain rode shotgun for Keating and his gang of financial marauders .
Think back on some of the opportunistic moves McCain made while he thought the voters were n't watching :
1. McCain accepted $ 112,000 in campaign contributions from Keating and his subalterns .
To this day , McCain refuses to return the money .
Why not ?
McCain says returning the money would be admitting he had done something wrong .
McCain does n't seem to recognize that Keating 's money has already been returned by two other senators , Dennis DeConcini and Don Riegle of Michigan .
Even Attorney General Bob Corbin has divested himself of the $ 50,000 he took from Keating .
Public opinion might yet force McCain to cough up , but do n't expect the duplicitous McCain ever to admit he did anything wrong .
2. McCain 's wife , Cindy , and her father were included in a lucrative deal with Keating to construct the Fountain Square shopping center .
She invested $ 359,000 .
McCain excuses himself .
He says it was his wife 's money and he had nothing to do with the deal because they have a prenuptial agreement .
On its very face , that alibi is impossible to swallow .
3. McCain and his wife regularly accepted free rides on Keating 's private airplanes .
Among the places they set down was Keating 's home in the Bahamas .
Who else among the Keating Five wormed himself into that close a relationship ?
4. McCain , with visions of becoming president of the United States dancing around in his head , accepted every morsel Keating tossed his way .
5. McCain was a willing participant in the infamous meeting in DeConcini 's office where five United States senators bullied government employees who were trying to bring a halt to Keating 's marauding of Lincoln Savings and Loan .
This meeting caused a two - year delay in Lincoln 's closing .
During that period , Lincoln sold $ 220 million in American Continental Corporation debentures .
They were marketed through Lincoln offices in $ 1,000 denominations while customers were steered away from those which were insured .
6 . Pointing up the closeness of the friendship is the fact that Brad Boland , one of McCain 's top assistants , spent so much time around the Keating family that he ended up marrying Keating 's daughter .
Boland is now Keating 's public relations man .
That must be quite a heavy task .
There is , of course , plenty of blame to go round among the senators .
All five were ready and eager to take part in that fateful meeting in the early evening in the Washington , D.C. , office of Arizona 's senior senator , the honorable DeConcini .
It was the heat generated by the senators in this meeting that made it possible for the looting of Lincoln Savings to continue unabated for two more years .
We all have seen people make it to the Senate for reasons that have nothing to do with their competence as lawmakers .
Two of the Keating five , McCain and Ohio's John Glenn , are there because of their exploits before turning to politics .
Glenn was an astronaut ; McCain was a prisoner of war .
What else did McCain have to offer ?
He moved to Arizona only because there was a congressional opening .
He was shipped back to Washington on the heels of his first election before he'd had time to visit the Grand Canyon .
Clearly , McCain 's attraction to voters stems wholly from an accident of history .
McCain rode his POW status to his elections in both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
It 's all a little sad when you look back on it .
McCain has never hesitated to use his status as a prisoner to pull at the heartstrings of Arizona voters .
Take that one element away from his life and McCain has no credentials to be in Congress .
Now it appears that luck will still be on his side .
Until things heated up in the Persian Gulf , the one story that had the power to enrage voters and purge the Congress was the savings - and - loan crisis .
It is a financial scandal that matches anything in the entire history of this country .
And McCain , because of his intimate association with Keating , was right at the vital center .
On Friday , October 17th , 2008 , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R- M N ) made the following
comment on national television to Chris Matthews , host of MSNBC's Hardball :
“ I wish the American media would take a great look at the
views of the people in Congress and find out :
Are they
pro-America or anti-America ?
I think people would love to
see an expose like that . ”
No , Michelle , actually we would not love to see that , having already witnessed an
ugly chapter in American history that was fueled by s uch small - minded and
unconscionable t hinking .
What we would like to see , however , is your immediate departure from Congress .
I encourage Minnesota voters to cast their ballots on November 4th for Elwyn
Tinklenberg , who is opposing Rep. Bachmann in the race to represent the
state ’s 6th District in the U.S. House of Representatives .
Even if you do not
live in Minnesota , you can donate to Mr. Tinklenberg ’s campaign by going to
t his dedicated page on the ActBlue website .
Enough i s enough .
I spent the entirety of last weekend in the Cheshire County jail .
I want to thank the Sheriffs who cuffed and transferred me as well as the Corrections Officers in the jail for their professionalism and courtesy .
I made it clear that I did not intend to resist and you made it clear that you did not want to hurt me .
I respect you for the level of humanity you treated me with , considering the system itself is inhumane .
There may be a few bad guys among you , but I could not identify them during my brief stay .
Also special thanks to Lieutenant Kevin Clark for allowing me a personal phone call when the in - cell phone would n’t work with my girlfriend ’s cell phone .
Unfortunately , while I ’m sure you all do your best to do your job as instructed so you can keep food on your family ’s table , you should know that what you are doing as part of your job is wrong .
Many of you already know this .
In fact , the superintendent of the jail , Richard Van Wickler , is a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
As you know , the jail is full of people who have not done harm to another human being .
I refer of course to “ consensual criminals ” , like drug users .
This appears to be the main reason another jail is being built – you ’ve run out of room to hold your political prisoners !
Do n’t you wish you were only incarcerating real criminals ?
You know , people who actually hurt others or damaged property ?
I understand that quitting your job may make you feel better , but then you may be replaced by someone less humane than you , so I ’m not certain that is the solution .
Obviously you ’ll be fired ( whether you ’re the superintendent or a CO ) for doing the right thing and turning loose all your peaceful prisoners .
Perhaps you can start by joining with your superintendent and becoming a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .
What else can COs who object to being a part of incarcerating peaceful people do to protest ?
Please post your ideas here in the comments .

( Adds fiscal stimulus measures , industry output data )
MOSCOW , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin assured Russians on Thursday he would guide them through the global financial crisis without the economic convulsions of the past , but acknowledged there would be pain .
Putin unveiled a $ 20 billion economic stimulus package and help for people hurt in the slowdown as he set out a long - term response to a crisis that has cut more than 70 percent from the value of Russian markets since May and hammered the rouble .
The crisis has dented confidence in the Russian economy and raised the prospect that popular discontent could , for the first time , seriously undermine the ruling double act of Putin and his protege , President Dmitry Medvedev .
Putin , who stepped down as president in May and remains hugely influential , offered assurances there would be no repeat of the economic turmoil when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and , 10 years ago , when the state defaulted on its debt .
“ It ( the crisis ) will test the mettle of every country , their ability to defend the fortunes of their citizens , the economy and the national currency .
That challenge stands today in front of Russia , ” he told the congress of his ruling United Russia party .
He told the congress , in an upscale shopping centre near the Kremlin , that Russians were asking “ a fair question : what is going to happen to us ? ”
“ We will do everything , everything in our power ... so that the collapses of the past years should never be repeated in our country .
We will do everything in our power to defend the deposits of our citizens in banks , ” he said .
BUDGET DEFICIT NEXT YEAR ?
The fiscal stimulus package will include a cut in profit tax , which accounts for 8.5 percent of budget revenues , to 20 percent from 24 now , and a new depreciation mechanism that will allow firms to reduce the profit tax further .
The announcement came as official data for October industrial output growth was revised downwards , to 0.6 percent year - on - year from the 1.6 percent released earlier , in new evidence of an economic slowdown .
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Russia could next year have its first budget deficit in a decade but the deficit would be covered by transferring cash from a rainy day fund , not from borrowing .
He said the 2009 deficit may equal 1 percent of GDP .
Putin said he believed Russia ’s large gold and foreign exchange reserves and the funds it had accumulated during years of high oil prices put it in good stead to weather the crisis .
“ They allow us to preserve macroeconomic stability and therefore they will help us prevent a surge in inflation and a sharp change in the rouble rate , ” he said .
New figures showed gold and foreign exchange reserves had fallen by $ 21.9 billion in the past week to the lowest level in over a year .
The central bank has dipped into them to support the rouble , under pressure from falling world oil prices .
Russia's MICEX .MCX stock exchange picked up slightly after Putin 's speech but did not regain earlier losses .
Putin , who spoke after a short speech by Medvedev , made no references to speculation that , prompted by the crisis , he could make a comeback to the Kremlin in an early election .
Kremlin critics have said a draft law now in parliament to extend the presidential term to six from four years may be part of a plan to trigger early elections , although officials have denied any such intention .
FALLING RESERVES
James Fenkner , managing director of Moscow - based investment fund Red Star Asset Management , said he believed Putin was unrealistic on protecting the rouble .
“ They ’re bleeding reserves trying to support the currency , ” Fenkner told Reuters .
“ They have to move that exchange rate . ”
Putin promised extra help for the unemployed , for pensioners , and for home - buyers , increased spending on health and education and state guarantees on infrastructure bonds .
Ronald Smith , chief strategist at Alfa Bank , said the spending was a reasonable response to an unprecedented global slowdown .
“ They had been very prudently saving for just such a rainy day , and boy , is it raining cats and dogs , ” he said .

Gallup Daily : Obama Lead at 7 - 8 % Among Likely Voters
No major change in structure of race
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has 51 % of the vote among likely voters in two separate estimates based on Gallup 's likely voter models , while John McCain 's share of the vote is 43 % to 44 % ; these results are based on interviewing conducted Wednesday through Friday as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
Obama has a seven percentage point , 51 % to 44 % , margin using the " traditional " model Gallup has employed in past elections for Oct. 22 - 24 , and an eight - point , 51 % to 43 % , margin using an " expanded " model that takes into account possibly greater turnout by new or infrequent voters .
Barack Obama was off the campaign trail for two days as a result of a visit to his ailing grandmother in Hawaii , but returns to campaigning today in Nevada and New Mexico .
John McCain has been campaigning continuously and will also be campaigning in New Mexico on Saturday .
None of this has , apparently , made much difference in the standing of the two candidates in the minds of voters .
Obama 's margin over McCain is statistically significant , and continues to reflect a fairly stable Obama lead in the race for president , with Election Day now just 10 days away .
Obama 's lead among registered voters is at nine points , 51 % to 42 % .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 22 - 24 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,793 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,413 " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intentions and self - reported past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The traditional likely voter model assumes a turnout of 60 % of national adults .
The likely voter sample is weighted to match this assumption , so the weighted sample size is 1,819 .
For results based on the sample of 2,358 " expanded " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intentions only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
The expanded likely voter model does not make any assumptions about turnout level .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
If we define true and false with the following combinators ( in Python ) :
TRUE = lambda a : lambda b : ( a ) FALSE = lambda a : lambda b : ( b )
then if - then - else can be implemented simply by applying a predicate to two arguments : the then / true case and the else / false case .
For example :
( TRUE ) ( True ) ( False ) == True ( FALSE ) ( True ) ( False ) == False
Now if we define :
AND = lambda a : lambda b : ( a ) ( b ) (a ) OR = lambda a : lambda b : ( a ) ( a ) ( b ) NOT = lambda a : lambda b : lambda c : ( a ) ( c ) ( b )
we can do boolean logic with only reference to function application .
For example :
( AND ) ( TRUE ) ( FALSE ) == ( FALSE )
This is a little hard to verify in Python so we can use our if - then - else trick :
( AND ) ( TRUE ) ( FALSE ) ( True ) ( False ) == False
Our definition of TRUE and FALSE is known as the Church encoding of the booleans .
We can also Church - encode a pair , or cons , and define car and cdr appropriately :
CONS = lambda a : lambda b : lambda c : ( c ) ( a ) ( b ) CAR = lambda a : ( a ) ( TRUE ) CDR = lambda a : ( a ) ( FALSE )
If the definitions of CAR and CDR seem odd , note that the magic is really in CONS .
( CAR ) ( ( CONS ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) == 1 ( CDR ) ( ( CONS ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) == 2
But this means CONS makes a nice way of deferring our ( True ) ( False ) trick to " unchurch " Church - encoded booleans into Python booleans :
UNCHURCH_BOOLEAN = ( CONS ) ( True ) ( False )
Now we can say :
( UNCHURCH_BOOLEAN ) ( ( NOT ) ( TRUE ) ) == False ( UNCHURCH_BOOLEAN ) (( OR ) ( TRUE ) ( FALSE ) ) == True
The natural numbers can also be Church - encoded :
ZERO = FALSE SUCC = lambda a : lambda b : lambda c : ( b ) ( ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) )
We can then define :
ONE = ( SUCC ) ( ZERO ) TWO = ( SUCC ) ( ONE ) THREE = ( SUCC ) ( TWO ) FOUR = ( SUCC ) ( THREE )
and so on .
Here 's a little Python function for " churching " numbers :
def church_number (n ) : return SUCC ( church_number(n - 1 ) ) if n else FALSE
We can define addition , multiplication and exponentiation as follows :
PLUS = lambda a : lambda b : lambda c : lambda d : ( a ) ( c ) ( ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) )
MULT = lambda a : lambda b : lambda c : ( b ) ( ( a ) ( c ) ) EXP = lambda a : lambda b : ( b ) ( a )
Of course , what would be nice is if we had an easy way to unchurch our Church - encoded numbers so we could see if these work .
Well , it turns out that 's easy to do :
UNCHURCH_NUMBER = lambda a : ( a ) ( lambda b : b + 1 ) ( 0 )
So
( UNCHURCH_NUMBER ) ( ZERO ) == 0 ( UNCHURCH_NUMBER ) ( ONE ) == 1 ( UNCHURCH_NUMBER ) ( TWO ) == 2
and so on .

Using reflections in photography can lead to some amazing effects and beautiful images .
Using water , windows , mirrors or any sort of reflective surface can change an image into a work of art .
The wonderful thing about using reflections when taking photos is that they can completely alter the image from something fairly straightforward to something richer or abstract or otherwise more artistic .

Using water , windows , mirrors or any sort of reflective surface can change an image into a work of art .
The wonderful thing about using reflections when taking photos is that they can completely alter the image from something fairly straightforward to something richer or abstract or otherwise more artistic .
Sometimes reflections can be annoying and certainly not artistic .
But creativity and good - quality photos depend on the photographer being able to see things differently , rather than seeing only one part of a larger whole .
Also , using reflected light can vastly improve the quality of lighting available .
Diffused light is generally better for taking photos , and using reflected light , either as the main source of light or for highlighting , is an excellent way to capture diffused light .
Whether you choose to use reflection in an artistic way or as a source of lightning , learning to use reflections in photography will help take your photographic skills to the next level .
Below we present over 50 beautiful examples of reflective photography .
All examples are linked to their sources .
Below , you can also explore other works of the photographers we ’ve featured here .

Ersatz Sanctions Berlin Plans to Deter Trade with Iran
The German government has decided to " discourage " companies from doing business with Iran .
The move comes after criticism that Berlin has not done enough to put the pressure on Tehran .
A Hertfordshire couple in their 60s were horrified to receive a letter last week from a London firm of lawyers accusing them of dowloading a hardcore gay porn movie .
It demanded they pay £ 503 for " copyright infringement " or face a high court action .
The 20 - page " pre-settlement letter " from lawyers Davenport Lyons , acting on behalf of German pornogaphers , insisted they pay £ 503 to their clients for the 115 minute film Army Fuckers which features " Gestapo " officers and " Czech " farmers .
The bewildered couple contacted Guardian Money .
" We were offended by the title of the film .
We do n't do porn - straight or gay - and we can't do downloads .
We have to ask our son even to do an iTunes purchase . "
But this Hertfordshire couple are not alone .
A large number of people have received this letter , provoking a massive outcry on web forums such as slyck.com and torrentfreak which estimate 25,000 of these letters have been sent out .
If all the recipients paid up , it would net £ 12.5 m - more than almost any porn film has made .
The lawyers also sent out similar demands for a second German gay porn film with an even more offensive title .
Media expert Michael Coyle at Southampton - based solicitors Lawdit , is fighting on behalf of individuals who have received the letter from Davenport Lyons .
" Owners of films , music and computer games obviously have to protect their rights and prevent illegal copying , otherwise everyone would get all sorts of content for free .
" But many of these letters have been sent to people who have no idea what a download is .
We 've had straight pensioners complain , and a mother who had the shock of having to question her 14 - year - old son about gay porn because he was the only apparent user of the internet connection that was registered to her . "
Coyle says Davenport Lyons represent DigiProtect , a German company with rights to both pornographic films .
He questions the amount demanded and methods used to identify computers alleged to have downloaded material .
He believes the sum demanded is out of all proportion to the alleged injury .
" In one case , Davenport Lyons wanted £ 500 for a £ 20 game .
The alleged file - sharing would have cost only about £ 50 - the rest is legal costs . "
" All they do is find the internet connection , demand the service provider reveal the name and address ( not all do ) and then send out a letter demanding cash .
But the technology is flawed .
It is easy to hijack a wireless router especially in a built - up area or a block of flats , so it is never clear who used what , " says Coyle .
Coyle offers a £ 50 service for those who refuse to cave in to the demands as he believes some of the firm 's successes are due to consumers paying up because they cannot afford the legal costs of defending themselves .
" They have won court cases including a high - profile £ 16,000 on a games download .
But these have not been defended .
My advice is to deny file sharing to any such request , " he adds .
We put a number of questions to Davenport Lyons .
In a statement it said : " We can not comment on individual cases .
We represent clients who own valuable rights in copyright material and are legally entitled to protect and enforce such rights against any unlawful infringement .
The material was not put on a file - sharing site by our clients .
" We write an initial letter to those suspected of illegal file sharing based on technical information received from our clients .
Such procedure is required by court rules .
We allow ample opportunity for the recipient to respond , and if they have done nothing wrong they have no reason to be concerned . "

Jeffrey Hancock , associate professor of communication , is co-author of a study about how people use information posted on Facebook profiles to their personal advantage .
Lindsay France / University Photography
( PhysOrg.com ) --
It 's an age - old question :
How do you get a new acquaintance to like you ?
Jeff Hancock , associate professor of communication , says that he and his research team have found in two studies that what works in face - to - face communication can also work in the cyber world .
In one study , some participants had access to an unknown partner 's Facebook profile and some did not ; both groups were asked to get their partners to like them in a short instant - message conversation .
Those with Facebook access used that information -- such as the partner 's interests or favorite music -- to ask questions to which they already knew the answers .
Or they mentioned the information to make themselves seem similar to the partner .
Did it work ?
" Very much so , " Hancock said , noting that the participants who had access to the Facebook profiles were more successful .
" The more they used the questions and mentions , they more the other person liked them . "
And in most cases -- more than 97 percent -- the partner failed to detect that their new friend seemed to know an awful lot about them .
Hancock attributes the technique 's efficacy to homophily -- the social science theory summed up in the saying " birds of a feather flock together . "
" We like people we 're more similar to , " Hancock said .
" So by using these frames , the participants made themselves seem more similar to the new person . "
The article , " I Know Something You Don't : The Use of Asymmetric Personal Information for Interpersonal Advantage , " was published in the Proceedings of the 2008 Computer Supported Cooperative Work ( CSCW ) .
Hancock presented the paper -- as well as one on text communication -- at the CSCW 's annual conference Nov. 8 - 12 in San Diego .
Both papers were nominated for Best Paper , awards given to only 1 percent of the studies submitted .
In the second study , which examined understanding e-mail , text messaging and similar text - only communication , Hancock found that people who send instant messages not only unconsciously reveal their mood in their messages , but they also pass that mood onto their texting partner .
" To the best of our knowledge , it 's the first time that emotional contagion has been demonstrated in a text - only communication , " Hancock said .
Emotional contagion is a well - studied phenomenon in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group .
Texters in a sad , frustrated mood unconsciously said less in their messages , sent fewer messages and used more words related to sadness and anxiety , according to the article , titled " I 'm Sad You 're Sad : Emotional Contagion in Computer - Mediated Contagion . "
" It 's a common assumption that emotions can only be communicated when people are face - to - face , through such nonverbal cues as gestures and facial expression , " Hancock said .
" We found that 's not true . "
The two studies demonstrate that basic human psychological processes operate even in relatively new communication environments involving text messages and social networking Web sites .
" We 've been interacting face - to - face with words for at least 60,000 years , " Hancock said .
" But we 've been interacting via computer for 20 years , or 10 years for most of us .
Yet these old principles and processes still hold up .
We 're very adaptive . "
Hancock points out that his co-authors on the papers are four information science undergraduates who have since graduated and Ph.D. candidate Catalina Toma .
" It 's completely consistent with Cornell 's vision to become the top research institution for undergraduate education . "

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Allies of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin stepped up attacks on state lawmakers investigating the firing of her public service commissioner Tuesday , calling it a " McCarthyistic " inquisition and asking judges to block the probe .
The five Republican state lawmakers who filed suit said the two Democrats and the former Anchorage prosecutor leading the probe " are unable to hold the balance between vindicating their own political interests and the interests of those who are being investigated . "
One of those named in the lawsuit , state Sen. Kim Elton , declined comment Tuesday .
There was no immediate response from Sen.
Hollis French , the chairman of the state Senate Judiciary Committee , which on Friday issued subpoenas to Palin 's husband , Todd , and 10 members of her administration .
In addition , Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said another lawsuit had been filed by citizens in Fairbanks , Alaska , complaining the Legislature was " wasting public monies by continuing its politicized investigation . "
And Stapleton said House Speaker John Harris urged French and Elton to " reconsider " the probe , which was authorized with bipartisan support that she said no longer exists .
Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations she and her advisers pressured then - Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire a state trooper going through a bitter custody dispute with Palin 's sister -- and that Monegan was terminated when he refused .
Palin says she fired Monegan over budget issues , and denies any wrongdoing .
Also named as a defendant in the Republicans ' lawsuit is Stephen Branchflower , the former Anchorage prosecutor hired to investigate Monegan 's firing .
The lawsuit alleges that Elton , French and Branchflower " are conducting a McCarthyistic investigation in an unlawful , biased , partial and partisan political manner in order to impact the upcoming Alaska general and national presidential elections . "
Watch how state probe is turning political »
Palin originally pledged to cooperate with the investigation that the Alaska Legislative Council commissioned in July .
But since becoming Sen.
John McCain 's running mate , campaign spokesmen have lashed out at the probe as " tainted " and " partisan , " and fought to get the state Personnel Board to launch its own probe .
" I think it 's fair to say that the governor is not going to cooperate with that investigation so long as it remained tainted and run by partisan individuals who have a predetermined conclusion , " McCain - Palin campaign spokesman Ed O'Callaghan said Monday .
In particular , campaign officials singled out comments French made to ABC News that they said suggested the investigation could yield criminal charges or an " October Surprise " for the GOP ticket .
And they accuse the probe of being " hijacked " by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's campaign -- a charge the Obama campaign dismissed as " complete paranoia . "
Monegan said he was repeatedly pressured to take action against State Trooper Mike Wooten , Palin 's ex-brother - in - law , before his July dismissal .
Monday , the McCain - Palin campaign released documents it said bolster its argument that Monegan was fired over budget disputes and " egregious insubordination . "

Scarborough : Obama tapping Emanuel would be telling GOP to ' drop dead ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 5 , 2008
Print This Email This
The news that president - elect Barack Obama has offered the position of White House chief of staff to Congressman Rahm Emanuel has generally drawn praise as a canny political move .
However , former Rep. Joe Scarborough disagrees strongly , calling Emanuel " a harsh partisan " and saying on Wednesday that if he accepts the post it would be a " horrible symbol " for Republicans .
Scarborough got into a dust - up over Emanuel with the guests on his MSNBC program , beginning when Time editor Mark Haperin suggested that Obama will be " in a very strong position " when it comes to dealing with Congress because Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are " nice people ... but they 're not the strongest figures in the world . "
" Obama understands legislatures , " Halperin explainued , " and he 's not going to make the mistakes the way Bill Clinton did .
...
The danger you 're talking about -- going too left , letting Congress run roughshod over him -- I do not think 's going to happen .
...
He 's now ... offered the chief of staff job to your friend Rahm Emanuel -- I think a very shrewd move . "
According to Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post , before being elected to Congress , " Emanuel built a reputation as one of the savviest political minds in the party and also one of the most confrontational and sharp elbowed .
His tactics and approach earned him the name ' Rahmbo . ' ...
In pursuing Emanuel , Obama is also sending a message to Capitol Hill that he recognizes the need to work with them by selecting one of their own but that he also will not be afraid to play tough . "
Scarborough , however , apparently did not see the choice of Emanuel as a signal to Congressional Democrats that Obama intends to work with them while keeping the upper hand but rather as a slap in the face to Republicans hoping for a bipartisan approach .
" I do n't think that 's a shrewd move , " Scarborough complained .
" I respect Rahm politically ... [ but ] that is a very bad sign for a united America because Rahm Emanuel is all brass knuckles .
... Barack Obama , if he selects him , has just sent a message to Republicans , ' Drop dead . ' "
" It is a horrible , horrible symbol ... to people that believe that Barack Obama 's going to reach out to the center and to Republicans , " continued Scarborough .
He insisted that " they needed a Tom Daschle " -- referring to the mild - mannered former Senate Majority Leader who was an early Obama supporter .
It was not clear whether Scarborough was sincere in his objections to Emanuel or simply attempting to sow discord as he brushed aside his guests ' objections that Emanuel is a " centrist " and a member of the Democratic Leadership Council .
Former Tennesee Rep. Harold Ford asserted , " Rahm would give him , give the president a credibility with Democrats .
He could stand up to them on things that he 's going to have to stand up to them on .
... Look at the candidates that Rahm recruited to win in ' 06 .
These were moderate , conservative Democrats .
...
You want in a chief of staff somebody who can help push your agenda through . "
" That 's crap , " retorted Scarborough .
" Rahm Emanuel is a harsh partisan .
...
This is a very clear signal to Republicans , ' Duck , because change means we 're just changing administrations .' ...
For people that do n't know Rahm Emanuel , this would be the equivalent of a Republican putting Tom DeLay in ... as chief of staff . "
" Tom DeLay was not personal friends with a single Democrat in the caucus , " Halperin countered .
" Not one .
And Rahm has got close friendships with lots of Republicans -- and that 's one way stuff gets done in Washington . "
" I 'm trying to come to terms with the new America , " Scarborough concluded sourly .
" Yes We Can -- beat the hell out of Republicans . "

Introduction
. NET Remoting is available since beginning of .NET intoduction .
It ’s time to get to know it well eventually .
I hope this topic will help you with this .
This document has many samples attached .
It was decided not to overload one project with all features at once .
Even though only couple lines should be changed for switching from one final application to another , there will be a separate solution to avoid text like “ // uncomment this to gain that ” .
All samples are introduced with Visual Studio 2003 solutions .
So , you should be able to open them with VS2005 and VS2008 .
Sometimes objects on pictures wo n’t have numbers even though those will be referred as “ second ” or “ fifth ” .
I will use such numbering with rules to count from top to bottom and from left to right .

1 . What is .NET Remoting ?
“ .NET Remoting ” are means in .NET Framework for 2 applications to interact over network ( e.g. withing 1 PC , within LAN or even worldwide ) .
Also , in .NET we have ability to run several Application Domains in one process .
. NET Remoting is the way to interact between these Domains .
There are 2 common types of protocols used in .NET Remoting : tcp for binary stream and http for SOAP stream .
Here in this article all samples will use binary channels , tcp .
It requires less traffic load and better performance as there is no overhead with XML parsing .
For our production projects it is a big plus .
As usual for distributed applications , there is a Server and a Client application .
In .NET Remoting we can have as many clients as we want , and all those Client applications can use the same Server .
.NET remoting is not just a socket with low level methods .
It is framework where you can work remotely with classes with ability to invoke methods , to pass custom types as parameters and get them as return values , to throw Exceptions between processes , to pass Callback delegates and have them invoked later remotely , to do asynchronous calls .
2. Simple project to show .
NET Remoting
Remoting interaction requires :
1 ) service type description that is available for both points on interaction
2 ) point # 1 – host ( e.g. Server ) that holds the instantiated remoting object of our service type
3 ) point # 2 – client application that can connect to Server and use remoting object
Now , let ’s take a look at picture below .
You can see two separate processes .
Server is holding a real instance of MyService .
This instance can be used by other processes over .
NET Remoting .
Client process is not instantiating the instance of MyService .
It just has some transparent proxy .
When Client application invokes methods of MyService proxy , the proxy redirects those calls to .NET Remoting Layer in Client process .
That remoting layer knows where to send such call – so , call goes over network ( e.g. over . NET Remoting channel ) right to our remoted Server process .
After that Remoting layer on Server side knows if it should use already existing instance of MyService or create new one .
It depends on type of activations .
Activation types can be configured in *.xml config file or through code .
All this will be described later in this article .
You may find “ Simple Remoting ” solution in downloads .
It consists of three core projects .
Almost all samples in this article will have them :
1 ) ONXCmn - class library with definition of MyService type
2 ) ONXServer – executable console application that hosts MyService service .
3 ) ONXClient – executable console application that shows how to use remoted MyService sevice .
You can start as many Client applications as you want .
All of them will be served by single Server application .
You can not start several Servers at the same time though .
This is because there is a port to listen for remote Client applications .
You cannot initiate several socket listeners on the same network card and the same port .
Also , I would like to pay your attention at Log and Utils classes .
They will be used with all samples .
You will find Log useful to print timestamp with each print out .
Also , it prints id of current thread – so we can easily see if the same thread was used for group of actions or not .
As for Utils class , it dumps information about all registered remoting service and client types .
It helps you to catch some misconfiguration in case something is not working :
static void Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes ()
public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { public MyService ( ) { Log. Print ( " Instance of MyService is created " ) ; } public string func1 ( ) { Log. Print ( " func1 ( ) is invoked " ) ; return " MyService.func1 ( ) " ; } }
Here we describe our remoting type – MyService .
It must be derived from MarshalByRefObject .
This parent class tells our MyService class not to be sent by value – it is referred by reference only .
Our MyService has only one service method – “ string func1 ( ) ” .
Whenever we invoke “ func1 ( ) ” we print log message and return value .
As you may guess , we instantiate MyService object in Server application and use it from Client application .
That is why we should expect log message to appear in Server console and not in Client one .
The same about MyService ( ) constructor .
Log message about object creation should appear in Server console .
Now , Server class :
class MyServer { [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXServer.exe.config " ) ; Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes( ) ; Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press EXIT to stop MyService host ... " ) ; } }
It might surprise you if you really see .NET Remoting for first time .
There is nothing specific and complex here .
Why is it working ?
The “ Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes ( ) ” is simply invoked to print registered .NET services .
The “ Log.WaitForEnter ( .. ) ” is just user prompt to press ENTER to close our console application .
So , the only line of code that really turns our regular console application into .
NET Remoting Server is “ RemotingConfiguration .
Configure ( " ONXServer.exe.config " ) ” .
This method reads *.xml file and has enough information from there to start socket listener on some port and to wait for requests from remote Client applications !
This is nice approach as you can change behavior of your application without need to change and recompile our code .
Now , let ’s take a look at this configuration file :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyServiceUri " mode = " SingleCall " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
Remoting is configured inside < configuration >< system.runtime.remoting >< application > section .
This is true for both Server and Client configuration ( yes , Client is also configured through *.xml file ) .
For Server we have < service > section that might have one or more < wellknown > sections .
This wellknown section is the place where you describe your service to be available for Client applications .
There are 3 attributes for it :
1 ) full type description – describes , what type to instantiate when we get request for this welknown type from Client .
Full type value consists of type name with full namespace path and after comma there is the name of assembly where this type is .
2 ) objectUri – this is unique name that Client application will be requesting by .
Client application usually requests service by “ URI ” and not by direct type name .
You will know why when you get to “ 6 .
Hide Implementation from Client . Remoting via Interface exposure ” topic .
3 ) This parameter may be either “ SingleCall ” or “ Singleton ” .
In case of “ SingleCall ” every method call that comes from any Client is served by newly created instance of MyService .
In “ Singleton ” configuration ALL calls from ALL client applications are served by single instance of MyService object .
If you have several services that should be registered in our application , list “ wellknown ” sections one after another inside “ service ” section .
Also , beside from “ service ” section there is “ channels ” section .
Here we might have several channels defined .
In our sample we have only “ tcp ” channel defined .
It will be listening on port 33000 .
Now , let ’s take a look at Client configuration :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " /> </ client > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
You may notice pretty much similarity between Server and Client configurations .
The difference is that in Client configuration we have “ < client /> ” section instead of “ < service /> ” .
It makes application understand that when we create instance of MyService we actually want to request this class remotely .
Also , wellknown section has “ url ” attribute that will connect to “ localhost ” machine to port 33000 and request named service with URI MyServiceUri.
Attribute “ type ” says application to use this remoting whenever Client application code tries to instantiate the MyService object on client side .
So , no actual instance of MyService is created in Client application .
We only create Proxy that knows where to send our call requests whenever we call some method .
And finally here is Client application :
class MyClient { [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes ( ) ; MyService myService = new ONX.Cmn.MyService ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService.func1 ( ) returned { 0} " , myService.func1 ( ) ) ; Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press ENTER to exit ... " ) ; } }
As you see it is as simple as Server console application .
You simply call “ RemotingConfiguration .
Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ” to register our MyService type correctly .
Then you dump information about all remote types that were registered so far .
After that you create “ instance ” on MyService .
As you understand now , there will be only transparent proxy created .
And then you call “ MyService.func1 ( ) ” method .
This call will go to Server application , get return value from there , deliver it to Client application and print in our log on Client side .
Here is what we get in Server and in Client consoles for our sample :
SERVER : [ 1812 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:15.595 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( BEGIN )--------- [ 1812 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:15.595 ]
WellKnownServiceTypeEntry : type='ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn ' ; objectUri=MyServiceUri ; mode=SingleCall [ 1812 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:15.595 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( END ) --------- [ 1812 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:15.595 ]
Press EXIT to stop MyService host ... [ 5068 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.876 ]
Instance of MyService is created [ 5068 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.876 ] func1 ( ) is invoked
CLIENT : [ 7388 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.736 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( BEGIN )--------- [ 7388 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.798 ]
WellKnownClientTypeEntry : type='ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn ' ; url=tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri [ 7388 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.798 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( END ) --------- [ 7388 ] [ 2008/10/05 21:30:20.892 ] myService.func1 ( ) returned MyService.func1 ( )
You can see that Instance of Service is created in Server application even though we have “ new MyService ( ) ” in Client application code !
3. Configuration file and configuration in code
All configurations that were performed for our “ Simple Remoting ” solution can be done through code without need to have additional *.xml configuration file .
Sometimes it is easier to have it in code , but it makes harder to do quick adjustments or modifications to configuration .
That is why in our article I will continue to use *.xml files as this is easier to read also .
But for security or any other reasons still you may store configuration in some files or in database , and then teach your application to read that configuration data and register remoting types inside of your code if you wish .
As a brief example here is code that makes the same configuration as we have for our Client application in “ Simple Remoting ” sample in previous topic :
//RemotingConfiguration .Configure( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; RemotingConfiguration.RegisterWellKnownClientType( typeof( MyService ) , " tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " ) ;
You may want to check MSDN to get more details on .NET Remoting configuration in code .
4 . Types of remote object activation
There are 3 types of activation of remote objects : 2 types of Server Side Activation and 1 type of Client Side Activation :
1 ) Server Side Singleton - Object is created on Server when first request comes from one of Client applications .
Nothing happens on a Server when you " create " instance in your Client application .
Server acts only when Client application invokes first method of remote object .
In Singleton mode all Client applications share SINGLE instance of remote object that is created on Server .
Even if you create several objects in Client application , still they use the same single object from Server application .
2 ) Server Side SingleCall - Object is created for EACH method call .
So , it does not matter how many Client applications are running .
Every method call from any Client application has this life - cycle :
- Server creates new instance of remote object
- Server invokes requested method against newly created remote object
- Server releases the remote object .
So , now the remote object is available for Garbage Collection .
3 ) Client Side Activation - Object is created in Server application with every " new " operator that is in Client application .
Client application has full control over this remote object and does NOT share it with other Client applications .
Also , if you create 2 or more remote objects in your Client application - yes , there will be created the exact number of remote objects in Server application .
After that you may work with each instance individually as you would do without .NET remoting involved .
The only issue here is Lease Time that might destroy your remote object on Server application earlier than you expect .
See “ 5 . What is Lease Time ?
How to control it ? ”
For Server Activation
Object you will need to register “ well known type ” .
For Client Activation
Object you will need to register “ activated type ” .
Let take a look at each type of activation closer .
4.1 . Server Side Object Activation .
Singleton
In this type of activation no object is created on a Server until first call comes from one of Clients .
It does not matter how many calls are coming after object is created .
It does not matter how many Client applications are trying to use our Server object – all such calls are directed to single remote object , e.g. “ Instance of MyService ” on a picture below .
Also , I would like to pay your attention that even though you request several instances of MyService in Client application ( see myService1 and myService2 on picture ) those 2 variables will still point to single TransparentProxy in Client process .
This is because for “ wellknown ” type one proxy per process is enough with either “ Server Activation Object ” model .
If Lease Time is expired , Singleton might be destroyed on Server .
In this case with new request from Client application new Singleton is created and is used in the same way – e.g.
Single object for all Clients requests .
See “ 5 . What is Lease Time ?
How to control it ? ”
To use this type of activation you should configure server with well - known type like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyServiceUri " mode = " Singleton " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
And client configuration like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " /> </ client > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
As for sample , locate “ SAO Singleton ” solution .
With client code :
class MyClient { [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes( ) ; string result ; // create myService1 Log.WaitForEnter ( "1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... " ) ; MyService myService1 = new MyService ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService1 created .
Proxy ? { 0} " , ( RemotingServices. IsTransparentProxy(myService1 ) ? " YES " : " NO " ) ) ; //query myService1.func1( ) Log.WaitForEnter ( "2 ) Press ENTER to query 1 - st time ... " ) ; result = myService1.func1 ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService1.func1 ( ) returned { 0} " , result ) ; //query myService1.func2 ( ) Log.WaitForEnter ( "3 ) Press ENTER to query 2 - nd time ... " ) ; result = myService1.func2 ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService1.func2 ( ) returned { 0} " , result ) ; //create myService2 Log.WaitForEnter ( "4 ) Press ENTER to create another instance of Remote Service ... " ) ; MyService myService2 = new MyService ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService2 created .
Proxy ? { 0} " , ( RemotingServices. IsTransparentProxy(myService2 ) ? " YES " : " NO " ) ) ; //query myService2.func1( ) Log.WaitForEnter ( "5 ) Press ENTER to query from our new Remote Service ... " ) ; Log. Print ( " myService2.func1 ( ) returned { 0} " , myService2.func1 ( ) ) ; Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press ENTER to exit ... " ) ; } }
We get
SERVER : [ 4424 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:52.369 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=1 [ 4424 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:52.369 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=1 [ 4424 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:53.056 ] func2 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=1 [ 4424 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:54.556 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=1
CLIENT : >1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... [ 7076 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:51.416 ] myService1 created .
Proxy ?
YES 2 ) Press ENTER to query 1 - st time ... [ 7076 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:52.400 ] myService1.func1 ( ) returned MyService #1.func1 ( )
3 ) Press ENTER to query 2 - nd time ... [ 7076 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:53.056 ] myService1.func2 ( ) returned MyService #1.func2 ( )
4 ) Press ENTER to create another instance of Remote Service ... [ 7076 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:53.650 ] myService2 created .
Proxy ?
YES 5 ) Press ENTER to query from our new Remote Service ... [ 7076 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:31:54.556 ] myService2.func1 ( ) returned MyService #1.func1 ( )
Here in this sample only 1 MyService instance was created on Server side .
It served all 3 calls even though 2 calls came from myService1 and 1 call from myService2 .
4.2 . Server Side Object Activation .
SingleCall
As for creation of object on a Server side , we have the same situation – no object is created with “ new MyService ( ) ” on a Client application .
But as soon as you invoke ANY method in Client code , the invocation is directed to Server application .
The .NET Remoting creates NEW instace for each such query .
As you can see on a picture below , there were 5 invocations sent from 2 Client applications .
It made .NET Remting create 5 instances of MyService .
Each of instances was used only once – for single call .
Pay attention that “ Instance of MyService ” # 3 and # 5 were for the same created with the same call of “ myService1.func1 ( ) ” , but still .NET Remoting created a separate instance for each call .
Single Trasparent Proxy is created for all MyService objects in Client application ( see second Client ) .
To use this type of activation you should configure server with well - known type like you did for SSA Singleton .
The only difference is that mode should be set to “ SingleCall ” :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyServiceUri " mode = " SingleCall " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
Client configuration is absolutely the same as for SSA Singleton :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " /> </ client > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
As for sample , locate “ SAO SingleCall ” solution .
SERVER : >[ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:21:57.662 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=1 [ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:21:57.662 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=1 [ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:00.381 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=2 [ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:00.381 ] func2 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=2 [ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:04.849 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=3 [ 3472 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:04.849 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=3
CLIENT : 1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... [ 7252 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:21:54.209 ] myService1 created .
Proxy ?
YES 2 ) Press ENTER to query 1 - st time ... [ 7252 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:21:57.693 ] myService1.func1 ( ) returned MyService #1.func1 ( )
3 ) Press ENTER to query 2 - nd time ... [ 7252 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:00.381 ] myService1.func2 ( ) returned MyService #2.func2 ( )
4 ) Press ENTER to create another instance of Remote Service ... [ 7252 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:02.756 ] myService2 created .
Proxy ?
YES 5 ) Press ENTER to query from our new Remote Service ... [ 7252 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:22:04.849 ] myService2.func1 ( ) returned MyService#3.func1 ( )
In our sample the “ id ” is the unique id of each instance of MyService object that is created on Server side .
As you can see , we have as many instances created in SERVER app as number of calls ( e.g. 2 calls for myService1 and 1 call for myService2 – in sum we got 3 ) .
Also , according to timestamps you may conclude that MyService is created right with “ func # ( ) ” call .
4.3 . Client Side Activation
This is pretty nice type of activation to have as it makes you to work with object like “ there is no remoting at all ” .
You have distinct instance of object created for each of your “ new ” operator .
Your instance is created remotely on a Server and it is never shared with other Client applications .
So , for Client application this type of activation is very close to use case when you create object is a regular way , without .NET Remoting involved .
myService , myService1 and myService2 are real 3 objects that were instantiated on Server and transparently used by Client applications .
Pay attention that among 3 types of activation described this is the only one where we have more than one proxy created for Client # 2 .
This is because number of proxies will be equal to number of remote objects that your Client application has created so far .
To use this type of activation you should configure server with “ < activated />” section , not with well - known type :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < activated type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
Client configuration also uses “ < activated />” section :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client url=" tcp://localhost:33000 " >
< activated type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " /> </ client > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
Pay attention that “ url ” parameter is specified in “ < client /> ” section with this type of activation .
There is no need for objectURI here as .NET Remoting will know what type to use .
Also , Leasing expiration is involved in this activation type .
See
As for sample , locate “ CAO ” solution .
I wo n’t present text of Client code as it is the same as for 2 tests from above .
The only change is configuration that controls the type of activation .
Now , we get
SERVER : >[ 6956 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:47.075 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=3 [ 6956 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:49.918 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=3 [ 6956 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:52.559 ] func2 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=3 [ 6956 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:54.965 ]
Instance of MyService is created , MyService.id=4 [ 6956 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:57.231 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , MyService.id=4
CLIENT : 1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... [ 2280 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:47.090 ] myService1 created .
Proxy ?
YES 2 ) Press ENTER to query 1 - st time ... [ 2280 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:49.918 ] myService1.func1 ( ) returned MyService#3.func1 ( )
3 ) Press ENTER to query 2 - nd time ... [ 2280 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:52.559 ] myService1.func2 ( ) returned MyService#3.func2 ( )
4 ) Press ENTER to create another instance of Remote Service ... [ 2280 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:54.965 ] myService2 created .
Proxy ?
YES 5 ) Press ENTER to query from our new Remote Service ... [ 2280 ] [ 2008/10/05 22:38:57.231 ] myService2.func1 ( ) returned MyService#4.func1 ( )
In this sample MyService instances created on Server side right at the time that Client application code hits “ new MyService ( ) ” command .
You can see some delay in creation of myService1 ( 15 ms ) .
This is because this was first call from our Client application to Server .
It required establishing physical network connection between our applications and did all other hidden .
NET Remoting handshakes .
As for myService2 it was created right at the same millisecond .
Also , as you can see , each of our myService# on Client side was served with corresponding MyService instance on Server side .
5 . What is Lease Time ?
How to control it ?
In case of interprocess coordination Server does not know if Client is still going to use object or not .
The easiest way for remoting object in Server application is to count how much time has passed since object was created or since last time when some Client used the object ( e.g. made some method invocation ) .
There are means to set lease time through configuration files ( showed below ) and through code :
using System ; using System .
Runtime .
Remoting .Lifetime ; ... LifetimeServices.LeaseTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes ( 30 ) ; LifetimeServices.RenewOnCallTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes ( 30 ) ; LifetimeServices.LeaseManagerPollTime = TimeSpan.FromMinutes ( 1 ) ;
LeaseTime – is initial lease time span for AppDomain .
RenewOnCallTime - the amount of time by which the lease is extended every time when call comes in on the server object .
LeaseManagerPollTime - the time interval between each activation of the lease manager to clean up expired leases .
See MSDN for details .
Here is how it works .
For each server object we can get CurrentLeaseTime time from Lease helper .
This CurrentLeaseTime is how much time left for object to live .
There is a .NET Remoting LeaseManager that wakes up periodically and checks every available server object in Server application .
With each check it reduces the CurrentLeaseTime for each checked object .
If object is expired then its reference is removed and that object is marked for GC to be collected .
Every time when remote call comes for server object , this object ’s CurrentLeaseTime is set to RenewOnCallTime time span .
Take a look at “ Lease Time ” solution .
As you can see it uses Server Activation in Singleton mode .
It should make all Clients and all MyService objects in Clients ’ application use the same instance of MyService that is on Server .
But we configured lease time to be only 5 seconds :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > ... < lifetime leaseTime = " 5S " renewOnCallTime = " 5S " leaseManagerPollTime = " 1S " /> </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
It makes .NET Remoting mark remoted object for garbage collection until 5 seconds passed with no queries from any Client :
1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... [ 5044 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:17:47.442 ] myService1 created .
Proxy ?
YES 2 ) Press ENTER to query 1 - st time ... [ 5044 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:17:48.552 ] myService1.func1 ( ) returned MyService#4.func1 ( )
3 ) Press ENTER to query 2 - nd time ... [ 5044 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:18:03.334 ] myService1.func2 ( ) returned MyService#5.func2 ( )
4 ) Press ENTER to create another instance of Remote Service ... [ 5044 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:18:04.099 ] myService2 created .
Proxy ?
YES 5 ) Press ENTER to query from our new Remote Service ... [ 5044 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:18:04.990 ] myService2.func1 ( ) returned MyService#5.func1 ( )
See “ 3 ) ” in output .
As you can see , we were waiting too long ( e.g. > 5 seconds ) before we invoked query 2 - nd time .
It made Server forget about MyService # 4 and create new one – MyService # 5 .
After that in “ 5 ) ” we invoked func1 ( ) within 2 seconds and it was using MyService # 5 as it was not expired yet on Server side .
Here we start our Client application again and press ENTER continuously with no delays .
As you can see , all three invokes use the same MyService instance :
1 ) Press ENTER to create Remote Service ... [ 5380 ] [ 2008/10/01 14:30:39.355 ] myService1 created .

We can also make our remoting object never expire .
In order to do so we will need to override one of the MarshalByRefObject methods and make it return “ null ” :
public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { ... public override object InitializeLifetimeService ( ) { return null ; } }
If you add such override to LeaseTime solution , you will see that even though we waited too long and have < lifetime > parameter specified in configuration – our MyService is not expired and reused for all calls :

There is also “ sponsoring ” mechanism that allows customizing the lease time according application needs .
You can read “ sponsors ” topic in MSDN to get more information on this .
6. Hide Implementation from Client .
Remoting via Interface exposure
It is not always a good idea to expose to the world the implementation of your remoting object .
This is due to security reasons and due to size of assembly that has complex implementation .
Also , implementation can use some other assemblies that you would not want to deploy to client computers .
In this case it is a good idea to split our MyService class into :
1 ) interface that we will expose to client
2 ) and to the implementation itself .
At this point we can put out types into separate assemblies and deliver only small part to client computer :
Then during delivery we need to put only small part of product on Client computers :
You may find “ Hide Implementation from Client app ” solution to see how it is implemented .
The idea is to request remote type by Uri and cast returned object to interface .
On a server side such Uri request will instantiate our real implementation that is defined in ServerLib assembly .
Server configuration :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.
Server .MyService , ONXServerLib " objectUri=" MyServiceUri " mode = " Singleton " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
Client configuration ( no need to define wellknown type here ) :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > </ configuration >
Client code to access MyService through IMyService :
IMyService myService1 = Activator.GetObject ( typeof ( IMyService ) , " tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " ) as IMyService ; string result = myService1.func1 ( ) ;
Note , that there is no way to use Client Activation Object if you decide to go with hiding implementation behind interface .
This is because you need to _instantiate_ object of class in client side for Client Side activation .
But you do n’t have type information on client side – only interface .
So , you can do this only with well known type definition ( e.g. Server Activation Object ) .
7. Custom types as parameters and return values
If you want to pass your own types as parameters to methods of remoted objects …
If you want to get such types as results of functions …
The only thing that you should do is to make your type serializable .
This is easy – just add [ Serailizable ] attribute for your type description .
Note , if your type has members of custom types , those included types should be also serializable .
As for standard types like int , double , string , ArrayList and so on – most of them are already serializable .
See “ Custom Types ” solution with example :
[ Serializable ] public class MyContainer { private string str_ ; private int num_ ; public MyContainer ( string str , int num ) { str_ = str ; num_ = num ; } public string Str { get{ return str_;} } public int Num { get{ return num_ ;} }</p> public override string ToString ( ) { return string .
Format ( " MyContainer [str= \ " {0}\ " , num={1} ] " , Str , Num ) ; } } public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { public MyContainer func1 ( MyContainer param ) { Log. Print ( " func1 ( ) is invoked , got { 0} " , param ) ; return new MyContainer ( " abc " , 123 ) ; } }
With this Client code
class MyClient { [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { MyService myService = new MyService ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService created .
Proxy ? { 0} " , ( RemotingServices. IsTransparentProxy(myService ) ? " YES " : " NO " ) ) ; MyContainer container1 = new MyContainer ( " From Client " , 555 ) ; MyContainer container2 = myService.func1(container1 ) ; Log. Print ( " myService.func1 ( ) returned { 0} " , container2 ) ; } }
it will give you such Server output :
[ 3660 ] [ 2008/10/03 10:05:27.970 ] func1 ( ) is invoked , got MyContainer [ str= " From Client " , num=555 ]
and such Client output :
[ 2696 ] [ 2008/10/03 10:05:27.892 ] myService created .
Proxy ?
YES [ 2696 ] [ 2008/10/03 10:05:27.970 ] myService.func1 ( ) returned MyContainer [ str= " abc " , num=123 ]
8. Custom exceptions through remoting channel
There are no limitations on throwing standard Exception class as it already has everything that is needed .
As for custom exceptions here is the list of required TODOs :
1 ) General rule :
All custom exceptions should drive from Exception class or it ’s descentants .
2 ) It must have [ Serializable ] attribute for class
3 ) It must have constructor
MyException ( SerializationInfo info , StreamingContext context )
4 ) It must override
void GetObjectData( SerializationInfo info , StreamingContext context )
5 ) If your custom exception has some members , those should be taken care to write and read to / from stream .
Here is our custom exception from “ Exceptions ” solution :
[ Serializable ] public class MyException : ApplicationException { private string additionalMessage_ ; public MyException ( string message , string additionalMessage ) : base ( message ) { additionalMessage_ = additionalMessage ; } public MyException ( SerializationInfo info , StreamingContext context ) : base ( info , context ) { additionalMessage_ = info.
GetString ( " additionalMessage " ) ; } public override void GetObjectData( SerializationInfo info , StreamingContext context ) { base .
GetObjectData ( info , context ) ; info .
AddValue ( " additionalMessage " , additionalMessage_ ) ; } public string Additional Message { get{ return additional Message_;} } }
We save our member data in “ GetObjectData ( … ) ” method .
During deserialization we restore this value in constructor with SerializationInfo as parameter .
With this MyService implementation :
public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { public void func1 ( ) { throw new MyException ( " Main text for custom ex " , " Additional text " ) ; } public void func2 ( ) { throw new Exception ( " Main text for standard ex " ) ; } }
We simply try to throw both our custom exception and starndard one .
Having such Client implementation :
class MyClient { [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; MyService myService = new MyService ( ) ; try { myService.func1 ( ) ; } catch ( MyException ex ) { Log. Print ( " Caught MyException : message= \ " {0}\ " , add.msg= \ " { 1}\ " " , ex. Message , ex.AdditionalMessage ) ; } try { myService.func2 ( ) ; } catch ( Exception ex ) { Log. Print ( " Caught Exception : message= \ " {0}\ " " , ex. Message ) ; } Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press ENTER to exit ... " ) ; } }
We get output ( stripped ) :
[ 15:09:39.380 ] Caught MyException : message = " Main text for custom ex " , add.msg = " Additional text " [ 15:09:39.380 ]
Caught Exception : message = " Main text for standard ex "
If we comment out saving and restoring of additional Message field in MyException class – after deserialization we will get default string value .
So , no error will be generated but not full state restoring .
If we comment out [ Serializable ] attribute , we will get runtime exception .
9. Events in .NET Remoting
Imagine use case .
Our remoting object is instantiated in Server .
In regular use case Client applications use remoting object by invoking its methods .
What if you want it to invoke some callback method that is resided inside Client application ?
You might prepare some information for Client and wait for client application to use polling mechanism and to call some remote object method periodically like “ Information [ ] MyService.IsThereSomeInfoForMe ( ) ” .
But actually we can use event mechanism .
There are some refinements though :
1 ) Server application should have runtime type information about type that holds callback method .
2 ) This callback method should be public and cannot be static
3 ) To avoid Server to wait and make sure that callback got recipient , we have to mark callback with [ OneWay ] attribute .
It makes us unable to return some data neither through “ return ” value nor through “ ref ” of “ out ” parameters .
4 ) As instance of this type will instantiated on Client side and will be used on Server side , it should derive from MarshalByRejObject class .
Take a look at “ Events ” solution .
All these limitations make us to introduce some even sink and define it in Cmn assembly so it is available for both Server and Client application :
public class EventSink : MarshalByRefObject { public EventSink ( ) { } [ System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging .OneWay ] public void EventHandlerCallback ( string text ) { } public void Register ( MyService service ) { service .
EventHandler += new OnEventHandler ( EventHandlerCallback ) ; } public void Unregister ( MyService service ) { service .
EventHandler -= new OnEventHandler( EventHandlerCallback ) ; } }
As we want this sink to actually invoke our callback , we cannot use polymorphism and override some of methods in derived class that would be defined inside code of our Client application .
This will violate rule # 1 from above – Server will need to know our type .
So we use delegation mechanism and pass our Client ’s callback to EvenSink as constructor parameter .
Here is full code for EventSink class :
public class EventSink : MarshalByRefObject { private OnEventHandler handler_ ; public EventSink ( OnEventHandler handler ) { handler_ = handler ; } [ System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging .OneWay ] public void EventHandlerCallback ( string text ) { if ( handler_ != null ) { handler_ ( text ) ; } } public void Register ( MyService service ) { service .
EventHandler += new OnEventHandler ( EventHandlerCallback ) ; } public void Unregister ( MyService service ) { service .
EventHandler -= new OnEventHandler( EventHandlerCallback ) ; } }
Also , since .
NET Framwork v1.1 there are security restriction on deserialization of some types .
In order to override default setting we need to set filterLevel to “ Full ” .
Here is full Server config file :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyServiceUri " mode = " Singleton " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port= " 33000 " > < serverProviders > < formatter ref=" binary " typeFilterLevel= " Full " /> </serverProviders > </ channel > </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
And Client configuration :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyServiceUri " /> </ client > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port= " 0 " > < clientProviders > < formatter ref=" binary " /> </clientProviders > < serverProviders > < formatter ref=" binary " typeFilterLevel= " Full " /> </serverProviders > </ channel > </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
It is also possible to configure this through code .
See MSDN for details .
Take a look at MyService class now .
public delegate void OnEventHandler ( string message ) ; public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { public event OnEventHandler EventHandler ; public string func1 ( ) { PublishEventAnfScheduleOneMore ( " Event from Server : func1 ( ) is invoked " ) ; return " MyService.func1 ( ) " ; } private void PublishEvent ( string message ) { if ( EventHandler != null ) { EventHandler ( message ) ; } } private void PublishEventAnfScheduleOneMore( string text ) { PublishEvent ( text ) ; Thread t = new Thread ( new ThreadStart ( PublishEventIn5Seconds ) ) ; t. Start ( ) ; } private void PublishEventIn5Seconds ( ) { Thread .
Sleep ( 5000 ) ; PublishEvent ( " 5 seconds passed from one of method calls " ) ; } }
As you can see we invoke callback immediately when some Client called “ MyService.func ( ) ” and also we do it one more time from separate thread after 5 seconds timeframe .
It was done for testing purposes to show that events can be invoked at any time ( e.g. not even to answer on call invocation ) .
We span a separate thread and return control to Client that invoked “ func1 ( ) ” .
And then , after 5 seconds our spanned thread will raise event for all registered event handlers .
Once Client registers its event handler - it will get ALL events from Server .
Here is stripped code for our Client application .
Full version is available in “ Events ” solution :
class MyClient { private MyService myService_ ; private EventSink sink_ ; public MyClient ( ) { // create proxy to remote MyService myService_ = new ONX.Cmn.MyService ( ) ;</p> // create event sink that can be invoked by MyService sink_ = new EventSink ( new OnEventHandler( MyEventHandlerCallback ) ) ; //register event handler with our event sink //( after that event sink will invoke our callback ) sink_ .
Register ( myService_ ) ; } public void MyEventHandlerCallback ( string text ) { Log. Print ( " Got text through callback ! { 0} " , text ) ; } public void Test ( ) { Log. Print ( " myService.func1 ( ) returned { 0} " , myService_.func1 ( ) ) ; } [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; MyClient c = new MyClient ( ) ; c.Test ( ) ; Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press ENTER to exit ... " ) ; } }
And here is stripped output from one of test runs :
[ 5412 ] [ 09:43:55 ] myService.func1 ( ) returned MyService.func1 ( ) [ 5412 ] [ 09:43:55 ]
Press ENTER to exit ... [ 7724 ] [ 09:43:55 ]
Got … callback !
Event from Server : func1 ( ) is invoked [ 7724 ] [ 09:44:00 ]
Got … callback !
5 seconds passed from one of method calls
As you can see we got initial event right after call to “ func1 ( ) ” and then one more after 5 seconds .
Pay attention that callback functions were invoked on a separate thread .
So , if you need to synchronize some data access , beware .
10 . Asynchronous calls
This topic does not differ much from simple asynchronous calls without remoting .
Let ’s analyze “ Async Calls ” solution .
It has simple implementation of MyService :
public class MyService : MarshalByRefObject { public string func1 ( string text ) { Log. Print ( " func1 ( \" {0}\ " ) is invoked " , text ) ; return text +DateTime.Now.ToString (" HH:mm:ss.fff " ) ; } }
And here is the sample of how it is used in Client application :
delegate string GetStringHandler ( string arg ) ; class MyClient { private const int NUMBER_OF_INVOCATIONS = 5 ;</p> private static void OnCallEnded ( IAsyncResult ar ) { GetStringHandler handler = ( ( AsyncResult ) ar ) .
AsyncDelegate as GetStringHandler ; int index = ( int )ar.AsyncState ;</p> string result = handler .
EndInvoke( ar ) ; Log. Print ( " myService.func1 ( ) # {0} is done .
Result is \ " { 1}\ " " , index , result ) ; } [ STAThread ] static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { RemotingConfiguration .Configure ( " ONXClient.exe.config " ) ; MyService myService = new MyService ( ) ; Log. Print ( " myService created .
Proxy ? { 0} " , ( RemotingServices. IsTransparentProxy(myService ) ? " YES " : " NO " ) ) ; for ( int index=1 ; index <=NUMBER_OF_INVOCATIONS ;++index ) { Log. Print ( " Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # {0} ... " , index ) ; GetStringHandler handler = new GetStringHandler( myService.func1 ) ; handler .
BeginInvoke ( " from Client " , new AsyncCallback ( OnCallEnded ) , index ) ; } Log.WaitForEnter ( " Press ENTER to exit ... " ) ; } }
As you can see we loop 5 times in “ for ” .
With every iteration we create delegate that corresponds to prototype of “ MyService.func1 ” method and make asynchronous call with “ BeginInvoke ( … ) ” .
As we passed our “ OnCallEnded ” method as callback , when asynchronous invocation is done , we get control in our OnCallEnded method .
There we get reference to our delegate and get result by calling “ EndInvoke ( ar ) ” .
Here is example out output of Client application :
[ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.243 ] myService created .
Proxy ?
YES [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.243 ] Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # 1... [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.274 ] Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # 2 ... [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.274 ] Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # 3 ... [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # 4 ... [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] Invoking myService.func1 ( ) # 5 ... [ 0216 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ]
Press ENTER to exit ... [ 2248 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] myService.func1 ( ) # 2 is done .
Result is " from Client16:39:45.274 " [ 3868 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] myService.func1 ( ) # 1 is done .
Result is " from Client16:39:45.274 " [ 2248 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] myService.func1 ( ) # 3 is done .
Result is " from Client16:39:45.290 " [ 2248 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] myService.func1 ( ) # 5 is done .
Result is " from Client16:39:45.290 " [ 3868 ] [ 2008/10/03 16:39:45.290 ] myService.func1 ( ) # 4 is done .
Result is " from Client16:39:45.290 "
We were even lucky to get our 5 calls in order , that is different from original – call # 2 ends earlier than call # 1 .
The same about calls # 4 and # 5 .
Also notice , that not all calls were running in the same thread .
And all of them are different from thread where we initiated our 5 calls .
11 . Several Services in one Server . Several Server links from single Client app
All the samples in MSDN and internet that I reviewed were showing single Remoting Object type in Server application .
I was wonder how do we introduce several services in single Server .
And how do we use several Servers in single Client application .
It appeared to be not so hard , but still it better to see than to guess .
Let us analyze the case with 2 wellknown types on Server side :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < service > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService1 , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyService1 Uri " mode = " SingleCall " /> < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService2 , ONXCmn " objectUri=" MyService2Uri " mode = " SingleCall " /> </ service > < channels > < channel ref=" tcp " port = " 33000 " /> </ channels > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
You cannot :
1 ) Have several channels with the same protocol ( e.g. “ ref ” parameter ) .
Otherwise you will get exception that such protocol is already registered .
But you can specify several channels if they are for different protocols
2 ) Each known type should have unique objectUri .
Otherwise definition of types will be overlapped and only on of types will be available
For configuration from above our helper “ Utils.DumpAllInfoAboutRegisteredRemotingTypes ( ) ; ” method gives us :
[ 7496 ] [ 2008/10/05 00:01:04.047 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( BEGIN )--------- [ 7496 ] [ 2008/10/05 00:01:04.047 ]
WellKnownServiceTypeEntry : type='ONX.Cmn.MyService2 , ONXCmn ' ; objectUri=MyService2 Uri ; mode=SingleCall [ 7496 ] [ 2008/10/05 00:01:04.047 ]
WellKnownServiceTypeEntry : type='ONX.Cmn.MyService1 , ONXCmn ' ; objectUri=MyService1 Uri ; mode=SingleCall [ 7496 ] [ 2008/10/05 00:01:04.047 ]
ALL REGISTERED TYPES IN REMOTING -( END ) ---------
In our case Client configuration looks like :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < configuration > < system.runtime.remoting > < application > < client > < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService1 , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyService1Uri " /> < wellknown type = " ONX.Cmn.MyService2 , ONXCmn " url=" tcp://localhost:33000/MyService2Uri " /> </ client > </application > </system.runtime.remoting > </ configuration >
If we would want to use Services from different Servers , each Server would listen on different port .
So , there would be different port in each “ < wellknown / > ” section .
There is “ Two Services in single Server ” solution if you would like to try it for yourself .

Thank you for your time .
I hope it was spent with use .
Any comments are welcome .
I will try to adjust this article as soon as I have some comments and time .
Happy remoting !
Slimes.com ( the future of who knows what yet ? ) had the awesome opportunity to visit the World Slime Convention in the sweetest place on earth …
YES … Hershey PA !
What do you get when you mix a whole bunch of slimers , with Hershey ?
Well , tons of kids surrounded by two of the best things on the planet … Chocolate and Slime of course !
Being this was my family ’s first convention , I wanted to share how well organized , and obviously successful , that this meet - up really was .
My daughter , who found a love for slime about three years ago , and who has slowly faded out of interest , was simply ecstatic by all of the creators and fans of all of the “ artistic creation ” of slime .
I do n’t know how many people were actually there , but there certainly was a huge following .
