While men tend to be assertive with their employers regarding pay , women are more likely to leave their salary settlement unchallenged .
Find out more by reading Marilyn Davidson 's article below on what women should do now to win this battle of the sexes .
WHY WOMEN SHOULD THINK LIKE MEN Women managers earn about £ 13,500 less than the average male manager , according to the most recent research .
It 's been estimated that at the current rate of change it will be 187 years before women get the upper hand .
Despite a sexual revolution in terms of the number of females in the workplace in Britain , the idea seems to persist that men are the breadwinners and women bring up the children .
So men should earn more .
In the UK , the pay gap between full - time working women and their male counterparts has increased from 17 % to 17.1 % .
The gap is even greater for part - time workers .
FIND OUT MORE ...
The Trouble with Working Women is broadcast in the UK on 18 and 19 May at 2100 BST on BBC Two And the higher up the organisational ladder women climb , the more that gap becomes a chasm .
Women directors earn on average nearly a quarter less than men .
At this level there is not usually a set pay package - people are head - hunted and offered a particular salary .
Women at this level are much more likely to accept their original salary offer whereas men will ask for more .
They 'll ask for another £ 50,000 , knowing that they will probably get £ 25,000 .
When it comes to annual bonuses , women managers tend to get half of what their male counterparts receive - and that 's true in almost every country in the world .
In my work with business undergraduates I 've found that not only do the men expect to earn more than the women , they also think they deserve to earn even more than that .
£ 11 k expectation gap Every year I run a diversity and equality course , with up to 160 students .
Between a third and a quarter are men .
Do n't ask , do n't get :
Peggy confronts the boss in TV's Mad Men , and wins Before I start the first lecture I ask them two questions .
What do you expect to earn five years after graduation ?
What do you think you deserve to earn five years after graduation ?
I ask them to write down both answers and whether they are male or female .
Then I analyse each response .
I 've been doing this for about seven years , and every year there are massive differences between the male and female responses .
The male students expect to earn significantly more than the women , and when you look at what the students think they deserve to earn , again the differences are massive .
In terms of salary expectations , the male students expect about £ 52,000 a year and the women about £ 41,000 .
On average the men think they deserve £ 10,000 more a year than the women - that 's 25 % more than the women think they 're worth - a staggering figure .
If that 's what women think they deserve five years into their working career , you can see why after 20 years women are still earning substantially less .
I 've come across a similar recent American study which had exactly the same results .
Fear of feistiness I think this illustrates not only the fact that there is a disparity in what we pay men and women , but also that your expectations affect your behaviour and help sustain the status quo .
Women fear being aggressive and feisty but it 's more complex - men equate money with status and power , women see job satisfaction as more an issue
At the end of my course the male and female students say that little experiment had the most impact upon them , and will make them think about their attitudes to pay when they start work .
We tend to find that in interviews or assessments women are not as good at negotiating a higher salary or even bringing it up , or asking for it to be assessed , or even complaining because they suddenly realise that a male has been appointed who they know is earning more than them and doing the same job .
They 're also much less likely to ask for the perks that they actually deserve - like the bigger car or the bigger office .
Partly women fear being too aggressive and feisty - which can be viewed as negative in the workplace - but I think it 's more complex .
It is part of our conditioning that men equate money with status and power but women see job satisfaction as more of an issue .
And when they 're not being modest , women are caricatured as volatile Women are more likely than men to think , well , I 'm good at my job , so I will be noticed and promoted , and I will eventually get a pay rise .
Men , on the other hand , will go to their line manager and say they deserve a pay rise ... now .
I think there 's still a negative stereotype about female ambition .
But I think also , you know , pay is very complex ; it 's about secrecy , the fact that often people do n't know what their colleagues are earning and wo n't ask .
You still find gender segregation in the work place as well .
People seem to think the war is won but in reality the Equal Pay Act is past its sell by date because it really has n't had the impact that it should have had .
It 's not just about attitudes , but also about the fact that a lot of women still work predominantly with other women , but are often supervised or managed by men , even in professions like management .
A high proportion of women work in areas like HR , marketing , and nursing and they often get paid less than their male colleagues , because the men still dominate the senior positions .
Marilyn Davidson is a professor of work psychology at Manchester Business School .
Below is a selection of your comments .
What this demonstrates for me more than anything , aside from the gender issue , is that management in organisations everywhere is simply incapable of recognising the worth of employees , of implementing a fair meritocracy .
One wonders how much talent and potential are missed or underexploited as a result .
Their loss I guess .
It never fails to amaze me that organisations in this day and age allow the gender issue to be more important than the pragmatic goal of maximising their success .
I suppose at base all humans are essentially slightly - evolved animals following unconscious unreasoning prejudices .
Lucy Kelvin , Glasgow I fought as hard as I could for eight months to try to bring my pay up to the level of several male colleagues and to the level of my male predecessor when I was promoted into his post .
The pay rise never came .
Two male colleagues ( both already paid more than me ) asked ONCE for a rise and got it .
In my case , the problem was not that I acted differently to a man , but that my boss only took the men seriously .
I quit , as my only other option was a career - ending tribunal .
That 's the reality .
Susan Kane , Canterbury
If this is the case , businesses should definitely consider hiring more women as they are statistically cheaper .
David , UK
If you had two candidates for a job , both equally good the only difference being that the woman would do the job for £ 13 k less than the man , then any rational company should go for the " cheaper " candidate .
So it begs the question why companies employ men , as by the evidence in this article they expect to be overpaid - perhaps employing men is bad business sense ?
Nicola , London Imagine if you went to a car dealer and were shown two cars .
Both were identical , except , the dealer tells you , every now and again , one of the cars would be off the road for nine months .
Which car would you chose ?
You 'd either go for the car that is always roadworthy , or demand a discount to buy the other one .
And that is why women earn less than men : women give birth , and men do not .
A woman 's attitude and assertiveness has very little to do with it .
It is probably unhelpful to suggest otherwise .
Jody , London
This entire brouhaha is founded upon the ( erroneous in my view ) presumption that the most important aspect of a job is the level of salary .
Sure , over the population , men are paid more than women , but I 'd bet , over the population , that a higher percentage of women have good job satisfaction and are " happy in their work " than men .
So who 's " winning " ?
Not necessarily the men - it depends by what criteria one is measuring .
Mark Checkley , Birmingham , UK I think you 're right in saying that women rate job satisfaction higher than pay when looking at what they want to do with day to day lives .
Obviously we want to pay the bills and buy nice things but when you spend eight hours a day somewhere ( away from your children ) , we have to enjoy what we 're doing and be happy in the environment .
To me promotion just means longer hours and more stress all with very little thanks .
If you have no free time to enjoy the money you 're earning what 's the point ?
Emma , Oxford Very interesting .
It took me years before I realised it was possible to ask for a pay rise .
I thought that if I asked I 'd get fired .
Now I work for myself and can access research into what other people ( men and women ) doing similar work get paid , I still find it difficult to ask for what I feel I deserve .
I was shocked the other day to be told by a client that I was cheap , when I had got the impression that he though me expensive - so how did I get that so wrong ?
Do women misinterpret unspoken signals about their worth ?
Delia , Llandudno , Wales
How can a woman doing exactly the same job as a man , equally effectively , be paid £ 13 500 less ?
It 's illegal .
I suspect you 're comparing averages of nominally similar jobs , with absolutely no account of the level and content of the jobs taken into account .
This may point to the fact that women are n't occupying as many senior positions as men , but that 's a whole other issue .
Generally , comparing the salaries of jobs that have even a slight degree of difference is fraught with difficulty , let alone large differences , eg comparing a TV presenter to an MP to a GP .
( To take inspiration from a recent spat . )
If you 're going to look at gender pay and promotion differences seriously , you need to do it a lot more scientifically than has been done to date .
Jon Laughton , Olney , England I was self - employed for over 20 years , and eventually sold my business to a larger company who took me on as a manager overseeing my part of the company .
I discovered that I was the only female manager and was not invited to any manager meetings at head office , my salary was £ 10,000 a year less that the men and I did not have a company car or mobile phone as they did .
When I raised the subject with my immediate boss , he started to ignore me completely , talking to people that I was managing , would n't speak to me on the phone etc .
I eventually went to see the director , who called me a trouble maker , tried to belittle me by saying no one liked me and then in the following months tried to get rid of me by altering my pay package ( which had been agreed when I was bought out ) .
They made my life hell , and I kept a diary of everything that was going on and called Acas .
Unfortunately the stress became too much and I got a job elsewhere .
As a woman I can definitely say I have been on the bad side of sexual discrimination .
Ann Brown , Newcastle upon Tyne Ms Davidson takes a very macho view of the workplace : she thinks it 's ' all about the dosh ' .
Just because female ambition is different , why is that " negative " ?
The Equal Pay Act gave women the right to have the same deal as men , but maybe they looked at the rat - race with its long hours , its devotion to the job above all else and its destruction of the human spirit and said " no thanks " .
Meanwhile us men slave away with our eyes glued to a computer screen and our noses glued to the boss 's backside for 20 years till our wives see what empty , soulless shadows we have become and walk away ; taking kids , house , money and all , leaving the man with his salary and his drink problem .
You need a big salary to accept that deal .
Women are smarter than men .
Consciously or unconsciously , they say " no " .
Patrick Neylan , Orpington , Kent , UK £ 52,000 five years after graduation !
What planet are our students on ?
Not on Planet Science that 's for sure .
With a PhD and 32 years of experience in a biological research / university environment I am not earning £ 40,000 .
University lecturers are on about £ 35,000 .
Show me where I have gone wrong .
Garry Rucklidge , Aberdeen
There was a German study recently that found that women asking for a pay rise were regarded a lot more negatively by their bosses then men .
It 's not just the woman 's faults - it is the gender stereotyping by those on the receiving end .

Security experts say the technology protecting the grid has not kept pace
The US government has admitted the nation 's power grid is vulnerable to cyber attack , following reports it has been infiltrated by foreign spies .
The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) newspaper reported that Chinese and Russian spies were behind this " pervasive " breach .
It said software had been left behind that could shut down the electric grid .
" The vulnerability is something [ we ] have known about for years , " said US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
" We acknowledge that ... in this world , in an increasingly cyber world , these are increasing risks , " Ms Napolitano added .
She refused to comment on the WSJ story that an intrusion had taken place , but security experts said they were not surprised by the claims .
" There is a pretty strong consensus in the security community that the SCADA equipment , a class of technology that is used to manage critical infrastructure , has not kept pace with the rest of the industry , " said Dan Kaminsky , a cyber security analyst and director of penetration testing for IOActive .
" Software for desktops and the internet have been dealing with the issue of security for the last 10 years , and that has n't really come into the SCADA realm .
" From a geo-political standpoint , this has created an opening for skilled ' hostiles ' to obtain a presence in places we would rather they did n't have one . "
' Strategic thinking '
The WSJ reported that the intruders had not sought to damage the power grid or any other key infrastructure so far , but suggested they could change their approach in the event of a crisis or war .
A report last year said China had been accessing sensitive US databases Security watchers said that , if true , the involvement of the Chinese and Russians in such a scenario would show they were strategically thinking about how either to constrain the US or to inflict more damage if they felt a need to do so .
" I think that China recognises if in a very strategic sense you want to ensure you have the ability to exploit another country 's potential weakness or vulnerability , but do it in a way that is n't confrontational or cause an international crisis , then this is a very good way of doing that , " Eric Rosenbach , of Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government 's Belfer Center , told Reuters news agency .
The motives behind these potential attacks are undoubtedly military or political in nature , said Tim Mather , chief security strategist for the RSA Conference , the world 's biggest security event .
He told the BBC : " These countries are not doing this willy - nilly .
There is a tactical reason for all of this and no doubt tied to a longer term strategic plan which is gosh if they need to jerk the chain of the US , then this is the way to do it .
" This is like having an ace in the hole for the Chinese or Russians , just in case , " said Mr Mather .
' Top - to - bottom review '
In the coming weeks , a government review of cyber security is due to land on the desk of US President Barack Obama .
" The president takes the issue of cyber security very seriously , which is why he ordered a top - to - bottom review shortly after taking office , " said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro .
The Journal said intelligence officials brought the breaches to light
He added that the White House was not aware of " any disruptions to the power grid caused by deliberate cyber-activity here in the United States " .
Mississippi Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson , chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee , said he would introduce legislation to address weaknesses in the system .
" Our electric system is critical to our way of life , and we cannot afford to leave it vulnerable to attack .
Our oversight indicates there is a significant gap in current regulation to effectively secure the infrastructure , " he said .
The North American Electric Reliability Corp , the industry group with responsibility for grid reliability and security , said it was unaware of any cyber - attacks that had led to disruptions of service .
" NERC and industry leaders are taking steps in the right direction to improve preparedness and response to potential cyber threats .
There is definitely more to be done , " the group said in a statement .
" To date the number of people in the position to cause harm on SCADA has been thankfully relatively small , " Mr Kaminsky told the BBC .
" But however small , it is big enough to be a problem and a problem that can potentially turn the lights out and cause economic harm to our country .
The game is up , " he said .

We are really excited to share with you our initial concepts for a D7 .
Please take a look at the video above and there are LOTS of sketches and paper prototypes that you can explore over on the Flickr group as well .
In this video you ’ll see the three key aspects of the D7UX interaction model we are proposing :
the ‘ header ’ which will be displayed to users who are logged into the site , comprising of a ‘ global ’ header allowing access to all functionality ( permissions allowing ) , and a customisable / role based set of buttons allowing fast access to the most frequently used tasks ( eg. add / edit ) or views ( eg. find content ) .
the example shown in the video would be for a ‘ content creator ’ type role .
We have n’t completely thought through the application of this header down to the level of ‘ site member ’ ( eg. someone who adds discussions to the forum on the site you ’ve built using Drupal ) , but we think as a concept it has legs .

the ‘ overlay window ’ , the example of which shown is ‘ add content ’ ( in a very sketchy and unfinished state , I hasten to add ! ) .
We see the overlay as a fantastic way to provide a clean interface for these tasks whilst keeping the user in the context of the site for which they are performing those tasks , rather than taking them away into an ‘ admin section ’ .
Obviously we would need to allow for users who are not using JavaScript ( in which case they probably would have to go into more of an ‘ admin section ’ ) .

the ‘ in line editing ’ which will allow you to ‘ switch on ’ edit mode and edit content in place ( would n’t that be lovely ! ) .
Of course , not all content would be editable on the page so the edit view would also allow for a range of ‘ editors ’ to be launched into an overlay window .
We ’re imagining : block editors , content type editors , navigation editors , views editors as a start ( some of these terms will probably only make sense to Drupallers – apologies for that , will try to translate in future versions )
In the video we also show another idea that we are quite excited about , although we have a long way to go before it is entirely thought through … we ’re not entirely sure that it will work , but the problems we are facing with it seem to be getting easier not more difficult , which is a good sign …
You could think of this as a Direct Manipulation Tool for Site and Page Structuring .
It ’s been inspired by some of the tools that we ’ve used in the past to do Information Architecture work ( hence the use of that word in the initial header that is currently being CrowdTested , yes , it will most likely change ! ) .
The idea behind this tool is that we are able to make site building and page creation a much easier task for people who do n’t know and do n’t want to know the ins and outs of Drupal ’s technical architecture .
We ’re really excited by the potential this has for achieving our objective of allowing users who are not developers to build complex sites using Drupal … would love to hear what you think of it , and stay tuned for much more work on this component .
We ’re looking forward to pushing some of this out for more Crowd Testing very soon .
I ’d really encourage you , if you ’re concerned about what people will make of this , to get involved in the user research – go put it in front of people and find out for real what people do and what ’s usable or not .
I ’ll post another set of materials and scripts for CrowdSourcedUsabilityTesting very soon !
Ok .
So , there you have it .
We ’ll just wait here , nervously and excited , whilst you have a look ….
then , please , tell us how you like it so far !
Some people live in romantic ages .
They tend to believe that genius is the product of a divine spark .
They believe that there have been , throughout the ages , certain paragons of greatness 
Dante , Mozart , Einstein  whose talents far exceeded normal comprehension , who had an other - worldly access to transcendent truth , and who are best approached with reverential awe .
We , of course , live in a scientific age , and modern research pierces hocus - pocus .
In the view that is now dominant , even Mozart ’s early abilities were not the product of some innate spiritual gift .
His early compositions were nothing special .
They were pastiches of other people ’s work .
Mozart was a good musician at an early age , but he would not stand out among today ’s top child - performers .
What Mozart had , we now believe , was the same thing Tiger Woods had  the ability to focus for long periods of time and a father intent on improving his skills .
Mozart played a lot of piano at a very young age , so he got his 10,000 hours of practice in early and then he built from there .
The latest research suggests a more prosaic , democratic , even puritanical view of the world .
The key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not a divine spark .
It ’s not I.Q. , a generally bad predictor of success , even in realms like chess .
Instead , it ’s deliberate practice .
Top performers spend more hours ( many more hours ) rigorously practicing their craft .
A Texas senator is trying to make it illegal for any government agency to buy Windows Vista without prior approval .
Juan Hinojosa says simply " Do n't buy it because it 's not worth it . "
If the law passes , all state agencies in Texas would need written approval from the Legislative Budget Board before buying Vista itself or any machine with the system pre-installed .
The only exception would be for places of higher education .
Anti-Vista Amendment Rides State Budget
The proposal is not a separate law .
Instead it 's a rider to the budget : one of 800 amendments added during the legislative process .
Hinojosa introduced the rider during a committee session and it was approved without any debate .
( Source : tx.us )
The final budget plan will be discussed by the Texas Senate next Wednesday .
It appears that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to reject Hinojosa 's proposal without ditching the entire budget -- something unlikely to happen .
The budget covers all government spending for the next two years .
Hinojosa says state officials have already had problems because of bugs in Vista .
" It takes up a lot of memory .
It 's not compatible with other equipment , and it 's supposed to be an upgrade from the XP program that is being used by state agencies , and it 's not . "
He admits he has n't used the system himself , but says he has read about its problems .
Microsoft Says It 's Unfair
Microsoft says it is disappointed by the move , pointing to the 1,500 employees it has in the state and the recent opening of a $ 500 million data center as proof of its commitment to Texas .
It says it 's unfair for legislation to attack a single company and product in this way .
The San Antonio Express News reports that 44 state agencies are already running Vista in some form , with spending ranging from just $ 122 to almost $ 1.6 billion .

Those toying with the idea of self - infection with the current H1N1 swine flu strain now circling the globe doubt that there will be enough effective vaccine to stop the virus if it returns in the fall , especially if it swaps genetic material with the H5N1 strain or has picked up resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu .
Even if drug makers switched to making a vaccine against a pandemic strain now , their total capacity is enough to make only one to two billion doses in a year , the World Health Organization said Wednesday .
Triage decisions would have to be made about which of the world ’s six billion people got the vaccine .
The online debates are often over details .
Should you wait to self - infect till the season ’s end , when the virus has evolved into the strain most likely to return in the fall ?
Should you get Tamiflu and take it at the first symptom ?
Should you check to see if local hospitals are empty , in case things go wrong and you need to be on a ventilator ?
Michael Olesen , chief of infection control at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis and a flu pandemics expert , said he was not planning to seek out infection but was “ taking a passive approach to getting infected . ”
When he heard about the outbreak in Mexico , he said , he bought extra N95 face masks and had been planning to wear one on a flight to Detroit soon .
“ Now I ’m thinking of taking my chances ” and forgoing the mask , he said .
“ That ’s a change from a week ago .
I think to myself , yeah , I ’ll be miserable for a week  but that ’ll beat maybe being seriously sick later . ”
One of the first open debates of the idea of intentional self - infection was on Effect Measure , a public health blog with many posts by thoughtful people who say they are clinicians , epidemiologists , veterinarians and other professionals , sometimes in government , but who post under pseudonyms to speak freely .
On April 28 , a user calling herself OmegaMom posted : “ Just a quick note  I just got a Tweet from a mom suggesting ‘ swine flu parties ’ because the U.S. version seems to be a mild version .
Can you speak to the utter insanity of doing this , please ? ”
‘ Oxford Circus has lost its “ circus ” quality , ’ says Peter Heath , principal urban designer at Atkins .
‘ It is used so intensely that on the ground it is impossible to appreciate its circular nature . ’
The reconfiguration of Oxford Circus , the heart of London ’s main retail district , has been on Westminster City Council ’s agenda for over 20 years .
Heath worked on an improvement strategy during his time at the council in the late 1980s .
Work on site began this week and the aim is to complete within 12 months .
Now , as part of the wider Oxford , Regent and Bond Street ( ORB ) Action Plan , Atkins is working with The Crown Estate , Transport for London ( TfL ) and the council to alleviate congestion caused by the 43,000 people and 2,000 vehicles that negotiate the junction every hour .

‘ In a retail environment , people represent potential customers , ’ says Heath .
‘ Data shows that 11 - 15 per cent of these potential customers are not catered for – typically the elderly , people with young children and people with disabilities .
And despite the high non-local visitor numbers , there are few repeat visits from tourists .
The redesign aims to address this shortfall . ’
Accessibility is key and a number of studies were conducted , with particular focus on blind users .
‘ The consensus was that blind users do not want the unfamiliar option of crossing diagonally .
An upstand kerb will therefore discourage the use of this route , ’ says Paul Fraser , senior urban designer at Atkins .
‘ The corrected alignment of the straight crossings will help such users who will be guided by tactile edging . ’
TfL also insisted that crossing equipment be ‘ future proofed ’ to accommodate countdown - style signals via visual numbers and audio alarm .
THE CHANGES
1. Remove street clutter
An audit by Atkins found that within the immediate Oxford Circus zone , there are over 150 items of street furniture , each creating about 1m2 of ‘ dead space ’ .
Atkins aims to reduce this number by at least half .
The staircase points for access to the London Underground are fixed and the existing stone balustrade renders the space between them redundant .
In the new scheme this space provides an area for people waiting to cross to congregate without blocking
the pavement .
2 , Increase pavement size
To redress the pedestrian / vehicular balance , pavement area is being increased by 63 per cent .
With the extra space created by decluttering , this represents an overall increase of 69 per cent .
3. Realign crossing
The new crossing position reinstates the street line , reducing the detour pedestrians must make to continue along Oxford Street and Regent Street .
The shorter crossing distance means the central refuge islands are not strictly necessary , but Atkins has retained a slimmer version to promote consistency and the perception of the space as symmetrical .
There is potential to extend the central island device down the length of both streets , to accommodate numerous crossings .

4. Insert diagonal option
The option of crossing the circus diagonally will further alleviate congestion at crossing points and represent consumer ‘ desire lines ’ .
The Shibuya crossing in Tokyo , Japan , is the case study on which this idea was loosely modelled .
5. Rephase crossing
Rather than staggered crossing periods , which necessitate large central refuge islands , traffic - light systems will be coordinated to provide an ‘ all - red ’ phase to allow all pedestrians to cross at the same time , within the cycle time of 115 - 120 seconds .
This is clearer and safer for pedestrians , and has vehicular advantages because stop lines can be moved forward and traffic can clear through more quickly .
6. Materials
The circumference of Oxford Circus , suggested by the curved facades of the buildings at each four ‘ corners ’ , is reinforced by a curved paving line .
This will be infilled with mottled paving , the small units of which are cheap to replace should any future excavation be necessary .
It will also indicate a change in tempo from the granite and York stone flagstones of Oxford Street and Regent Street .
A change to the aggregate mix of the tarmac will achieve the subtle definition of the central circle , diagonal crossing and straight crossings , accompanied by raised white circular and square studs .

USING ANIMATION
Atkins researched and produced a two - dimensional model that simulates pedestrian movement with software by Legion .
This particle - based system ran seven different layered simulations controlling 5,000 virtual people , and was used to predict pedestrian behaviour such as clustering and walking speed in response to the new street layout .
Visualisation firm Designhive combined the data from the Legion model and a 3D Studio Max model of the proposal to produce an accurate and compelling simulation – one of the first times this technique has been used .
The particles were replaced with animated people , programmed to walk while the particles were moving and idle when the points stopped for traffic signals .
A similar technique was used to create moving traffic from a VisSim model by Atkins .
‘ The end result is a simulation that is difficult to distinguish from a real piece of video footage , ’ says Fraser .

The late Canadian - born economist John Kenneth Galbraith once described India as " a functioning anarchy . "
But there 's nothing anarchic about the current general election here in the world 's largest democracy .
It is unfolding with surprising efficiency and even the possibility of a real upset as India 's poor look to have found their champion .
Four of five days of voting have ended — the final day is Wednesday , May 13 — and three - quarters of the 714 million eligible voters have had their chance to go to the polls .
Turnout has been lower than usual in many areas — down 25 per cent in parts of insurgency - plagued Jammu and Kashmir and well under 50 per cent in the wealthy enclaves of Mumbai .
But one group that appears to be voting with real enthusiasm is the country 's Dalit community , members of the lowest Hindu castes who were once known as untouchables .

A rising tide of Dalit and lower caste support has buoyed the political fortunes of a most unlikely leader , a 53 - year - old unmarried woman with a penchant for plain - speaking and rough tactics , Kumari Mayawati , who is widely known only by her last name .
In fact , some are predicting her Bahujan Samaj party ( the name translates roughly as Majority People 's party ) will emerge as the kingmaker in the next coalition government with Mayawati herself a leading candidate to become prime minister , replacing the Congress party 's venerable Manmohan Singh , the architect of India 's so - called economic miracle .
India 's ' Iron Lady '
Known to her followers as " Behen - ji " or " respected sister " and to others as India 's " Iron Lady , " Mayawati 's life is one of those amazing tales of rags to riches , with an Indian twist .
Her low - caste origins did n't prevent her from getting an education and becoming a teacher , before turning to full - time politics in 1984 , notes her biographer , Delhi journalist Ajoy Bose .
But no mainstream forecaster could have predicted Mayawati's 20 - year trajectory to fame , political power and , for some , questionable fortune , says Bose .
According to many accounts , Mayawati has amassed millions through her control of donations to her and the party .
She vigorously denies that there is anything wrong in what she has done .
But , according to Bose , Mayawati " has virtually reinvented the games that Indian politicians have traditionally played in pursuit of power . "
India 's election by the numbers Overall population : 1.2 billion Eligible voters : 714 million Polling stations : 828,804 Electronic voting machines used : 1.3 million Constituencies : 543 ( plus two appointed MPs ) Candidates in last election : 5,398 Budgeted Cost : $ 264 million CDN Source : Indian Election Commission , Government of India
These include " constant political and ideological oscillation that would have been ludicrous had they not delivered such spectacular results . "
Those results included being elected chief minister ( the equivalent of a Canadian premier ) of India 's most populous and politically important state , Uttar Pradesh , in four separate elections as well as amassing a steadily growing block of MPs in the central Parliament in New Delhi .
' Our turn '
In the run-up to the current election , Mayawati makes no secret of her desire for India 's top political job .
Asked in a rare television interview if anything could prevent her becoming prime minister , she said in her colourful Hindi : " A movement has begun .
When the time comes , no one can stop [ me ] . "
For her , acquiring power has meant changing party alliances frequently , while lashing out savagely against her perceived enemies .
In Uttar Pradesh , opposing Mayawati can lead to losing your job or even jail , journalists have noted .
Yet neither her autocratic style nor the allegations of corruption that have dogged her tenure in Uttar Pradsh have held back her expanding political base at the lower end of Indian public life .
" Mayawati's Dalit supporters are unanimous that what attracts them is not what she is but the hope she holds out for the future , " Bose writes .

With India 's economy growing at one of the fastest rates in the world in recent years , those at the bottom clearly feel it is time for their share .
Nehru 's heirs
The low - caste firebrand is n't the only charismatic and controversial figure in India 's current election .
Also wading in more fully this time is Rahul Gandhi , the 38 - year - old former investment banker who gave up a job in London in 2002 to enter politics — effectively the family business .
This is his second election but the first in which he has really thrown himself into the ring , travelling the country and speaking almost everywhere he can .
Few doubt his Italian - born mother and party leader , Sonia Gandhi , intends that her son continue the Congress party dynasty that began with Rahul 's great - grandfather , Jawaharlal Nehru , the first prime minister of independent India from 1947 to 1963 .
Economist Manmohan
Singh is running for re-election as the Congress party 's official candidate for prime minister .
But of course that can change after the actual votes are counted on May 16 and the coalition jockeying begins .
At this point , Singh 's opponent from the main opposition Bharatiya Janata party ( BJP ) is Lal Krishna Advani , 81 , a respected political strategist who engineered his party 's rise from just two parliamentary seats in the early 1990s to head the coalition government between 1998 and 2004 .
On the far right of the political spectrum and another force to be reckoned with is Narendra Modi , chief minister of the western state of Gujarat .
A fiery orator , Modi has earned grudging respect for his stewardship of Gujarat 's economy after it was rocked by vicious anti-Muslim violence in 2002 .
But he 's been denied a U.S. visitor 's visa on numerous occasions because of unresolved allegations involving his role in those events .
Even further out on the fringes is the usual clutch of Bollywood movie stars , transgender activists , unrepentant Communists and strict followers of Mahatma Gandhi who want India to eschew industrialization and life in the cities for villages , homespun cotton clothes and vegetarianism .
In the past , elections in India have been marred by violent attacks by armed gangs and raids on polling stations known as " booth - capturing . "
This time , however , the two million police , soldiers and election officials who move around the country monitoring the voting process seem to have kept anarchy at bay and given a patient , tenacious electorate its opportunity to vote .
Many analysts here have been saying there has been a distinct lack of emotive national issues in this campaign beyond general concerns about poverty and national security , brought on by the attack on Mumbai at the end of last year .
Galbraith 's functioning anarchy may no longer apply , but for sheer variety and unpredictability , an Indian election is still one of the greatest shows on Earth .
It is also serious business .
More than 600 million of the country 's vast population live in varying degrees of poverty and they 're increasingly impatient with the politics - as - usual approach that has brought the country to this point .
The country 's aspiring leaders ignore this at their peril .
SHOULD people who have bought DVDs legally be allowed to make digital copies of them for their own use ?
Any reasonable person would say yes .
In copyright terms , that ought to be considered “ fair use ” .
The law , however , presently says otherwise .
In America the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 considers it fair use for people to record copyrighted radio broadcasts for personal use .
But the act says nothing about making digital recordings ; and ripping copyrighted music tracks off CDs and storing them on iPods has now become an everyday occurrence .
Apple would be in serious difficulty if people were prevented from transferring their own CDs to their iPods .
Indeed , the software Apple gives away to iPod customers is designed to let them do just that .
Yet it is probably illegal .

One reason cited by people who believe they are entitled to make copies of any copyrighted material is security .
A backup copy is needed , they say , in case a rare or favourite DVD is attacked by “ disc rot ” or gets badly scratched .
They are being disingenuous .
Optical discs are not indestructible , but they are remarkably robust .
Certainly , the adhesive used to bond the layers within the platter can lift , causing the aluminium data - layer below to become oxidised and patchy .
But the solution is simple : keep all optical discs out of direct sunlight .
Meanwhile dust , fingerprints and even scratches can usually be removed by wiping the polycarbonate disc with a polyester cloth dipped in dilute washing - up liquid , and then rinsing with rubbing alcohol or methylated spirits .
Just remember to wipe the disc radially — from the centre to the edge .
Wiping with a circular motion — parallel to the direction the data are laid down — can create microscopic blemishes over the Hamming error - correction codes .
The picture can then become jerky or freeze as the video player stumbles across the patch of corrupted data .
In an act of desperation , your correspondent once used toothpaste to rub out deep gouges on a Laser Disc .
The unplayable disc was restored to life , and subsequently replayed many times with never so much as a flicker .
The polymer coating of a Blu-ray Disc makes it even more durable than a DVD .
Though little more than half a millimetre thick , it can withstand a surprising amount of abuse .
It even stands up to a screwdriver attack .
Another excuse used by those who would copy DVDs is convenience — to have copies of favourite films on a laptop while away from home .
Maybe , but your correspondent thinks it is easier to take the original discs with him .
A better case can be made for copying DVDs onto a dedicated home - server , especially if it is hooked up to a wide - screen television using a secure cable .
Copying DVDs for such purposes may make life easier , but it is almost always against the law .
With every DVD sold in America , both the packaging and the introduction to the video itself clearly state that unauthorised reproduction , distribution or exhibition is illegal .
To be more specific , the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act of 1998 makes it a crime to circumvent measures that control access to the copyrighted material .
Unfortunately , the copyright protection on DVDs is so pathetic that it positively invites piracy .
The encryption method known as Content Scrambling System ( CSS ) was first cracked in 1999 by Jon Johansen , a Norwegian programmer .
In a few short lines of elegant code he called DeCSS , Mr Johansen showed the world how utterly useless the encryption was .
Ever since , free software tools with names like HandBrake , DVDFab and DVD Shrink have circulated the web for copying the contents of DVDs onto hard - drives and recordable discs .
The one way you can legally copy a DVD , at least for the moment , is to buy one of the $ 10,000 home - server and player combos beloved by Hollywood moguls and made by a Silicon Valley firm called Kaleidescape .
A Kaleidescape server works by ripping the tracks off an owner 's collection of CDs and DVDs and storing them on the digital jukebox 's huge hard - drive .
The digital content is then encrypted and fed to various screens and speakers around the home by a secure cable .
Ironically , Kaleidescape was sued several years ago by the film industry 's friends in theDVD Content Control Association for breaching its CSS licence .
In its defence , Kaleidescape claimed that content distributed this way was even safer than it was on the original DVDs .
The judge not only agreed , but could find no breach of the CSS licence either .
The Content Control Association is appealing against the ruling .
RealNetworks , a digital media company that pioneered much of the technology for streaming music and video from the web , has pinned its defence in court this week on the Kaleidescape ruling .
Last October a group of Hollywood studios sued the Seattle firm for the way RealDVD , a $ 30 software program , makes copying DVDs to a PC 's hard - drive a simple one - click affair , busting the CSS digital - rights - management system wide open and encouraging flagrant piracy in the process .
Not true , claims the company .
RealDVD keeps the encryption intact as it copies everything — CSS included — to a PC 's hard - drive , and then wraps the lot up in an iTunes form of digital rights management .
Lawyers for the firm have framed the debate in terms of fair use , as the software not only maintains the CSS encryption but also locks the copies of the DVD onto the receiving PC 's hard - drive for the owner 's private use .
But why , might our reasonable person ask , would RealNetworks go out of its way to provoke the Hollywood studios , who rely on DVD sales for most of their revenue these days ?
It is not as though a $ 30 program , sold in direct competition with a dozen well - established freebies from the internet , is going to make any significant difference to the media company 's sagging bottom line .
The answer can only be that RealNetworks has far bigger fish to fry than mere backup software for DVDs .
Under questioning in court this week , the company was forced to reveal its long - term plans for the technology .
It seems that RealNetworks wants to turn its handiwork , code - named Facet , into a “ TiVo for DVDs ” — and do for video what MP3 players have done for audio .
Apparently , the company has contracts with set - top - box makers in Asia awaiting the go - ahead .
If the San Francisco court rules in its favour , RealNetworks could have its $ 300 version of the formidably expensive Kaleidescape jukebox out by next Christmas .
There is just one problem : the federal judge hearing the present case is Marilyn Hall Patel , who ruled against Napster in 2001 — and put a stop , albeit briefly , to peer - to - peer sharing of MP3 music files over the internet .

Men want ' macho ' hymns , fewer flowers and less dancing in church
' Too girly ' :
The survey found men would rather sing passionate hymns such as Amazing Grace , rather than ' sentimental , lovely dovey songs '
They have stood the test of time and it seems that today , despite all the changes to church services , men still prefer to sing ' proper macho hymns ' .
Nearly 60 per cent of those who took part in a survey said they enjoyed singing - but added comments showing they preferred anthemic songs and ' proclamational ' hymns as opposed to more emotional love songs .
Sixty per cent said they did not like flowers and embroidered banners in church , while 52 per cent did not like dancing in church .
Comments gathered from the online survey of 400 UK readers of the men's magazine Sorted also showed many did not like hugging , holding hands or sitting in circles discussing their feelings in church .
Most were churchgoers .
The magazine suggested a top ten of male - friendly hymns including : Onward Christian Soldiers , Guide Me O Thy Great Redeemer , All People That On Earth Do Dwell , Amazing Grace and Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind Forgive Our Foolish Ways .
Most of the readers were churchgoers with the majority filling in a survey form online between January and April .
Nearly three quarters , or 72 per cent , said their favourite part of a service was the talk or sermon .
Sorted managing editor and publisher Steve Legg said : ' Jesus recruited a bunch of 12 ordinary blokes before He began his ministry proper .
They spent three years together doing stuff .
He sat down and ate with them and built relationships .
' The comments at the end of the survey showed that what appeals to men is doing stuff together - sports teams , fishing , pub quizzes , paint - balling , DIY projects , curry nights , bowling , clay pigeon shooting and going out for a beer . '
The findings of the survey will be discussed at a seminar on men and the church at the Christian Resources Exhibition ( CRE ) in Sandown Park , Esher , on Friday May 15 .
Mr Legg added that too many churches were decorated like ' Laura Ashley showrooms ' .
He said : ' I often walk into churches and they are like Laura Ashley showrooms with all these flowers and banners and tissues .
Men just do n't feel comfortable with that .
' Certainly , with the singing , I am fed up with singing these sentimental lovey dovey songs .
' On the football terraces we are very passionate , chanting and cheering , and we want more songs like that .
We want fewer girly songs . '
Here is a suggested top 10 of male - friendly hymns drawn up by Sorted :
FIA president Max Mosley has said that he expects perhaps half the current F1 field not to lodge an entry by the deadline of May 29th .
This deadline is now less than two weeks away .
Tomorrow the Ferrari injunction against the FIA over the process by which it drew up the 2010 rules package will be heard at the High Court in Paris .
If the injunction succeeds it opens the way to a full legal challenge of the way the rules for next season were drawn up .
“ I think that we will probably get anywhere between three and six teams by the deadline , depending , ” said Mosley , he told Autosport .
“ After that they become a late entry and if there is a space they can take it , and if there is n’t space they cannot .
“ They have to make up their minds what they want to do .
If they want to continue racing in F1 , then they can come and talk .
And if they want to go and do something else , then they have got to start making a car . ”
There are believed to be several teams seriously thinking about entering a team in the 2010 world championships , including Lola , Prodrive , USGPE and GP2 team I Sport .
One of the options for the manufacturers is to start their own series and , as it happens , they commissioned a detailed study into the feasibility of this when they were formed into the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association a few years ago .
But that was at the height of the economic cycle , when car sales and media rights were at a peak .
Now the landscape is very different .
It is a huge undertaking to start a new series and there could n’t be a worse time to do it , with the car industry in a once in a generation global crisis .
The manufacturers involved in F1 all have far bigger problems to deal with than investing heavily to start their own series .
This is the calculation Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone are making .
They could join forces with an existing series , but in either case one of the hardest parts would be getting a really good television package together , because without that there would be no sponsors and no wider media interest .
The deals for F1 are signed up well in advance and with many of the world ’s leading broadcasters , like the BBC .
A split , whereby Ferrari and other manufacturers race in one series and Brawn , Force India , Williams and others are in Formula 1 would not work for either series .
F1 would be a pale shadow of its former self and the new series , despite Ferrari ’s presence , would be quite a tough sell in the current TV market .
They would probably be able to get some prominent space with terrestrial broadcasters if they offered the coverage for free , or subsidised it but it would be extremely hard to sell rights to a new series for the many millions F1 commands .
Something similar happened in America with the Indycar series in the mid 1990s when Indianapolis boss Tony George split with the CART teams , so what had been Indycar was forced to rename itself Champ Car and lost its most famous race , the Indianapolis 500 .
TV deals were divided and it was a disaster for both sides , one they have yet to recover from .
I do n’t think it will come to this , but there is no doubt that were are passing through a very painful moment for the sport .
Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Monday night 's broadcast .
Campbell Brown says President Bush can't seem to see the failure of his administration 's response to Hurricane Katrina .
( CNN ) -- Much of President Bush 's news conference today was a defense of the many controversial decisions of his presidency , it was also reflective , with the president showing a willingness to admit and talk about the serious mistakes made by this administration .
But on one topic in particular , he seemed almost entirely disconnected from what really happened : Hurricane Katrina .
As someone who spent many days in New Orleans , Louisiana , after Hurricane Katrina , I was taken aback listening to the president talk about the government 's response .
President Bush :
" People said , ' Well , the federal response was slow . '
Do n't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed .
I remember going to see those helicopter drivers , Coast Guard drivers , to thank them for their courageous efforts to rescue people off roofs .
Thirty - thousand people were pulled off roofs right after the storm moved through .
It 's a pretty quick response .
Could things have been done better ?
Absolutely .
Absolutely .
But when I hear people say , the federal response was slow , then what are they going to say to those chopper drivers , or the 30,000 that got pulled off the roofs ? "
' No Bias , No Bull '
Get the latest on the day 's main events .
8 ET Monday through Friday see full schedule »
It is impossible to challenge what so many of us witnessed firsthand -- what the entire country witnessed through television day and night : New Orleans was a city for a time abandoned by the government ; where people old and young were left at the New Orleans convention center for days with no water or food .
People will disagree over aspects of the Bush legacy , but on the government 's handling of Katrina ?
We were there .
Watch Campbell Brown 's reaction to President Bush 's news conference »
The whole country saw what happened .
People stuck on roofs were one part of a massive catastrophe .
But there was so much else the government did n't do .
To this day that city is fighting for its life .
Mr. President , you can not pat yourself on the back for that one .
We will debate the war in Iraq , national security , the economy and the rest of your legacy .
Those debates will continue for years to come .
But on how you handled Katrina , there is no debate .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .
All About George W. Bush • Hurricane Katrina
Anger and hostility are significantly associated with both a higher risk for coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in healthy individuals and poorer outcomes in patients with existing heart disease , according to the first quantitative review and meta- analysis of related studies , which appears in the March 17 , 2009 , issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .
Management of anger and hostility may be an important adjuvant strategy in preventing CHD in the general public and treating CHD patients , according to authors .
" Anger and hostility were found to predict a 19 percent and 24 percent increase in CHD events among initially healthy people and those with pre-existing CHD , respectively , " says Yoichi Chida , M.D. , Ph.D. , Department of Epidemiology & Public Health , University College , London , UK .
" The harmful association of anger and hostility with CHD events in healthy people was greater in men than women .
This suggests that the accumulation of stress responses in daily life might have a greater impact on future CHD in men . "
Authors extensively reviewed the literature on the longitudinal associations of anger and hostility with CHD events , and identified 25 studies of initially healthy populations and 18 studies of patients with CHD .
While the damaging effects of these emotions have been widely asserted , previous reviews have been inconclusive .
" This review provides further evidence that psychological factors do matter in the development and progression of CHD , " says Johan Denollet , Ph.D. , CoRPS research center , Tilburg University , The Netherlands , and co-author of the accompanying editorial .
" Clinicians should take symptoms of anger and hostility seriously , and may consider referring their patient for behavioral intervention .
We need to closely monitor and study these personality traits in order to do a better job at identifying high - risk patients who are more liable to future fatal and non-fatal coronary events . "
Interestingly , there was no longer a significant association of anger and hostility with CHD when researchers performed a subgroup analysis of the studies that controlled for behavioral covariates ( e.g. , smoking , physical activity or body mass index , socioeconomic status ) and disease treatment , suggesting that the major pathway between anger and hostility and CHD might be behavioral risk factors .
In addition , a direct physiological pathway should be considered in future studies ; this might involve autonomic nervous dysregulation , increases in inflammatory or coagulation factors such as C - reactive protein , interleukin 6 and fibrinogen , and higher cortisol levels .
Future research should also focus on the interplay between negative emotions and emotion regulation strategies as a determinant of major coronary events , according to Denollet .
How the U.S. colonizes the world through the installation of military bases :
From the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists :

Empire of Bases
By Hugh Gusterson | 10 March 2009
Before reading this article , try to answer this question :
How many military bases does the United States have in other countries : a ) 100 ; b ) 300 ; c ) 700 ; or d) 1,000 .
According to the Pentagon ’s own list , the answer is around 865 , but if you include the new bases in Iraq and Afghanistan it is over a thousand .
These thousand bases constitute 95 percent of all the military bases any country in the world maintains on any other country ’s territory .
In other words , the United States is to military bases as Heinz is to ketchup .
The old way of doing colonialism , practiced by the Europeans , was to take over entire countries and administer them .
But this was clumsy .
The United States has pioneered a leaner approach to global empire .
As historian Chalmers Johnson says , “ America ’s version of the colony is the military base . ”
The United States , says Johnson , has an “ empire of bases . ” …
Even if politicians and media pundits seem oblivious to these bases , treating the stationing of U.S. troops all over the world as a natural fact , the U.S. empire of bases is attracting increasing attention from academics and activists–as evidenced by a conference on U.S. foreign bases at American University in late February .
NYU Press just published Catherine Lutz ’s Bases of Empire , a book that brings together academics who study U.S. military bases and activists against the bases .
Rutgers University Press has published Kate McCaffrey ’s Military Power and Popular Protest , a study of the U.S. base at Vieques , Puerto Rico , which was closed in the face of massive protests from the local population .
And Princeton University Press is about to publish David Vine ’s Island of Shame–a book that tells the story of how the United States and Britain secretly agreed to deport the Chagossian inhabitants of Diego Garcia to Mauritius and the Seychelles so their island could be turned into a military base .
The Americans were so thorough that they even gassed all the Chagossian dogs .
The Chagossians have been denied their day in court in the United States but won their case against the British government in three trials , only to have the judgment overturned by the highest court in the land , the House of Lords .
They are now appealing to the European Court of Human Rights .
American leaders speak of foreign bases as cementing alliances with foreign nations , largely through the trade and aid agreements that often accompany base leases .
Yet , U.S. soldiers live in a sort of cocooned simulacrum of America in their bases , watching American TV , listening to American rap and heavy metal , and eating American fast food , so that the transplanted farm boys and street kids have little exposure to another way of life .
Meanwhile , on the other side of the barbed - wire fence , local residents and businesses often become economically dependent on the soldiers and have a stake in their staying .
These bases can become flashpoints for conflict .
Military bases invariably discharge toxic waste into local ecosystems , as in Guam where military bases have led to no fewer than 19 superfund sites .
Such contamination generates resentment and sometimes , as in Vieques in the 1990s , full - blown social movements against the bases .
The United States used Vieques for live - bombing practice 180 days a year , and by the time the United States withdrew in 2003 , the landscape was littered with exploded and unexploded ordinance , depleted uranium rounds , heavy metals , oil , lubricants , solvents , and acids .
According to local activists , the cancer rate on Vieques was 30 percent higher than on the rest of Puerto Rico .
It is also inevitable that , from time to time , U.S. soldiers –often drunk –commit crimes .
The resentment these crimes cause is only exacerbated by the U.S. government ’s frequent insistence that such crimes not be prosecuted in local courts .
In 2002 , two U.S. soldiers killed two teenage girls in Korea as they walked to a birthday party .
Korean campaigners claim this was one of 52,000 crimes committed by U.S. soldiers in Korea between 1967 and 2002 .
The two U.S. soldiers were immediately repatriated to the United States so they could escape prosecution in Korea .
In 1998 , a marine pilot sliced through the cable of a ski gondola in Italy , killing 20 people , but U.S. officials slapped him on the wrist and refused to allow Italian authorities to try him .
These and other similar incidents injured U.S. relations with important allies .
The 9/11 attacks are arguably the most spectacular example of the kind of blowback that can be generated from local resentment against U.S. bases .
In the 1990s , the presence of U.S. military bases near the holiest sites of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia angered Osama bin Laden and provided Al Qaeda with a potent recruitment tool .
The United States wisely closed its largest bases in Saudi Arabia , but it opened additional bases in Iraq and Afghanistan that are rapidly becoming new sources of friction in the relationship between the United States and the peoples of the Middle East …..
U.S. foreign bases have a double edge : they project American power across the globe , but they also inflame U.S. foreign relations , generating resentment against the prostitution , environmental damage , petty crime , and everyday ethnocentrism that are their inevitable corollaries .
Such resentments have recently forced the closure of U.S. bases in Ecuador , Puerto Rico , and Kyrgyzstan , and if past is prologue , more movements against U.S. bases can be expected in the future .
Over the next 50 years , I believe we will witness the emergence of a new international norm according to which foreign military bases will be as indefensible as the colonial occupation of another country has become during the last 50 years .
The Declaration of Independence criticizes the British “ for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us ” and “ for protecting them , by a mock trial , from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States . ”
Fine words !
The United States should start taking them to heart .

Reporter working on story critical of VA has his equipment confiscated Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday April 10 , 2009

This A public radio reporter visiting a VA hospital earlier this week to work on a story about veterans ' healthcare was stopped by government officials mid-interview , ordered to leave the hospital and had some of his recording equipment confiscated .
David Schultz , a reporter with a local NPR affliate , WAMU 88.5 , was at the Veteran Affairs Hospital in Washington , DC on Tuesday night , covering a townhall meeting on the quality of minority healthcare .
In the middle of an interview with one of the veterans at the meeting on the below quality healthcare he was receiving at the hospital , Schultz was told by hospital officials to halt the interview and to turn over his recording equipment .
DC radio station WTOP reports that Gloria Hairston , an internal communications specialist with the VA , was the one to order a stop to the interview .
Hairston was joined by two other VA employees and four armed guards , who stood between Schultz and the exit , in ordering the 26 - year - old reporter to hand over his equipment , which included a recorder , microphone and headphones .
" She said I would n't be allowed to leave , " Schultz told WTOP .
" I became worried that I was going to get arrested .
Katie Roberts , a spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs , told the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press that Schultz refused to listen to the VA officials ' request for a signed waiver by the veteran he was interview .
Schultz was able to persuade Hairston to just confiscate the memory card of his recorder , instead of all of his equipment .
When one of the veterans who had drifted over to watch the spectacle asked Schultz for his phone number , he was stopped from handing it out by Hairston .
" I started to give it to him and then [ Hairston ] became irate , " Schultz said .
" She said , ' You ca n't give him your phone number .
You have to give me all of your equipment or I 'm going to get ugly . ' "
After conferring with his boss , WAMU news director Jim Asendio , by phone , Schultz handed over his memory card and left the hospital .
" I told him to give them the flash card and get out of there , " Asendio said to WTOP .
" I did n't want this to get out of hand . "
Thus far , attempts by WAMU to retrieve the flash card from the VA have been unsuccessful .
Roberts , the VA spokeswoman , is claiming that Schultz " took advantage of the patient " he was interviewing by not correctly identifying himself as a reporter , an assertion that Schultz disagrees with .
She said the VA would return the flash card if the veteran Schultz was interviewing signs a consent form .
Tuesday 's incident has , unsurprisingly , not gone down well with journalists .
" When he was in the Army , the current secretary of Veterans Affairs , Gen. Eric Shinseki ( USA ret. ) , no doubt had occasion to read the riot act to subordinate officers , " writes Art Brodsky of The Huffington Post .
" It 's time for him to get into command mode again , and the subjects this time are his incompetent public relations staff , which created an embarrassing nightmare for an Administration dedicated to transparency and openness . "

Now , in fairness we have to say that the United States was far from being the only nation in which banks ran wild .
Many European leaders are still in denial about the continent ’s economic and financial troubles , which arguably run as deep as our own  although their nations ’ much stronger social safety nets mean that we ’re likely to experience far more human suffering .
Still , it ’s a fact that the crisis has cost America much of its credibility , and with it much of its ability to lead .
And that ’s a very bad thing .
Like many other economists , I ’ve been revisiting the Great Depression , looking for lessons that might help us avoid a repeat performance .
And one thing that stands out from the history of the early 1930s is the extent to which the world ’s response to crisis was crippled by the inability of the world ’s major economies to cooperate .
The details of our current crisis are very different , but the need for cooperation is no less .
President Obama got it exactly right last week when he declared : “ All of us are going to have to take steps in order to lift the economy .
We do n’t want a situation in which some countries are making extraordinary efforts and other countries are n’t . ”
Yet that is exactly the situation we ’re in .
I do n’t believe that even America ’s economic efforts are adequate , but they ’re far more than most other wealthy countries have been willing to undertake .
And by rights this week ’s G - 20 summit ought to be an occasion for Mr. Obama to chide and chivy European leaders , in particular , into pulling their weight .
But these days foreign leaders are in no mood to be lectured by American officials , even when  as in this case  the Americans are right .
The financial crisis has had many costs .
And one of those costs is the damage to America ’s reputation , an asset we ’ve lost just when we , and the world , need it most .
This week , with his pronouncement that credit is the lifeblood of a healthy economy ,  President Obama reiterated what has been one of his most common themes in diagnosing our economic problem .
The president has relied on this bedrock belief to propose policies that place the restoration of credit as the highest priority .
However , despite his seemingly earnest intentions , the president and his economic advisors have misdiagnosed the ailment .
Savings , not credit , is the lifeblood of a healthy economy .
When not used properly credit can be like a cancer that sickens an otherwise healthy economy .
What everyone seems to have forgotten at this point is that credit does not come from thin air .
Even in a system in which bank reserves are leveraged many times , someone has to put savings in a bank for the bank to turn around and make a loan .
As a result , the bedrock is the savings , which allows for the credit to flow .
Credit extended without adequate savings inevitably leads an economy into disaster .
The primary mechanism that has injected credit where it does not belong is the massive credit card industry that has developed in the United States over the last generation .
The ease with which these cards may be obtained and the degree to which Americans now rely on them for routine purchases has created a culture of credit that simply has no precedent in a healthy economy .
Until this culture has been reformed , America ’s fight to restore economic vitality will be a lost cause .
However , this week a much discussed opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by top banking analyst Meredith Whitney , indicated that many Americans besides the president are still looking toward credit as the means of economic salvation .
In her piece , Ms. Whitney writes ,
 Undeniably , consumers look at their unused credit balances as a " what if " reserve .
" What if " my kid needs braces ?
" What if " my dog gets sick ?
" What if " I lose one of my jobs ?
This unused credit portion has grown to be relied on as a source of liquidity and a liquidity management tool for many U.S. consumers .
If credit is taken away from what otherwise is an able borrower , that borrower ’s financial position weakens considerably .
With two - thirds of the U.S. economy dependent upon consumer spending , we should tread carefully and act collectively . 
In order to keep the economy functioning , Ms. Whitney asks the credit card providers and the federal government to keep credit lines open , so that millions of Americans can keep on spending .
However , while such actions would certainly keep our phony economy propped up a while longer , it would further weaken the very foundation upon which a real economy will eventually have to be rebuilt .
Without a doubt , Americans , and all other people for that matter , benefit from having access to rainy day money . 
But Americans should be saving for a rainy day , not adopting the attitude that if it rains I ’ll whip out my credit card .
If Americans need to pay for a suddenly ill dog , to straighten their kid ’s teeth , or to pull them through a period of unemployment , they should save some of their present earnings .
But saving money requires a reduction in spending , and that is something that modern economists , within and without the Administration , cannot abide .
A drop in spending will create a sharper contraction in our economy — which is now comprised of 70 % consumer spending .
But this is no reason to discourage the process .
The option to go into debt in the event of an emergency is no substitute for building personal savings for such events .
Not only does such a strategy jeopardize the solvency of individuals or families when they are at their most vulnerable , but it deprives society of badly needed savings .
Currently , with so many financially strapped Americans looking to draw on their credit lines , the fallacy of this savings substitute is easily revealed .
With lenders ’ capital depleted , and falling home prices , and rising unemployment putting borrowers at greater risk of default , credit is naturally harder to come by .
Had only a small percentage of borrowers needed to access their credit card rainy day funds  there would have been no credit crisis .
But with a deluge drenching so many at once , there was simply not enough credit umbrellas to go around .
Had Americans actually been saving money instead , everyone would have his own umbrella and would not now be looking to borrow someone else ’s .
Most importantly , as savers bank their earnings into rainy day funds ,  in addition to earning interest , those savings are available to businesses to make capital investments , produce goods and services , and provide employment .
Without access to those savings , such investments cannot be made , and society is worse off as a result .
Lastly , savings can always be relied upon whereas credit is ephemeral .
Remarks this week from the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao should serve notice to all Americans that the day will soon come when the Chinese stop lending us their umbrellas .
When that happens , the average American will be soaked to the bone .

The Best of Peter Schiff
I was raised in the LDS Church ( aka : The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ) .
Though I am no longer a Mormon , I do have family members and friends who are and so news , photos , captions , etc. , with the M - word in them usually catches my eye .
While cruising around a tattoo gallery recently , THIS back piece tattoo caught my attention .
At first , I thought it was Photoshopped or a joke , because I know the LDS Church 's stance on ink , but after looking into it , I found that this large tattoo was on the back of Jack Armstrong , a long - time tattoo artist and collector who began his tattoo career in the 1920s and owned many tattoo shops throughout the years .
Jack was a Mormon and was n't joking when he had over a dozen Mormon prophets permanently inked onto his back .
He told Don Terry in a New York Times article in 1998 :
" Are you ready for this ? '' he asked , pulling off his shirt and turning his back to reveal a huge tattoo of Jesus , two dozen past presidents of the Mormon Church and himself , looking like Santa Claus in a baseball cap .
'' I 'm religious , '' Mr. Armstrong said .
'' I'm a Mormon . ''
It appears that Armstrong began collecting his prophets before the LDS October , 2000 General Conference , when then - Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley said this about tattoos and piercings :
" Now comes the craze of tattooing one 's body .
I cannot understand why any young man -- or young woman , for that matter -- would wish to undergo the painful process of disfiguring the skin with various multicolored representations of people , animals , and various symbols .
With tattoos , the process is permanent , unless there is another painful and costly undertaking to remove it .
Fathers , caution your sons against having their bodies tattooed .
They may resist your talk now , but the time will come when they will thank you .
A tattoo is graffiti on the temple of the body .
Likewise the piercing of the body for multiple rings in the ears , in the nose , even in the tongue .
Can they possibly think that is beautiful ?
It is a passing fancy , but its effects can be permanent .
Some have gone to such extremes that the ring had to be removed by surgery .
The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve have declared that we discourage tattoos and also " the piercing of the body for other than medical purposes . "
We do not , however , take any position " on the minimal piercing of the ears by women for one pair of earrings " -- one pair . "
The Mormons are not alone in their stance on body modifications .
Many Christian denominations counsel against " marking the skin , " while some " more progressive " sects not only allow them , they base their ministry around them .
The Christian Tattoo Association states that they are :
" a non-profit , tax - exempt ministry to tattoo artists and enthusiasts .
The main goal of the CTA is to share the Gospel with tattoo artists and enthusiasts .
This is achieved by attending local and national tattoo conventions , developing relationships which provide avenues for personal witnessing , sharing our faith through the internet , printed page and conducting bible studies and worship services .
The CTA is not a Christian society trying to separate Christian tattooers and tattoo enthusiasts from the influences of the world .
We are a ministry designed to assist born - again Christians in taking the Gospel of Jesus to those who have not yet heard the good news . "
If you are a Christian , where do you stand on tattoos ?
If you are of another faith , what are your feelings about ink ?
If you are an atheist or agnostic , do you have tattoos or are they not your cup of tea ?

' I was so numb I could n't even cry ' : Daughter blasts ' Gestapo ' social services as they bundle mother , 86 , out of family home
Placing a tea - time meal of beans - on - toast in front of her frail 86 - year - old mother Betty , Ros Figg glanced out of the dining room window to see two squad cars and a police van pull up .
Thinking there must be a major incident going on nearby , she pulled back the net curtains hoping to see what had prompted such an impressive show of police manpower .
One of the officers was carrying a battering ram .
Was there a criminal on the loose ?
Heartless : Betty Figg , 86 , covered with a blanket , is wheeled away by Coventry social services
A suspected terrorist in hiding ?
A secret drugs den , perhaps ?
None of the above , as it would turn out .
The person they 'd come for , armed with a warrant , was poor old Betty - a once sprightly great - grandmother who 'd recently succumbed to dementia .
' I could n't believe my eyes when four police officers , flanking two social workers and a doctor , walked towards my house , ' says 55 - year - old Ros .
' One of the police officers was holding a red battering ram and I thought : " What on earth does he need that for ? "
' It 's the sort of thing they 'd use to raid terrorists , not people like us .
' I was so frightened I did n't want to let them in so I leaned out of the window and asked them what they wanted .
' One of the social workers said a doctor had come to examine my mother .
When I opened the door a warrant , giving them the right to search for and remove my mother , was put in my hand .
Happier times : Rosalind Figg says she was made to feel like ' an enemy of the state ' after trying to care for her mother , who has dementia , at home
' My poor mum , when she saw the policemen kept asking : " What have we done wrong ? " and I was desperately trying to stay calm and reassure her , saying : " We 've done nothing wrong , Mum . "
' I was shaking with shock .
I was so numb I could n't even cry .
' Two policemen remained stationed at the front door the whole time .
Did they think we were going to do a runner ?
' My mother has a wheelchair - she can't even walk . '
And so on Monday , with neighbours hanging out of the windows to see what was going on , Betty - who was diagnosed with dementia last June - was wheeled by social workers from her daughter 's house in Coventry to a waiting car and taken away .
The almost Orwellian operation was captured on a very sad series of pictures - one showing a blanket thrown over Betty 's head by social workers to shield her from photographers - which have since been published in newspapers , prompting a public outcry .
Betty was then returned to the residential home which Ros removed her from last Saturday , believing her Mum would be better off in her care .
Butts Croft House in Coventry , where Mrs Figg was receiving care
Social services had opposed Ros 's request to care for her mother at home , arguing that the level of care she could offer was not sufficient , and swung into action with the full force of the law when Ros defied them and took her home .
' I did n't try to stop them taking my mother because I did n't want to panic and upset her , ' says Ros .
' I felt so guilty that I had brought this on her , but also complete disbelief .
' I told her : " Do n't worry , Mum , I 'll be seeing you soon . "
Then I watched from the window as they threw a blanket over her head to stop people taking photographs .
Rosalind Figg said her mother perked up after they took her out of the home
' How could they do that to an old and confused lady ?
As soon as they put the blanket on her head , she threw it off again and I thought : " Good on you , Mum . "
' They were so keen to get her away from me that they reversed into a bollard , leaving it bent .
' I still can't believe it 's happened .
I was made to feel like an enemy of the state rather than a daughter who just wants to do the best for her mother .
' I can't believe these Gestapo tactics can be allowed to happen in our society .
' After they 'd gone , I read the warrant they 'd left behind , and I felt even more upset .
I was insulted .
' It said Mum was being removed under Section 135 of the Mental Health Act 1983 because she was at risk of neglect or ill - treatment , with no evidence to support that at all .
I 've never been in trouble with the police .
' The doctor took her blood pressure , which was normal , said her skin was a bit dry and said she had some bruises on her leg .
' But they were marks which had been there before she came home .
As far as I know , she was n't on any medication at the home .
' What kind of country are we living in where social workers appear to be quite capable of leaving children with parents who abuse them , but not elderly women with the children who love them ?
' What they have done is a complete travesty of human rights . '
Ros , a mother of four sons aged between 21 and 36 , still looks shaken by these events .
Softly - spoken , she shows me round her terraced home , pointing out the wheelchair ramp she had put in at the front door and the den she turned into a downstairs bedroom in preparation for her mother 's arrival .
On the bed is a mattress with sensors to alert Ros should her mother get up in the night and leave the room .
All of this was considered by social services to be completely inadequate .
Ros was yesterday consulting with solicitors to see what legal action to take .
She also visited her mother , taking a legal representative with her .
Ros says : ' It was lovely to see Mum , but I could see immediately that she 'd lost her sparkle again .
' She told me she missed me and asked if she could come home again . '
Ros is convinced she can look after her , having given up her job running a pottery shop and also having had experience as a carer , including looking after people with dementia .
She is supported by her partner of 12 years , Chris , an electrician , her sons and older sister Marianne , a qualified nurse , who all want to see Betty back with her family .
Ros shows me photographs of her mother from happier days , surrounded by the family she adored .
Even after Betty 's husband Brian died eight years ago , aged 80 , the week before their 50th wedding anniversary , she remained a sprightly , independent woman living alone in the marital home .
Last May , however , Ros - who used to pop in every day to check on her mother - started to notice that Betty was becoming increasingly confused .
' She burnt food and did odd things like putting milk in the kettle , ' says Ros .
' I took her to the GP and he referred her to a memory clinic .
That was when I asked if she could have help at home , and , perhaps , respite care in a home . '
On May 25 last year , however , Betty 's condition suddenly deteriorated following the tragic death of her 25 - year - old nephew , Gareth , in a road accident .
On June 9 , she was diagnosed with dementia and the following week was admitted to University Hospital , Walsgrave , after doctors became concerned about her legs , which had started to swell , and her fragile mental state .
On June 29 she suffered a fall in hospital , breaking her hip , which required an operation .
In August , when she was due to be discharged , social services were called in to assess her needs .
When it was suggested that Betty go to Butts Croft House nursing home in Corley , Coventry , because she was unable to return to her own home , Ros agreed .
' I thought she was going for respite and assessment , and no one told me otherwise , ' says Ros .
' I never for one moment thought it might be permanent .
When I first visited my mother there , it looked very nice , newly built , and for the first six weeks we were happy for her to stay there . '
Ros , who has power of attorney over her mother 's affairs , paid the £ 485 weekly home fees from Betty 's savings , topped up by her state allowances and pension .
' There are a lot of elderly people who are happy at Butts Croft House , as are their relatives , and for some people it's the right environment , ' says Ros .
' But I became convinced that Mum would be happier at home with me .
' Betty had cared for her mother , Maud , when she was dying from cancer and all my instincts told me I should be caring for my mum , too .
' When Mum first went to the home , she was in a room with less serious dementia sufferers , but then she was moved to a room for those with more advanced dementia .
' There was a big hedge outside the window , so tall you could n't see the sky , and I did n't like to think of her sitting in electric light all day .
She had very little stimulation .
' There were some very good carers at the home , but no carer can ever know someone as well as their family and I was upset when I found out one had assumed that Mum , who has her own teeth , was wearing dentures and had tried to take them out .
' Sometimes when I visited Mum her toothbrush was dry and brown because it had n't been used . '
Last November , Ros gave notice of her intention to remove Betty , but their plans to take her home had to be abandoned when the family was told Betty could not leave until social services had assessed her .
Ros - who 'd started to make changes to her home to accommodate her mother which met , she claims , the social services ' standards - was frustrated .
' She had n't been sectioned .
We thought she had gone into the home as a temporary measure , ' says Ros .
' Meetings with social workers were postponed .
Then they started talking about the Mental Health Act and how my mother was very vulnerable .
' No one ever said to me outright that I could n't care for my mum . '
In February , Betty was admitted to hospital with an oral infection and Ros decided then that she wanted her mother discharged into her care once she was well .
Instead , after consultations between the hospital , social services and doctors , Betty was put back into the care home without informing the family of the decision .
' When she returned to the home , I went to see her and found her mouth caked in blood , ' says Ros .
' She was complaining of feeling hungry .
She 'd been given a dry beef sandwich , when her mouth was still infected and sore , and she just could n't eat it .
' I said to her : " Mum , you are not doing very well are you ? " , and she said : " No . "
When I said : " What shall we do ? " , she replied : " Come with you ? " '
Ros kept pressing social services for the assessment , thinking they could agree a care package to meet her mother 's needs at home .
' In the end I was told she needed round - the - clock care which would cost me thousands of pounds , and it would be better if she stayed in the home , ' says Ros .
' I was so angry .
I thought : " Right , I 'll just go and take her out .
They can't stop me from looking after my own mother . "
' I was worried about how I would cope , but I was going to have carers to help me .'
So at 4.30 pm last Saturday , Ros , accompanied by her sister and her partner 's sister - in - law , who is also a nurse , arrived at Butts Croft House to take her home .
' We went into her room and quietly started packing because we did n't want to make a fuss , ' says Ros .
' As we were leaving , we told the manager we were taking her out .
When she asked if we were bringing her back , and we said no , she told us if Mum was n't back by 6.30 pm she 'd call the police .
' When we put Mum in the car , her eyes lit up and she said : " Ooh is n't this nice . "
She really perked up for the first time in ages . '
Ros says she called the police to check she was n't breaking the law , and claims she was told it was a civil matter which would n't involve them .
But that night two PCs arrived at Ros 's home at a quarter to midnight .
' They did n't seem to know why they were here , ' says Ros .
' I opened the door to Mum 's room to show them Mum curled up asleep , and then they left , apologising for bothering us . '
Two days later , however , the police - complete with battering ram - returned as back - up to social services to take Betty away .
Coventry City Council said this week that the police were only called in after an initial attempt to gain entry by social workers was refused .
But Ros says : ' Neighbours told me two official - looking people had knocked on the door in the afternoon , but I was in the garden and did n't hear them .
I did n't refuse entry .
' In the two days Mum was home , I 'd seen a real improvement in her .
' Her bed sores were healing and she 'd started to laugh and chat with neighbours over a cup of tea .
' All I want is my mum back home .
I 've done nothing wrong - unless you call wanting to care for your own mother wrong . '
The nursing home declined to comment on the case and Coventry City Council said it had exercised its statutory powers as a ' last resort ' .
Yesterday , Colin Green , Coventry City Council 's acting director of community services , told the Mail the actions taken to remove Betty to ' a place of safety ' were appropriate in the circumstances .
He said that social workers and health professionals had all agreed that Betty had a very high level of need which was best served in Butts Croft House .
He added : ' This situation could have been resolved quite differently had Rosalind Figg not removed her mother from the residential care home without the appropriate arrangements . '
A spokesman for West Midlands police said : ' Police were asked to assist social services to remove an elderly woman to a place of safety .
' A warrant was granted and an enforcer was taken in order to gain access to the property if needed .
The enforcer was not used .'
Removed to ' a place of safety '?
Those words must feel like a dagger through the heart of Ros Figg .
No wonder she feels this week 's shameful events were a travesty .

The G20 protests in central London turned violent today ahead of tomorrow 's summit , with a band of demonstrators close to the Bank of England storming a Royal Bank of Scotland branch , and baton - wielding police charging a sit - down protest by students .
Much of the protesting , from an estimated 4,000 people in the financial centre of the capital , was peaceful , but some bloody skirmishes broke out as police tried to keep thousands of people in containment pens surrounding the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street .
A minority of demonstrators seemed determined to cause damage , seeking confrontation as they surged towards police lines .
Late tonight , much of the City remained cordoned off .
By about 8 pm , running battles between riot police and demonstrators were taking place across London Bridge .
Bottles , sticks and bricks were thrown .
Nearer the heart of the City , police moved in to break up a ' climate camp ' on Bishopsgate , with baton - wielding officers said to be pushing through a line of tents and bicycles .
At least five armoured police vehicles were also at the scene .
The trouble broke out as Gordon Brown and Barack Obama announced that the G20 leaders were " within a few hours " of agreeing a global deal for economic recovery .
The G20 summit will be held tomorrow , amid high security , in London 's Docklands .
Earlier in the day , protesters targeting the Bank of England were met by lines of police whose tactics were to try to pen demonstrators inside multiple cordons of officers .
" It 's our street , it 's our street , " the protesters chanted as they were forced forward on to the line .
At one stage , after midday , riot officers and police dogs and horses removed some 20 protesters who had spent a quarter of an hour ransacking an RBS branch , tearing out computers and telephones .
To cheers and shouts , they smashed several of the bank 's windows , writing " burn a banker " and " scum " in spray paint .
Police in riot gear inside the bank tackled protesters trying to climb in through the smashed windows .
Subsequently , at least 10 protesters sitting down in the street close to the Bank of England were left with bloody head wounds after being charged by officers with batons at around 4.30 pm .
One woman , said to be an Italian student , was carried off unconscious .
Tonight the Metropolitan police said 32 people had been arrested .
The offences ranged from threatening behaviour and criminal damage to violent disorder ; two were arrested for aggravated burglary on the RBS building and one for attempted arson on the branch .
One was detained in possession of a class - A drug , while another 12 protesters who had turned up at the protest in a blue armoured personnel carrier were arrested in connection with possession of police uniforms and road traffic offences .
Some buildings in the City were boarded up in anticipation of trouble , with staff warned to work from home or dress down .
As protesters began to gather , after 11 am , some City workers were seen waving £ 10 notes at them from office windows .
After the charge against the sit - down protest at students , there were complaints that officers had been heavy handed .
" When people surrounded RBS , I could understand police tactics , " said Jack Bright , 19 .
" We were sat down , trying to have a peaceful protest , but they started whacking us . "
With his head wounds bandaged up by an ITN crew , Finn O'Sullivan , 21 , said : " There was a girl in front of me who got hit .
Then a bloke got hit and fell to the floor .
I was next in line and just remember shields coming down on us .
The police were stamping and kicking .
I asked them to let me through the line for medical treatment but they said no . "
Earlier police spent an hour clearing and sealing off the branch of RBS that had been targeted .
The firm is at the centre of a row over £ 703,000 - a- year pension payments to Sir Fred Goodwin , the disgraced former chief executive – and the branch had been closed today as a precaution .
By midday , around 60 protesters and police were involved in scuffles , which saw officers pelted with bottles , eggs , fruit and paint .
Some officers also had their helmets ripped from their heads and thrown into the air , which turned pink and red as protesters let off smoke bombs .
Police responded by using truncheons , batons and pepper spray .
Protesters pushing against the police on Threadneedle Street provoked intermittent skirmishes that left several officers and demonstrators injured .
Police used truncheons and batons to beat back the protesters each time they surged forward .
Some in the pens demanded to be released , saying they were being denied the right to march .
Scotland Yard said corralling the demonstrators into the area was a legitimate tactic as missiles were being thrown at police officers on Threadneedle Street .
A spokesman said that the pens would remain in place for as long as necessary , but by 3 pm police had loosened the cordon around the Bank and allowed crowds to filter away along Queen Victoria Street .
Injured demonstrators with bleeding heads and necks were ushered through the crowd while others handed out milk so that people could wash the pepper spray from their eyes and mouths .
Harry , dressed as the Grim Reaper , led the procession from Moorgate to the Bank of England .
His costume did not amuse the police , however , who demanded that he remove his skull mask so they could see his face .
He said it was the first time he had marched in 10 years .
" I 'm protesting for the small individuals in Britain who have been left with their pants down as the government bails out the banks for billions of dollars .
Where 's the money for the struggling baker , butcher , small marketing people and architectural companies ? "
But by late afternoon tempers around the main protest zone were fraying , as demonstartors complained they were being blocked in by police and not being allowed to leave .
Then , at around 7 pm , the police moved in on the climate camp .
Rebecca Pearse , of the Legal Observer Collective , who said they worked with police to provide a witness of events , said that until the police moved in " it had been all sunshine , smiles , cake , food and drums .
Then it just escalated . "
Too Fat for the Boy Scouts ?
New Weight Requirement Angers Some
New height / weight requirements bar some from participating in scouting events .
May 6 , 2009  -- Larry Armstrong has been volunteering with his local Boy Scout branch for years , chaperoning trips , serving on the council committee , even becoming certified in archery instruction for a day camp .
But Armstrong , at 6 - foot , 2 - inches tall and about 370 pounds , may no longer qualify for some scout outings because he 's overweight , part of a new push by the national organization to ensure the scouts and their volunteers are healthy .
A new mandatory weight requirement by the national Boy Scouts of America that will take effect next January has some longtime volunteers concerned they will be left out of trips they 've enjoyed with their sons for years .
According to the chart outlined in the national health and medical record form , Armstrong 's weight must come down to a minimum of 239 pounds before he 'll be allowed on certain " high adventure " trips that take him more than 30 minutes away from emergency care by ground transportation .
" It looks like they 're trying to get the perfect person , " said Armstrong , who volunteers with Troop 458 out of Chapmansboro , Tenn .
" And that 's not going to happen . "
In Los Angeles , Joshua Godinez faces the same problem .
He defined himself as " pretty obese " at 5 - foot - 6 and 270 pounds .
Godinez said he already sticks to non-strenuous activities .
He recently took a 90 - minute hike along local roads , he said .
But Godinez said he understands why some volunteers are taking exception to the new guidelines , which are discussed on the online Web site he runs that compiles scouting stories and commentary .
" I think the idea is sound , " he said .
" I do n't know if people were ready for them to just drop it into the program . "
According to the BSA chart , which it says is taken directly from federal health guidelines , Godinez needs to weigh a maximum of 201 pounds before going on a " high adventure " trip with his 17 - year - old son .
The recommended weight for his height is between 118 and 167 pounds .
" High adventure " is a term used to describe activities such as long treks that snake through back country .
According to an FAQ sheet from the BSA regarding health and medical records , the height / weight requirements would not prohibit overweight volunteers at most of the BSA resident camps , which are reachable by car and Cub Scout programs , which are , by nature , not strenuous because of the young age of the boys involved .
" This was a decision made by the health and safety committee , " BSA national spokesman Deron Smith said .
" I think that the reason behind this , this is just part of the ongoing effort of the Boy Scouts to insure they are constantly improving the safety " of scouts and their leaders .
" The goal of these policies is certainly not to restrict anyone from volunteering or participating in the scouting program , " he said . "
" For high adventure activities for which medical care may be delayed , restrictions based on standardized height / weight ratios are now mandatory , " according to the FAQ .
A medical evaluation by a doctor is now also required annually for trips lasting longer than 72 consecutive hours .
Will Boy Scouts Lose Volunteers ?
Armstrong said his weight has only been a problem when he tried to sign up to attend the BSA 's Florida Sea Base with his youngest son Matthew , 8 , a Wolf Scout .
The Sea Base is a " high adventure " camp that offers ocean activities .
" I did n't know until midway that there was a weight requirement , " he said .
Armstrong said he lost 40 pounds and passed a doctor - administered physical and completed a swim test , but it was n't enough to allow him on the June 15 trip as he was still too heavy for some of the ladders at the facility .
Armstrong said he 's concerned that enforcement of this new policy will mean fewer volunteers , which are hard enough to find as it is .
" It takes a heck of a person to do this , " he said .
Commenters on Godinez 's Web site , www.boyandgirlscouts.com, had the same concerns .
" This is nuts , " one poster wrote .
" Guidelines are welcome , not mandatory policy .
Risk and ability to participate should be a matter between the boy / parent and trained medical staff , not an arbitrary table . "
Both Armstrong and Godinez said they are trying to lose weight , a battle they 've been fighting for years .
Armstrong said he 's cut out sodas and sweet tea .
But he said he has n't weighed 239 pounds , his maximum weight for participation in high adventure activities , since " probably when I was a young guy . "
The national Boy Scout destinations , such as the Florida Sea Base , have always had these standards , Smith said .
According to the FAQ , local councils will be able to impose additional requirements on top of the national policy , depending on the activity in their region .
" We want to note that these policies do not restrict a person 's ability to volunteer in the scouting program and are not meant to make it difficult to participate in scouting activities ; rather , they are meant to ensure the health and safety of those who participate in high adventure activities , " Smith said in an e-mailed statement to ABCNews.com .
" Therefore , we do not expect it will greatly impact many volunteers or leaders . "
Armstrong said he was concerned that the new requirements would preclude him from teaching archery next year , something he 's done for years .
The day camp , he believes , is more than 30 minutes away from a medical facility .
He 's also now questioning whether , under the new requirement , he wo n't be able to help his older son , 16 , complete his Eagle Scout project , which involves pouring concrete to improve a school 's baseball batting cage .
But Hugh Travis , scout executive of the Middle Tennessee Council , said Armstrong would not be prevented from participating in non-high adventure activities locally and that while there are changes , height and weight requirements are nothing new for the Boy Scouts .
" The Boy Scouts are concerned about childhood and adult obesity , " he said .
" The primary concern is for the health and safety and welfare of the scouts and the adult leaders . "
When asked what affect the new requirements would have on his volunteers , Travis said he does n't expect much of any .
Out of about 12,000 volunteers in the Middle Tennessee Council , he said , only Armstrong has complained .
A few minutes ago , the Pritzker Award ceremony took place in Buenos Aires , Argentina .
This year , the prize was awarded to swiss architect Peter Zumthor .
Our correspondent Martin Bravo was there and sent us this photos of the event :
I was enchanted by Twitter on the opening day of Brainstorm Green .
By creating what ’s called a hashtag for the event – in this case , # FortuneGreen – those of us who organized the Fortune conference about business and the environment encouraged people at the event to tweet about it .
And we made it easy for anyone to follow or search for a stream of tweets from the event .
So I opened my laptop and , in real time , read dispatches from the event :
What was being said , what others thought about about what was being said , big ideas , trivial observations , critiques of our speaker , links to photos from the scene–all in 140 characters or less , the limit on the size of messages that can flow through Twitter .
( For an explanation of Twitter , see this . )
While the size of each message is limited , there ’s no limit on the number of 140 - character dispatches you can send .
So people , including me , were sending out dozens of tweets per hour .
By searching Twitter ( at http://search.twitter.com/) for Tweets containing # FortuneGreen — are you still with me here ?— anyone can see everything that was said about the event .
Kind of fun .
Some examples from today ’s session , and I wo n’t try to translate all the shorthand now :
oppgreen : http://twitpic.com/3sv27
- Cowboy Clinton at # fortunegreen today … check out his cowboy boots … yeehaw !
patrickdo : @mlamonica thanks for the link , great story on Bill Clinton at # fortunegreen mlamonica : Green business is key to tackling climate change , says Bill Clinton .
link to full story this time http://t.cnet.com/4g #fortunegreen DavidSwardlick : Pres. Clinton - the only morally accepable way to controll population in the world is to help get all the girls into schools # FortuneGreen Milieunet : RT @greenwombat : Clinton : Arizona & Nevada : “ Those are two of the places it would be easiest to make energy independent . ”
# FortuneGreen
You get the idea .
Anyway , I was tweeting merrily along after moderating a panel on climate change politics in Washington when I sent out the following :
MarcGunther : EDF ’s Fred Krupp , NRG ’s David Crane , Duke ’s Jim Rogers say , give away 100 % of permits under cap and trade at first # FortuneGreen
During my panel , I had understood Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund , CEO David Crane of NRG Energy and Jim Rogers , the CEO of Duke Energy , who all belong to the U.S. Climate Action Partnership , to say that all of the allowances under a cap - and - trade program for carbon emissions should initially be given away .
The question of whether to give away or auction those allowances — essentially , permits to pollute — is a contentious one , for reasons not worth going into here .
To my surprise , my tweet set off a bit of a storm in the world of energy and environmental bloggers , including some not at the event .
My tweet turned out to be the result of a miscommunication or misunderstanding on my part .
Of course , since I was reporting live during the event , I did n’t bother to check my facts .
I do n’t blame Twitter for that .
That was my fault .
But I learned two lessons that would have been obvious had I done a little more thinking and a little less tweeting .
Lesson No. 1 is this :
Trying to cover an event live on Twitter — especially if you are a participant , as I was — does n’t allow time to check facts or seek out an alternative point of view or think for more than a few seconds about what to say .
There ’s not enough time to do anything but tweet .
In fact , it ’s hard just to tweet and pay attention .
You ’re multitasking .
It ’s closer to court stenography or simultaneous translation than to real journalism , which requires sifting and thinking .
Or at least it should .
Lesson No. 2 : There ’s not much you can do when you make a mistake on Twitter , particularly if you are dealing with a complex subject .
After trading emails with bloggers , NRDC and EDF , I got the following from Dave Hawkins , NRDC ’s leading climate expert , who was with us at Brainstorm Green :
What USCAP recommends is that nearly all allocations go , not to emitters , but for consumer rebates / dividends , low - carbon technology , efficiency , low–income protection , adaptation , and international engagement .
That includes initial allocations to local distribution companies , with a requirement that the value be passed through to customers and / or invested in efficiency … .
You asked about NRDC ’s position on allowance distribution .
It is set forth in the attached Cap 2.0 proposal and we believe it is consistent with the USCAP Blueprint .
It is on the web at http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/cap2.0/files/synthesis.pdf
As you can see from figures 2 and 3 of the document , allowance value is focused on clean and advanced energy deployment , efficiency , and consumer dividends from the start and after 15 years all value would go back to consumers as dividends .
Of the estimated $ 100 billion annual value at the start of the program about $ 8.9 billion is proposed for distribution to energy - intensive industry to prevent off - shoring of production and emissions from these industries .
This gets phased down over the initial 15 years of the program .
In 2012 more than $ 51 billion per year would go directly for efficiency and low - carbon energy RD&D and deployment , with more of the remainder going to consumer rebates and dividends , adaptation , forestry and agriculture incentives , and international engagement .
Try saying that in 140 characters .
Even if I could , it would now be impossible to reaggregate the audience that read the original mistaken tweet .
All I can do now is send out a tweet about this blogpost — my best effort to correct the mistake .
The real mistake , though , is trying to cover a story in little live bursts .
You ca n’t concentrate , you ca n’t think , you ca n’t convey a complex idea , you ca n’t persuade or explain .
That ’s why Twitter is bad for journalism–or , more specifically , it is not the right vehicle within which to do journalism .
Twitter will good for journalism in other ways .
It ’s an effective way to point other people to content on the web .
By following others ’ tweets , I ’ve discovered blogs or stories I would otherwise have missed .
I ’ve quickly collected several hundred “ followers ” in just a few weeks , so I can tell about what I ’m writing or reading .
Twitter ’s valuable in other ways , too .
It ’s a real - time window into what people are doing and thinking and talking about .
It has enormous potential , already demonstrated , as an organizing tool .
Anyone in the communications business probably ought to play around with Twitter and other social media like Facebook .
But I had a brief chat with Peter Darbee , the CEO of PG&E Corp. , during Brainstorm Green that has stuck in my mind longer than any tweet .
He told me that he ’s going to cut back on some of his day - to - day work so that he can carve out a couple of hours every day for thinking .
Imagine that .
Just thinking –no phone , email , meetings or , presumably , tweets .
I ca n’t remember the last time I spent 15 minutes thinking , unless you count time I spend running .
Something ’s lost because of all the attention we devote to Gmail and blogs and Facebook and Twitter .
As Joni Mitchell put it , “ do n’t it always seem to go that you do n’t know what you got till it ’s gone . ”

Bedbugs , largely eliminated from developed countries after World War II , are back , and harder to kill than ever .
The less - than - quarter - inch bugs and their miniscule eggs live in mattresses , books , crevices in the floor .
The little suckers ( pun , alas , intended ) can go more than a year without feeding .
And unlike termites , which cluster in the thousands , bedbugs can make trouble in very small numbers ; if a single female survives an extermination , she and her hatching eggs will reinfest the space .
Pest - control companies consider bedbugs their biggest challenge .
After the banning of DDT and other harsh pesticides , exterminators have had to rely on something called Integrated Pest Management , an “ environmentally sensitive , ” multipronged approach .
They can , for example , bake bugs to death by warming a room to 130 degrees using industrial - strength heaters ; use mega vacuum cleaners to suck the bugs out ; or apply Cryonite , a carbon - dioxide snow that freezes the fluids in the insects ’ cells , causing instant death .
Bedbug dogs do n’t actually do anything to bedbugs .
But if the idea is to use less pesticide , dogs may be your best bet .
A controlled experiment by entomologists at the University of Florida found that dogs were 98 percent accurate in locating live bedbugs in hotel rooms .
In a hotel or apartment building , dogs can determine which rooms require attention , avoiding the telltale stench of mass fumigation and saving thousands of dollars by treating only the affected rooms .
( Not that the dogs are cheap : they typically cost about $ 325 an hour . )
According to recent field research , one trained dog - and - handler team is more effective at detection than trained humans alone , and accomplishes the job in significantly less time .
“ You see this ? ” says John Russell of New Jersey ’s Action Termite & Pest Control , pointing into an overstuffed Manhattan closet where one of his dogs , a black Lab named Sara , has indicated a problem .
“ Clutter !
That ’s why bedbugs are so hard to find . ”
The apartment ’s tenant , who has lived in his one - bedroom for 34 years , hovers nearby .
When Sara noses one of the many jackets within , the tenant grabs it .
“ I ’ll just throw it out , ” he says , ushering the garment into the hallway .
Sara is n’t one of Peruyero ’s dogs , but a graduate of a competing outfit , the Florida Canine Academy , which claims to have been the first to enter the bedbug business , and also certifies teams to detect bombs , drugs , money , weapons , termites , and arson .
Florida Canine ’s trainees , selected for their work ethic , drive , and desire to please , are taught to gesture with their nose , because , “ dogs who give the paw , ” the owner , Bill Whitstine , says scornfully , “ can scratch furniture or end up spreading the bugs around . ”
Rival trainers commonly accuse each other of failure to teach dogs to distinguish between live and dead bugs .
The National Entomology Scent Detection Canine Association sprang up in 2006 , partly in response to “ false alerting ” problems among bug - sniffing dogs .
“ We were really concerned that a few dogs improperly trained could tarnish the whole industry , ” the president , J. Louis Witherington , told me .
Still , disagreement persists about the best way to train and accredit bedbug dogs .
“ A lot of programs have been successful training narcotic dogs , bomb dogs , arson dogs , ” Peruyero says .
“ But it ’s a totally different world with bedbug dogs .
The only thing tougher is training dogs to detect melanoma . ”

20,000 plus new samples of malware are detected every day , say experts Twelve million computers have been hijacked by cyber- criminals and detected by security vendor McAfee since January , the firm has said .
It reports there has been a 50 % increase in the number of detected so - called " zombie " computers since 2008 .
The true number of newly hijacked PCs is likely to be higher than those detected by McAfee alone .
The figures come as a report from Deloitte said a global approach to cyber - security was needed .
" Doing nothing is not an option , " said Deloitte 's Greg Pellegrino .
Everything that depended on cyberspace face unprecedented risks , said Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ( DTT ) .
" This issue is moving so quickly , and with so much at stake economically and in terms of safety and security for people , we do n't have 100 years to figure this out , " explained Mr Pellegrino , who is a global public sector industry leader at DTT .
McAfee also revealed that the United States now hosted the world 's largest percentage of infected computers at 18 % with China a not too distant second with just over 13 % .
" The massive expansion of these botnets provides cyber - criminals with the infrastructure they need to flood the web with malware , " said Jeff Green , senior vice - president of McAfee .
" Essentially , this is cyber - crime enablement . "
' Daily living '
The DTT findings revealed a growing awareness of the role the internet plays in so many different aspects of our lives from security to commerce and from transportation to communication .
Better cyber - security measures will benefit global commerce , says the report " We are seeing this change from protecting the internet to a conversation about how we succeed and prosper in cyberspace , " Mr Pellegrino told the BBC .
" Security spending is growing at a rate never seen before while the threat environment is growing at a pace of 40 % a year .
" In terms of volume and severity of incidents , the math does n't work and we have to come up with a different approach that requires public and private sectors working together , " Mr Pellegrino said .
" We are talking about daily living , " said fellow author Gary McAlum , who is a retired US Air Force colonel and senior manager of security and privacy services at Deloitte .
" There is a lot of discussion about the economy and the military and the public and private sector , but we have now reached a sense of urgency about the interconnectedness of all these areas . "
That view was echoed by a member of the US military top brass who just gave evidence to a branch of the House Armed Services Committee .
" Our economy , the nation 's critical infrastructure , and many of our military operations depend on unfettered access to cyberspace , " said Lt Gen Keith Alexander , the director of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) who also heads the Pentagon 's new Cyber Command .
" Maintaining freedom of action in cyberspace in the 21st Century is as inherent to US interests as freedom of the seas was in the 19th Century , and access to air and space in the 20th Century . "
He has called for the creation of a digital warfare force for the future and has stated that the US needs to reorganise its offensive and defensive cyber-operations .
Prominence
The Deloitte study included interviews conducted with government officials and industry experts from around the world .
While it revealed a patchwork approach to the problem it also showed it was one that was gaining prominence .
There are 32,000 suspected cyber- attacks every 24 hours , says the NSA " We were very pleased that there was a similar tone and awareness and leadership effort coming from different countries across the world , " Mr Pellegrino said .
" Clearly this particular issue has a different context depending on where you are in the world .
We can not afford to go backwards . "
In America , President Obama has made the issue of cyber - security a priority .
Shortly after taking office he ordered a 60 - day review that has now been delivered to his desk .
It is understood the release of the review has been delayed by the ongoing H1N1 swine flu crisis .
When the report is made public , it is expected that the president will also announce his choice for cyber - security tsar to lead the charge .
While the Deloitte research said security in Asia - Pacific needed to " catch up " it noted that the United Kingdom was in the process of writing a national cyber strategy with an emphasis on public - private partnership .
On the continent , the European Commission has urged member states to co-ordinate on cyber - security measures , while in Latin America the report authors conclude that there is a " diversity of approaches " .
Canada has completed its own cyber - security review and this year will be implementing the National Cyber - Security Strategy as well as creating a new Directorate of Cyber - Security with a mandate to engage closely with the private sector .
Despite all these efforts , the Deloitte authors point out that time is of the essence .
" Not only do we have to take action , we do n't have enough time , " warned Mr Pellegrino .
Mr McAlum agreed and said mapping a clear strategy was crucial .
" We need to get our house in order first so that we can interact with the rest of the world with one voice , with clear roles and responsibilities aligned . "

The bootsector of DOS 1.0 is celebrating its 28th birthday today ( it contains the timestamp “ 7 - May - 81 ” ) , so let ’s look at it more closely .
Here it is :

DOS 1.0 shipped on a 160 KB single sided disk .
The boot code in the IBM PC ’s BIOS loaded the first sector into RAM at segment 0x0000 , offset 0x7C00 and ran it .
Later versions of BIOS checked for 0xAA55 in the last word of the bootsector , but the first version did not .
Note that DOS 1.0 is also pre-BIOS Parameter Block , i.e. the bootsector does not contain any information about the physical layout of the disk , since there was only a single disk size .
What the boot sector is supposed to do is read “ IBMBIO.COM ” and “ IBMDOS.COM ” into RAM and run them – these are the DOS system files for machine abstraction and DOS API , respectively .
In MS - DOS , they would be called “ IO. SYS ” and “ MSDOS.SYS ” .
But the DOS 1.0 bootsector takes quite a lot of shortcuts .
It assumes it ’s always a 40 track , 8 sectors single - sided disk and the two files occupy the first sectors of the data area contiguously – something that SYS .
COM could guarantee when making a disk bootable .
So the bootsector first loads the first sector of the root directory ( hardcoded to track 0 , sector 4 ) and compares the first two entries with “ IBMBIO.COM ” and “ IBMDOS.COM ” .
For some reason , the comparison is case - insensitive , although DOS only allows uppercase filenames .
00000600 49 42 4d 42 49 4f 20 20 43 4f 4d 06 00 00 00 00 |IBMBIO COM .....| 00000610 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f7 02 02 00 80 07 00 00 |................| 00000620 49 42 4d 44 4f 53 20 20 43 4f 4d 06 00 00 00 00 |IBMDOS COM .....| 00000630 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0d 03 06 00 00 19 00 00 |................|
If they are not there , it prompts the user to replace the disk and tries again .
Otherwise , it loads 20 sectors starting from track 0 , sector 8 to segment 0x0060 , offset 0x0000 into memory and jumps there .
0x60:0x0000 is the same as the linear address 0x0600 .
On the IBM PC , 0x0000 to 0x03FF are occupied by the interrupts vectors , 0x0400 to 0x4 FF is used by BIOS for its variables , and DOS 1.0 uses 0x500 to 0x5 FF as the “ DOS Communication Area ” , so code can start at 0x0600 .

These are the first few bytes of IBMBIO .
COM .
Its birthday is about six weeks from now , but I am going to post about its internals next week .
Let us finally look at the complete commented disassembly of the boot sector .
It compiles with NASM , but will emit a few bytes differently because of variations in the assembly encoding – but variations in size have been compensated wit NOPs .
It is actually quite easy to read .
Nine Inch Nails released their new tour sampler NIN / JA on their website a few hours ago .
While the regular quality MP3s can be downloaded straight from their server , the band has set up their own BitTorrent tracker for the higher quality ' lossless ' downloads .
Trent Reznor , the frontman of Nine Inch Nails has always been pro-filesharing and admitted to downloading music using BitTorrent .
Unlike others in the music biz , the NIN members are no stranger to BitTorrent .
“ We use torrents ourselves , and we know that most NIN fans are tech - savvy and familiar with file - sharing , so we want to experiment with ways to use that to our advantage , instead of making the mistake of trying to fight or ignore it , as so many artists and labels do . ” NIN ’s Art Director Rob Sheridan explained to TorrentFreak last year .
In fact , when they released the album ‘ Ghosts ‘ for free last year their server could n’t handle the high traffic numbers and downloads , so the linked to the torrents they had uploaded to The Pirate Bay instead .
Thanks to The Pirate Bay , many fans did n’t have to wait till the server recovered , and the torrent quickly became one of the most downloaded files on the tracker .
With the release of their tour promo NIN / JA today , NIN decided to prevent similar server troubles , and the band now offers . torrent downloads for the higher quality ( and size ) downloads .
The tracker used for the torrents is hosted by the band itself on the tracker .
nin.com subdomain .
The tracker is already being used by thousands of fans just hours after it went up .
Self - hosted BitTorrent trackers may become a new hype .
Two weeks ago , the government - owned Norwegian Broadcasting ( NRK ) had set up its very own BitTorrent tracker to distribute some of their TV - shows .
Thus far , we have n’t spotted NIN ’s tour sampler on any of the public torrent sites , but it wo n’t take long before it spreads .
The official website requires people to submit their email address in order to get the links to the DRM - free downloads .
It ’s well worth it though .
Update : Apparently the tracker at nin.com was also used for some of the previous releases , we were not aware of this .
Conservatives have been making fun of me for my proposal to shoot
pollution molecules straight up in the air .
They talk that the
technology necessary to do this is n't ready .
They say that we are
playing with fire - meddling in things we do n't understand .
There has
been a fundamental misunderstanding of my proposal .
No new technology is
needed .
I merely suggested , that from this point forward , Harry Reid
and Nancy Pelosi should look straight up when speaking .
This should
generate more than enough pollution to get the job done .
Swedish designers
Humans since 1982 have created a digital clock made of 24 analogue clocks , which spell out the time with their hands .
The designers have also developed a typeface derived from letter forms created by banks of clocks .
See demonstrations of the Clock Clock on YouTube here and here .
The prototype Clock Clock will be exhibited at the Rhösska design museum in Göteborg from June till mid August 2009 .
See our earlier story on Celebrating the Cross 1 by humans since 1982 .
Here 's some text from humans since 1982 :
--
we are designstudents at HDK Göteborg in Sweden and gathered under the name " humans since 1982 " .
After having successfully launched our " Surveillance Light " and our lounger " Celebrating the cross 1 " we now developed a prototype of a wall clock : we call it " The clock clock " .
Hereby 24 manual alarm clocks show the time in a digital manner .

Yoplait yogurt , the 19th largest dairy processor in the country , announced today that by August of this year , all Yoplait branded products will be made with milk that is 100 percent farmer certified to come from cows not treated with rbGH ( or recombinant bovine growth hormone ) an artificial hormone also known as rbST ( recombinant bovine somatotropin ) .
In an e-mail announcement sent out Friday , Yoplait noted that it ’s the first leading yogurt brand to go “ rbGH - free , ” which may come as a surprise to companies such as Stonyfield , Nancy ’s , Cascade Fresh , Brown Cow , and other organic industry leaders , all of which have been in the forefront of the movement to reject the synthetic hormone in milk products .
“ It ’s an honor to welcome them into the no-rbGH club , ” said Gary Hirschberg , the Stonyfield CE - Yo.
“ Better Yo - Late than Yo - Never . ”
In 1993 , Stonyfield was the first dairy in the U.S. to secure agreements with milk suppliers not to use artificial hormones like rbGH ( trade name Posilac ) soon after it was introduced .
The use of rbGH has been linked to increased rates of infections in dairy cows , elevated antibiotic use , and unresolved questions about its links to serious human health risks , including cancer .
Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Japan and all 25 members of the European Union have banned the use of rbGH , and the Codex Alimentarius , the United Nations ’ main food safety body , twice decided that it could not endorse the safety of rbGH for human health .

In case you ca n’t recall why U.S. companies have been pumping cows full of this junk for 16 years , just a small reminder that rbGH was brought to us by Monsanto , which has much sway in our government .
( For the seminal article on the chemical giant , read the piece in Vanity Fair . )
And , in yet another winning decision by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the agency gave its seal of approval , despite serious questions about the safety of rbGH .
According to the Breast Cancer Action ( BCA ) , when rbGH is injected into a cow , that cow ’s milk will contain higher amounts of another powerful hormone called insulin growth factor 1 ( IGF - 1 ) .
IGF - 1 is natural and necessary , but too much of it may cause health problems .
Studies have shown that elevated levels of IGF - 1 in humans may increase the risk of breast cancer .
More research is needed to better understand whether the elevated levels of IGF - 1 in milk make their way into our bloodstream .
Although it has n’t yet been proven that the use of rbGH will definitively lead to breast cancer , BCA notes that the current evidence is cause for concern and for action .
Slight problem : Yoplait , owned by General Mills , marketed its yogurt as being healthy for women , and participated in breast cancer awareness projects , including pledging a 10 - cent donation to a breast cancer organization for every pink lid consumers mailed back to the company .
Because Yoplait yogurt was made with milk from cows injected with rbGH , there was a contradiction in their message .
Yoplait ’s move away from rbGH can be linked in large part to the BCA ’s Think Before You Pink campaign — which demands transparency and accountability on the part of companies that align themselves with breast cancer and urges companies to do all they can to ensure their products do n’t contribute to the high rates of the disease .
BCA uses the term “ pinkwashing ” to describe companies , like Yoplait , that participated in breast cancer fundraising or “ awareness ” campaigns but manufactured products that may be linked to the disease .
One of the reasons the Yoplait campaign was successful is due in large part to consumer education efforts by organizations such as the Oregon chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility .
“ When Yoplait says that they ’re dropping rbGH because of consumer demand , they ’re not kidding , ” said Rick North , PSR ’s Project Director for Safe Food , who has been on the frontlines of this effort .
“ They ’ve received thousands of postcards from all over the country opposing rbGH and also letters from hospitals and colleges expressing their displeasure with the hormone .
This was not only the right thing for them to do , it was the smart thing . ”
As it turns out , Americans do n’t want their milk messed with .
A recent Consumers Union poll [ PDF ] revealed that 70 percent of consumers polled are concerned about dairy cows being given synthetic growth hormones and 93 percent of consumers agree that dairies that produce milk and milk products without artificial growth hormones should be allowed to label their products as being free of these hormones .
Consumer demand for rbGH - free dairy led big retailers like Wal - Mart , Krogers , Starbucks , Tillamook , Safeway and Chipotle Restaurants to get on the milk wagon and phase out the hormone in all of their dairy products .
California Dairies , Inc. , which produces nearly 10 percent of the nation ’s milk , went rbGH - free last year .
And , by the end of summer 2009 , the New England dairy industry will be rbGH - free as well .
Faced with dwindling sales of rbGH , Monsanto tried to thwart informed consumer choice by pressuring the FDA and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to restrict labeling of such products as “ rbGH - free . ”
That did n’t work out too well , so Monsanto and their supporters launched a state - by - state assault attempting to ban or restrict rbGH - free labeling in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Ohio , Indiana , Kansas , Utah , and Missouri .
So far , these attempts have not been successful , as dozens of farmers , environmental and consumer groups joined forces to beat them back .
Still limping along , a bogus non-profit called American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology ( AFACT ) was formed last year to join the battle .
This “ grassroots ” group received funding from Monsanto and was formed by Osborne and Barr , a PR firm founded by two ex-Monsanto employees .
Seems that AFACT is actually ALIE .
In the meantime , stay tuned and ready for action to make sure your favorite dairy can continue to label their products “ rbGH - free ” .
Be sure to buy rbGH - free milk from one of the aforementioned brands , and even better , buy organic .

" There is nothing more difficult to take in hand , more perilous to conduct , or more uncertain in its success , than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things . "
– Niccolo Machiavelli ( 1469 -1572 )
A new world order began when the Berlin Wall came down in late 1989 .
The next new world order began when the U.S. Army staged the toppling of Saddam Hussein ’s statue after the fall of Baghdad in late 2003 .
A brave new world order , the one we ’re now in the early stages of , began in late 2008 when the U.S. economy dropped down a rabbit hole that may go all the way to China .
The trajectory should look familiar ; it traces a path taken by hegemons throughout the ages , straight to the cliff they fell from .
As with great powers before us , the military might that created our empire has become the instrument of its downfall .
Niccolo Machiavelli , who served as secretary to Florence and had extensive dealings with the infamous Cesare Borgia , is probably history ’s premier political scientist .
Machiavelli insisted that “ A prince ought to have no other aim or thought , nor select anything else for his study , than war and its rules and discipline . ”
So we can see that the guy was no hand - wringing peace pansy .
Conversely , however , he said of war that , “ a well - established republic or kingdom would never permit its subjects or citizens to employ it for their profession . ”
Machiavelli asserted that “ as long as [ the Romans ] were wise and good , never permitted that their citizens should take up this practice as their profession . ”
It was only when Pompeii and Caesar established the institution of emperor as professional warrior that Rome ’s republic began to erode .
Eventually the army ’s elite Praetorian Guard “ became formidable to the Senate and damaging to the emperor ” and “ gave the Empire and took it away from anyone they wished . ”
In his 1961 farewell address , President Dwight Eisenhower warned America to “ guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence ” by the “ military - industrial complex ” for the same reason Machiavelli cautioned heads of state of his day to beware of advisers who “ in times of peace , desire war because they are unable to live without it . ”
In ’61 , Eisenhower admonished that the “ economic , political , even spiritual ” influence of America ’s new war industry was “ felt in every city , every statehouse , every office of the federal government . ”
A decade into the new American century , militarism has woven itself into the very fiber of our society .
Political careers and regional economies are wholly dependent upon it .
The defense industry has transformed America into a warfare - welfare state , and it does n’t bother making a secret of it .
Witness the recent uproar over Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ proposed defense budget “ cutbacks ” that are actually an increase .
Lipstick neocon Joe Lieberman led the protest over Gates ’ refusal to expand the F - 22 stealth fighter purchase .
At $ 360 million a pop , the F - 22 is a Cold War albatross that was designed to go toe - to - toe with the Russkies in the skies over Europe .
Now , its mission involves air - to - air combat against jumbo jets armed with box cutters ; but it ’s built in Joe ’s state of Connecticut , so it ’s of vital importance to national security .
Even more deplorable than the persistence of Lieberman and other congressional war mongrels at investing in what defense analyst William Lind calls “ a military museum ” is their willingness to let the Pentagon dictate policy .
From the beginning of our Mesopotamian mistake , the generals , supposedly , were calling the shots .
When then - Army chief of staff Eric Shinseki said we were n’t taking enough troops into Iraq , then - defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld handed him a Purple Heart for the bruise he got where the door hit him on his way out .
From then on , all the generals said we did n’t need any more troops in Iraq than we already had there , so we did n’t need any more troops in Iraq .
Then the GOP lost the 2006 election , and Rumsfeld got his Purple Heart .
Young Mr. Bush decided it was time to go on a surgin ’ safari , and Gen. David Petraeus signed on to play bwana .
Even the once credible Thomas E. Ricks , who has done more than anyone to exalt Petraeus , admits that his idol has been pulling a confidence game on the American Congress and public since he assumed command of forces in Iraq .
In a February 2009 Washington Post article , Ricks wrote that Petraeus ’ agenda was “ not to bring the war to a close , but simply to show enough genuine progress that the American people would be willing to stick with it even longer . ”
Congress , the public , and Petraeus ’ critics in the military largely failed to recognize what he was up to , mainly because he patently misled them when he told the House Foreign Affairs Committee , “ We ’re after conditions that would allow our soldiers to disengage . ”
He was , in fact , after conditions that would never allow his soldiers to disengage , at least not during his lifetime , and possibly not during theirs .
Throughout his tenure in Iraq – first as commander in Mosul ( where he made his reputation as a counterinsurgency “ genius ” thanks to Ricks ’ fabrications ) , then as the general in charge of training Iraqi security forces , and finally as commander of international forces in Iraq – Petraeus has achieved short - term results by handing out guns to everybody and bribing them not to use the guns against U.S. troops or Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s forces .
As a result , Ricks admits , we have poured “ a lot of gasoline on the fire , ” and if we leave , “ it will be much worse than it was when Saddam was there . ”
So we can never leave .
What Petraeus deserves for his perfidy would cauterize his exit ramp .
He has been , instead , elevated to five - star deity status .
David Petraeus is the Douglas MacArthur of the 21st century – a general so dangerous that he challenges the commander in chief ’s constitutional authority .
As MacArthur did with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman , Petraeus poses the threat of challenging Barack H. Obama for his job come the next general election .
Do n’t think for a minute that a Petraeus / Palin ticket is too absurd to come to pass .
Look what ’s happened so far in the new American century .
In April 2008 , Mr. Bush announced that his “ main man ” Petraeus would be the decider of when and how U.S. troops would withdraw from Iran , and “ King David , ” now in charge of Central Command , has been the de facto commander in chief of the U.S. military ever since .
Now , President Obama ’s decisions must be sanctioned by Petraeus and the rest of the long - war generals .
Petraeus , his pet ox Ray Odierno , and Joint Chiefs chairman Mike Mullen all publicly opposed withdrawal timelines ( and the Obama candidacy ) during the 2008 presidential race .
Individually and as a group , they have waged an information campaign to desensitize the American public to the reality that their country may always be ensnared in counterproductive wars .
Babe Odierno is on record as wanting to keep more than 30,000 troops in Iraq until 2015 or so .
If you ’re watching , you ’ll see that they ’re blaming the resurgent violence in Iraq on the pending withdrawals from Iraqi cities , i.e. , the “ timelines . ”
When the 2012 political season rolls around , the reasons we ’re still in Iraq will be as slippery and amorphous as the reasons we invaded in the first place .
The Petraeus patrol is steering us into the same trap in the Bananastans , and President Obama either does n’t see that the road ahead looks identical to the one in the rear view mirror , or he figures he ’s powerless to reverse America ’s vector toward self - immolation , or he ’s dumber than he looks , or he just does n’t care .
These generals of ours , whose authority is too formidable for either the president or the Congress to oppose , do n’t have a clue how to win their wars .
They do n’t know their centers of gravity from their elbows , but that ’s okay .
They ’re not supposed to win their wars .
In fact , that would be counter to the real objective : to keep the gravy boat afloat and the cash caisson rolling along for as long as they possibly can .
That they ’re leaving tire tracks all over the Constitution they took an oath to support and defend by subverting the president ’s authority matters little to them .
Whether they ’re Manchurian candidate true believers , or Orwellian double thinkers , or simply take the Machiavellian position that ends justify means , I just ca n’t say .
I knew officers of all those flavors during my career .
I also knew officers of genuine moral vision and clarity ( as opposed to the Ann Coulter / Pat Robertson version of moral vision and clarity ) , but few of them were invited into the generals ’ club , and the few who managed to slip past the doorman have by now earned their Purple Hearts the way Shinseki did .
The generals we have left lie like other people eat , sleep , and go to the bathroom , all for the sake of preserving an institution that will never again have a peer competitor and will never be capable of defeating an - ism of any kind .
I believe we still have a window of opportunity to become the “ kinder , gentler nation ” and that “ shining city on the hill ” of a brave new world order , but the window is dwindling rapidly .
Our generals , openly disdainful of their commander in chief and the legislature , have stolen our country .
The zombie Republicans in Congress think it ’s patriotic to back the generals against the president , and the Democrats have folded like the Chicago Cubs in August .
Obama needs to step up to the plate , fire all of his four stars and that bureaucratic dimwit Gates , and take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things .
" We estimate that North Korea has as many as 320 Rodong missiles , which can be launched from mobile transporters anywhere in the country , and we are assessing the threat these pose , " he said .
BRUSSELS — European antitrust regulators , which have been aggressively pursuing what they see as anticompetitive practices among technology companies , could impose their largest fine ever in a market - dominance case against the chip maker Intel .
The size of the penalty will be discussed by representatives from 27 European Union governments in early May .
The decision would follow landmark rulings by the European Commission against Microsoft , which also is being investigated over its Internet Explorer browser , and a settlement with I.B.M. , which is again the subject of a complaint .
The commission began investigating Intel in 2000 after Advanced Micro Devices , its archrival , filed a complaint .
Both chip makers are based in the United States .
In two sets of charges , in 2007 and 2008 , the commission accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers , by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost .
Somehow a stimulus check just does n’t seem stimulating enough to jumpstart my flatlining bank account .
I ’m thinking I need to make a little extra dough on the side before I can start feeding any to our flagging economy , but I do n’t have any skills .
I ’ve thought about growing vegetables , building furniture , or washing windows to pad my pockets , but I do n’t have a garden , I ’m useless with a hammer , and … well , I do n’t want to work that hard .
So instead I ’m looking to make the most ( money ) using what I ’ve got at my fingertips .
After doing a little research , here are the resources I discovered , some of which I never even knew were valuable :
Hairy Business
Real hair is in huge demand for use as hair extensions , hairpieces , and wigs .
So , if ( like me ) you ca n’t grow weeds , but you can grow a mean head of hair , then check out the world ’s largest independent hair sale site , Hairtrader .
Now , you ca n’t just sell any old head of hair : hair must be naturally beautiful — that means it ’s never been bleached , permed , tinted , highlighted , chemically straightened , or otherwise subjected to the demands of modern life .
That rules out me and most of the western world too .
To date , the record sale was $ 2,500 for 25 ” of light brown hair .

If your urine is drug and alcohol - free , you might be able to strike ( liquid ) gold .
Thanks to the scads of people addicted to drugs and alcohol , there ’s a market for good , clean urine to help people ace their drug test .
Granted , you could go to jail for selling your pee , but as someone wise and famous once said ( probably someone who never attempted to sell their urine ) , without risk , there is no reward .
Urea Sample sells synthetic urine kits to folks looking to beat drug tests for up to $ 139.95 .
If you cut out the middle man and go straight to the source , you can make around $ 200 , according to arrest reports .
If risk is your thing and potential jail time is n’t too daunting , you could also consider selling your corneas , worth roughly $ 7000 .
Or if your pee is n’t pure , you can always just take it to the next level and opt to sell a kidney .
The advertising industry is desperate to find clever new ways to reach people .
They ’ve already placed ads at eye level on the back of the bathroom stall door , in school buses , on your favorite TV show , your laptop , iPod , and in video games .
Now they ’re eager to score new real estate — you !
In 2006 , Web - hosting company Globat purchased ad space on the back of a Lancaster , Pennsylvania man ’s neck for an undisclosed sum of money .
Robert Reames , III , age twenty - seven , had a globat.com ad tattooed on the back of his neck so he could buy a new car .
I ’ve often said , “ I have eyes on the back of my head , ” so I ’m thinking I should offer the back of my head to Lenscrafters … I ’ve heard many a lactating mother cry that throwing away expressed breast milk feels like throwing away liquid gold — and they ’re right .
While there are plenty of banks where you can sell / donate breast milk ( once you ’ve been screened of course ) , there ’s also a thriving black market of men — or couples — with a breast milk fetish .
( Maybe I ’m just lactose intolerant , but eew ! )
Still , I guess if guys can make money selling sperm , why ca n’t we put the old mammaries to work ?
Another way to go is to answer this classified ad : “ Got Milk ?
Earn $ 2000 per photo shoot modeling for Beautiful Pregnant.com , the only pregnancy / lactation site that has a touch of class .
” It ’s actually illegal to sell human organs or tissues , but that does n’t mean they ’re entirely worthless .
Many companies will “ compensate ” you for your time , and more specifically for your plasma — the water and protein - packed portion of your blood — which is easily replaced by the body .
To find a donation site in your area , visit Blood Banker .
Not only do they have a listing of blood banks that pay cash for your plasma , but they also list additional information about how often you can donate .
Note : a donor burns about 650 calories by donating one pint of blood !
No need to wait until you ’re dead to donate your body to science .
You can do so now , while you ’re still alive and kicking , to the tune of several hundred dollars a day , depending on the study .
Healthy as a horse ?
Great !
You ’re needed .
You ’re also needed if you smoke , have diabetes , are post - menopausal , have high blood pressure , suffer from insomnia , or have a history of depression .
And if you hate drugs , but love shopping , there are clinical trials just for you .
Even though drug studies are the most lucrative , research participants are also constantly needed for consumer product testing and mystery shopping sprees , where you can get paid to go to the movies , eat out , buy products , and even drink beer at pubs !
Why get $ 2500 or more for donating a little old egg ( okay , it ’s not so old , you need to be thirty - five or under ) when you can get more than $ 25,000 for delivering a fully hatched chick ?
If you need more than a little extra cash , surrogate pregnancy may be the way to go .
On top of the carrying fee , you get all your medical bills , travel expenses , and maternity clothes for free .
( And then you can keep that really cute pair of “ fat pants ” for a future non-pregnant time when you ’re feeling extra bloated . )
For all those older couples wanting to have children , infertile couples , or two - dad families out there , you wo n’t be just putting your uterus on the market for some fast cash , you ’ll be giving the gift of family .

If you ’re especially enterprising , you can follow starlets around paparazzi - style , wait for the inevitable heartbreak , then capture their tears in a vial , and sell them on eBay like one enterprising young man did recently with Paris Hilton ’s tears .
It ’s more of a long - term commitment , but you ’d be getting in on the ground floor of something unique .
The energy wasted by spam e-mails could power 2.4 million homes a year according to security firm McAfee .
But its report offers little advice as to how to avoid this problem .
The firm ’s report , produced with the help of environmental consultants ICF International , concludes that spam is responsible for the waste of 33 billion kilowatt hours of energy each year .
It also produces 17 million tons of CO2 , the same amount produced each year by three million cars .
However , it appears the actual production and sending of the spams make up just seven per cent or so of the energy costs ( though it ’s not as if spammers are likely to be carbon offsetting anyway ) .
Instead , most of the energy is used in filtering out the unwanted messages .
Around 16 % of the energy costs come from automated filtering .
The rest comes from recipients , with 27 % coming from having to retrieve legitimate messages from a spam folder , and just over 50 % coming from reading through spams which have evaded the filters and landed in the inbox .
According to the study , this means that the energy used in automated filtering actually pays for itself in environmental terms by saving on energy wasted by recipients .
Of course , more effective filtering would cut down energy costs ever further .
It ’s worth noting that there ’s a major caveat to the figures .
It appears the energy costs at the user end were estimated by taking the time it takes for people to sift through e-mails and working how much power their computers used during this time .
The drawback with that method is that is assumes the computer would otherwise be switched off or in hibernation mode .
But in reality , it ’s almost certain that people who did n’t have to sort through spam would simply spend the time working on their computers instead .
You may have seen the official announcement of the first DLC map pack for Killzone 2 on Spike TV and currently on Gametrailers.com , but we wanted to reiterate some of the key details of what will be available as well as let you know the official date it will be on the PSN for download : April 30th .
The price for this map pack is still TBA .
The first DLC pack , called “ Steel and Titanium ” , will contain two brand new multiplayer maps with new gameplay elements and strategic twists , sure to test even the most skilled players .
The first map in the pack is Wasteland Bullet , and the action will take place on the bullet train that and transports goods and troops between Pyrrhus and the Wasteland .
The game is a frenzied firefight to wrestle control of the train from the enemy and into the hands of your faction .
With the train moving at full speed , players will need to remain aware of the immediate environment as well as enemies – hitting an overhead obstacle at this speed will mean instant death .
The second map , Vekta Cruiser , will find ISA troops boarding a vast ship with the goal to repel a force of assaulting Helghast troops while also protecting the cruiser itself from heavy Helghan fire .
The action takes place entirely indoors in a frantic and claustrophobic battle where attackers lurk around every corner .
On his second day in office , President Obama repudiated George W. Bush ’s obsessive and destructive secrecy by ordering his government to obey the Freedom of Information Act .
He said it should not withhold documents because they are embarrassing , or reveal failures and errors , or “ because of speculative or abstract fears . ”
He was right .
And yet last week , the Justice Department was in federal court , asking for another delay in releasing three legal opinions written by Steven Bradbury when he was acting head of the department ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
The memos provided a legal pretext for interrogations that ranged from merely illegal to outright torture .
Scott Shane reported in The Times that the Central Intelligence Agency , hoping to avoid embarrassment , was fighting the release .
That is exactly the sort of obstructionism that Mr. Obama ordered stopped .
The administration , which now has until April 16 to decide about the Bradbury memos , has agreed “ to review ” for release yet another memo that has been kept secret far too long .
Written by Jay Bybee , a former Justice Department lawyer who is now a federal judge , it redefined torture in a way that almost anything , short of murder , would be legal .

Disco Room :: She 's Unreal Tension Remix [ 6:10 - 8.6 MB ]
Submitted By : Disco Room
Yet another fine remix from a talented Zombie - head known as Sean Mullen who operates his machines under the ' Disco Room ' moniker .
Utilizing more of Freddie Hubbard & Ilhan Mimaroglu 's vocal - samples from " Sing Me A Song of Songmy " ( Jazz Series , 1976 ) , Disco Room creates a groovy downtempo remix that contains a soft rumbling bassline that casually morphs into an upbeat drum'n bass styled assault on the ears .
" Give Me Love , So that I can KILL " is precisely maneuvered around this laid - back piece of musical engineering .
Sean Mullen 's talent is one to contend with ;
The creative use of the original samples from " She 's Unreal " ( Subliminal Sandwich , 1996 ) proves that he can easily nurture a breakbeat to its full capacity while downtempo rhythms cascade in the background .
Kudos ... Disco Room Email : sean@imageworks.com

Submitted By : Hexane Running the full gamut , from minimal experimental techno , to full force dance - floor raveups , one of the most exciting aspects of electronic music is the ability to re-conceptualize existing musical works .
While Hexane admit that they " do n't usually make trance music .. " they also informed us that for the following submission " it just works on Circles " .
And such is the case with this 12 minute track that comes loaded with early 90s influenced trance / acid - techno with a focus on bringing an entirely new spin on the already classic " Circles " track featured on Satyricon .
While the backbone of the original " Circles " track is replaced with a trance / acid - techno flavor , a few of the existing lyrics make an appearance on this track .
Please keep in mind that not only is this a remix of " Circles " but there are also traces of " The Sphere " ( mind is perpetual motion , its symbol is the sphere ) , scattered throughout the mixture of " Circles " and the consistent pulse of Hexan 's nostalgic acid -techno .
Fans of early trance might be interested in this rather lengthy piece of musical landscapes .
An interesting perspective that highlights an entirely distinct musical genre .

Line Noise :: Helter Skelter Remix [ 11:24 - 16 MB ]
Submitted By : Line Noise
The Miami , Florida contingent and avid MBM aficionados at Laced Milk have composed what could very well be the lengthiest remix ever produced ( well , it comes in 2nd next to Hexane 's remix ) .
11 - minutes of strangled electro samplings and atypical screeches are manipulated and re-configured in such a way that you simply can't stop moving to the funk once this track is in rotation .
Loosely tied atmospheric elements run rampant with a collage of vocal samples until a steadily flowing rhythmical beat waves across the audio spectrum .
Sit back , relax and enjoy the Line Noise frequency range .

MJK :: I Live 4 Drugz [ 5:06 - 5.9 MB ]
Submitted By : Michael Kaplan " I Live 4 Drugz " sounds like a remix of many tracks dropped into one , combining early - mid -90s electro with funky and mechanical rhythms .
Sampling " Acid Again " vocals and bending each digital element to its absolute extents , MJK adds his own acid hooks , and watery basslines to make this remix a fluid workout on the brain .
Some of the percussive elements on " I Live 4 Drugz " sound like outakes from Storm the Studio , -- nonetheless , this remix , with its electro - experimentation highlights the mind - altering side of MBM 's music throughout the years .
" Acid Again " fans take note burn with ecstasy and enjoy this ( beta version ) remix now !
Complete remix coming soon .
Resident Lab :: Radio Halcyon [ 5:12 - 4.7 MB ]
Submitted By : Iread Resident Lab does it again , with a second try at remixing one of MBM 's most classic tracks " Radio Babylon " .
The original bassline has been altered slightly , falling into a punchier landscape while peculiar samples are tossed around the heavy percussion .
Tune in a little further , and the bassline you thought was morphing into a creature finally turns into its own entity , live and persistent and as vibrant as ever .
Whereas Resident Labs " 3 BPM Faster then the Terror Dome " delves into a mix of tracks , " Radio Halycon " displays an original remix with signature bleeps , rhythms , obscurities , and all the original samples for a completely fulfilling experience in sound innovation .
The ending fades away as peacefully as the introduction .. atmospheric ambience molded to gritty metallic sparks .
Well done .
Resident Lab :: 3 BPM Faster then the Terror Dome [ 6:01 - 5.6 MB ]
Submitted By : Iread Ian Read 's remix of MBM's " 10 x Faster Than the Speed of Love " is more of a collage of bizarre samples from alternate sources ( James Brown , Public Enemy etc. ) casually sliding into " 10 x Faster .. " lyrics .
Not much is altered in the way of the original tune , but a definite compliment to Public Enemy is apparent with Resident Lab 's interpretation .
Slowly inserting vocal samples in between the relaxed back beat , this remix is true to its origin , and a pleasure to digest .
Ron West :: Have a Good Day ! [ 5:13 - 4.8 MB ]
Submitted By : Ron West Ron West 's " Have a Good Day " can't be mistaken for a remix of MBM's " Helter Skelter " sampling the signature lyrics " It 's in my Brain " .
While most of the remixes for this project have been on the electro experimental break - beat tip , Ron West introduces a solid 4/ 4 beat along the lines of Orbital meets DHS .
Dropping his own electrical rhythms and basslines , " Have a Good Day " brings back memories of Meat Beat Manifesto during concert .
A direct and clean beat is polished against subtle tweaks and high - hats .
New voice samples are realized towards the end including what sounds like an old film clip with the lyrics , " Have a Good Day " repeated over and over again .
Overall , Ron West focuses on a more direct and punchy dark - techno remix of " Helter Skelter " , and accomplishes just that .
Thread :: Wild Life [ Cerulean Mix ] [ 5:31 - 5.1 MB ]
Submitted By : James Izzo Thread , who has recorded for the Sensory Expansion Media record label , has intertwined his more relaxed and ambient melodies for the remix of MBM's " Wild Life " .
Subtracting the vocals and adding a mysteriously abstract and atmospheric tone , James Izzo ( aka Thread ) manages to develop a swirl of electrical debris while maintaining the tracks original structure .
" Wild Life ( Cerulean Mix ) " has a creative mood that should have you asleep and dreaming of the delicate beauty it creates within minutes .

A Labour backbencher has apologised for submitting an expenses claim for a £ 5 donation he made at a church service commemorating the Battle of Britain .
Frank Cook made the offering in his Stockton North constituency in 2006 and submitted the claim with a handwritten note , the Sunday Telegraph reports .
Mr Cook said he did not recall the claim - rejected by the Commons Fees Office - and that it was " a mistake " .
It comes as party leaders make more calls to reform the MP expenses system .
The government is considering introducing a legally - binding code of conduct for MPs that would cover minimum standards of service to constituents .
Tory leader David Cameron has given his backing to Liberal Democrat calls for powers to allow voters to force out MPs who break Commons rules .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has suggested a " recall " mechanism that would be triggered if 5 % of constituents signed a petition demanding a by - election .
It would only apply to someone found guilty of wrongdoing .
' No other claims '
Meanwhile , Mr Clegg has said the chancellor , Alistair Darling , should resign over claims in the Daily Telegraph he switched the designation of his second home four times in as many years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Clegg told the BBC it was impossible for Mr Darling to continue in his job when such major question marks were being raised about his financial affairs .
Mr Darling has said his claims were within the rules of the Commons , which are designed to reflect the fact that MPs have to meet the cost of living in two places .
In its latest expenses story , the Sunday Telegraph says the handwritten note attached to Mr Cook 's donation claim read : " Battle of Britain church service , Sunday 17.09.06 .
£ 5 contribution to offertory on behalf of Frank Cook MP . "
Mr Cook expressed shock at the discovery by The Sunday Telegraph of the note .
He told the BBC that he took full responsibility for the claim he could not recall putting in the claim and had no record of it .
" It 's been my error .
An inexcusable error .
An error for which I am full of regret .
" Why on earth I did it , I do n't know .
I can't have been thinking at the time .
" I must have been just rushing through the paperwork , and I 've got to say that I regret doing it .
It should never have been done .
It 's unjustifiable and I 'm very sorry .
And I 'm so pleased that the Fees office spotted it as they did "
He said he would now be going over his other expenses claims to check for any mistakes .
Personally I do n't care what system we have so long as it is clear , open and credible with the public - and we have to get it done quickly
David Miliband
Foreign Secretary
The Telegraph also reports on further claims made by other MPs , including reimbursement for bathmats and carpets bought in India .
David Cameron has also been explaining his second home claim .
The Mail on Sunday reports he paid off the remaining £ 75,000 of a mortgage on his London home using his own money , shortly after taking out a £ 350,000 mortgage on his constituency home in 2001 .
He used the second homes allowance to pay the interest on the new mortgage .
Mr Cameron did not break any rules and his office said the taxpayer had not lost any money .
The Telegraph also features an ICM poll which suggests more people intend to vote Liberal Democrat than Labour in the next general election .
The survey put Gordon Brown 's party in third place for the first time since 1987 on just 22 % - three points behind the Lib Dems and 18 behind the Conservatives .
' In a mess '
In response to public anger over MPs expenses , Foreign Secretary David Miliband has called for a " new approach to politics " .
The foreign secretary wrote in the News of the World that British politics was " in a mess " and needed shaking up .
An elected House of Lords and greater powers for local communities were essential to make politics " more accountable , more in touch , less elitist " , he said .
" ' Never waste a crisis ' is a good guide to getting out of a mess .
And British politics has got into a mess , " he wrote .
" At just the time when our problems need a new approach to politics , the expenses scandal has given people good reason to give up on politics altogether . "
' Bread and butter '
But it was crucial to turn the anger into real change , he said .
" We have to start with expenses .
Personally I do n't care what system we have so long as it is clear , open and credible with the public - and we have to get it done quickly .
" But we can't stop there .
Some people have said that constitutional reform is a ' middle - class issue ' , whatever that is .
That 's rubbish .
" We can't tackle the bread - and - butter issues unless our politics is more accountable , more in touch , less elitist . "

The plight of Pakistanis fleeing warfare in the Swat Valley echoes conditions in such hard - pressed regions as Darfur and Congo , a U.N. relief official said Monday , as thousands more displaced people poured out of the conflict area and strained humanitarian organizations .
The government pressed its weeks - old military campaign against Taliban insurgents and said its troops had killed 700 militants in the last four days , a figure that could not be independently verified .
The current conflict started last month when Taliban fighters in the northwestern region of Pakistan expanded into neighboring areas closer to Islamabad , the capital , after having agreed under the terms of a now - defunct peace deal to put down their weapons .
This challenge to the state , combined with significant U.S. pressure , prompted the army to send reinforcements to the region backed by warplanes to take on the Taliban .
That sent civilians fleeing by the tens of thousands .
Advertisement
The flood of displaced people is “ approaching the situation we ’re seeing in Darfur and Congo , ” Killian Kleinschmidt , a representative of United Nations relief efforts , said Monday .
“ The sheer numbers are not as great as Darfur , and we ’re still somewhat away from Congo , but not far .
“ I ’m not saying the consequences for people themselves are as bad , ” Kleinschmidt added .
“ Here they ’re not fleeing into the desert , or someplace where there ’s nothing .
It ’s not as dramatic .
They are able to flee to places where there are people , food and some capacity to deal .
It gives us more time to react . ”
The U.N. said 360,000 people have fled the Swat Valley and neighboring Dir and Buner districts in the last four days , in addition to the 500,000 living since last fall in camps , which Kleinschmidt noted could be “ dehumanizing . ”
Though the public has generally supported the military operation against the Taliban , which has sought to impose Sharia , or Islamic law , in the region , some civilians fleeing the fighting say the army has upended their lives and damaged their property more than the insurgents .
This could undercut the government ’s bid to win local support in its fight against extremists .

The government said Monday that it would survey and provide tax exemptions for communities damaged by the military .
The army lifted a curfew Sunday , prompting more terrified people to abandon their homes .
Many of those fleeing have landed in Mardan , the first major town south of the Swat Valley .
“ We ’re almost full , ” said Usman Khan , an official with the Salban Development Organization , a humanitarian civic group in Mardan .
“ Now we started another camp nearby that ’s already got 5,000 or 6,000 people , but that ’s filling up fast and they just keep coming like rain . ”
Most of the recently displaced have chosen to live with friends or relatives rather than stay in the designated camps , the U.N. said .
This reflects in part a long tradition of hospitality in the Pashtun community , which accounts for much of the mountainous region ’s population .
Advertisement
It also suggests that many want to avoid the sterility , boredom and heat of life in the camps , as temperatures soar above 100 degrees .
But those living outside the camps present special challenges for aid groups .
They ’re more dispersed , more difficult to register and more difficult to assist .
In some cases , victims have to walk half a mile or more to find water and basic supplies .
Furthermore , these already - impoverished host communities are seeing their resources stretched , fueling potential instability .
Jeff Hall , regional assistant director with humanitarian group World Vision , said one family he visited Sunday in the town of Jalala had 28 people living in a three - room apartment , two rooms of which had collapsed roofs .
“ And with the lifting of the curfew , there were 15 more people on the way , ” he said .

Aid workers said almost everything was in short supply , including food , water , sanitation and health and education services .
Khan said the registration process was suffering under the load of incoming people .
Last week , groups arriving from Swat and Buner demonstrated against the lengthy registration system , which is a prerequisite for receiving aid .
Displaced people planning either to live in a camp or a host community are required to show their Pakistani federal ID card to ensure that non-Pakistani citizens or impoverished - but - not - displaced people do n’t take advantage of the aid .
They are then eligible for another card that gives them access to food , tents and other basic supplies .
“ I ’d say the registration is not going according to plan , ” Khan said .
“ There are too many people .
Some in the camps are registered , some are not .
It ’s iffy . ”

Today the Washington Post devoted front - page real estate to an examination of how some wealthy people who do n’t think of themselves as wealthy will suffer under Obama ’s proposed tax plans .
Their primary example is Gail Johnson , who , along with her husband , earns about $ 515,000 in a typical year from the chain of preschools and after - school programs they own :
“ You hear ‘ tax the rich , ’ and you think , ‘ I do n’t make that much money , ’ ” said Johnson , whose Rainbow Station programs are headquartered near Richmond .
“ But then you realize : ‘ Oh , if I put my business income with my wages , then , suddenly , I ’m there . ’ “
The piece claims that , under Obama ’s plan , Johnson ’s federal taxes would increase by 19 percent , or $ 23,000 .
As economist Dean Baker points out , Johnson ’s situation “ would describe that of less than 1 percent of all small business owners , so it is difficult to understand why such a person would be prominently featured in an article on President Obama ’s tax plans . ”
The Post piece goes on to note that “ Republicans argue that those who fall into the upper brackets tend to be firms with the greatest capacity for job creation ” –a claim which , as Baker writes , contradicts extensive economic analysis .
Also interviewed for the piece are the chief lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , a VP at the National Foreign Trade Council , Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley , and two other small business owners likely to pay more in taxes under Obama ’s plan–all critics of the plan , except for the last small business owner , tacked on at the very end as the Post ‘s apparent effort to distinguish its reporting from pure PR for the wealthy .
Post writers Lori Montgomery and V. Dion Haynes report that Johnson says she and her husband actually take home “ substantially less ” than their taxable income , and that potential tax increases would face her with a difficult choice :
“ You can try to pass it on to consumers .
But if you raise tuition , you put pressure on family budgets , ” she said .
“ For us , we ’re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea . ”
Or , gee , maybe you could try to get by with a post - federal tax income of $ 372,000 a year instead of $ 395,000 .
Jim Murphy , the other critical small business owner interviewed , “ said his accountant estimates that Obama ’s proposals could add $ 60,000 to his $ 120,000 tax bill . ”
“ Said his accountant estimates ” ?
Is this what passes for reporting at the Washington Post ?
Apparently so , at least when the coverage is of the embattled upper class .
It ’s no secret that Trent Reznor ( Nine Inch Nails ) has seen times as dark as some of his music .
During the period between 1994 ’s The Downward Spiral and 1999 ’s The Fragile albums ( and especially after the not - so - successful The Fragile ) , Reznor struggled with substance abuse , depression , and suicidal thoughts .
And , if you ’re familiar with it at all , “ Hurt ” – one of Reznor ’s many most well - known songs from The Downward Spiral – sounds like an anthem for folks struggling with the same kinds of issues .
Reznor has spoken publicly about his battles with drug addiction and mental health issues .
During a 2007 interview with Heather Adler , Reznor stated :
“ I hated everything .
I hated everyone .
I hated everything about myself .
I hated music .
I did n’t care about anything [ … ]
That ’s a bleak place to wind up at , but things could n’t be further away from that now .
I was certainly depressed and I was in the thralls of withdrawal for about a year after the Fragile tour [ … ]
Through my actions , I was certainly behaving in an irresponsible enough way that I was , in a cowardly way , trying to end it . ”
A few months later , Reznor talked with Sun-Times music critic Jim Derogatis about how family issues worked to exasperate those issues :
“ My grandma never recovered , literally .
She died one month later and I fell deeper into a depression that consumed my entire being .
I became lazy , I became irritable , I was a giant f*** ing a** hole to everyone who had been close to me .
I made s*** ty decisions , I befriended Marilyn Manson , I was a mess .
It was the worst time of my life . ”
( Is he equating a friendship with Marilyn Manson with depression and crappy decisions ?
Haha , that ’s funny . )
As he ’s still alive and well and very much in the public eye for good news , things obviously changed for Reznor .
He took some time off , successfully completed rehab , and regrouped .
So what ’s Reznor up to these days ?
Well , aside from recently celebrating is 44th birthday ( hey , staying alive is an accomplishment for all of us – especially those who ’ve battled drug addiction ) , he ’s a raving Twitter fan who just won the 2009 Webby Award for Webby Artist of the Year “ for his achievements in ‘ harnessing the power of the Internet to share his music and passions ' ” .
Reznor also recently became engaged to West Indian Girl ’s Mariqueen Maandig , and he and the NIN touring members are also currently on tour with Jane ’s Addiction and nearly every single show is sold out .
Not too shabby , right ? 🙂
1 Apr 2009 : Column 263WH continued
I recognise that there is a serious terrorist threat , and that point leads me to Street View .
The argument has been made that underground stations and other transport locations could be targets for terrorism and that anyone taking photographs of such places might be doing so to find out where the entrance is and what is around it , and is therefore suspicious .
However , I have been on Street View , and have been able to look at all the underground stations in my constituency and find where all the CCTV cameras are .
I was even able to go to RAF Uxbridge , where there was a bomb incident many years ago , and along the A40 to RAF Northolt to look over the fence , all using Google Street View , because the cameras are on stalks .
The argument that photographers
1 Apr 2009 : Column 264WH
might threaten our security , or that the police have to be so alert to the issue , has been diminished by the advent of Street View .
I did not mean to discuss Street View so much , but many people , including colleagues , have contacted me about it since I secured the debate .
I am not sure whether Members will yet have had time to purchase todays Uxbridge Gazette , but there is an article on page 9 entitled ,  Mind my privacy  , about Mrs. Rita Blake , aged 72 , of Widmore road , Hillingdon .
She says that there is an image of her wobbling up the road and she does not like it .
There have been several other such incidents just in my constituency .
It is fun to look at Street View , but from a security point of view I am talking not about terrorism , but about burglary and all sorts of other incidents what representations have the Government made to the provider to see what can be done ?
Frankly , I find the matter very concerning .
When I hear the argument that people taking photographs are potential terrorists , I am reminded that all hon .
Members have probably left though Carriage Gates and had to wait for the public to finish taking their photographs of what I suspect is one of the prime terrorist targets in the country .
With the technological advances in digital photography , a camera that does not look complex can pick up incredible detail that can then be downloaded on to a computer .
Carriage Gates is , of course , one of the more vulnerable entrances to the House .
I do not see how the issue can be divided two ways .
I would also like to mention a point raised by some good friends of mine who are journalists .
They say that the police are increasingly using powers under section 76 of the Counter - Terrorism Act 2008 and section 58 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Terrorism Act 2000 against bona fide journalists .
That is rather worrying .
I think it is well known in the House that I am not a supporter of a third runway at Heathrow and that I attend many demonstrations against it held by the public .
At such demonstrations , I have increasingly noticed the police taking photographs of ordinary residents and that our bread - and - butter constituents are having their photographs taken .
I understand that there might be one or two anarchists who infiltrate such demonstrations , but it is worrying that huge swaths of our fellow citizens are photographed just because they are doing something that seems to involve demonstrating against the state .
I have put my name to various amendments and a private Members Bill on the control of paedophilia , but a further issue that has been raised with me is the fact that there seems to be an incredible hysteria about taking any photographs that might contain a child .
My daughter is a keen rugby player she is only 13 and her mother hopes that she will learn to do something a bit more sensible , but she is my daughter so , unfortunately , the chances of her growing up to do something sensible are limited .
I feel that I cannot even take a camera to a game of girls  or boys  rugby without being looked at in a strange way .
At best , I might end up in a diary column ; at worst , I might end up appearing in front of the local magistrate having to explain why I was taking a photograph of young children .
The situation is getting to the point of hysteria .
There are various strands to the issue and I appreciate that the Minister might not have enough time to deal with all them .
We should all be interested in the subject .
1 Apr 2009 : Column 265WH
The police force and , certainly , PCSOs should have some sort of code .
I noticed that , in the last Session of Parliament , the hon .
Member for Great Grimsby ( Mr. Mitchell ) tabled early - day motion 1155 on photography in public areas .
He asked for a photography code for the information of officers to be issued by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers .
That is right ; officers should be told what is likely to cause a problem .
I believe that that should be the case not only because I am a libertarian and I think that we should have those rights , but because the terrorism legislation introduced by the Government is brought slightly into disrepute if it is used for the wrong purposes .
We agreed to emergency legislation being pushed through the House because of the threat of terrorism and because we know that such legislation is important .
However , when the legislation was being considered , we raised concerns and were told ,  No , it wont be used in that way .
This is just for use in extremis . 
We then find that somebody has been stopped reading out the names of the war dead in front of the cenotaph in Whitehall , and that somebody has been cautioned under terrorism legislation for taking a photograph of a police car on double yellow lines .
I am afraid that that will make people think that the laws we pass have not been scrutinised properly and that those laws might even be brought into disrepute .
I understand that there is a fine balance to be struck between allowing people the right to take photographs and dealing with the other issues that we must consider .
As MPs , we know full well that photographers might take pictures of us when we are carrying out our various activities in our constituencies only when they find out that such pictures are mundane and boring do they delete them but there is a right for people to take photographs and we must ensure that it is not subsumed by hysteria and a state that has become too keen on surveillance .
At the same time , however , we should be worried about the advent of Street View and concerned that something even more intrusive might follow .
I shall finish now and listen to the Ministers wise words .
11.16 am
The Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State for the Home Department ( Mr. Shahid Malik ) :
It is a pleasure to be engaging in this debate under your stewardship , Mr. Bercow .
You are my favourite Conservative MP , which might not help you in the coming years .
None the less , it is on the record .
I congratulate the hon .
Member for Uxbridge ( Mr. Randall ) on securing this debate on an important topic that has recently attracted considerable interest .
I have listened carefully to the points raised and shall try to deal with the main issues .
Let me start by saying that our counter - terrorism laws are not designed or intended to stop people taking photographs .
That is simply not their aim .
People have the right to take photographs in public places for legitimate reasons and we will do everything we can to uphold that right .
The hon .
Gentleman rightly talked about the threat of terrorism , as all hon .
Members have done in the debate .
After the Good Friday agreement was reached , I was a commissioner to the Equality Commission for
1 Apr 2009 : Column 266WH
Northern Ireland for three years .
Also , my constituency housed the lead 7/7 bomber and , more recently , the youngest convicted terrorist in the country .
Therefore , I know full well the threat that exists .
However , to be blunt , none of the issues that the hon .
Gentleman mentioned in his interesting and useful contribution seem to be a threat to this country in any shape or form .
I will go through that in my speech .
I accept that there are concerns about how some of our laws are being , or might be , applied .
There are two separate issues and I would like to deal with each in turn .
First , concerns have been expressed about the stop - and - search powers used under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
As hon .
Members will know , section 44 enables the police to stop and search anyone within an authorised area for the purposes of searching for articles of a kind that could be used in connection with terrorism .
The powers do not require a reasonable suspicion that such articles exist .
That is a useful power , but it is also wide - ranging , and concerns have been expressed that the power is being used to stop people taking photographs whether of buildings or of people within authorised areas .
There are also concerns that cameras are being confiscated as part of such searches .
Those are genuine concerns that people have raised .
I would like to make it clear that section 44 does not prohibit the taking of photographs .
In November last year , the National Police Improvement Agency issued revised guidance on the use of section 44 that made it clear that the power does not stop the taking of photographs in an authorised area and that the police should not use those powers to prevent people from taking pictures .
The police may stop and search someone who is taking photographs in an authorised area , just as they may stop and search any member of the public , but the powers should not be targeted on photographers .
Mr. Randall : I understand what the Minister is saying the police and PCSOs do not have to give any reason for stopping and searching , whether the person has a camera or not .
Does that mean , therefore , that there is random stop and search in such areas ?
Mr. Malik : I made it clear that in the designated areas , the police and PCSOs because their approach is not intelligence - led have the right to stop and search people if they feel it necessary to do so .
Parliament passed those laws many years ago .
My hon .
Friend the Minister for Security , Counter - Terrorism , Crime and Policing has met with several MPs and with representatives of Amateur Photographer to discuss the issue .
He has also written to Ken Jones , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers , to ask him what steps are being taken to ensure that the revised guidance is being cascaded to all police officers on the street .
Mr. Pelling : I appreciate that time is short .
Before I was stopped and held to account for taking a photograph , seven people in my constituency had written to me expressing concern .
One had been taking a picture of a cycle lane .
Also , Danny Fitzpatrick , a photographer on the Croydon Advertiser , has been stopped repeatedly .
Surely the power is being used without proper discrimination by the police service .
Mr. Malik :
If hon .
Members have examples that they want to pass to me , I am happy to look at them and pass them on to the police .
I am setting out what ought to happen .
Hon .
Members are telling me about experiences of constituents that are contrary to what ought to have happened .
As such , I am more than happy to look into them .
Hugh Bayley :
If the police take a camera when they search someone and subsequently , having examined the images on it , satisfy themselves that no offence has been committed and that there was no mal - intent , do they always return the camera and the images on it to the person from whom they took them to investigate ?
Mr. Malik : Common sense and justice say that that ought to be the case .
Again , if my hon .
Friend has information to the contrary , I would be happy to receive it .
We are putting out guidance to ensure that the laws are implemented correctly and that peoples liberties are not being infringed upon unnecessarily .
That is crucial .
Mr. Randall : Will the Minister give way ?
Mr. Malik :
For the last time .
Mr. Randall : I am very grateful .
I want to clear up one point .
The Minister said that the offence applies in designated areas .
Mr. Malik : Yes .
Mr. Randall : Presumably , a shopping centre is a designated area , but Windsor street in Uxbridge is not a shopping centre .
Can some police officer stop anybody , anywhere , even away from a designated area ?
Surely , common sense would apply if someone was taking a photograph in areas other than a designated area .
Mr. Malik : I am speaking about section 44 and designated areas .
Let me continue with my response , which , I hope , will give Members satisfaction on other issues .
If it does not , I may have just enough time left to respond to outstanding questions .
The second issue concerns the new offence in section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000 , which was inserted by section 76 of the Counter - Terrorism Act 2008 .
It makes it an offence to elicit , attempt to elicit , publish or communicate information about an individual who is or has been a constable , or a member of the armed forces or intelligences services .
The information must be of a kind that is likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism .
It has been suggested that the new offence could criminalise people taking or publishing photographs of police officers .
A photograph of a police officer may fall within the scope of the offence , but would do so in only limited circumstances .
The offence is designed to capture terrorist activity directed at members of the protected groups , which , sadly , we know occurs .
An offence might be committed , therefore , if someone provides a person with information about the names , addresses or details of car registration numbers of persons in the protected groups .
The important thing is that the photographs would have to be of a kind likely to provide practical
1 Apr 2009 : Column 268WH
assistance to terrorists , and the person taking or providing the photograph would have to have no reasonable excuse , such as responsible journalism , for taking it .
I can assure my hon .
Friend the Member for City of York ( Hugh Bayley ) York is a great city that had he taken a photograph of a billboard in an underground station , he would have been on safe ground .
I hope that the incident did not cost him the prize for being the best MP photographer in that year .
I want to be clear about this : the offence does not capture an innocent tourist taking a photograph of a police officer , or a journalist photographing police officers as part of his or her job .
It does not criminalise the normal taking of photographs of the police .
Police officers have the discretion to ask people not to take photographs for public safety or security reasons , but the taking of photographs in a public place is not subject to any rule or statute .
There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place , and there is no presumption of privacy for individuals in a public place .
My hon .
Friend the Minister for Security , Counter - Terrorism , Crime and Policing has said that we will issue all police officers and forces with a circular on the new offence .
It will set out the policy intentions behind the offence and make it clear that it does not criminalise legitimate photographic or journalistic activity .
The circular will be discussed with interested parties before it is issued .
Designated areas may cover any area .
They may , for example , cover a town or a borough .
They must be approved by the Secretary of State , and , prior to that , by the Director of Public Prosecutions .
It is worth noting in this context the two important safeguards in the statute , which I just mentioned .
It is also worth remembering why Parliament only recently agreed to create the new offence .
The offence is aimed at protecting those who are on the front line of our efforts to tackle terrorism .
Sadly , recent events in Northern Ireland have shown that members of the armed forces and the police continue to be targets for terrorists .
We also judge that the police , the armed forces and the intelligence services are regarded as potential targets by extremists in the UK .
The new offence is therefore important , and I would not want concerns about its potential application to photographers to overshadow that .
Although the offence came into force only on 16 February this year , a similar offence applied in Northern Ireland between 2001 and 2007 .
There was no attempt to prosecute journalists under the old offence in Northern Ireland , and we are not aware of any suggestions that the new offence has been used against people taking photographs .
On a separate issue , we have recently been made aware of the publication on the internet of detailed street images of the capital and other major UK cities .
The hon .
Member for Uxbridge raised the matter .
It freely demonstrates that the ability to take photographs in a public place is not subject to any set of rules or to statute .
There are no legal restrictions on photography in a public place except where the picture is taken with the intent of committing a crime or terrorist act .
I hope that I have provided some reassurance that we take the issue seriously and that we are doing all that we can to ensure that legislation is not misused against photographers , whether journalists , tourists or just

enthusiasts .
I make it absolutely clear that , unless someone is engaged in criminal activity , they must be allowed to take photographs in public places and that the law should not be used to discourage or hamper that activity .
I hope the hon .
Gentleman accepts that the Governments intentions in this area are right and that we are working hard to ensure that the law does not have an unintended impact on photography .
The hon .
Member for Croydon , Central ( Mr. Pelling ) spoke about a journalist in his constituency .
Freedom of the press is a fundamental foundation of any democracy , and the idea that journalists are being blocked willy - nilly from engaging in their lawful activity is completely unacceptable .
Anecdotally , there seems to be a disconnect between what the Government intended and what might be happening on the ground 

Stafford Hospital
[ Miss Anne Begg in the Chair ]
2.30 pm
Mr. David Kidney ( Stafford ) ( Lab ) :
We are honoured to have you in the Chair as our watchful eye while we debate this very important subject for Stafford and its surrounding areas , Miss Begg .
The hon .
Member for South Staffordshire ( Sir Patrick Cormack ) asked me to say that he very much wanted to be here to take part in the debate , because many of his constituents look to Stafford hospital for treatment , but , as I speak , he is chairing the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs in a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland , so he is unable to attend .
He wanted me to give his apologies .
The national health service told the people of Stafford and me that our hospital was good : the trust that managed the hospital told us constantly that the hospital was good , and the regulator told us that the hospital was good .
Back in 2002 , the regulator was the Commission for Health Improvement , and it said that in 2001 the hospitals rating was only one star and that it had weaknesses .
In the following year , the rating went to two stars and , in 2003 , to three stars .
Intuitively , that looks like an improving performance year on year , but in 2003 , the Commission for Healthcare Improvement ceased to exist and the Healthcare Commission took over and in 2004 the rating crashed from three stars to zero stars .
That was when the great big pile of papers before me , detailing the hospitals performance , started for the regulator and for Ministers .
I asked the regulator ,  Is this hospital safe ?  , and in 2004 , the Healthcare Commissions assurances were that the hospital was safe and had some good performances , even though it had some weaknesses , which were mostly to do with waiting times .
In the years that followed , under the Healthcare Commission , the hospitals ratings appeared again , intuitively to improve year after year .
In 2005 - 06 , the rating was fair on quality , fair on resources .
Fair means room for improvement .
In 2006 - 07 , it was fair on quality , good on resources ; and in 2007 - 08 , it was good on quality , good on resources .
It looked like a hospital improving .
The commissioner of services from the hospital , the primary care trust , did not point out that anything was wrong ; it went on commissioning services .
The performance manager of the hospital , the strategic health authority , did not point out that anything was wrong ; it went on performance - managing the hospital .
Then the regulator of foundation trusts , Monitor , approved the trusts application for financial trust status just last year , after what it claimed had been a rigorous examination of the trusts leadership , management and governance arrangements .
But all those different parts of the NHS told us wrong , and we have been left bewildered , furious and in no mood for anything other than the strongest and quickest action to repair the terrible damage that has been done .
Patients who trusted the NHS as a friend and saviour were tragically failed and let down .
The hospitals leadership , management and governance were not good .
The hospital was not good .
WASHINGTON 
In an abrupt shift , Senate Democratic leaders said they would not provide the $ 80 million that President Obama requested to close the detention center at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The move escalates pressure on the president , who on Thursday is scheduled to outline his plans for the 240 terrorism suspects still held there .
In recent days , Mr. Obama has faced growing demands from both parties , but particularly Republicans , to lay out a more detailed road map for closing the Guantánamo prison and to provide assurances that detainees would not end up on American soil , even in maximum security prisons .
The move by Senate Democrats to strip the $ 80 million from a war - spending bill and the decision to bar , for now , transfer of detainees to the United States , raised the possibility that Mr. Obama ’s order to close the camp by Jan. 22 , 2010 , might have to be changed or delayed .
“ Guantánamo makes us less safe , ” the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , said at a news conference where he laid out the party ’s rationale for its decision , which is expected to be voted on this week .
“ However , this is neither the time nor the bill to deal with this .
Democrats under no circumstances will move forward without a comprehensive , responsible plan from the president .
We will never allow terrorists to be released into the United States . ”
( And do n’t tell me you do n’t want to be miserable .
I ’m pretty sure you ’re already doing at least a few of the things on this list … )
Turn Molehills Into Mountains
When your printer jams , it ’s not just annoying , it ’s a disaster .
When your car develops an odd rattle , it ’s not just normal wear and tear , it ’s clearly going to cost a fortune to fix .
When your son swears at you , it ’s not just a bit of acting out , it ’s the first sign of junior delinquency .
However small your problem , magnify it until it becomes overwhelming .
You can only be properly miserable when you have huge problems .
Dwell On It
Now that you ’ve got a big problem , make sure you dwell on it .
Let it fill your waking thoughts .
Let it spoil your time with your partner or family .
( And make sure you keep bringing it up in conversation so everyone knows how awful you ’re feeling . )
Imagine all the worst - case scenarios that could result .
Lie awake at night , dreaming up new ones .
Worry About Things You Ca n’t Change
Of course , problems that you can solve can only make you miserable for so long – eventually , you ’ll either fix them or they ’ll melt away of their own accord .
So you need to worry about things that you have absolutely no control over .
And you ’re in luck : there ’s a ready stock of these things on the daily news .
Just switch on CNN , and start worrying …
Let Everything Mount Up
Whenever there ’s something which might cause you stress – unanswered emails , unpaid bills , your taxes , your Christmas cards – let it mount up .
Leave your bills unopened for months .
Shove all your receipts straight into one big envelope .
Do n’t bother updating your address book until December 15th .
This habit is self - reinforcing : the more the pile grows , the more reluctant you ’ll be to tackle it .
And guess what ?
The bigger it is , the more it ’ll prey on your mind .
An easy way to make yourself miserable .
Blame Other People
To be truly miserable , you must n’t take responsibility for any of your problems .
Blame your parents .
Blame society .
Blame the government .
Blame your boss .
Blame your big sister .
To be honest , it does n’t really matter who you blame .
Just so long as you ’re clear that you are n’t to blame at all – meaning you could n’t possibly have any power to change the situation .
Of course , to make sure that everyone else is just as miserable as you , be vocal , and tell people that it ’s all their fault that your life is so screwed up .
Beat Yourself Up
Once you ’re bored of blaming other people , start beating yourself up .
Listen to that little voice in your head which says that you ’re stupid and lazy .
Let it go on and on until you believe it .
Blame yourself for mistakes you made twenty years ago .
Blame yourself for not being 100 % perfect .
This is a fast , easy and reliable way to become miserable and to stay miserable .
If you do it well , you ’ll be convinced that you have no power to change yourself .
Complain , Whine And Grumble
When you ’re miserable , let the world know about it .
Complain to your co-workers about the food in the staff canteen .
Whine to your friends about your long hours , aching back and credit card debt .
Grumble about the weather , the price of gas , the media , the government .
If every word that comes out of your mouth is a negative one , you ’ll be doing a great job of maintaining your miserable mood – and dragging down everyone else ’s mood to match it .
Never Accept Help
Inevitably , your whining will cause someone to offer some help .
Perhaps a friend at work says he ’ll help you out with your paperwork , or your partner offers to do your tax return for you .
Maybe your sister says she ’ll look after the kids one Saturday to give you a break .
Always insist that you do n’t need help .
Make yourself believe that the person offering could n’t possibly lighten your burdens … and make sure they know that they ’ve stepped out of line by being willing to lend a hand .
( They wo n’t offer again . )
Follow The Path Of Least Resistance
Whenever you have to make a decision , just follow the path of least resistance .
It ’s easier to stay in your current crap job than to hunt around for something better – so stay where you are .
It ’s easier to grab take - out rather than cook , so keep doing it ( and make sure you feel thoroughly miserable about the effect on your wallet and your health ) .
If you ’re feeling demotivated , lethargic and dispirited , do n’t fight it .
Let yourself spend the whole weekend sitting around in your pyjamas , playing video games .
Then beat yourself up ( see number 6 ) for not getting anything useful done .
Never Take A Break
Sometimes , the path of least resistance does n’t lead to duvet days and general apathy – it means carrying on with life at your current reckless rate .
Keep working ridiculous hours ; lack of sleep will contribute to your misery .
Laugh at anyone who suggests a vacation – and tell them ( or at least think to yourself ) that they ’re slackers for wanting a couple of weeks off .
Make sure you ’re burning the candle at both ends – and hating it .
Go to bed miserable , and wake up miserable .
What more could you want ?
I ’m hoping you ’ve not taken the advice in this article too seriously !
If you ’ve got a “ how to be miserable ” tip to add , pop it in the comments .
Even better , if you know a great way to cheer up and get some perspective , let us know that too …
COMIC SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS : Comics this week will be Tuesday and Thursday .
Guest comics will run next week while I get everything in order for New England Webcomics Weekend .
I got a chance to meet Danielle Corsetto at STAPLE this weekend in Austin , TX .
All of the girls in this comic are from her most EXCELLENT comic “ Girls With Slingshots . ”
I highly recommend it .
STAPLE seemed like a fun , non-threatening con , and based on Danielle ’s endorsement I think I will exhibit there next year .
I was visiting family in Austin , but my wife and I managed to sneak away and finally see “ Watchmen . ”
There was WAY more dong than I expected , but I thought it was tastefully done .
Floppity , yet tasteful .
I am waiting for someone on YourTubes to put out the “ ALL DONG ” special edit of the film .
I really enjoyed the movie .
It was slow at times , but it seemed appropriate .
The story and characters carried a lot of weight and it would have seemed phony if they sped through the narrative .
I ’m anxious to read the comic now and see what I think after taking it all in .
I got the feeling from the movie that I knew where the “ comic issues ” began and ended .
The tension seemed to rise and fall about 12 times during the film .
Did I mention the dong ?
There was a lot of it .
Or
“ Cody does not find a suitable apartment ”
“ I ’m a very religious person .
I probably should ’ve told you that on the phone . ”
. : So began a three hour conversation with a potential landlord / roommate .
Some background : I start grad school in September , but I want to spend the summer here beforehand to get a feel for the place .
I can only withstand so much culture shock , you see , and I ’d rather not have it from both grad school and Jersey at the same time .
. : I researched some apartment listings online , but I also wandered around campus looking for fliers with those little tearable phone number slips .
I found one that looked decent : $ 530 / month in a shared household ; I ’d get my own room .
I called the number on the slip , and the man answered with a distinct but not oppressive east coast accent .
The house was far from campus , and I was without a car as well as ignorant of the bus routes , but he said I should go by foot because I probably needed the exercise .
Likable enough .
. : I started in downtown and reached his house in just half a back of sweat later .
Not bad time .
He answered the door and immediately showed me a copy of the lease .
“ By the way , ” he said , “ I ’m a very religious person .
I probably should ’ve told you that on the phone . ”
. : I told him I just spent the last five years at Baylor ; I was used to being around religious people .
“ Are you Baptist ? ” he asked .
I must confess , I had n’t anticipated this natural follow up to my statement , so I fumbled a “ No … ” and let the matter rest there , hoping he would n’t pursue it .
. : He asked me what I was doing , and I told him I was going into plant biology .
“ I was real big into plants a long time ago , ” he said .
“ So peaceful . ”
“ Well , ” I said , “ not always . ”
. : In what I thought was a continuation of the topic , he said he wanted to show me something special when I was done reading the leasing information .
I figured something was up when I got to the last line in the handwritten section on house rules : “ This is a Christian household .
If you hate God do not move in !!! ”
. : That ’s when the crazy started .
The “ something ” he wanted to show me was two statues — one of Mary and one of some saint — that wept .
He keeps them in his room , right next to other iconography and , for some reason , this poster of the fundamental particles of the universe .
. : The babble came fast and furious .
“ Cody ” — for I made the mistake of telling him my name —
“ This right here is proof of God ’s majesty .
These are actual tears — unexplainable tears .
And they came from nowhere .
Matter , from nowhere .
I did n’t put them there .
Nobody put them there .
It ’s not like somebody came by and sprayed water on them .
I ’ve heard people say it ’s humidity and condensation , but that does n’t make any sense .
God directly broke the second law of thermodynamics .
So the big bang theory has another headache .
But that ’s what they still teach in school . ”
. : I may have received only a B + in physical chemistry , but I know damn well that ’s not what the second law of thermodynamics says .
In fact , I told him as much .
I also told him that the big bang theory was first postulated by a catholic priest .
He dismissed both facts without much consideration and bemoaned once again the current “ gospel ” being taught in schools .
. : His attention returned to the statues .
He pointed to the places of the miracles — namely , the faces — and mentioned how they are without blemish or dust , unlike the tops of the heads and shoulders .
This was strong evidence because , as we all know , miracles of God are kept clean .
He then took the opportunity , since I mentioned my Baptist environment , to alleviate my fears by explaining that Catholics do n’t worship icons .
“ These are objects . ”
. : He then asked me if I liked photography .
I knew where this was going .
He pulled out a well - worn binder of photographs and placed it atop the glass casing of an old record player ( the house scored massive retro points , if nothing else ) .
He flipped across page after page of excruciatingly detailed photographs from disposable cameras until he found the one that he , presumably , thought most impressive .
It was a picture of a man standing in a parking lot at night .
Stripped of the important details ( as we shall soon see ) , it looked pretty much like this :
. : But this was no ordinary picture my ordinary eyes were gazing upon !
There was something else to behold , something that ( according to the testimony of Mr. Miracle ) the eye did n’t see at the time the picture was taken — because the human eye and cameras work exactly the same , so when they do n’t record a phenomenon the exact same way , we should get all worked up about it .
. : No , when this picture was developed , there was magic smoke everywhere .
What ’s more , I had a handy guide right next to me who could interpret the significance of every whirl and twirl of said magic smoke .
The billow to the left of the guy , see , was clearly God ’s guiding hand giving a thumbs up ( I am not making this up ; he is ) :
. : Let me assure you ( though you have no reason to trust my artistic ability ) that I am accurately representing the contents of the photograph with my renditions .
( The fingers , I confess , are an embellishment . )
. : Then , right next to the guy , you can see a seated Jesus Christ with His right hand raised in the air .
No outline distinguished God ’s hand from Jesus ’ , obviously — it ’s smoke .
But he assured me the two were separate :
. : But the next one is truly astounding .
To the right of the man you can see , as clear as day , the beak and two wings of the holy spirit ( who is , I did not know , a bird ) :
. : So there ’s the Trinity right there .
But you know catholics are n’t content with just The Big Three ; naturally , they have to bring along Mom , who you can plainly see praying in profile :
. : You can kind of make it all out too , ca n’t you ?
Even though it ’s just my poor drawing ( from memory ! ) of an equally nebulous apparition caught on film , you can kind of see a godly thumbs up , an angel bird , and a burrito - shaped Virgin Mary .
But like I said , I had a handy guide right there telling me what I should see .
He had picked out all the important details to highlight and ignored everything else .
In reality , the photo looked much more like this :
“ Cody , you would n’t believe it , but some people once they look at this tell me they do n’t see anything . ”
This anomaly ( their negative reaction to the miracle , not the miracle itself ) is explained by a lack of grace from God .
That ’s not what he said , of course .
What he really said was God ’s grace towards him allowed him to see the otherwise clear as mud miracle in the image ; I ’m only assuming that the logically consistent converse also applies .
. : I still had n’t said much by this point to challenge any of his assertions .
As gently as possible , I asked him if he had ever shown the picture to other people without first explaining what they should be seeing .
He said he had n’t , and he seemed confused as to why he should .
. : I tried to illustrate by analogy with double - blind tests in medicine : neither the patients nor the doctors know who ’s receiving the medicine and who ’s receiving the placebo until after the results are recorded .
Likewise , a simple test for the anomaly in the photograph would be to give people two photos ( the “ miracle ” and an ordinary photograph ) and ask them to point out the one with the miracle in it .
Unsurprisingly , he felt no need up until now to perform any such test , but he did happily offer me the task .
. : I did n’t get a chance to tell him that it ’s not my burden , because he liked to move from topic to topic .
He returned once more to his statues , and I could n’t resist offering another test concerning the perennial cleanliness of the their faces : the parts that accumulate dust all happen to be horizontal surfaces ; the weeping faces are both vertical .
A simple test would be to lay the statues on their backs , face up , and see if dusts accumulates .
. : He objected , “ That part is n’t really that relevant . ”
“ Well if it is n’t relevant , why would you tell me in the first place ? ” Subject change .
. : There were several annoying refrains throughout the conversation .
“ I used to be a skeptic like you when I was younger ” popped up more than once , as did “ I ’m a scientist by training too . ”
( Electrical engineering , in case you ’re collecting data points for the Salem Hypothesis . )
For some reason , maybe because I have a bad habit of nodding my head when somebody talks to me at length , he assumed I was religious , even though the only information I offered on the matter was that I was not a Baptist .
Far be it from me to correct him .
Maybe , I thought , he ’d listen a little more closely to what I said if he were n’t immediately prejudiced by my renunciation of belief in God ( a folly strategy , I realize , but whatever ) .
. :
The last miracle he thought worthy to mention had to do with some old lady who allegedly lives on nothing but the wafer used in the Eucharist .
I pointed out that there are those who can one - up that claim , and his youthful skepticism returned !
I also offered a simple test for the old lady ’s claim : ipecac .
We would expect the stomach of someone who lives on only a meager wafer to hold nothing more substantial than acid and mucus .
A single kernel of corn would give the game away .
Unfortunately for him , the test is one - way : nothing but mucus and acid could simply mean she had n’t eaten anything that day , not that she eats nothing else ever .
. : Mr. Miracle demurred .
“ What could be more simple than just watching her ? ” Indeed .
What could be more simple than maintaining constant surveillance of an elderly woman for weeks on end , never letting her out of your sights for a moment , recording her presence on camera and having others review the hours and hours of footage ?
He ’s right : one sip of ipecac is too complicated .
. : He wants it both ways : he wants the real - world validity miracles offer , but he immediately rejects the use of any real - world methods of verification .
What gets me is that he should n’t be afraid of such investigations , because when push comes to shove he always has an ace card up his sleeve : Satan .
. : Satan , I ’ve learned , is the Great Unfalsifier .
So the lady took some ipecac and barfed up tuna salad ?
Satan put it there .
He ’s capable of miracles too , I was told .
And as near as I can tell , his role is to render all religious claims unfalsifiable .
Ca n’t see God ’s presence in the picture ?
Satan ’s messing with your grace .
You can see God ’s presence in the picture ?
Congratulations , you ’ve bested Satan !
. : I ’m sure some thoughtful Catholic reading this will correct me and tell me that ’s not how Satan really acts , according to church doctrine .
Thing is , I ’m not the one who needs to be told that .
This wackaloon is the one claiming to be an adherent to doctrine .
But there are more simple Catholics than there are thoughtful Catholics ( his words , not mine , so spare me the griping ) , and for them miracles and cartoonish visions of Satan are more important than philosophy and reason .
Unfortunately , the childish superstitions this man holds are unlikely to be repudiated from behind the pulpit any time soon , and until they are I am free and right to criticize any religion that tolerates them .
. : Damn shame , too , because the house was a pretty nice place .
Decent sized room , serviceable kitchen , and nice location , plus the cheapest rent I could find .
Of course , overnight visitors were forbidden — he does not abide fornication in his residence .
( This kind of moral steadfastness did not preclude him from describing the balcony as “ a nice place to look at all the cute girls passing by . ” )
He described a previous female tenant in more than flattering terms but was quick to point out that he does n’t take in tenants to date them .
“ Phew , ” I said , placing my hand on my chest , “ I sure am relieved . ”
He squirmed a little and said , in all seriousness , “ No , I do n’t do that kind of thing . ”
. : We said our goodbyes and I left .
I never told him what I really thought .
In fact , I told him quite a few things that I did n’t think .
I ’m a little ashamed of that , too .
I wish I were more open about my beliefs , if not for integrity ’s sake then for pragmatism ’s :
“ I ’m a very religious person .
I probably should ’ve told you that on the phone . ”
“ That ’s nice .
I ’m not a religious person . ”
“ Oh .
On your way , then .
No need to talk to you for three hours . ”
“ Very good .
See you never . ” [ Exit ]
. : There is one redeeming aspect to this story : on the way back to my motel room I hailed a taxi cab .
Before driving off , the driver had a short conversation with a fellow cabbie .
Apparently somebody had committed suicide by throwing themselves on the train tracks , and this had caused several delays and considerable loss of business for the taxis by the station .
The friend said something about this being a reason why people should go to church :
“ That ’s what happens when you do n’t believe in God — you commit suicide . ”
My cabbie vehemently agreed :
“ People who do n’t believe in God are fucked up . ”
. : I sat the whole ride in silence .
When we finally arrived , I reached for my money and said , “ You know , concerning that conversation you had with your friend , I just wanted to say that I do n’t believe in God and I love my life .
Here ’s your fare . ”
. : He paused for a second , genuinely , I believe , bemused .
“ You do n’t believe in God ? ” he asked incredulously .
“ I do n’t , ” I said , gently closing the door and walking away .

Writing these posts is getting tougher and tougher .
The comments get shriller and less rational from the antivax crowd ; they scream their own personal anecdotes , they tell long - debunked lies , and do everything they can to avoid the fact that solid , rock - hard evidence shows no link at all between vaccines and autism .
And in the meantime , babies die because of the antivaccination movement .
If you think Jenny McCarthy , Jim Carrey , and the rest of the ignorant antiscience antivax people are right , then read this story .
I dare you .
David McCaffery writes about his daughter , Dana , who was four weeks old when she died .
Too young to get vaccinated herself , she contracted whooping cough because vaccination rates in that part of Australia are too low to provide herd immunity .
This poor little girl died in her father ’s arms , and the blame rests squarely on the antivaccination movement .
That ’s not an anecdote , that ’s data .
David and Toni McCaffery on Australian TV .
After Dana ’s story was told on the Australian TV show " Sunday Night " there was such a reaction that Channel 7 decided to hold a forum about vaccinations .
Richard Saunders and Rachael Dunlop from The Australian Skeptics were there — you can read Rachael ’s personal account of the forum — and Richard has posted video from the forum .
This is heartbreaking , and made worse by Meryl Dorey , the biggest antivax mouthpiece in Australia .
Listening to her makes my blood boil .
She is a typical antivax promoter : she has no real data , so she manipulates and spins .
She throws baseless accusations at the doctor on stage , and uses all sorts of tactics like that to convince people she ’s right .
She is n’t .
Vaccinations do not cause autism .
Vaccinations have some small risk , but it ’s far , far less than the danger from measles , rubella , whooping cough , and all the other easily preventable diseases .
Then listen ( at 6:30 into the video ) to the woman who did n’t vaccinate her son .
She herself says she does n’t know enough about the issue to say much in response to another woman in the audience who was concerned over her own son ’s safety .
She admitted she does n’t have all the facts , but she still decided not to vaccinate her kid .
Wow .
The antivax movement thrives on ignorance like that .
Then , at about 7:00 into the video , the McCafferys speak .
It tears my heart apart to hear them talk about their baby daughter .
The only good thing here is that Meryl Dorey had her arguments eviscerated by the doctor on stage .
That ’s because her arguments have no substance , no science , no real data behind them .
All the antivaxxers have is panic and fear and lies .
Talk to your doctor , and if they recommend it , vaccinate your kids .
You may be saving far more than just their lives ; the sad truth is that if more parents in Australia had gotten vaccinations for their children , Dana McCaffery would still be alive today .
If you fight against vaccines , then keep that fact in mind .
And please , contact the people at " Sunday Night " and send them some support .
They did a great job exposing the antivax movement and getting some real information out to the public .
The producer ’s name is Rebecca le Tourneau and she is happy to get international support about this .

In a shameless attempt to increase blogviews , I have stooped to publishing a page with two salacious stories that are sure to pique the interest of the minions .
First off , here is a story of a man who hears his teenage daughter scream .
He rushed to her bedroom to find a naked man , wearing a ski-mask and latex gloves with a bunch of condoms .
Dad choked the man to death .

Still … dad choked the man to death .
It does not appear that the Indiana authorities will charge dad .
In Texas , they ’d give him a parade .
Chuck Norris would be proud …. and I bet we know who this young woman ’s hero will be for the rest of her life .

If we , the people who make websites , want the world to know who we are and what we do , it ’s up to each of us to stand up and represent .
Last year , 30,055 of you did just that , taking time out of your busy day to answer the sometimes detailed and often thought - provoking questions in the second A List Apart Survey .
Article Continues Below
This year ’s findings paint a clearer picture of the distinctions between full - time and freelance web professionals : how you work , what you earn , and what you love about the job .
Interestingly , too , despite the brutality of a global recession that was already in full swing ( like an axe ) when we offered the survey , most respondents revealed a surprisingly high level of job security , satisfaction , and confidence in the future .
A website instead of a white paper#section2
For 2008 , instead of a downloadable ( PDF ) white paper , we decided to present our findings on the web .
Which meant , in addition to compiling and analyzing data and reporting our findings with words and charts , we had to create a website and convert findable , accessible XHTML table data into clear and beauteous CSS charts .
The website is now housed at a temporary location while we finish some back - end work related to the way we publish the magazine .
A permanent URL will be published here soon .
Meanwhile , visit the website at its temporary URL to see what your participation in the 2008 survey helped us learn about our profession .
Slice it yourself #section3

Memalyze : Dynamic Analysis of Memory Access Behavior in Software
skape
This paper describes strategies for dynamically analyzing an application 's memory access behavior .
These strategies make it possible to detect when a read or write is about to occur at a given location in memory while an application is executing .
An application 's memory access behavior can provide additional insight into its behavior .
For example , it may be able to provide an idea of how data propagates throughout the address space .
Three individual strategies which can be used to intercept memory accesses are described in this paper .
Each strategy makes use of a unique method of intercepting memory accesses .
These methods include the use of Dynamic Binary Instrumentation ( DBI ) , x86 hardware paging features , and x86 segmentation features .
A detailed description of the design and implementation of these strategies for 32 - bit versions of Windows is given .
Potential uses for these analysis techniques are described in detail .

White asparagus is pictured at a food market in Vienna , April 23 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Leonhard Foeger
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German police are searching for a motorist who beat a 24 - year - old woman selling white asparagus because he was upset about her asking price for the coveted springtime vegetable , police said on Monday .
The prices for white asparagus , sometimes called “ edible ivory ” in Germany , fluctuate wildly during the short springtime season , peaking early in the season at 10 euros per kilo .
The man screamed at the woman that her asparagus was overpriced .
He then punched her in the face and threatened to unleash his attack dog at her .
She fled and called police .
“ The motorist said her prices were totally over the top , ” said Dietmar Keck , police spokesman in the Havelland district west of Berlin , without saying how much she was asking .
Prices for asparagus now range from 1 to 5 euros per kilo , he said .
Some 55,000 tons valued at 175 million euros are harvested annually .
MOSCOW  Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin ’s governing party has won handily in regional elections , Russia ’s Central Election Commission said Monday , in his first electoral test since the economy began to turn dire .
Mr. Putin ’s party , United Russia , won the majority of seats in all nine regions where local parliamentary elections were held Sunday , and nearly swept smaller municipal elections .
The Communist Party , which complained of widespread violations , came in a distant second .
United Russia officials called the resounding victory evidence that Mr. Putin ’s response to the economic crisis , including supporting the ruble and selected bailouts , had spared many Russians the ill effects of a rapidly tumbling economy .
“ These elections show that the steps taken by the government and the legislature are correct and directed at preventing serious impacts of the global crisis on the economic situation in Russia , ” said Boris Gryzlov , the party chairman .
April 18 , 2009 – April 24 , 2009
Edge Rails has been undergoing major surgery for the past week , as the core team gets ready for a Rails 3.0 alpha release at RailsConf .
We saw about 50 commits to the master branch in GitHub this week .
Here ’s a quick overview of the recent changes .
Rails 2.3.x
Changes
Before digging into the changes on the master branch , there were a few things committed to the 2 - 3 - stable branch .
If you ’re running on 2.3 edge , these are ready for you ; they ’re also ported to the master branch already .
A couple of bugs involving associations with hash conditions have been fixed , notable to make sure that : dependent => : delete will work .
will work .
The PostgreSQL Active Record adapter now does the right thing if you use tables in non -default schemas .
You need to set the table name in your model class , of course : set_table_name ' other_schema.customers ' commit
commit Also in the PostgreSQL adapter , a couple of bugs related to wrong quoting of names with capital letters are fixed .
ActionView :: Path Refactoring
One major chunk of change in Rails 3 this week comes from the continued work to refactor Action Pack .
This time , ActionView : : Path was the target .
Changes in commit include decoupling ActionView :: Path from Action Controller and Action Mailer , which gives us two major benefits .
First , consolidating similar code in one place makes it easier to understand and maintain .
Second , by abstracting this stuff and giving it an API , we ’ll make it possible for other components to participate in the controller layer , beyond mailers and traditional controllers .
There ’s also some work here to set up for the future .
The plan is to decouple templates from the file system , and to decouple localization from ActionView .
Stay tuned !
Pluggable JSON Backends
You may recall that recently Rails went to pluggable XML support .
This week , thanks to work from Rick Olson , we have pluggable JSON .
This means that you can replace the default YAML - based JSON support with the JSON gem :
ActiveSupport :: JSON.backend = " JSONGem "
As part of this change , Rails now uses ActiveSupport :: JSON.encode ( ) wherever it needs JSON .
This replaces using # to_json , and Rails team is recommending that you do the same .
If you do choose to use # to_json , you need to be aware that some libraries might override it .
You can use this pattern to make sure that you ’re getting Rails ’ own definition of # to_json :
gem ' json ' # JSON gem loaded , which overwrites to_json ActiveSupport :: JSON.
backend = " JSONGem " class ActiveRecord : : Base # replace the gem's to_json with Rails ' own to_json alias to_json rails_to_json end
Active Support à la carte
In Rails 2.x , require " active_support " pulls in all core extensions at once .
In Rails 3 , require " active_support " only makes the extensions available ; you have to explicitly require those you wish to use .
Many of this week ’s changes were concerned with breaking up Active Support so you can take just what you need and nothing more .
The end result is that it ’s easy to cherry - pick features from Active Support without feeling like you ’ve invited a portly gentleman for a piggyback ride .
As an added bonus , all core extension documentation is now consolidated in one place : the core class .
You do n’t have to go poking around every extension module to find a method .
Internally , the core extensions have been reorganized so they can be directly required without assuming all of Active Support is available .
Want inflections like " car " . pluralize ?
require " active_support/core_ext/string /inflections " and you ’ve got them .
Note : the implementation and organization will change as we settle on the best way to provide core extensions .
Other Edge Changes
After 30 years of frosty relations , an Iranian delegation briefly met Richard Holbrooke , the US envoy who is playing a key role in negotiating President Barack Obama 's exit strategy from Afghanistan , at the Hague conference on last month .
The country also held its first formal talks with Nato for three decades .
In what could prove to be a landmark discovery , a leading paleontologist said scientists have dug up the 47 million - year - old fossil of an ancient primate whose features suggest it could be the common ancestor of all later monkeys , apes and humans .
Anthropologists have long believed that humans evolved from ancient ape - like ancestors .
Some 50 million years ago , two ape - like groups walked the Earth .
One is known as the tarsidae , a precursor of the tarsier , a tiny , large - eyed creature that lives in Asia .
Another group is known ...
White House
It 's time to play Fill That Supreme Court Seat , and cable TV's " Democratic insiders " and " GOP strategists " are already blabbing and bloviating about Obama 's pick , Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
To help the pundits ( but , ultimately , the bloggers , and maybe even , you know , the senators confirming her or at least you , dear reader ) wade through the legalese , we 've assembled a microcosmic dossier of Sotomayor decisions , complete with over - the - top talking points for both sides of the aisle .
The Pro-Labor Yankee Fan : Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee ( 1995 )
The National Labor Relations Board , on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players Association , filed suit against MLB club owners during the strike of 1994 - 1995 .
The players aimed to reinstate bargaining points that the owners had removed from contract negotiations .
Judge Sotomayor ordered the players and owners to restart negotiations with the bargaining points back on the table , effectively ending the strike that threatened to destroy baseball as we know it .
She took a broad , pro-labor interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act .
" This strike has placed the entire concept of collective bargaining on trial , " Sotomayor wrote in her opinion .
Why She 's Brilliant
The case indicates Sotomayor 's willingness to give labor the benefit of the doubt , to protect fair collective bargaining , to take on powerful , power - grabbing interests , yada yada yada .
All good stuff .
Here 's what it really shows :
She 's got the stones to step up and be a national hero when duty calls .
Which will come in handy when that Scalia scoundrel tries to lurch the country toward fascism .
Why She 's a Lunatic
Yeah , she saved baseball .
Whatever .
If this had been Silverman v. National Badminton Players Federation , we all would have yawned .
Look beyond the populism and you 'll find a judge who buddies up to unions at every turn , no matter the consequences .
Oh , and you can toss her claims of impartiality out the window at trial , she admitted to being a lifelong Yankees fan .

After New York City terminated its contracts with the nonprofit agency HANAC because of alleged corruption , the organization challenged the city 's right to do so .
Judge Sotomayor found that the city could not transfer the contracts to other nonprofits without offering the agency a formal hearing , basing her decision on city rules .
" This one troubles me , " she said in the court hearing , raising questions " about whether the Mayor had inappropriately , or even unconstitutionally , injected himself into the contracting process , " perhaps to divert attention from a city official 's own alleged corruption .
In her opinion , Sotomayor noted that HANAC was initially not told about the order that had effectively terminated its contracts .
She also discussed the harm to HANAC 's reputation that may have resulted from the cancellation of the contracts .
Why She 's Brilliant
The case shows Sotomayor 's evergreen willingness to stand up to bloated government officials who bend the rules when there is benefit to be reaped .
Her decision itself was based on a crystal - clear violation of city rules , but she notes other ways in which city officials acted like assholes : concealing news of the contract severance from HANAC , for example .
She does n't coldly ignore those little contextual nuggets ; she incorporates them .
Why She 's a Lunatic
Sotomayor was so eager to rule against the Giuliani administration that she overlooked an obvious roadblock : as a federal judge , she had no jurisdiction to hear the case .
An appeals court later ruled that the case belonged in the state court system .
Sotomayor should never have delivered a verdict .
This leaves two disturbing options : either she does n't understand the difference between a federal and state court , or she knew she did n't have jurisdiction , but was so " troubled " that she thought she could sneak this one through .
The Protector of the Homeless : Archie v. Grand Central Partnership ( 1998 )
Darek Niedzieski/iStock
Homeless advocates charged that a community partnership was underpaying homeless people for their work under a workforce training program .
Judge Sotomayor ruled that the program 's organizers by calling the homeless " trainees " and paying less than $ 2 an hour to perform menial work had violated the law .
She found that many of the conditions for trainee work status were not satisfied , and discounted the argument that some of the workers agreed to work for free .
Her opinion also mentioned the partnership 's financial gain from the cheap labor , a partnership official 's exorbitant salary and allegations of worker abuse .
Why She 's Brilliant
Sotomayor drew on a firm set of guidelines to decide this case , showing a healthy respect for the letter of the law .
What 's more , she recognized the egregious exploitation of downtrodden souls who did n't have the means to fight back .
It 's just the sort of empathetic approach that President Obama values in a jurist .
Why She 's a Lunatic
Sotomayor 's overbroad interpretation of labor law speaks volumes about her distaste for free - labor markets .
When adults consent to work for free , that 's not exploitation it 's volunteerism !
By harping on the company 's profits , alleged abuses and executive paychecks , she 's not interpreting the law she 's demonizing a legitimate business , painting it as a heartless , slave - driving cartel .
In reality , this was a partnership aiming to help the homeless , an activity made more difficult due to Sotomayor 's meddling .
The DUI Do-Over : Krimstock v. Kelly ( 2002 )
Eugene Richards
This class-action suit against New York City challenged a vehicle - seizure policy allowing law enforcement to hold vehicles seized during misdemeanors until an eventual forfeiture proceeding a waiting period that could take years .
Judge Sotomayor ruled that the city needed to allow prompt hearings for vehicle owners to challenge the impoundment .
She cited various state and local statutes dealing with post - seizure hearing and detention procedures and innocent owner defenses .
She also drew on the Fourth and Fourteenth amendments to come to the conclusion that the city 's seizure policies violated due - process rights .
" A car or truck is often central to a person 's livelihood or daily activities , " Sotomayor wrote .
Why She 's Brilliant
As a judicial realist , Sotomayor recognizes the obvious : you do n't compound a man 's wheels for two years because of a DUI .
That actually had been happening under New York 's inane seizure policy , and clearly someone needed to call bullshit .
Sotomayor 's broad interpretation of civil liberties laws to support her decision show her cognizance of the ways in which police can adversely and unnecessarily burden the lives of average Joes , and they show her tendency to err on the side of constitutional protection over strict law enforcement procedure .
Why She 's a Lunatic
Sotomayor 's decision seems reasonable enough , but her reasoning reveals a paranoid distrust of law enforcement .
In her opinion , she questions police officers ' ability to act as fair brokers to the accused , citing the " risk of erroneous seizure " and even mentioning the police department 's financial interest in seizing property .
It 's a bizarre implication for a federal judge to make does n't exactly inspire confidence in the justice system , does it ?
The Disgruntled Draft Pick : Maurice Clarett v. NFL ( 2004 )

Former Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett sued the NFL over claims that an eligibility rule violated antitrust law .
Judge Sotomayor decided that the rule requiring draftees to be at least three years removed from high school is exempt from antitrust law because of special exceptions made for collective bargaining .
She rejected Clarett 's argument that the eligibility rule put an undue restriction on the labor market , citing unions ' longstanding right to help shape hiring criteria .
Why She 's Brilliant
Sotomayor has a clear record in favor of strong collective bargaining arrangements .
Even in the face of seemingly competing rules antitrust provisions designed to promote free competition she decided to protect unions ' sway over employment standards .
More importantly , she protected the NFL from having to employ underage punks in general , and Clarett in particular .
Why She 's a Lunatic
Yet another pro-labor decision .
When it comes to cases in which labor law is in dispute , whatever the merits , smart money says Sotomayor sides with the unions .
In fact , legal scholars have slammed this case , calling it an overbroad application of the legal loophole that allows antitrust exemptions .
A St. John 's Law Review article dedicated to the case accused Sotomayor of " tipping the scales of the delicate balance between federal labor law and antitrust law too far in favor of labor law . "
Matthew Emmons / US PRESSWIRE via Newscom
Several environmental groups recently challenged an EPA rule regulating water - intake structures at power plants , arguing that the rule did not adequately protect the surrounding aquatic life .
Judge Sotomayor rejected the EPA rule on the basis that cost - benefit analysis was an inappropriate rationale for rulemaking .
She took issue with the EPA 's establishment of a range of methods with which power plants could comply with the Clean Water Act , rather than a single standard , writing that the decision to do so was n't well explained and " frustrated effective judicial review . "
Sotomayor strongly rejected proposed restoration measures such as restocking fish as a way to minimize environmental impact , even citing the dictionary definition of the word " minimize " to make her argument .
Why She 's Brilliant
Sotomayor drew heavily on past court decisions to rule in favor of sensible environmental regulation and to chide the EPA for its lax , poorly reasoned policymaking .
You need n't be a wild - eyed treehugger to recognize that " minimizing " aquatic suffering does n't mean slaughtering as many salmon as you 'd like , so long as you dump a few fresh ones back in the river .
Is it any wonder that a smart judge would chide George W. Bush 's EPA for its cloudy logic ?
Why She 's a Lunatic
Sotomayor 's decision was overturned by the Supreme Court , which found cost - benefit analysis a -okay .
Clearly she was determined to side with the activists , in spite of the law , and she grabbed at straws to do so .
Who cares that the EPA did n't explain why it used cost - benefit analysis ?
The Clean Water
Act left the policy process open - ended for a reason to allow the EPA to regulate without micromanagement from Congress .
Or activist judges .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Workmen rolled up their sleeves at American International Group
Inc this weekend to take down the most prominent sign at the downtown Manhattan offices of the embattled insurer that has become the scorn of America .
A spokesman said the company had decided to replace the large AIG sign -- outside the entrance to its property - casualty offices -- as part of its plan to change that operation ’s name to AIU Holdings Ltd .
The move is designed to “ distinguish these well - capitalized businesses from AIG , ” said a second spokesman .
The signage is outside the company ’s Water Street offices , around the corner from AIG ’s Pine Street headquarters , which has long only been marked by an understated brass plaque inscribed “ American International Building . ”
AIG has said it may sell the headquarter building , as part of its drive to raise funds to repay its debt to the U.S. government .
The AIG name , once the proud moniker of the world ’s largest insurer , has become tainted since large losses on mortgage bets necessitated a government bailout of $ 85 billion last September .
Twice since more aid has been given to AIG , with the rescue now costing U.S. taxpayers up to $ 180 billion .
The AIG name has become even more tarnished in the past week , after a scandal erupted over bonuses to executives of a controversial financial products unit that caused much of the $ 100 billion in losses over the past year .
A rebranding to distance the giant insurer ’s sprawling operations across 130 countries away from the AIG name are likely to continue .
“ I think the AIG name is so thoroughly wounded and disgraced that we ’re probably going to have to change it , ” Liddy told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee last Wednesday .
WHAT ’S IN A NAME
AIG ’s roots date back to China in 1919 but it has only carried the American International name since 1967 , when the new company was incorporated to hold the shares of the group ’s growing insurance operations .
Since AIG ’s bailout last September , other of the company ’s businesses have also rebranded , in most cases returning to earlier names .
A U.S. auto insurance unit , AIG Direct , for example , has changed its name back to 21st Century , the name it used until 2007 when AIG , already a majority owner , acquired 100 percent of the company .
In the case of AIU Holdings , the company said earlier this month that it was renaming its global property - casualty business ahead of plans to eventually spin off about 20 percent of this business in a public stock offering , and could sell off more over time .
The prettiest of the * buntu ’s is coming
Ubuntu ’s brownish / orangy theme has been the target of much criticism .
What is often forgotten is that one of its derivatives has been looking very good for quite a while now : Xubuntu .
A complete visual overhaul for the upcoming version 9.04 is all set to continue this trend .
Pasi Lallinaho , picking up the baton from Jozsef Mak , leverages Xfce ’s extensive theming capabilities to provide a coherent look and feel with wonderful new themes .
Update :
This article previously contained a paragraph about a new GTK theme , but unfortunately , that did n’t make it in in time , meaning the visual overhaul is now “ just ” a new wallpaper , login window theme and icon theme , so scrap the part about extensive theming capabilities 😉
The theme for the login screen pictures a misty forest set next to a lake , in Xubuntu ’s characteristic colour scheme .
Then there is the gorgeous new wallpaper , bearing a watermark of the Xubuntu logo on a canvas of the same defining shades of blue .
To complement it all , the GNOME - Colors icon theme is included .
GNOME - Colors is a very complete theme , including a wide range of good - looking icons that very well match the rest of Xubuntu ’s artwork .
Of course , a release this pretty deserves some buzz – if not for the great looks , then at least for the host of new features , such as the new version of Xfce – and you can help !
If you own a website or blog , you can include a countdown banner with the following HTML code :
< a href = " http://xubuntu.org/ " title = " Learn more about Xubuntu ... " >< img src= " http://xubuntu.org/xubuntu-static/jaunty-countdown/ " alt =" Countdown to Xubuntu ( xubuntu.org ) 9.04 , by Pasi Lallinaho " ></a>
Alternatively , if you are a member of a forum or other online community , you can include it in your signature , forum posts or other places you ’d like to promote Xubuntu , with the following BBCode :

Of course , the countdown banner , too , was created by Pasi in the style of the new Xubuntu desktop .
With all the reality - free nonsense being peddled by Republican luminaries these days , I figured a “ History Flashback ” would be a good feature to introduce to the site .
Today : Republicans are going around half - cocked on the Judge Sotomayor nomination , including jabs at the concept of empathy , her hard - to - pronounce name and the funny - sounding ethnic foods she likes to eat .
Their high dudgeon has metastasized into loud accusations that Judge Sotomayor is a “ bigot ” and a “ racist “ .
They ’ve dismissed her out of hand as a “ dumb ” “ affirmative action ” pick .
Yesteryear : President Bush nominated Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals back in 2003 .
Democrats filibustered the nomination , which drove the GOP ballistic and resulted in accusations that Democrats were prejudiced against Hispanics .
Here ’s what some of them said :
Trent Lott — Trent Lott ! — said of Democrats , “ They do n’t want Miguel Estrada because he ’s Hispanic . ”
When Florida Sen. Bob Graham ( D ) voted against Estrada , none other than Rush Limbaugh ran a statement on his website with a headline that read , “ Bob Graham ’s Crusade Against Hispanic Judges . ”
As Steve Benen put it :
In 2003 , a variety of Republicans argued that Democratic opposition to a Hispanic judicial nominee was necessarily evidence of Democratic racism .
Now that conservatives are worked up over Sonia Sotomayor , I wonder whether Republicans are prepared to be held to the same standard .
Update : Media Matters has more examples of Republicans screaming that Democrats were necessarily racist because they opposed Estrada :
Republican Sen. Jon Kyl Said “ I See This , Really , As A Slap At Hispanics . ”
As reported by the Washington Times : “ Republicans have seized on Mr. Estrada ’s stalled nomination to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and Hispanic voters , whose ranks are growing faster than any other minority group in America .
‘ I see this , really , as a slap at Hispanics , ’ Sen. Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican , said Wednesday . ”
[ Washington Times , 3/14/03 ; emphasis added ] … Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla Said Opposition To Estrada Was “ The Biggest Anti-Hispanic Crusade This City Has Ever Seen . ”
As reported by the Washington Times : “ Senate Democrats yesterday again blocked the nomination of lawyer Miguel A. Estrada to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
The vote sustained for the second time a Democratic filibuster of the Estrada nomination .
His supporters responded with accusations of racism and President Bush declared that ‘ the judicial confirmation process is broken . ’
‘ It ’s a sad day , ’ Rep. Henry Bonilla , Texas Republican , said after the vote .
‘ This is the biggest anti-Hispanic crusade this city has ever seen . ' ”
[ Washington Times , 3/14/03 ; emphasis added ]
Updated : Pwtenny has some helpful background on the Estrada affair :
If government officials are prosecuted for approving torture , let ’s include Congress
President Obama says he ’s open to prosecuting Bush officials for their anti-terror legal advice .
This comes only two days after Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said no prosecutions were being considered because this is not the time for “ anger and retribution ” .
So much for “ looking forward ” .
Well , if government officials are to be prosecuted for approving “ torture , ” should n’t we include Congress ?
After all , Congress was fully briefed and approved of the “ enhanced ” interrogation tactics used by the CIA .
But then , that would mean Congress would have to investigate and prosecute itself .
You know , kind of like Barney Frank fixing the financial mess he helped create .
The Wall Street Journal notes in its “ Presidential Poison ” editorial that Bush officials wo n’t ( or should n’t ) be the only ones on the hot seat if this goes forward : “ Congress will face questions about what the Members knew and when , especially Nancy Pelosi when she was on the House Intelligence Committee in 2002 .
The Speaker now says she remembers hearing about waterboarding , though not that it would actually be used .
Porter Goss , her GOP counterpart at the time , says he knew exactly what he was hearing and that , if anything , Ms. Pelosi worried the CIA was n’t doing enough to stop another attack .
By all means , put her under oath .
Here ’s an idea that might help jog Pelosi ’s memory as to what she actually heard and approved :
Waterboard ‘er .

Nationals Uniform Fail
( Image via Comcast SportsyNet )
Brutal loss tonight for the Nats .
Great start from John Lannan , one - run lead with the closer on at home , and then dinger in the top of the ninth , extra innings , three singles leading to a Marlins run , and a bottom - of - the - tenth - no - outs runner stranded at second .
Oh well , at least the names on the uniforms were spelled correctly .
Yeah .
So , subtle shot at Peter Angelos ?
Acknowledgment that the team will not be oh - fer this season in the W - L column ?
A desire for the team name to be an anagram for Anal Snit , Natal Sin and / or Slain Ant ?
You be the judge .
In more Nationals news , Chris Cooley is now taking aim .
Here 's what he wrote when discussing the invite list for his first new pool party .
Invites will go first to the entire Caps team after they win the Stanley Cup , which should coincide nicely with the Nats getting their second or third win of the season .
uch , majr cheap sht , Clley .
And in yet more Nats news , Caron Butler is thinking of making a return to the first - pitch circuit this weekend , after his disastrous throw two seasons ago .
" I do n't need to practice , man , " he said , when discussing the upcoming throw .
" Put that [ stuff ] on YouTube .... I 'm not doing it for the media attention , I 'm doing it for my own inner confidence .
Brother , I ai n't been right since that damn pitch .
I 've got to go back and find myself . "
Maybe he can find some extra vowels , while he 's at it .
From Think Progress :
Last month , Phillip Zelikow disclosed that while serving as a top-aide to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2005 , he had written and circulated a memo expressing grave concerns about the Bush administration ’s torture regime .
Another memo Zelikow co-authored at around the same time even offered a legal alternative to the program .
Now , it turns out that strong opposition to President Bush ’s interrogation policies came from within his tight - knit inner circle .
Karen Hughes , counselor to the president , told the Houston Chronicle this week that she was “ very vocal in the internal debate ” :
She acknowledged the current uproar over interrogation tactics and allegations of prisoner torture during the Bush years .
“ I was very vocal in the internal debate , ” she said .
“ I worried about how that would make us look in the eyes of the world .
But I had left the White House when a lot of that was taking place . ”
Then she paused , worried for the first time in 90 minutes that she ’d made a gaffe .
Whatever Sen. John McCain says about interrogation techniques , she added quickly , she has similar views .
It does not get any plainer than that .
The world is full of crazy and wonderful things and I 've scoured the Interwebs to find some of the world 's biggest stuff .
My journey across the web lead me to find that the world has a bunch of weird random crap that I would have never guessed .
Some of this stuff is quite mind blowing and I learned a few things on my quest .
One is that I 'd never like to own a dog that could easily eat me in one bite , and the other is that I must visit the world 's biggest McDonalds !
#1 ) World 's Biggest McDonalds
There has been some debate over whether or not this is truly the world 's biggest McDonalds , but it pretty much is .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
An invasion of unidentified worms has forced 50 herdsmen and their families from their grassland homes , taking 20,000 head of livestock with them , in northwest China ’s Xinjiang region , state news agency Xinhua said Friday .
The worms are packed up to 3,000 per square meter and chew through the grasslands like lawnmowers , leaving only brown soil in their wake , Xinhua said .
The agency described it as the worst plague in three decades in Usu , about 280 km ( 175 miles ) west of the Xinjiang capital Urumqi .
Local experts could not identify the 2 - cm ( 1 inch ) long , thorny green worm with black stripes and samples had been sent to Xinjiang Agricultural University , Xinhua said .
“ The pasture was green a week ago .
But now the worms are creeping around , and they even come into my house .
I have to sweep them out several times an hour , ” Xinhua quoted one herdsman as saying .
Xinjiang has in the past used chickens , ducks and other birds to fight locusts , which are also a menace on the grasslands , but so far they have shown little interest in the pesky worms .
One local official said the worms might be moth larvae that have flourished in the relatively warm winter and plenty of rain .
HOUSTON , April 9 ( UPI ) --
By age 12 , 12 percent of U.S. students had already engaged in vaginal sex , 7.9 percent in oral sex and 6.5 percent in anal sex , U.S. researchers have learned .
Christine Markham of the University of Texas School of Public Health and colleagues examined sexual risk behaviors among middle - school students in a large southeastern U.S. urban public school district .

" This is one of the few school - based studies conducted with this age group to look at specific sexual practices in order to develop more effective prevention programs , " Markham said in a statement .
" This study shows that although most seventh graders are not engaging in sexual risk behaviors , a small percentage are putting themselves at risk . "
For the purposes of the study , Markham and colleagues defined sexual intercourse as vaginal , oral or anal sex .
The findings are alarming because youth who start having sex before age 14 are much more likely to have multiple lifetime sexual partners , use alcohol or drugs before sex and have unprotected sex , all of which puts them at greater risk for getting a sexually transmitted disease or becoming pregnant , Markham said .
The study , published in the Journal of School Health , said one - third of the sexually active students reported engaging in vaginal or anal sex without a condom within the past 3 months and one - fourth had four or more partners , the study said .

Tourists flock in their hundreds of thousands to Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing .
They can marvel at history in the Forbidden City and gaze at modern China 's fashionably dressed citizens dodging shoals of Mercedes .
What they will not see is any hint of the recent past in Tiananmen Square - there is nothing which commemorates the deaths of the hundreds , perhaps thousands of people in June 1989 , the massacre which brought a brutal end to many weeks of demonstrations .
Twenty years later , we wanted to make a programme about what happened to those caught up in the events - the student leaders , the workers and those who were injured or knew someone who had died .
And because recent history has been re-written by the Chinese authorities , we anticipated problems .
We applied for the official " journalist visas " , announced during last year 's Olympic Games - offering greater openness and freedom for the foreign press .
Engaging ineptitude Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
After months of waiting - and advice from Chinese journalists that hen 's teeth might be more available - we entered the country on tourist visas .
Our first two days of filming involved uniformed policemen sticking their white - gloved hands in front of the lens , while their plainclothes counterparts attempted to tail us through heavy traffic in Chengdu - with engaging ineptitude .
At one point we were followed by five vehicles , all of which appeared to have no idea how to tail anyone - especially when we abandoned our driver and hopped on a bus .
At one point we made a detour to avoid leading them to an interviewee - who is known to the police for dissident views - and I ended up in an organic farm talking earnestly to a rather puzzled man about cabbages while the police officers bobbed up and down behind a field of flowering rapeseed .
It would all seem something of a cat and mouse game for us , except for the fact that the people we were intending to interview all suffer endless harassment and surveillance - and have done ever since 1989 .
As we slipped our " tail " and organised a rendez - vous in safe and discreet locations , we became ever more aware of the mammoth security system which can be brought to bear on those whom the state designates " trouble - makers " .
Security cameras Tourists probably do n't notice that Beijing boasts 280,000 security cameras ; it is rumoured that the muscular lads who offer to be guides in Tiananmen Square , sell you postcards and ice - cream , are all members of the secret police .
Zhang Xianling founded Tiananmen Mothers after losing her son
The people we spoke to frequently find police outside their flat , cameras trained on their front door and their phones tapped .
It is no wonder that they used their mobiles ( several ! ) to arrange to meet us .
What is surprising - and impressive - is their determination to talk about what happened , bear witness to the massacre and explain why they continue to demand that the authorities admit what they did to their own people .
They talk of being spirited from their homes every time there is a " sensitive time " - such as Party congresses or the Olympics , and being taken hundreds of miles away so that journalists cannot find them .
Many have been imprisoned for speaking out , yet they will not give up and their determination is breath - taking .
There 's Mrs Zhang , founder of the Tiananmen Mothers , a group which supports those who lost their sons and daughters , killed by an army which was firing relentlessly all the way into the city .
Her son was shot - he had no idea what was happening when he went out " just to take some photographs " .
She speaks with great dignity , one of the few voices among 1.3 billion who want the truth acknowledged - and who speak of their hopes for justice and more freedom .

WASHINGTON -- Signs of growth in North Korea 's nuclear program and the country 's increasing isolation are renewing fears about Pyongyang 's ability and need to smuggle weapons of mass destruction around the world , said U.S. and United Nations officials .
North Korea 's arms trade has focused on Iran and Syria , countries Washington views as state sponsors of terrorism , as well as Libya .
Officials say North Korean arms have also been sold to nations allied with the U.S. , such as Egypt and Pakistan , and to the military regime in ...

A young hairdresser in Kaluga , Central Russia , locked a robber who tried to steal her money in the basement of the beauty salon .
After that , she has brutally raped her hostage for three days .
A court in Kaluga has filed criminal charges against both of them , the Russian website Newsru.com reports .
The robber , who has not been named , burst into the salon armed with shotgun at about 17.00 on March 14 .
He demanded money .
There were two hairdressers and one client in the salon at the time .
One of hairdressers , who was studying judo and taekwondo , disabled the robber with a smashing body blow .
Then she carried the unlucky robber to the basement and bound him with a hairdryer cord .
The hairdresser told her scared colleague and the client that she would call the police .
But she did not .
After work , instead of calling the police , she made her hostage undress .
The perverted hairdresser forced the hostage to take several Viagra tablets .
She chained the unfortunate robber with pink furry wristbands and painfully raped him for the next three days .
After his release , the exhausted robber filed charges against the perverted woman .
The frenulum of his penis was torn as a consequence of rape session .
“ That ’s ridiculous .
We had sex just a couple times .
I brought him brand new jeans .
I fed him every day and gave him one thousand rubles ( $ 25 ) before his release , ” the hairdresser said .
In response , she filed charges against the robber .
The robber admitted that the hairdresser really did feed him royally .
“ I actually do n’t know what will happen to them .
But it ’s a pity that they could not meet in the cell .
They would be a great couple , ” one of the police officers said .

Colin Powell was on Face the Nation this morning , and he used his appearance to fire back at both Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney ’s claims that he is not a Republican anymore .
Powell said that Cheney had been misinformed , and Limbaugh is an entertainer who is entitled to his own opinion .
Powell said , “ Rush will not get his wish , and Mr. Cheney was misinformed .
I am still a Republican and I would like to point out that in the course of my 50 years of voting for presidents I have voted for the person who I thought was best qualified at that time to lead the nation .
Last year , I thought it was president , now Barack Obama .
In the previous 20 years , I voted solidly for Republican candidates .
I voted for Ronald Reagan twice , George Bush 41 twice , George Bush 43 twice .
I spent eight years in Bush administrations .
I served Ronald Reagan for two years .
I spoke at the 1996 convention and I spoke at the 2000 convention . ”
He continued , “ I have always felt that the Republican Party should be more inclusive than it generally has been over the years , and I believe we need a strong Republican Party that is not just anchored in the base , but has built on the base to include more individuals , and if we do n’t do that , if we do n’t reach out more , the party is going to be sitting on a very narrow base . ”

Powell said that Cheney was misled about him leaving the party , “ He was misled if he thought if I left the party .
You know neither he nor Rush Limbaugh are members of the membership committee of the Republican Party .
I get to make my decision on that .
I will continue to work in a way that I think is helpful to the country and the party . ”
Powell noted that he has voted for Democrats John F. Kennedy , Lyndon B. Johnson , and Jimmy Carter in the past .
He said that he votes for the best person for the job in each election .
Powell said that Limbaugh is an entertainer , but he also has power within the GOP , “ Mr. Limbaugh is entitled to his opinion , and I do n’t say he should n’t have an opinion … but he should n’t have a veto over what someone thinks .
He is an entertainer .
He is a radio figure , and he is a significant one , but he is more than that when the chairman of the RNC Michael Steele issues the mildest of criticisms concerning Mr. Limbaugh , and then 24 hours later the chairman of the RNC has to lay prostrate on the floor apologizing for it , and when two congressman offer the mildest criticism of Mr. Limbaugh , they too within 24 hours have such pressure brought to bear on them that they have to change their view and apologize for criticizing him .
If he is out there he should be subject to criticism just like I am subject to criticism . ”
The former Secretary of State questioned Rush Limbaugh ’s racial reasoning for his support of Obama .
He said that race does n’t explain all 69 million votes in the 2008 election for Obama .
He also mentioned that the Republican Party is declining in support among all major demographics , and has lost states like Virginia , Nevada , and North Carolina .
He also cited the 200,000 Republicans that have switched to the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania as evidence that the GOP has to broaden its base .
I think those who only see this as an argument between Colin Powell , Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh are missing the point .
This is a dispute over the future direction of the Republican Party .
Powell has become the leading voice for making the GOP more inclusive .
Cheney and Limbaugh represent the notion that the GOP needs to stay as it is , or move to the right .
Powell made it clear that he is n’t afraid of Limbaugh or Cheney .
He said that there are many other moderate Republicans out there but they are afraid to speak out against Limbaugh because when they do , their inboxes and voicemails fill up .
In the short term , I think Cheney and Limbaugh win this fight , but after the GOP gets crushed again in 2010 and 2012 , eventually Republicans will see the light and move towards Powell ’s view .
The more that I watch this squabble unfold , the more I believe that Colin Powell is the only moderate with the stature and position in the GOP to take on Rush Limbaugh .
He has nothing to lose by challenging Limbaugh .
Since he is n’t an elected official , and has no desire to seek office , what can Rush do to him ?
Limbaugh ’s power is over those who depend on public opinion to keep their jobs .
This does n’t apply to Gen .
Powell , who despite serving in the Bush administration is still a respected global figure .
It is my hunch that Cheney and Rush are destined to lose this fight with Powell .
I am really encouraged by President Obama ’s commitment to clean energy and combating climate change .
I just have three worries : whether he has the right policies , the right politics and the right official to sell his program to the country .
Other than that , things look great !
Last week , House Democrats , with administration support , introduced a 600 - page draft bill on energy and climate .
At the center of it is a plan to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions through a complicated cap - and - trade system .
These people have the very best of intentions , but I wish they would step back and ask again : Can cap - and - trade pass ?
Will it really work ?
And is it the best strategy , with all the bureaucracy it will require to monitor , auction emissions permits and manage the trading ?
Advocates of cap - and - trade argue that it is preferable to a simple carbon tax because it fixes a national cap on carbon emissions and it “ hides the ball ”  it does n’t use the word “ tax ”  even though it amounts to one .
So it can get through Congress .
That was true as long as no one thought cap - and - trade could ever pass , but now that it might under Mr. Obama , opponents are not playing hide the ball anymore .
In the past two weeks , you could hear a chorus of Republicans , coal - state Democrats , right - wing think tanks and enviro - skeptics all singing the same tune : “ Cap - and - trade is a tax .
Obama is going to raise your taxes and sacrifice U.S. jobs to combat this global - warming charade , which many scientists think is nonsense .
Worse , cap - and - trade will be managed by Wall Street .
If you liked credit - default swaps , you ’re going to love carbon - offset swaps . ”
It was good to see all of you .
Thanks to all who showed up .
We had a large turnout and some good discussions , although as usual chaos seemed to be a major player as we tried to stay coordinated .
The meeting had four discernible parts :
I. Food and gabbing at Ninfa ’s Express ( the non-express part , where you sit down )
II . 2600 continuation at Border’s
III .
Cigarette break behind Border’s
IV .
HAQR meeting among the nu-metal ( 40 % off !!1! )
We also got our hands on some tshirt designs .
First , altalp ’s submission :
And , based on that , a new submission of some ideas we kicked around at dinner :
And then T -900 helped me come up with another design :
LordPhatal submitted another based on the above :
And a late mod on that one , excuse the bad photoshop skills :
See if that kickstarts any imaginations out there .
If you have any great ideas , create a mockup using the tshirt form and email the list maintainer .
Lines have been drawn between Taser supporters on one side and Taser detractors on the other at the Braidwood Inquiry into the death of Robert Dziekanski .
At the centre of the debate are the experts .
Dr. Zian Tseng , a leading cardiac specialist , told the inquiry he believed the Taser was a direct factor in Dziekanski's death at Vancouver International Airport in 2007 .
" In my opinion -- in that scenario -- he would n't have died in a sudden death , if the Taser was not introduced in this situation , " Tseng said .
This is testimony the lawyer for Taser International did n't want the Braidwood Inquiry to hear , saying " the evidence has no value . "
On Thursday , in a surprise motion , David Neave asked that the reports by Tseng and several other doctors who were critical of Tasers be blocked , even though the non-critical reports by scientists employed by the manufacturer had already been heard .
" This is devolving into ... has become , a battle of experts , " he told Judge Thomas Braidwood .
Braidwood later decided the testimony of Tseng and the other medical experts would be allowed .
Taser international 's lawyer was n't the only one critical of Tseng .
Counsel for the Government of Canada -- Helen Roberts -- questioned the specialist about every other possible contributing factor of Dziekanski's death .
Tseng agreed that tobacco could have had a negative impact on Dziekanski's body .
Roberts also asked about Dziekanski's lack of food and sleep , his agitation and his fear of flying , but nothing about the Taser 's role .
Earlier in the inquest , she tried blocking RCMP officers , like Superintendent Wayne Rideout , from appearing at the inquiry .
This upsets former B.C. Attorney - General Ujjal Dosanjh .
He gave political permission to introduce Tasers a decade ago .
Dosanjh now believes he was n't told the truth about the safety of the weapons .
He says the federal government and the RCMP are not serving the public interest .
" By impeding certain witnesses or trying to prevent certain witnesses from coming before the inquiry is preventing the commissioner from coming to a conclusion based on all of the evidence -- that is insulting to Canadians , " he said .
Dosanjh believes the most prudent thing Canada could do is take Tasers away from the police until Judge Braidwood makes his final recommendations .

Glaxo , Novavax , other drug stocks leap due to swine flu
As concern spread Monday about a swine flu virus outbreak , investors saw opportunity in shares of companies that make or hope to make anti-flu drugs .
Britain's GlaxoSmithKline , ( GSK ) which makes antiviral Relenza , saw its U.S. - traded shares rise 7.6 % Monday , while U.S. - traded shares of Swiss drugmaker Roche Holdings , ( ROG ) which makes antiviral Tamiflu , rose 4 % .
The antivirals , which make up the U.S. government 's stock of anti-flu drugs , reduce the severity of flu symptoms and may prevent illness .
They 're seen as the first line of defense in an outbreak .
Longer term , health officials look for new vaccines to ward off outbreaks .
Novavax , a Maryland - based company that in 2005 turned its attention to flu vaccines , saw its shares leap 80 % Monday .
Novavax ( NVAX ) is testing cell - based technologies to enable it to produce a flu vaccine in as little as three months , says equity analyst Elemer Piros at Rodman & Renshaw .
That 's half as long as traditional flu vaccine makers , which use an egg - based process .
Shortening the process is key , because flu can mutate rapidly .
GSK and Roche also say they 're prepared to expand antiviral production .
The swine flu outbreak will reinvigorate stockpiling , says Jason Kantor , biotech analyst for RBC Capital Markets .
He covers Gilead Sciences , which developed Tamiflu and gets royalties from Roche .
The outbreak " raises the awareness that these threats still do exist , " he says .
A government audit has found more than 3,800 vulnerabilities were reportedly found in the Federal Aviation Administration 's ( FAA's ) web - based air traffic control system applications .
763 of the vulnerabilities are high - risk and some could put air travelers at risk .
Congress requested the audit of air traffic control ( ATC ) computer systems in order to ensure air travelers were safe .
( Source : cgisecurity.com )
The FAA has been using commercial software and Internet Protocol - based technologies in order to modernize ATC systems , moving away from the proprietary software the systems were originally developed for .
The report determined that the ATC's web - based applications are n't secured from attacks or unauthorized access and pose a higher risk to the FAA 's ATC system .
763 High - Risk Vulnerabilities Identified
70 web applications were tested .
763 high - risk , 504 medium - risk , and 2,590 low - risk vulnerabilities were identified as a result of the audit .
High - risk vulnerabilities provide an attacker with immediate access to a computer system .
Medium and Low - risk vulnerabilities may provide an attacker with useful information that can be used to compromise a computer system .
Auditors were able to gain unauthorized access to information stored on web application computers and an ATC system , and were able to confirm system vulnerabilities to malicious code attacks .
Exploiting those vulnerabilities could allow someone to gain unauthorized access to information stored on web application computers .
Internal FAA users could gain unauthorized access to ATC systems because the web applications often serve as front - end interfaces to ATC systems .
As a result , FAA user computers could be injected with malicious code .
Current Security Systems Inadequate
The Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure system , the Juneau Aviation Weather System and the Albuquerque Air Traffic Control Tower were all infiltrated and unauthorized access was gained to information stored on web application computers .
Other examples of unauthorized access are in the report ( PDF ) .
Unauthorized access was gained because web applications were not adequately configured to prevent unauthorized access and software with known vulnerabilities was not updated with readily available security patches .
The report makes several recommendations for correcting the vulnerabilities and for implementing an intrusion - detection - system ( IDS ) at various critical network points .
Current intrusion - detection capabilities are not adequate to protect ATC systems .
FAA ATC System Have a History of Vulnerability
More than 800 cyber alerts were issued to the Air Traffic Organization ( ATO ) during Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2008 .
As of the end of FY 2008 , over 150 incidents , including those where hackers may have taken over control of ATO computers , had not been fully addressed .
ATC systems in Alaska had to be shut down by the FAA after a viral attack in 2006 .
In 2008 hackers took control of FAA 's critical network servers and gained the power to shut down the servers .
In February 2009 , an FAA public - facing web application computer was compromised by hackers and used to gain unauthorized access to personally identifiable information on 48,000 current and former FAA employees .
The complete report ( PDF ) is available from The Office of The Inspector General .

( How long can we hang on to a morally bankrupt church ? , 22 May ) was thought - provoking and sensible .
I write as a practising Catholic who feels the church has lost its way .
I am in my mid-40s and becoming a rare breed at mass .
The church is still a patriarchal dinosaur .
There are many good and decent members of the clergy , but there are still too many people who feel they have to defer to and obey the clergy , and many members of the clergy who thrive on this fact .
While this is the case nothing will change .
The horror of the Irish abuse scandal for me is only the tip of the iceberg .
It is time for all Catholics , young and old , to speak out about issues which affect them and the society we live in , such as abuse , contraception , same - sex relationships , stem cell research etc .
Talking about things without fear of hell and damnation and the wrath of the clergy will hopefully stimulate healthy debate and positive moves forward .
If not , I 'm fearful the church will wither - which would be a shame , because in many parishes there is great work going on to help the poor and the oppressed .
And is n't that what being a Christian is all about ?
Clare McCarthy
Formby , Lancashire
Like Madeleine Bunting , I am clinging on with my fingernails .
One reason I remain is because I made a promise when my children were baptised that I would raise them as Catholics , and I want to fulfil that promise .
We attend mass every Sunday and belong to a vibrant community whose members come from many different countries .
We have a good parish priest who leads our community with gentleness and humility .
Another reason I still belong is because I love hearing the language of scripture , the music and singing at mass and I enjoy meeting and talking with my friends afterwards .
They are my community .
We rarely talk about the pope , the Vatican or even our local bishop .
That 's probably why I still remain - because belonging to the church is n't just about clergy in faraway places .
It 's about those who share our faith and our lives .

It must be tough to be Catholic at the moment , but I have a solution .
If you must believe in an imaginary friend ( or god , if you prefer ) , why not opt to worship him / her / it from the comfort of your own home in the manner of your choosing .
Or do you require all that rigmarole and ceremony to give your faith meaning ?
Do the religious believe in god , or do they " believe " in the ritual , togetherness and sense of community .
If it 's the latter , perhaps they could join a choir , football club or gardening group and avoid all the pain , hatred and intolerance religions routinely inflict on others .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government on Friday said it would drop charges in an espionage case against two pro-Israel lobbyists because it was unlikely to win at trial and classified information would have to be disclosed .
Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , former American Israel Public Affairs Committee officials , were accused of conspiring with a former Pentagon analyst to provide defence information to foreign government officials , policy analysts and the media .
“ Given the diminished likelihood the government will prevail at trial under the additional intent requirements imposed by the court and the inevitable disclosure of classified information that would occur at any trial in this matter , we have asked the court to dismiss the indictment , ” Dana Boente , acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , said in a statement .
Last week , Representative Jane Harman asked the Justice Department to release secretly taped telephone calls to show she did not intervene in the case .
The New York Times had reported that Harman was overheard on calls intercepted by the National Security Agency in 2005 in which she appeared to agree to seek lenient treatment for the lobbyists .
A former Pentagon analyst , Lawrence Franklin , pleaded guilty to disclosing information to Rosen and Weissman from early 2002 through June 2004 .
The defence for the lobbyists had argued that U.S. government officials regularly conveyed sensitive , non-public information to the defendants and others at AIPAC , with the expectation it would be disclosed to foreign government officials and the news media .

The Java heap , where every Java object is allocated , is the area of memory you 're most intimately connected with when writing Java applications .
The JVM was designed to insulate us from the host machine 's peculiarities , so it 's natural to think about the heap when you think about memory .
You 've no doubt encountered a Java heap OutOfMemoryError — caused by an object leak or by not making the heap big enough to store all your data — and have probably learned a few tricks to debug these scenarios .
But as your Java applications handle more data and more concurrent load , you may start to experience OutOfMemory Error s that can't be fixed using your normal bag of tricks — scenarios in which the errors are thrown even though the Java heap is n't full .
When this happens , you need to understand what is going on inside your Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) .
Java applications run in the virtualized environment of the Java runtime , but the runtime itself is a native program written in a language ( such as C ) that consumes native resources , including native memory .
Native memory is the memory available to the runtime process , as distinguished from the Java heap memory that a Java application uses .
Every virtualized resource — including the Java heap and Java threads — must be stored in native memory , along with the data used by the virtual machine as it runs .
This means that the limitations on native memory imposed by the host machine 's hardware and operating system ( OS ) affect what you can do with your Java application .
This article is one of two covering the same topic on different platforms .
In both , you 'll learn what native memory is , how the Java runtime uses it , what running out of it looks like , and how to debug a native OutOfMemoryError .
This article covers Windows and Linux and does not focus on any particular runtime implementation .
The companion article covers AIX and focuses on the IBM ® Developer Kit for Java .
( The information in that article about the IBM implementation is also true for platforms other than AIX , so if you use the IBM Developer Kit for Java on Linux or the IBM 32 - bit Runtime Environment for Windows , you might find that article useful too . )
A recap of native memory
I 'll start by explaining the limitations on native memory imposed by the OS and the underlying hardware .
If you 're familiar with managing dynamic memory in a language such as C , then you may want to skip to the next section .
Hardware limitations
Many of the restrictions that a native process experiences are imposed by the hardware , not the OS .
Every computer has a processor and some random - access memory ( RAM ) , also known as physical memory .
A processor interprets a stream of data as instructions to execute ; it has one or more processing units that perform integer and floating - point arithmetic as well as more advanced computations .
A processor has a number of registers — very fast memory elements that are used as working storage for the calculations that are performed ; the register size determines the largest number that a single calculation can use .
The processor is connected to physical memory by the memory bus .
The size of the physical address ( the address used by the processor to index physical RAM ) limits the amount of memory that can be addressed .
For example , a 16 - bit physical address can address from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF , which gives 2^16 = 65536 unique memory locations .
If each address references a byte of storage , a 16 - bit physical address would allow a processor to address 64 KB of memory .
Processors are described as being a certain number of bits .
This normally refers to the size of the registers , although there are exceptions — such as 390 31 - bit — where it refers to the physical address size .
For desktop and server platforms , this number is 31 , 32 , or 64 ; for embedded devices and microprocessors , it can be as low as 4 .
The physical address size can be the same as the register width but could be larger or smaller .
Most 64 - bit processors can run 32 - bit programs when running a suitable OS .
Table 1 lists some popular Linux and Windows architectures with their register and physical address sizes :
Table 1 . Register and physical address size of some popular processor architectures

Operating systems and virtual memory
If you were writing applications to run directly on the processor without an OS , you could use all memory that the processor can address ( assuming enough physical RAM is connected ) .
But to enjoy features such as multitasking and hardware abstraction , nearly everybody uses an OS of some kind to run their programs .
In multitasking OSs such as Windows and Linux , more than one program uses system resources , including memory .
Each program needs to be allocated regions of the physical memory to work in .
It 's possible to design an OS such that every program works directly with physical memory and is trusted to use only the memory it has been given .
Some embedded OSs work like this , but it's not practical in an environment consisting of many programs that are not tested together because any program could corrupt the memory of other programs or the OS itself .
Virtual memory allows multiple processes to share physical memory without being able to corrupt one another 's data .
In an OS with virtual memory ( such as Windows , Linux , and many others ) , each program has its own virtual address space — a logical region of addresses whose size is dictated by the address size on that system ( so 31 , 32 , or 64 bits for desktop and server platforms ) .
Regions in a process 's virtual address space can be mapped to physical memory , to a file , or to any other addressable storage .
The OS can move data held in physical memory to and from a swap area ( the page file on Windows or a swap partition on Linux ) when it is n't being used , to make the best use of physical memory .
When a program tries to access memory using a virtual address , the OS in combination with on - chip hardware maps that virtual address to the physical location .
That location could be physical RAM , a file , or the page file / swap partition .
If a region of memory has been moved to swap space , then it is loaded back into physical memory before being used .
Figure 1 shows how virtual memory works by mapping regions of process address space to shared resources :
Figure 1 . Virtual memory mapping process address spaces to physical resources
Each instance of a program runs as a process .
A process on Linux and Windows is a collection of information about OS - controlled resources ( such as file and socket information ) , typically one virtual address space ( more than one on some architectures ) , and at least one thread of execution .
The virtual address space size can be smaller than the processor 's physical address size .
Intel x86 32 - bit originally had a 32 - bit physical address that allowed the processor to address 4GB of storage .
Later , a feature called Physical Address Extension ( PAE ) was added that expanded the physical address size to 36 - bit — allowing up to 64GB of RAM to be installed and addressed .
PAE allowed OSs to map 32 - bit 4GB virtual address spaces onto a large physical address range , but it did not allow each process to have a 64GB virtual address space .
This means that if you put more than 4GB of memory into a 32 - bit Intel server , you can't map all of it directly into a single process .
The Address Windowing Extensions feature allows a Windows process to map a portion of its 32 - bit address space as a sliding window into a larger area of memory .
Linux uses similar technologies based on mapping regions into the virtual address space .
This means that although you can't directly reference more than 4GB of memory , you can work with larger regions of memory .
Kernel space and user space
Although each process has its own address space , a program typically can't use all of it .
The address space is divided into user space and kernel space .
The kernel is the main OS program and contains the logic for interfacing to the computer hardware , scheduling programs , and providing services such as networking and virtual memory .
As part of the computer boot sequence , the OS kernel runs and initialises the hardware .
Once the kernel has configured the hardware and its own internal state , the first user - space process starts .
If a user program needs a service from the OS , it can perform an operation — called a system call — that jumps into the kernel program , which then performs the request .
System calls are generally required for operations such as reading and writing files , networking , and starting new processes .
The kernel requires access to its own memory and the memory of the calling process when executing a system call .
Because the processor that is executing the current thread is configured to map virtual addresses using the address - space mapping for the current process , most OSs map a portion of each process address space to a common kernel memory region .
The portion of the address space mapped for use by the kernel is called kernel space ; the remainder , which can be used by the user application , is called user space .
The balance between kernel and user space varies by OS and even among instances of the same OS running on different hardware architectures .
The balance is often configurable and can be adjusted to give more space to user applications or the kernel .
Squeezing the kernel area can cause problems such as restricting the number of users that can be logged on simultaneously or the number of processes that can run ; smaller user space means that the application programmer has less room to work in .
By default , 32 - bit Windows has a 2GB user space and a 2GB kernel space .
The balance can be shifted to a 3GB user space and a 1GB kernel space on some versions of Windows by adding the /3GB switch to the boot configuration and relinking applications with the / LARGEADDRESSAWARE switch .
On 32 - bit Linux , the default is a 3GB user space and 1GB kernel space .
Some Linux distributions provide a hugemem kernel that supports a 4GB user space .
To achieve this , the kernel is given an address space of its own that is used when a system call is made .
The gains in user space are offset by slower system calls because the OS must copy data between address spaces and reset the process address - space mappings each time a system call is made .
Figure 2 shows the address - space layout for 32 - bit Windows :
Figure 2 . Address - space layout for 32 - bit Windows
Figure 3 shows the address - space arrangements for 32 - bit Linux :
Figure 3 . Address - space layout for 32 - bit Linux
A separate kernel address space is also used on Linux 390 31 - bit , where the smaller 2GB address space makes dividing a single address space undesirable ; however , the 390 architecture can work with multiple address spaces simultaneously without compromising performance .
The process address space must contain everything a program requires — including the program itself and the shared libraries ( DLLs on Windows , . so files on Linux ) that it uses .
Not only can shared libraries take up space that a program can't use to store data in , they can also fragment the address space and reduce the amount of memory that can be allocated as a continuous chunk .
This is noticeable in programs running on Windows x86 with a 3GB user space .
DLLs are built with a preferred loading address : when a DLL is loaded , it 's mapped into the address space at a particular location unless that location is already occupied , in which case it 's rebased and loaded elsewhere .
With the 2GB user space available when Windows NT was originally designed , it made sense for the system libraries to be built to load near the 2GB boundary — thereby leaving most of the user region free for the application to use .
When the user region is extended to 3GB , the system shared libraries still load near 2GB — now in the middle of the user space .
Although there 's a total user space of 3GB , it 's impossible to allocate a 3GB block of memory because the shared libraries get in the way .
Using the /3GB switch on Windows reduces the kernel space to half what it was originally designed to be .
In some scenarios it 's possible to exhaust the 1GB kernel space and experience slow I /O or problems creating new user sessions .
Although the /3GB switch can be extremely valuable for some applications , any environment using it should be thoroughly load tested before being deployed .
A native - memory leak or excessive native memory use will cause different problems depending on whether you exhaust the address space or run out of physical memory .
Exhausting the address space normally happens only with 32 - bit processes — because the maximum 4GB is easy to allocate .
A 64 - bit process has a user space of hundreds or thousands of gigabytes , which is hard to fill up even if you try .
If you do exhaust the address space of a Java process , then the Java runtime can start to display strange symptoms that I 'll describe later in the article .
When running on a system with more process address space than physical memory , a memory leak or excessive use of native memory forces the OS to swap out the backing storage for some of the native process 's virtual address space .
Accessing a memory address that has been swapped is much slower than reading a resident ( in physical memory ) address because the OS must pull the data from the hard drive .
It 's possible to allocate enough memory to exhaust all physical memory and all swap memory ( paging space ) ; on Linux , this triggers the kernel out - of - memory ( OOM ) killer , which forcibly kills the most memory - hungry process .
On Windows , allocations start failing in the same way as they would if the address space were full .
If you simultaneously try to use more virtual memory than there is physical memory , it will be obvious there 's a problem long before the process is killed for being a memory hog .
The system will thrash — that is , spend most of its time copying memory back and forth from swap space .
When this happens , the performance of the computer and the individual applications will become so poor that the user can't fail to notice there 's a problem .
When a JVM's Java heap is swapped out , the garbage collector 's performance becomes extremely poor , to the extent that the application can appear to hang .
If multiple Java runtimes are in use on a single machine at the same time , the physical memory must be sufficient to fit all of the Java heaps .
How the Java runtime uses native memory
The Java runtime is an OS process that is subject to the hardware and OS constraints I outlined in the preceding section .
Runtime environments provide capabilities that are driven by some unknown user code ; that makes it impossible to predict which resources the runtime environment will require in every situation .
Every action a Java application takes inside the managed Java environment can potentially affect the resource requirements of the runtime that provides that environment .
This section describes how and why Java applications consume native memory .
The Java heap and garbage collection
The Java heap is the area of memory where objects are allocated .
Most Java SE implementations have one logical heap , although some specialist Java runtimes such as those implementing the Real Time Specification for Java ( RTSJ ) have multiple heaps .
A single physical heap can be split up into logical sections depending on the garbage collection ( GC ) algorithm used to manage the heap memory .
These sections are typically implemented as contiguous slabs of native memory that are under the control of the Java memory manager ( which includes the garbage collector ) .
The heap 's size is controlled from the Java command line using the - Xmx and - Xms options ( mx is the maximum size of the heap , ms is the initial size ) .
Although the logical heap ( the area of memory that is actively used ) can grow and shrink according to the number of objects on the heap and the amount of time spent in GC , the amount of native memory used remains constant and is dictated by the - Xmx value : the maximum heap size .
Most GC algorithms rely on the heap being allocated as a contiguous slab of memory , so it 's impossible to allocate more native memory when the heap needs to expand .
All heap memory must be reserved up front .
Reserving native memory is not the same as allocating it .
When native memory is reserved , it is not backed with physical memory or other storage .
Although reserving chunks of the address space will not exhaust physical resources , it does prevent that memory from being used for other purposes .
A leak caused by reserving memory that is never used is just as serious as leaking allocated memory .
Some garbage collectors minimise the use of physical memory by decommitting ( releasing the backing storage for ) parts of the heap as the used area of heap shrinks .
More native memory is required to maintain the state of the memory - management system maintaining the Java heap .
Data structures must be allocated to track free storage and record progress when collecting garbage .
The exact size and nature of these data structures varies with implementation , but many are proportional to the size of the heap .
The Just - in - time ( JIT ) compiler
The JIT compiler compiles Java bytecode to optimised native executable code at run time .
This vastly improves the run-time speed of Java runtimes and allows Java applications to run at speeds comparable to native code .
Bytecode compilation uses native memory ( in the same way that a static compiler such as gcc requires memory to run ) , but both the input ( the bytecode ) and the output ( the executable code ) from the JIT must also be stored in native memory .
Java applications that contain many JIT - compiled methods use more native memory than smaller applications .
Classes and classloaders
Java applications are composed of classes that define object structure and method logic .
They also use classes from the Java runtime class libraries ( such as java.lang .
String ) and may use third - party libraries .
These classes need to be stored in memory for as long as they are being used .
How classes are stored varies by implementation .
The Sun JDK uses the permanent generation ( PermGen ) heap area .
The IBM implementation from Java 5 onward allocates slabs of native memory for each classloader and stores the class data in there .
Modern Java runtimes have technologies such as class sharing that may require mapping areas of shared memory into the address space .
To understand how these allocation mechanisms affect your Java runtime 's native footprint , you need to read the technical documentation for that implementation .
However , some universal truths affect all implementations .
At the most basic level , using more classes uses more memory .
( This may mean your native memory usage just increases or that you must explicitly resize an area — such as the PermGen or the shared - class cache — to allow all the classes to fit in . )
Remember that it 's not only your application that needs to fit ; frameworks , application servers , third - party libraries , and Java runtimes contain classes that are loaded on demand and occupy space .
Java runtimes can unload classes to reclaim space , but only under strict conditions .
It 's impossible to unload a single class ; classloaders are unloaded instead , taking all the classes they loaded with them .
A classloader can be unloaded only if :
The Java heap contains no references to the java.lang .
ClassLoader object that represents that classloader .
object that represents that classloader .
The Java heap contains no references to any of the java.lang .
Class objects that represent classes loaded by that classloader .
objects that represent classes loaded by that classloader .
No objects of any class loaded by that classloader are alive ( referenced ) on the Java heap .
It 's worth noting that the three default classloaders that the Java runtime creates for all Java applications — bootstrap , extension , and application — can never meet these criteria ; therefore , any system classes ( such as java.lang .
String ) or any application classes loaded through the application classloader can't be released at run time .
Even when a classloader is eligible for collection , the runtime collects classloaders only as part of a GC cycle .
Some implementations unload classloaders only on some GC cycles .
It 's also possible for classes to be generated at run time , without you realising it .
Many JEE applications use JavaServer Pages ( JSP ) technology to produce Web pages .
Using JSP generates a class for each .jsp page executed that will last the lifetime of the classloader that loaded them — typically the lifetime of the Web application .
Another common way to generate classes is by using Java reflection .
The way reflection works varies among Java implementations , but Sun and IBM implementations both use the method I 'll describe now .
When using the java.lang .
reflect API , the Java runtime must connect the methods of a reflecting object ( such as java.lang.reflect .
Field ) to the object or class being reflected on .
This can be done by using a Java Native Interface ( JNI ) accessor that requires very little setup but is slow to use , or by building a class dynamically at run time for each object type you want to reflect on .
The latter method is slower to set up but faster to run , making it ideal for applications that reflect on a particular class often .
The Java runtime uses the JNI method the first few times a class is reflected on , but after being used a number of times , the accessor is inflated into a bytecode accessor , which involves building a class and loading it through a new classloader .
Doing lots of reflection can cause many accessor classes and classloaders to be created .
Holding references to the reflecting objects causes these classes to stay alive and continue occupying space .
Because creating the bytecode accessors is quite slow , the Java runtime can cache these accessors for later use .
Some applications and frameworks also cache reflection objects , thereby increasing their native footprint .
JNI
JNI allows native code ( applications written in native compiled languages such as C and C++ ) to call Java methods and vice versa .
The Java runtime itself relies heavily on JNI code to implement class - library functions such as file and network I/O .
A JNI application can increase a Java runtime 's native footprint in three ways :
The native code for a JNI application is compiled into a shared library or executable that 's loaded into the process address space .
Large native applications can occupy a significant chunk of the process address space simply by being loaded .
The native code must share the address space with the Java runtime .
Any native - memory allocations or memory mappings performed by the native code take memory away from the Java runtime .
Certain JNI functions can use native memory as part of their normal operation .
The GetTypeArrayElements and GetTypeArrayRegion functions can copy Java heap data into native memory buffers for the native code to work with .
Whether a copy is made or not depends on the runtime implementation .
( The IBM Developer Kit for Java 5.0 and higher makes a native copy . )
Accessing large amounts of Java heap data in this manner can use a correspondingly large amount of native heap .
NIO
The new I/O ( NIO ) classes added in Java 1.4 introduced a new way of performing I/O based on channels and buffers .
As well as I/ O buffers backed by memory on the Java heap , NIO added support for direct ByteBuffer s ( allocated using the java.nio. ByteBuffer.allocateDirect( ) method ) that are backed by native memory rather than Java heap .
Direct ByteBuffer s can be passed directly to native OS library functions for performing I/O — making them significantly faster in some scenarios because they can avoid copying data between Java heap and native heap .
It 's easy to become confused about where direct ByteBuffer data is being stored .
The application still uses an object on the Java heap to orchestrate I/O operations , but the buffer that holds the data is held in native memory — the Java heap object only contains a reference to the native heap buffer .
A non-direct ByteBuffer holds its data in a byte [ ] array on the Java heap .
Figure 4 shows the difference between direct and non-direct ByteBuffer objects :
Figure 4 . Memory topology for direct and non-direct java.nio.
ByteBuffer
s
Direct ByteBuffer objects clean up their native buffers automatically but can only do so as part of Java heap GC — so they do not automatically respond to pressure on the native heap .
GC occurs only when the Java heap becomes so full it can't service a heap - allocation request or if the Java application explicitly requests it ( not recommended because it causes performance problems ) .
The pathological case would be that the native heap becomes full and one or more direct ByteBuffers are eligible for GC ( and could be freed to make some space on the native heap ) , but the Java heap is mostly empty so GC does n't occur .
Threads
Every thread in an application requires memory to store its stack ( the area of memory used to hold local variables and maintain state when calling functions ) .
Every Java thread requires stack space to run .
Depending on implementation , a Java thread can have separate native and Java stacks .
In addition to stack space , each thread requires some native memory for thread - local storage and internal data structures .
The stack size varies by Java implementation and by architecture .
Some implementations allow you to specify the stack size for Java threads .
Values between 256KB and 756KB are typical .
Although the amount of memory used per thread is quite small , for an application with several hundred threads , the total memory use for thread stacks can be large .
Running an application with many more threads than available processors to run them is usually inefficient and can result in poor performance as well as increased memory usage .
How can I tell if I 'm running out of native memory ?
A Java runtime copes quite differently with running out of Java heap compared to running out of native heap , although both conditions can present with similar symptoms .
A Java application finds it extremely difficult to function when the Java heap is exhausted — because it 's difficult for a Java application to do anything without allocating objects .
The poor GC performance and OutOfMemoryError s that signify a full Java heap are produced as soon as the Java heap fills up .
In contrast , once a Java runtime has started up and the application is in steady state , it can continue to function with complete native - heap exhaustion .
It does n't necessarily show any odd behaviour , because actions that require a native - memory allocation are much rarer than actions that require Java - heap allocations .
Although actions that require native memory vary by JVM implementation , some popular examples are : starting a thread , loading a class , and performing certain kinds of network and file I/O .
Native out - of - memory behaviour is also less consistent than Java heap out - of - memory behaviour , because there 's no single point of control for native heap allocations .
Whereas all Java heap allocations are under control of the Java memory - management system , any native code — whether it is inside the JVM , the Java class libraries , or application code — can perform a native - memory allocation and have it fail .
The code that attempts the allocation can then handle it however its designer wants : it could throw an OutOfMemory Error through the JNI interface , print a message on the screen , silently fail and try again later , or do something else .
The lack of predictable behaviour means there 's no one simple way to identify native - memory exhaustion .
Instead , you need to use data from the OS and from the Java runtime to confirm the diagnosis .
Examples of running out of native memory
To help you see how native - memory exhaustion affects the Java implementation you 're using , this article 's sample code ( see Download ) contains some Java programs that trigger native - heap exhaustion in different ways .
The examples use a native library written in C to consume all of the native address space and then try to perform some action that uses native memory .
The examples are supplied already built , although instructions on compiling them are provided in the README . html file in the sample package 's top - level directory .
The com.ibm.jtc.demos.NativeMemoryGlutton class provides the gobbleMemory ( ) method , which calls malloc in a loop until nearly all native memory is exhausted .
When it has completed its task , it prints the number of bytes allocated to standard error like this :
Allocated 1953546736 bytes of native memory before running out

Trying to start a thread when out of native memory
The com.ibm.jtc.demos.StartingAThreadUnderNativeStarvation class tries to start a thread when the process address space is exhausted .
This is a common way to discover that your Java process is out of memory because many applications start threads throughout their lifetime .
The output from the StartingAThreadUnderNativeStarvation demo when run on the IBM Java runtime is :

StartingAThreadUnderNativeStarvation.java:22 )
Calling java.lang.Thread.start ( ) tries to allocate memory for a new OS thread .
This attempt fails and causes an OutOfMemory Error to be thrown .
The JVMDUMP lines notify the user that the Java runtime has produced its standard OutOfMemory Error debugging data .
Trying to handle the first OutOfMemoryError caused a second — the : OutOfMemoryError , ENOMEM error in ZipFile.open .
Multiple OutOfMemoryError s are common when the native process memory is exhausted .
The Failed to fork OS thread message is probably the most commonly encountered sign of running out of native memory .
The examples supplied with this article trigger clusters of OutOfMemory Error s that are more severe than anything you are likely to see with your own applications .
This is partly because virtually all of the native memory has been used up and , unlike in a real application , that memory is n't freed later .
In a real application , as OutOfMemory Error s are thrown , threads shut down and the native - memory pressure is likely to be relieved for a bit , giving the runtime a chance to handle the error .
The trivial nature of the test cases also means that whole sections of the class library ( such as the security system ) have not been initialised yet — and their initialisation is driven by the runtime trying to handle the out - of - memory condition .
In a real application , you may see some of the errors shown here , but it 's unlikely you will see them all together .
When the same test case is executed on the Sun Java runtime , the following console output is produced :
Allocated 1953546736 bytes of native memory before running out Exception in thread " main " java.lang.OutOfMemoryError : unable to create new native thread at java.lang .
Thread.start0 ( Native Method ) at java.lang.Thread.start( Thread.java:574 ) at com.ibm.jtc.demos.StartingAThreadUnderNativeStarvation.main(
StartingAThreadUnderNativeStarvation.java:22 )
Although the stack trace and the error message are slightly different , the behaviour is essentially the same : the native allocation fails and a java.lang .
OutOfMemoryError is thrown .
The only thing that distinguishes the OutOfMemory Error s thrown in this scenario from those thrown because of Java - heap exhaustion is the message .
Trying to allocate a direct ByteBuffer when out of native memory
The com.ibm.jtc.demos.DirectByteBufferUnderNativeStarvation class tries to allocate a direct ( that is , natively backed ) java.nio .

The OutOfMemoryError reaches the top of the main thread 's stack and is printed on stderr .
When run on the Sun Java runtime , this test case produces the following console output :

Debugging approaches and techniques
The first thing to do when faced with a java.lang .
OutOfMemoryError or an error message about lack of memory is to determine which kind of memory has been exhausted .
The easiest way to do this is to first check if the Java heap is full .
If the Java heap did not cause the OutOfMemory condition , then you should analyse the native - heap usage .
Checking your vendor 's documentation
The guidelines in this article are general debugging principles applied to understanding native out - of - memory scenarios .
Your runtime vendor may supply its own debugging instructions that it expects you to follow when working with its support teams .
If you are raising a problem ticket with your runtime vendor ( including IBM ) , always check its debugging and diagnostic documentation to see what steps you are expected to take when submitting a problem report .
Checking the Java heap
The method for checking the heap utilisation varies among Java implementations .
On IBM implementations of Java 5 and 6 , the javacore file produced when the OutOfMemoryError is thrown will tell you .
The javacore file is usually produced in the working directory of the Java process and has a name of the form javacore.date.time.pid.txt .
If you open the file in a text editor , you can find a section that looks like this :
0SECTION MEMINFO subcomponent dump routine NULL =================================
1STHEAPFREE Bytes of Heap Space Free : 416760 1STHEAPALLOC
Bytes of Heap Space Allocated : 1344800
This section shows how much Java heap was free when the javacore was produced .
Note that the values are in hexadecimal format .
If the OutOfMemoryError was thrown because an allocation could not be satisfied , then the GC trace section will show this :
1STGCHTYPE GC History 3STHSTTYPE 09:59:01:632262775 GMT j9mm.80 - J9AllocateObject ( ) returning NULL ! 32 bytes requested for object of class 00147F80
J9AllocateObject ( ) returning NULL !
means that the Java heap allocation routine completed unsuccessfully and an OutOfMemory Error will be thrown .
It is also possible for an OutOfMemory Error to be thrown because the garbage collector is running too frequently ( a sign that the heap is full and the Java application will be making little or no progress ) .
In this case , you would expect the Heap Space Free value to be very small , and the GC trace will show one of these messages :
1STGCHTYPE GC History 3STHSTTYPE 09:59:01:632262775 GMT j9mm.83 - Forcing J9AllocateObject ( ) to fail due to excessive GC
1STGCHTYPE GC History 3STHSTTYPE 09:59:01:632262775 GMT j9mm.84 - Forcing J9AllocateIndexableObject ( ) to fail due to excessive GC
When the Sun implementation runs out of Java heap memory , it uses the exception message to show that it is Java heap that is exhausted :
Exception in thread " main " java.lang.OutOfMemoryError : Java heap space
IBM and Sun implementations both have a verbose GC option that produces trace data showing how full the heap is at every GC cycle .
This information can be plotted with a tool such as the IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools for Java - Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer ( GCMV ) to show if the Java heap is growing .
Measuring native heap usage
If you have determined that your out - of - memory condition was not caused by Java - heap exhaustion , the next stage is to profile your native - memory usage .
The PerfMon tool supplied with Windows allows you to monitor and record many OS and process metrics , including native - memory use .
It allows counters to be tracked in real time or stored in a log file to be reviewed offline .
Use the Private Bytes counter to show the total address - space usage .
If this approaches the limit of the user space ( between 2 and 3GB as previously discussed ) , you should expect to see native out - of - memory conditions .
Linux has no PerfMon equivalent , but you have several alternatives .
Command - line tools such as ps , top , and pmap can show an application 's native - memory footprint .
Although getting an instant snapshot of a process 's memory usage is useful , you get a much greater understanding of how native memory is being used by plotting memory use over time .
One way to do this is to use GCMV .
GCMV was originally written to plot verbose GC logs , allowing users to view changes in Java heap usage and GC performance when tuning the garbage collector .
GCMV was later extended to allow it to plot other data sources , including Linux and AIX native - memory data .
GCMV is shipped as a plug - in for the IBM Support Assistant ( ISA ) .
To plot a Linux native - memory profile with GCMV , you must first collect native - memory data using a script .
GCMV's Linux native - memory parser reads output from the Linux ps command interleaved with time stamps .
A script is provided in the GCMV help documentation that collects data in the correct form .
To find the script :
Download and install ISA Version 4 ( or above ) and install the GCMV tool plug - in .
Start ISA .
Click Help >>
Help Contents from the menu bar to open the ISA help menu .
Find the Linux native - memory instructions in the left - hand pane under Tool : IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools for Java - Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer >>
Using the Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer >>
Supported Data Types >>
Native memory >>
Linux native memory .
Figure 5 shows the location of the script in the ISA help file .
If you do not have the GCMV Tool entry in your help file , it is most likely you do not have the GCMV plug - in installed .
Figure 5 . Location of Linux native memory data capture script in ISA help dialog
The script provided in the GCMV help uses a ps command that only works with recent versions of ps .
On some older Linux distributions , the command in the help file will not produce the correct information .
To check the behaviour on your Linux distribution , try running ps -o pid, vsz=VSZ , rss=RSS .
If your version of ps supports the new command - line argument syntax , the output will look like this :
PID VSZ RSS 5826 3772 1960 5675 2492 760
If your version of ps does not support the new syntax , the output will look like this :
PID VSZ , rss=RSS 5826 3772 5674 2488
If you are running an older version of ps , modify the native memory script replacing the line
ps -p $ PID -o pid, vsz=VSZ , rss=RSS
with
ps -p $ PID -o pid, vsz,rss
Copy the script from the help panel into a file ( in this example called memscript.sh ) , find the process id ( PID ) of the Java process you want to monitor ( in this example , 1234 ) , and run :
./memscript.sh 1234 > ps.out
This will write the native - memory log into ps.out .
To plot memory usage :
In ISA , select Analyze Problem from the Launch Activity drop - down menu .
Select the Tools tab near the top of the Analyze Problem panel .
Select IBM Monitoring and Diagnostic Tools for Java - Garbage Collection and Memory Visualizer .
Click the Launch button near the bottom of the tools panel .
Click the Browse button and locate the log file .
Click OK to launch GCMV .
Once you have the profile of the native - memory use over time , you need to decide whether you are seeing a native - memory leak or are just trying to do too much in the available space .
The native - memory footprint for even a well - behaved Java application is not constant from start - up .
Several of the Java runtime systems — particularly the JIT compiler and classloaders — initialise over time , which can consume native memory .
The memory growth from initialisation will plateau , but if your scenario has an initial native - memory footprint close to the limit of the address space , then this warm - up phase can be enough to cause native out - of - memory .
Figure 6 shows an example GCMV native - memory plot from a Java stress test with the warm - up phase highlighted .
Figure 6 . Example Linux native - memory plot from GCMV showing warm - up phase
It 's also possible to have a native footprint that varies with workload .
If your application creates more threads to handle incoming workload or allocates native - backed storage such as direct ByteBuffer s proportionally to how much load is being applied to your system , it 's possible that you will run out of native memory under high load .
Running out of native memory because of JVM warm - up - phase native - memory growth , and growth proportional to load , are examples of trying to do too much in the available space .
In these scenarios your options are :
Reduce your native - memory use .
Reducing your Java heap size is a good place to start .
Reducing your Java heap size is a good place to start .
Restrict your native - memory use .
If you have native - memory growth that changes with load , find a way to cap the load or the resources that are allocated because of it .
If you have native - memory growth that changes with load , find a way to cap the load or the resources that are allocated because of it .
Increase the amount of address space available to you .
You can do this by tuning your OS ( increasing your user space with the / 3GB switch on Windows or a hugemem kernel on Linux , for example ) , changing platform ( Linux typically has more user space than Windows ) , or moving to a 64 - bit OS .
A genuine native - memory leak manifests as a continual growth in native heap that does n't drop when load is removed or when the garbage collector runs .
The rate of memory leak can vary with load , but the total leaked memory will not drop .
Memory that is leaked is unlikely to be referenced , so it can be swapped out and stay swapped out .
When faced with a leak , your options are limited .
You can increase the amount of user space ( so there is more room to leak into ) but that will only buy you time before you eventually run out of memory .
If you have enough physical memory and address space , you can allow the leak to continue on the basis that you will restart your application before the process address space is exhausted .
What 's using my native memory ?
Once you have determined you are running out of native memory , the next logical question is :
What 's using that memory ?
Answering this question is hard because , by default , Windows and Linux do not store information about which code path is allocated a particular chunk of memory .
Your first step when trying to understand where your native memory has gone is to work out roughly how much native memory will be used based on your Java settings .
An accurate value is difficult to work out without in - depth knowledge of the JVM 's workings , but you can make a rough estimate based on the following guidelines :
The Java heap occupies at least the - Xmx value .
value .
Each Java thread requires stack space .
Stack size varies among implementations , but with default settings , each thread could occupy up to 756KB of native memory .
Direct ByteBuffer s occupy at least the values supplied to the allocate ( ) routine .
If your total is much less than your maximum user space , you are not necessarily safe .
Many other components in a Java runtime could allocate enough memory to cause problems ; however , if your initial calculations suggest you are close to your maximum user space , it is likely that you will have native - memory issues .
If you suspect you have a native - memory leak or you want to understand exactly where your memory is going , several tools can help .
Microsoft provides the UMDH ( user - mode dump heap ) and LeakDiag tools for debugging native - memory growth on Windows .
They both work in a similar way : recording which code path allocated a particular area of memory and providing a way to locate sections of code that allocate memory that is n't freed later .
I refer you to the article " Umdhtools.exe : How to use Umdh.exe to find memory leaks on Windows " for instructions on using UMDH .
In this article , I 'll focus on what the output of UMDH looks like when run against a leaky JNI application .
The samples pack for this article contains a Java application called LeakyJNIApp ; it runs in a loop calling a JNI method that leaks native memory .
The UMDH command takes a snapshot of the current native heap together with native stack traces of the code paths that allocated each region of memory .
By taking two snapshots and using the UMDH tool to analyse the difference , you get a report of the heap growth between the two snapshots .
For LeakyJNIApp , the difference file contains this information :
// _NT_SYMBOL_PATH
set by default to C: \WINDOWS \symbols // //
Each log entry has the following syntax : // // + BYTES_DELTA ( NEW_BYTES - OLD_BYTES ) NEW_COUNT allocs BackTrace TRACEID // + COUNT_DELTA ( NEW_COUNT - OLD_COUNT ) BackTrace TRACEID allocations // ... stack trace ... // // where : // // BYTES_DELTA - increase in bytes between before and after log // NEW_BYTES - bytes in after log // OLD_BYTES - bytes in before log // COUNT_DELTA - increase in allocations between before and after log // NEW_COUNT - number of allocations in after log // OLD_COUNT - number of allocations in before log // TRACEID - decimal index of the stack trace in the trace database // ( can be used to search for allocation instances in the original // UMDH logs ) .
// + 412192 ( 1031943 - 619751 ) 963 allocs BackTrace00468
Total increase == 412192
The important line is + 412192 ( 1031943 - 619751 ) 963 allocs BackTrace00468 .
It shows that one backtrace has made 963 allocations that have not been freed — that have consumed 412192 bytes of memory .
By looking in one of the snapshot files , you can associate BackTrace00468 with the meaningful code path .
Searching for BackTrace00468 in the first snapshot shows :
000000 AD bytes in 0x1 allocations ( @ 0x00000031 + 0x0000001F ) by : BackTrace00468 ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey+000074D0 ntdll!RtlInitializeSListHead+00010D08 ntdll!wcsncat+00000224 leakyjniapp!Java_com_ibm_jtc_demos_LeakyJNIApp_nativeMethod+000000D6
This shows the leak coming from the leakyjniapp.dll module in the Java_com_ibm_jtc_demos_LeakyJNIApp_nativeMethod function .
At the time of writing , Linux does not have a UMDH or LeakDiag equivalent .
But there are still ways to debug native - memory leaks on Linux .
The many memory debuggers available on Linux typically fall into one of the following categories :
Preprocessor level .
These require a header to be compiled in with the source under test .
It 's possible to recompile your own JNI libraries with one of these tools to track a native memory leak in your code .
Unless you have the source code for the Java runtime itself , this cannot find a leak in the JVM ( and even then compiling this kind of tool into a large project like a JVM would almost certainly be difficult and time - consuming ) .
Dmalloc is an example of this kind of tool .
These require a header to be compiled in with the source under test .

Dmalloc is an example of this kind of tool .
Linker level .
These require the binaries under test to be relinked with a debugging library .
Again , this is feasible for individual JNI libraries but not recommended for entire Java runtimes because it is unlikely that the runtime vendor would support you running with modified binaries .
Ccmalloc is an example of this kind of tool .

Ccmalloc is an example of this kind of tool .
Runtime - linker level .
These use the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to preload a library that replaces the standard memory routines with instrumented versions .
They do not require recompilation or relinking of source code , but many of them do not work well with Java runtimes .
A Java runtime is a complicated system that can use memory and threads in unusual ways that can confuse or break this kind of tool .
It is worth experimenting with a few to see if they work in your scenario .
NJAMD is an example of this kind of tool .

Emulator - based .
The Valgrind memcheck tool is the only example of this type of memory debugger .
It emulates the underlying processor in a similar way to how a Java runtime emulates the JVM .
It is possible to run Java under Valgrind , but the heavy performance impact ( 10 to 30 times slower ) means that it would be very hard to run large , complicated Java applications in this manner .
Valgrind is currently available on Linux x86 , AMD64 , PPC 32 , and PPC 64 .
If you use Valgrind , try to narrow down the problem to the smallest test case you can ( preferably cutting out the entire Java runtime if possible ) before using it .
For simple scenarios that can tolerate the performance overhead , Valgrind memcheck is the most simple and user - friendly of the available free tools .
It can provide a full stack trace for code paths that are leaking memory in the same way that UMDH can on Windows .
The LeakyJNIApp is simple enough to run under Valgrind .
The Valgrind memcheck tool can print out a summary of leaked memory when the emulated program ends .
By default , the LeakyJNIApp program runs indefinitely ; to make it shut down after a fixed time period , pass the run time in seconds as the only command - line argument .
Some Java runtimes use thread stacks and processor registers in unusual ways ; this can confuse some debugging tools , which expect native programs to abide by standard conventions of register use and stack structure .
When using Valgrind to debug leaking JNI applications , you may find that many warnings are thrown up about the use of memory , and some thread stacks will look odd ; these are due to the way the Java runtime structures its data internally and are nothing to worry about .
To trace the LeakyJNIApp with the Valgrind memcheck tool , use this command ( on a single line ) :
valgrind -- trace- children=yes --leak-check=full java - Djava.library.path=.
com.ibm.jtc.demos.LeakyJNIApp
10
The -- trace - children=yes option to Valgrind makes it trace any processes that are started by Java launcher .
Some versions of the Java launcher reexecute themselves ( they restart themselves from the beginning , again having set environment variables to change behaviour ) .
If you do n't specify -- trace - children , you might not trace the actual Java runtime .
The -- leak - check=full option requests that full stack traces of leaking areas of code are printed at the end of the run , rather than just summarising the state of the memory .
Valgrind prints many warnings and errors while the command runs ( most of which are uninteresting in this context ) , and finally prints a list of leaking call stacks in ascending order of amount of memory leaked .
The end of the summary section of the Valgrind output for LeakyJNIApp on Linux x86 is :

The second line of the stacks shows that the memory was leaked by the com.ibm.jtc.demos.LeakyJNIApp.nativeMethod( ) method .
Several proprietary debugging applications that can debug native - memory leaks are also available .
More tools ( both open - source and proprietary ) are being developed all the time , and it's worth researching the current state of the art .
Currently debugging native - memory leaks on Linux with the freely available tools is more challenging than doing the same on Windows .
Whereas UMDH allows native leaks on Windows to be debugged in situ , on Linux you will probably need to do some traditional debugging rather than rely on a tool to solve the problem for you .
Here are some suggested debugging steps :
Extract a test case .
Produce a stand - alone environment that you can reproduce the native leak with .
It will make debugging much simpler .

Narrow the test case as far as possible .
Try stubbing out functions to identify which code paths are causing the native leak .
If you have your own JNI libraries , try stubbing them out entirely one at a time to determine if they are causing the leak .

Reduce the Java heap size .
The Java heap is likely to be the largest consumer of virtual address space in the process .
By reducing the Java heap , you make more space available for other users of native memory .

By reducing the Java heap , you make more space available for other users of native memory .
Correlate the native process size .
Once you have a plot of native - memory use over time , you can compare it to application workload and GC data .
If the leak rate is proportional to the level of load , it suggests that the leak is caused by something on the path of each transaction or operation .
If the native process size drops significantly when a GC happens , it suggests that you are not seeing a leak — you are seeing a buildup of objects with a native backing ( such as direct ByteBuffer s ) .
You can reduce the amount of memory held by native - backed objects by reducing the Java heap size ( thereby forcing collections to occur more frequently ) or by managing them yourself in an object cache rather than relying on the garbage collector to clean up for you .
If you identify a leak or memory growth that you think is coming out of the Java runtime itself , you may want to engage your runtime vendor to debug further .
Removing the limit : Making the change to 64 - bit
It is easy to hit native out - of - memory conditions with 32 - bit Java runtimes because the address space is relatively small .
The 2 to 4GB of user space that 32 - bit OSs provide is often less than the amount of physical memory attached to the system , and modern data - intensive applications can easily scale to fill the available space .
If your application cannot be made to fit in a 32 - bit address space , you can gain a lot more user space by moving to a 64 - bit Java runtime .
If you are running a 64 - bit OS , then a 64 - bit Java runtime will open the door to huge Java heaps and fewer address - space - related headaches .
Table 2 lists the user spaces currently available with 64 - bit OSs :
Table 2 .
User space sizes on 64 - bit OSs
OS Default user space size Windows x86-64 8192 GB Windows Itanium 7152 GB Linux x86-64 500 GB Linux PPC64 1648 GB Linux 390 64 4EB
Moving to 64 - bit is not a universal solution to all native - memory problems , however ; you still need sufficient physical memory to hold all of your data .
If your Java runtime wo n't fit in physical memory then performance will be intolerably poor because the OS is forced to thrash Java runtime data back and forth from swap space .
For the same reason , moving to 64 - bit is no permanent solution to a memory leak — you are just providing more space to leak into , which will only buy time between forced restarts .
It 's not possible to use 32 - bit native code with a 64 - bit runtime ; any native code ( JNI libraries , JVM Tool Interface [ JVMTI ] , JVM Profiling Interface [ JVMPI ] , and JVM Debug Interface [ JVMDI ] agents ) must be recompiled for 64 - bit .
A 64 - bit runtime 's performance can also be slower than the corresponding 32 - bit runtime on the same hardware .
A 64 - bit runtime uses 64 - bit pointers ( native address references ) , so the same Java object on 64 - bit takes up more space than an object containing the same data on 32 - bit .
Larger objects mean a bigger heap to hold the same amount of data while maintaining similar GC performance , which makes the OS and hardware caches less efficient .
Surprisingly , a larger Java heap does not necessarily mean longer GC pause times , because the amount of live data on the heap might not have increased , and some GC algorithms are more effective with larger heaps .
Some modern Java runtimes contain technology to mitigate 64 - bit " object bloat " and improve performance .
These features work by using shorter references on 64 - bit runtimes .
This is called compressed references on IBM implementations and compressed oops on Sun implementations .
A comparative study of Java runtime performance is beyond this article 's scope , but if you are considering a move to 64 - bit it is worth testing your application early to understand how it performs .
Because changing the address size affects the Java heap , you will need to retune your GC settings on the new architecture rather than just port your existing settings .
Conclusion
An understanding of native memory is essential when you design and run large Java applications , but it 's often neglected because it is associated with the grubby hardware and OS details that the Java runtime was designed to save us from .
The JRE is a native process that must work in the environment defined by these grubby details .
To get the best performance from your Java application , you must understand how the application affects the Java runtime 's native - memory use .
Running out of native memory can look similar to running out of Java heap , but it requires a different set of tools to debug and solve .
The key to fixing native - memory issues is to understand the limits imposed by the hardware and OS that your Java application is running on , and to combine this with knowledge of the OS tools for monitoring native - memory use .
By following this approach , you 'll be equipped to solve some of the toughest problems your Java application can throw at you .

StudiVZ is a Facebook - style operation and is Germany 's largest web - based social networking site .
With the European Parliament elections in sight , the website recently opened up to established political parties for election campaigning .
Not for all parties though , as they chose to ban the Pirate Party .
Just a few days ago it was announced that German political parties would be allowed to campaign and engage the public via the social networking site StudiVZ .
Not all parties will be allowed to participate though , since the German Pirate Party has been undemocratically banned from StudiVZ .
The other political parties were allowed to have a special account to show they are an organization and not an individual .
The Pirate Party , however , was not allowed to have one and instead operated on a standard user account registered by an individual .
StudiVZ noticed that the Pirate Party account was not a “ real person ” and despite it having a thriving network with hundreds of followers , it was summarily deleted .
This means that it is impossible for the Pirate Party to have a presence at all on the largest social networking site in Germany .
The person who created the profile on the site said the action taken by StudiVZ had backfired , noting , “ Many young and first - time voters only really became aware of us because they erased our profile . ”
The Pirate Party said it condemned the anti-democratic behavior of StudiVZ ’s operators and called for the “ opening up of the platform for all recognized parties in Germany . ”
For the Pirate Party in particular , social networking sites are an essential tool in their election campaign .
Andreas Popp , lead candidate for the upcoming European Parliament elections characterizes the censorship as undemocratic .
“ Just think about it : The Pirate Party needs to put up with a ‘ cheap spot ’ in a Web 2.0 community , only to get kicked off again .
It ’s a huge scandal that the smaller parties are being discriminated against in their opportunities to advertise on StudiVZ .
That ’s not how a democracy works . ”
To make it even more absurd , the ideals and plans of the party may be of use to StudiVZ in the future as Facebook will take the German site to court for pirating their concept .
We doubt that the German Facebook knockoff can count on support from The Pirate Party in this case .
BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) -- Former Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk will be deported from the United States to Germany on Sunday , a spokesman for the German Justice Ministry told CNN Thursday .
John Demjanjuk appears in court in Jerusalem in 1987 on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp from March to September 1943 .
He is expected to arrive in Germany on Monday , Justice Ministry spokesman Ulrich Standigl said .
Demjanjuk will turn 89 Friday .
Munich state prosecutors will question him with a view to bringing charges against him , they said in a statement on March 11 .
German authorities studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations , and concluded it was genuine , before issuing the warrant , the statement said .
Demjanjuk denies having been a camp guard , saying instead he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans .
Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center told CNN that he was " thrilled " at the news of Demjanjuk 's deportation , which has long been dependent on which country was prepared to accept him .
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum also welcomed the news , saying in a statement it " applauds Germany 's efforts to hold the perpetrators of Nazi crimes accountable . "
" Almost 65 years after the Holocaust , this act sends an important message about the enduring need to make the perpetrators of genocide , wherever they are , answer for their crimes , " the museum 's statement said .
Demjanjuk has asked the Department of Justice for an administrative stay of the deportation order , his American lawyer John Broadley told CNN .
It could be " several months " after his arrival in Germany before Demjanjuk is brought to trial , his German lawyer , Guenther Maull , told CNN .
Demjanjuk will be offered the chance to make a statement after his arrest warrant is read to him when he arrives in Germany , and then court procedures will begin , the lawyer said .
Demjanjuk will be kept either in Munich Stadelheim prison or a clinic , depending on his health , while awaiting the court 's decision , said Maull , who added he has never spoken to Demjanjuk .
Demjanjuk has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for well over two decades .
He was extradited from the United States to Israel , where he was convicted in 1986 of being " Ivan the Terrible , " a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp .
The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal and he returned to the United States .
The United States filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard .
A federal judge found in 2002 that Demjanjuk had been a guard at the Sobibor death camp , where a quarter of a million people were killed during World War II , and at two other concentration camps .
Prosecutors argued that Demjanjuk concealed his history when he came to the United States in 1952 .
He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court .
A retired auto - plant mechanic , Demjanjuk is originally from Ukraine .

In a move very surprising to this veteran of far too many southern talk radio programs where I was the one condemning torture to a hostile audience , the Southern Baptist Convention ’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission has just condemned torture .
“ I do n’t agree with the belief that we should use any means necessary to extract information , ” said SBC Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission president Richard Land .
“ I believe there are absolutes .
There are things we must never do under any circumstances . ”
Furthermore , they clearly indicated that waterboarding is indeed an act of torture :
“ For me the ultimate test is : Could I , in good conscience , do whatever I am authorizing or condoning others to do ?
If not , then I must oppose the action .
If I could not waterboard someone — and I could n’t — then I must oppose its practice . ”
Land said he considers waterboarding to be torture because the definition of torture includes the determination of whether a procedure causes permanent physical harm , noting he is unable to “ separate physical from psychological harm ” in this instance .
The practice contravenes an individual ’s personhood and their humanity , he said .
“ It violates everything we believe in as a country , ” Land said , reflecting on the words in the Declaration of Independence : that “ all men are created equal ” and that “ they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights . ”
“ There are some things you should never do to another human being , no matter how horrific the things they have done .
If you do so , you demean yourself to their level , ” he said .
“ Civilized countries should err on the side of caution .
It does cost us something to play by different rules than our enemies , but it would cost us far more if we played by their rules , ” Land concluded .
To begin , I ’d like to applaud the Southern Baptist Convention for taking this stand .
Based on my anecdotal observations , this wo n’t be popular with the let ’s - waterboard - them - another - hundred - times crowd .
However , some of their members may now think through the issue or gain the courage to publicly oppose acts of torture .
While this condemnation is clearly many days late , it ’s not a dollar short .
Perhaps it ’s time to welcome the Southern Baptists into the fold of people who like to have rational and reasonable debate over issues of a political nature .
Or perhaps not .

You 're in a crowd of people and suddenly all pandemonium is unleashed .
Faced with a threat to your life , the mind does strange things .
How do you get out alive , asks Stephen Cooter .
No matter how terrible they look from the outside , in almost every disaster , be it a plane crash , a ferry disaster or a terrorist attack , someone usually gets out alive .
And while it 's impossible to be prepared for every eventuality , scientists are discovering that there are things we can all do to increase our chances of survival should the worst happen .
ASSESS THE RISK
While many of us are afraid of flying , very few fear driving even though we 're much more likely to die on the roads than we are in a plane crash .
Even fewer of us might consider falling a risk , but in 2007 falling ( like falling out of bed or down stairs ) killed about 400 more people in England and Wales than land transport accidents .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The reason is that our brain has evolved to use simple shortcuts to estimate risk rather than doing a full , logical , analysis .
One of the shortcuts we use is our memory , but the trouble is some things are simply more memorable than others .
" Threats like plane crashes and terrorism , while they do n't occur very often they leave very dramatic memory traces , " says John Maule , professor of human decision making at Leeds University Business School .
" And because of that those traces are highly accessible .
We know therefore that people consistently overestimate the likelihoods of those events . "
So one way we might increase our chances of survival could be to remember the dangers we face everyday and not just those we see on the news .
REACT QUICKLY
Contrary to what you might think , many people put their lives in danger by not reacting immediately disaster strikes .

In his analysis of the evacuation of the World Trade Center on September 11 , evacuation expert Professor Ed Galea found people took a surprisingly long time to leave their desks .
The average was around 5 - 8 minutes , but he found some waited up to 40 minutes after the planes hit before leaving , finishing e-mails , filing things away , shutting down computers and even going to the toilet before evacuating .
Professor Galea believes many of us underestimate the need to act quickly when disaster strikes .
" People just do n't appreciate that in these situations every second can mean the difference between life and death " .
EXPECT MIND GAMES
" A lot of people assume in an emergency situation that their thinking , their perception , the way their mind works is all going to stay the same .
And that 's not the case , it changes , " says Professor Andrew Silke of the University of East London .
The mind can freeze in a crisis Many of these changes help people to survive .
Tunnel vision is a common change experienced by survivors that helps people concentrate on survival .
Many survivors also report a phenomenon called time distortion - most commonly seeing events unfold in slow - motion .
" What 's happening here is that your brain has shifted into a higher gear .
And it 's taking in more information .
And as a result of this you 'll get a sense that time has slowed down but it 's only that your brain has shifted operations .
It is now operating more effectively and faster than before . "
But the brain has a limit , so too much stress means that everything shuts down and the ability to cope , to concentrate or to focus disappears .
And in that situation we might find ourselves doing the wrong thing .
In his analysis of the 1985 Manchester Airport disaster , in which 55 people died , survival psychologist Dr John Leach found that some passengers stopped to take luggage out of the overhead bins , rather than escape from the aircraft .
And others were unable to do anything at all , frozen in their seats until they were engulfed in flames .
PREPARE FOR THE WORST
" The time to start thinking about what you do in an emergency is n't when you 're in an emergency , " says Mr Silke .
Oil rig men are trained in disaster emergencies
However , experts are agreed that the best way to avoid freezing and increasing your chances of survival is preparation .
And while you may not be able to take part in formal training exercises , there are still things you can do to prepare .
Mr Silke believes that just visualising what might go wrong and then thinking through what you would do to get out can save precious seconds .
" Once you 've thought about the scenario you now have a plan inside your brain about this scenario .
And so if it does actually happen you can pull that plan out and implement it there and then . "
BE CONFIDENT
And finally , it 's vital that once you have a plan you 're prepared to put it into action rather than waiting to be rescued .
Having the confidence to act is , says Mr Silke , something many survivors have in common .
And anything we can do to prepare , will also help boost our confidence .
" We have cases where you have a weaker , slower , less intelligent person survives while right beside them you have a smarter stronger faster person who does n't .
And the difference you find is that the person who survived , their self - confidence was higher . "

This reminds me of a story in our local paper a while back .
A chap was restoring a vintage car that had no top to it .
While restoring it , he wondered what might happen if it rolled over during an accident , so began practising ducking to the side so as to be under the top level of the car if this happened .
The first day he took the car out for a test drive , he hit a patch of ice , skidded and flipped the car over .
He survived unhurt because he 'd practised his drill and had ducked into the passenger side of the car .
Of course some would ask whether he had the accident because he'd thought about it so much , but at least his preparation worked !
Pippa , Somerset I notice that there is no mention of helping other people to survive .
I once watched a television documentary about the survivors of a fire in a plane and the one thing that remains in my mind is that they all appear to have trampled over others in order to save their own skins .
I was horrified and still am .
PattieB , UK Prior repetition of emergency procedures is what helps save you in emergencies .
It 's what the armed forces practice daily , and why when they 're under fire , they 're still scared but they perform the role they trained for .
That 's why I pay close attention time after time to the repetitive safety brief on all commercial flights .
It will make a difference if you ever are in an aircraft emergency .
Steve Ritchie , Edinburgh
About ten years ago , I used to skydive regularly .
During initial freefall training in a harness on the ground , one of my instructors removed the dummy toggle used to deploy the parachute ( without my knowledge ) , in order to simulate an emergency .
The fact that I could n't locate the toggle was very confusing , and initially I did n't know what to do .
Some years later on a sky dive , I found that I was unable to locate the toggle for real .
Because I had experienced this before .
I knew exactly what to do , and wasted very little time thinking , and simply acted .
Rob Beck , Liskeard , Cornwall
The same applies to avoiding danger .
A case in point .
Those who refused to go on the pleasure boat that sunk a couple of years ago off the UAE .
They decided it was unsafe , I wonder how many others thought the same but peer pressure prevailed !
Simon Mallett , Maidstone
In my experience , in training for emergencies , people under stress will follow strident command stimulus without question .
Where groups fare best in coping with a dangerous situation there will be someone confidently giving instruction and direction ; obedience is magnified where a recognised authority figure is present .
Ken Doerr , Chester
My husband was attacked outside in the dark of night .
I could n't scream for help , but my eyes opened wide and suddenly I could see everything as if the lights were on !!
I could see the " other " attacker in the bushes , and the face clearly of the one who hit him in the head !
I 'll never forget the power of the brain working overtime in a terrifying situation .
So do n't ever question the " super - human " strength you can get at these times .

This history has left its mark on our minds .
Children are irrepressible taxonomizers , placing the world of distinct individuals into categories based on their appearance , their patterns of movement and their presumed deeper natures , and some psychologists have argued that the hard - wired capacity to organize and structure the world is specially adapted to nature : we are natural - born zoologists and botanists .
We may also have evolved to get pleasure from certain aspects of the natural world .
About 25 years ago , the Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson popularized the “ biophilia ” hypothesis : the idea that our evolutionary history has blessed us with an innate affinity for living things .
We thrive in the presence of nature and suffer in its absence .
Image
Our hunger for the natural is everywhere .
It is reflected in art : the philosopher Denis Dutton , in his book “ The Art Instinct , ” suggests that popular taste in landscape painting has been shaped by preferences that evolved for the African savanna .
The appeal of the natural is also reflected in where we most want to live .
People like to be close to oceans , mountains and trees .
Even in the most urban environments , it is reflected in real estate prices : if you want a view of the trees of Central Park , it ’ll cost you .
Office buildings have atriums and plants ; we give flowers to the sick and the beloved and return home to watch Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel .
We keep pets , which are a weird combination of constructed things ( cats and dogs were bred for human companionship ) , surrogate people and conduits to the natural world .
And many of us seek to escape our manufactured environments whenever we can — to hike , camp , canoe or hunt .
Wilson emphasizes the spiritual and moral benefits of an attachment to nature , warning that we “ descend farther from heaven ’s air if we forget how much the natural world means to us . ”
But there are more tangible benefits as well .
Many studies show that even a limited dose of nature , like a chance to look at the outside world through a window , is good for your health .
Hospitalized patients heal more quickly ; prisoners get sick less often .
Being in the wild re­duces stress ; spending time with a pet enhances the lives of everyone from autistic children to Alzheimer ’s patients .
The author Richard Louv argues that modern children suffer from “ nature - deficit disorder ” because they have been shut out from the physical and psychic benefits of unstructured physical contact with the natural world .
So the preservation of the natural world should be important to us .
But how important ?
The psycholo­gist Philip Tetlock has pointed out that many people talk about the environment as a “ sacred value , ” protected from utilitarian trade - offs — when the Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil , 80 percent of the respondents in one poll said that we should pursue greater environmental protection “ regardless of cost . ”
But he also points to the need to balance environmental concerns with social and political and personal priorities .
( Few of these respondents would be willing to hand over their pensions for a more efficient cleanup of the Alaskan shoreline . )
And even if we did value nature above everything else , we would still have to decide which aspects of nature we care about the most .
You can see this in the debate over the creation of giant wind farms in the ocean or on hillsides .
Proponents are enthusiastic about the cheap , green energy ; critics worry about the loss of natural beauty and the yearly filleting of thousands of songbirds and ducks .
PITTSBURGH --
Pittsburgh police and the NHL's security office have investigated a death threat made against Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin on a Pittsburgh Penguins fan message board .
Ovechkin
The post , reportedly written by a 17 - year - old boy from Chambersburg , Pa. , said : " I 'm killing Ovechkin .
I 'll go to jail .
I do n't care anymore . "
The boy 's name was n't released because he 's a juvenile .
The Penguins immediately informed local police , as well as the NHL and the Capitals .
" We were notified of the message and immediately turned over all information to the authorities , " the Penguins said in a statement .
It is not known if criminal charges are pending , but officials do n't believe Ovechkin was ever in any real danger .
Ovechkin was aware of the threat , but did not comment when the incident was first reported by a local television station in Pittsburgh .
" We are aware of it .
NHL security was contacted and worked with local law enforcement in handling the matter , " NHL spokesman Frank Brown said Thursday .
" We became aware of an inappropriate comment on a message board and referred it to appropriate authorities , " the Washington Capitals said in a statement .
" We appreciate their diligence and have every confidence in our club 's safety . "
Ovechkin , the NHL's leading goal scorer , has five goals in the first three games of the NHL Eastern Conference semifinal series against Pittsburgh .
He scored the game 's first goal during Washington 's 3 - 2 overtime loss in Game 3 on Wednesday night , hours after the threat was posted .
The Capitals and Penguins play Game 4 in Pittsburgh on Friday night .
The series continues in Washington with Game 5 on Saturday night .

Researchers have discovered that a long - defunct gene was resurrected during the course of human evolution .
This is believed to be the first evidence of a doomed gene – infection - fighting human IRGM – making a comeback in the human / great ape lineage .
The truncated IRGM gene is one of only two genes of its type remaining in humans .
The genes are Immune - Related GTPases , a kind of gene that helps mammals resist germs like tuberculosis and salmonella that try to invade cells .
Unlike humans , most other mammals have several genes of this type .
Mice , for example , have 21 Immune - Related GTPases .
Medical interest in this gene ignited recently , when scientists associated specific IRGM mutations with the risk of Crohn 's disease , an inflammatory digestive disorder .
In a new study , researchers from Evan Eichler 's genome science laboratory at the University of Washington and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute reconstructed the evolutionary history of the IRGM locus within primates .
They found that most of the gene cluster was eliminated by going from multiple copies to a sole copy early in primate evolution , approximately 50 million years ago .
Comparisons of Old World and New World monkey species suggest that the remaining copy died in their common ancestor .
The gene remnant continued to be inherited through millions of years of evolution .
Then , in the common ancestor of humans and great apes , something unexpected happened .
Once again the gene could be read to produce proteins .
Evidence suggests that this change coincided with a retrovirus insertion in the ancestral genome .
The structures of the IRGM loci are shown in the context of a generally - accepted primate phylogenetic tree .
ORF , ERV9 , intronic sequence , Alu sequence , and 5 ′ untranslated region ( UTR ) depicted in green , black , white , yellow and blue colors respectively .
A red color denotes pseudogenes based on the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the ORF .
Shaded orange color indicates an atypical GTPase because of mutations leading to the loss of a canonical GTPase binding motif ( see Figure S1 ) .
The first ATG codon ( green arrow ) after the Alu repeat sequence is used as putative start codon for the open reading frame of IRGM .
The transcription start site is marked with green flag .
FS indicates frameshift mutation .
TGA and TAA denote the position of stop codons ( arrows ) .
The shaded white , blue and green colors indicate predicted intron , UTR or exon , respectively .
The genomic loci are not drawn to scale with the exception of the full - length sequence of IRGM ORF .

doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000403" The IRGM gene was dead and later resurrected through a complex series of structural events , " Eichler said .
" These findings tell us that we should n't count a gene out until it is completely deleted .
" The structural analysis , he added , also suggests a remarkable functional plasticity in genes that experience a variety of evolutionary pressures over time .
Such malleability may be especially useful for genes that help in the fight against new or newly resistant infectious agents .

The sentencing of a man who has become a key figure in the national debate over medical marijuana was postponed Thursday , with a federal judge saying he was inclined to impose a more lenient sentence than the five years required by federal sentencing guidelines , but questioning whether he had the authority to do so .
“ If I could find a way out , I would , ” U.S. District Judge George H. Wu said .
He gave lawyers in the case until June 2 to file briefs regarding the impending sentence of Charles Lynch .
Lynch , 47 , ran a medical marijuana dispensary in Morro Bay on the Central Coast in 2006 and 2007 .
Despite having the blessing of the city ’s mayor and other public officials , he was charged with violating federal drug laws for distributing marijuana and was convicted by a federal court jury in Los Angeles last year .
At the hearing Thursday , Wu heard from several character witnesses , including one of Lynch ’s patients and the young man ’s father .

“ I stand before you today because I believe a man is being punished for reasons that do n’t make much sense , ” said Owen Beck , whose parents took him to Lynch ’s Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers when he was battling bone cancer at age 17 .
“ I believe a great injustice is being done . ”
Beck ’s father , Steven , told
Wu that the chemotherapy his son was undergoing was having devastating side effects .
“ He could not eat .
He could not sleep .
His personality became dark and angry , ” the elder Beck said .
He told the judge they decided to try medical marijuana on the advice of their son ’s Stanford University oncologist .
He said Lynch usually gave them marijuana for free or at deeply discounted rates .
“ I never felt as though Charlie was there for the money , ” Beck said .

Such testimony was not allowed at Lynch ’s trial because the Supreme Court has ruled that a claim of medical necessity is not a valid defense .
Janice Peters , the mayor of Morro Bay , described Lynch as a “ polite , compassionate ” man who did everything the city asked of him with respect to his business .
Rob Schultz , the town ’s city attorney said he received only one complaint about Lynch the whole time he was in business “ and that had to do with the quality of the medical marijuana . ”
The comment drew loud laughter from Lynch ’s supporters , who packed the courtroom , many of them wearing green ribbons with the word “ compassion ” printed on them .

Cultivating , using and selling doctor - recommended medical marijuana is allowed under some circumstances in California and a dozen other states , but federal law bans the drug altogether .
Though Lynch was not charged with violating state law , prosecutors contend that he broke the law because he was not truly a “ primary caregiver ” entitled to dispense marijuana to patients and that he profited from the operation of his business .
Much of the discussion Thursday dealt with whether Wu was required to sentence Lynch to a mandatory minimum of five years or whether the defendant was entitled to a lesser sentence under a so - called safety valve .
The next hearing in the case , which the judge said would be the last , is scheduled for June 11 .

On May 21 , 2009 , Justice Botsford of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts granted our client Riccardo Calixte 's motion to quash the illegal search warrant with which it seized Calixte 's computers , phones , ipods , camera and other personal property .
Not only is this an enormous victory for Calixte himself , but the ruling is also the highest state court opinion to repudiate the nascent law enforcement " trend " of charging internet users who violate websites ' terms of service as criminals .
( Case page with background documents here . )
First , a quick recap .
According to the warrant application , on January 27 , 2009 , Boston College police filed a report stating that Calixte and a roommate were having " domestic issues . "
During a subsequent conversation with police the next day , Calixte 's roommate made a series of unsubstantiated and misleading claims about Calixte 's computer expertise that the police later used in an attempt to portray him as a criminal , by alleging that Calixte was a " computer science major who is considered a master of the trade among his peers , " that Calixte had a reputation as a " hacker , " that it is " not uncommon for Mr. Calixte to appear with unknown laptop computers which he says are given to him by Boston College for field testing or he is ' fixing ' for other students , " and that he " uses two different operating systems to hide his illegal activities .
One is the regular B.C. operating system and the other is a black screen with white font which he uses prompt commands on . "
As part of this laundry list of purportedly suspicious things Calixte allegedly did , the roommate also stated , without any explanatory detail , that he had observed Calixte somehow " hack into the B.C. grading system that is used by professors to change grades for students . "
Neither Boston College nor any professor apparently reported such a breach , and the police did no follow - up investigation on this or any other of the roommate 's aspersions .
At some unspecified later date , Calixte 's former roommate was the subject of a mass e-mailing to the Boston College community in which he was reported to be gay .
Based on some follow - up investigation by the police and by the Boston College IT department , police sought and obtained a search warrant for Calixte 's dorm room on March 30 , 2009 , arguing that all of the above information amounted to probable cause that crimes had been committed .
Justice Botsford agreed with EFF that no probable cause existed and that the search was illegal .
The following are a few of Justice Botsford 's important findings .
* Rejecting the Commonwealth 's argument that the sending of an e-mail from a Yahoo !
or gmail account to a Boston College listserv could constitute " obtaining computer services by fraud or misrepresentation " under G.L. c. 266 § 33A or " unauthorized access to a computer system " under G.L. c. 266 § 120 F because it might violate some unidentified Boston College terms of service provision :
This appears to be the highest state court to address the question of whether a terms of service violation can itself constitute a " computer hacking " crime , an argument that the district court and jury got wrong in the Lori Drew case .
* Rejecting the Commonwealth 's argument that the unsupported allegation of " grade hacking " constituted probable cause :
* Rejecting the idea that using two operating systems is either suspicious or corroborative of the former roommate 's claims , as we previously argued , but was simply " part of a listing of alleged activities that do not appear to be unlawful " :
* Rejecting the Commonwealth argument that probable cause existed regarding the allegedly " illegally downloaded " music and movies :
* Rejecting the Commonwealth 's argument that simply asserting that their witness was " reliable " was enough to support a finding of probable cause :
* Rejecting the Commonwealth 's argument that the information provided by the informant established a sufficient " nexus " with Mr. Calixte 's apartment and property :
In short , the court rejected every significant argument raised by the Commonwealth .
Referring to the information submitted by the police as " sketchy " and " troublingly weak , " the court ordered that " all ongoing forensic analysis of the items seized from Calixte must cease . "

Topflight archaeologists have unearthed a 35,000 - year - old figurine carved out of mammoth ivory by prehistoric Germans , depicting a woman with enormous breasts .
The find is thought to be the oldest known example of 3D pornography in the world .
Early German 3D jazzmag .
Credit : Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen .
The find was made in the Hohle Fels Cave in the Swabian Jura area of southwest Germany last year , by Nicholas Conard of Tübingen Uni .
He believes that the jubtastic relic is at least 5,000 years older than previously - discovered busty nude cavewoman themed objets d'art , and perhaps indicates that the desire to goggle at saucy imagery of ladies well - furnished in the tophamper department is a basic attribute of modern humanity .
The paleolithic porno , carved using primitive flint tools from mammoth tusk " in impressive detail " , is approximately 6 cm tall and 3.5 cm wide .
In place of a realistic head it has a knob which Conard theorises might have been used to attach it to a thong or cord .
This would have allowed it to be worn concealed beneath the owner 's primitive jerkin or hide garment , or alternatively stashed securely somewhere in the residential cave , perhaps to be brought out from time to time for private artistic contemplation .
" It 's sexually exaggerated to the point of being pornographic , " comments anthro prof Paul Mellars of Cambridge .
" There 's all this sexual symbolism bubbling up in that period .
They were sex-mad . "
If Conard 's dates are correct , the smut - hungry prehistoric proto-Germans were in the process of ethnically cleansing Europe of their Neanderthal rivals at the time the bounteously - torso 'd figurine was crafted .
Experts in prehistoric jub - themed erotica worldwide are now hotly debating the findings : some argue that a taste for copiously convex feminine imagery indicates a superior cognitive intelligence , possibly a conclusive advantage in a contest against Neanderthal dullards .
Other professors with wide expertise in the field disagree .
So far at least , it is n't known what ( if any ) kinds of special - interest gentlemen 's glossy portable statuary were favoured by the Neanderthals .
Thus the acrimonious debate regarding what pornography preferences are most favourable in a species - dominance context remains unsettled .
There 's layman 's coverage from boffinry mag Nature here , and Conard 's academic paper can be read by subscribers here . ®

FROM an astronomer ’s perspective , the universe is a pretty cool place .
In fact it ’s positively chilly , with more than half the energy emitted by normal matter coming from clouds of gas and dust too cold to radiate visible light – and which therefore cannot be seen with traditional telescopes .
The same problem plagues observations of the chilled - out photons of the cosmic microwave background left over from the big bang .
Closer to home , cool , dark objects litter our immediate cosmic neighbourhood .
To obtain a complete picture of our surroundings , astronomers must resort to the equivalent of night - vision goggles or a thermal - imaging camera .
These are specialised space telescopes that scan the sky at infrared and microwave wavelengths much longer than those of visible light , allowing them to spy out the faint traces of heat that dark bodies imprint on the sky .
On 29 April [ Note : this date has been postponed to mid May since the time of writing ] , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) will launch two such instruments from its base on the coast of French Guiana .
Piggy - backing in the nose of a single Ariane V rocket will be the Planck microwave telescope and an infrared telescope , the Herschel Space Observatory .
Once in space , the two will go their separate ways :
Planck to study in detail the cosmic microwave background , and Herschel to spy on the cool gas and dust clouds that are the nurseries of stars and galaxies .
This second satellite will incorporate the largest space telescope ever launched , named …

Advertisement A huge ocean wave has been filmed from beneath the surface , revealing features never before captured on camera .
The remarkable video , which will be shown as part of the BBC Natural History Unit 's new series South Pacific , was filmed in super slow motion using a high - definition camera .
It reveals the hidden power of a four - metre - tall monster barrel wave .
It also shows the first images of underwater spiralling vortices created by the wave 's action .
The wave was filmed off the coast of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands , part of the Federated State of Micronesia .
The location is well known in the international surf community .
Some of the biggest waves in the world break on South Pacific islands .
The storm swells that create these waves travel more than 5,000 km to break on their shorelines .
Super slow mo " I really wanted to slow the wave down , so it was like being there , immersed in that environment , " says the BBC's Huw Cordey , series producer of South Pacific .
" I wanted to capture the scale of the event . "
Doing so took special skills and equipment .
Australian cameraman Bali Strickland , renowned for filming expert surfers at some of the best surfing sites in the world , had to float in the water as the wave passed over him .
He filmed the wave using a £ 66,000 ( $ 100,000 ) high - speed camera that captures the action at 20 times slower than normal speed , and in high definition .
The kit required a special housing unit designed and built by German specialist high - speed cameraman and technician Rudi Diesel .
Until this film , no one had ever tried using this type of camera underwater before .
It opens up this huge insight into the birth of a wave
BBC series producer Huw Cordey
The spectacular results show the wave barrel closing over Australian big wave surfer Dylan Longbottom , who rode the wave to illustrate the scale and power of the water .
Clearly visible are long underwater vortices created by the moving wave , a feature the BBC team believes has never before been caught on camera .
" So much is revealed by slow motion , " says Mr Cordey .
" We saw these vortices on one shot , which I do n't think anyone has noticed before .
It opens up this huge insight into the birth of a wave . "
The vortices only appeared once , despite the team filming more than 10 waves , he added .
" Maybe it's when the wave gets to a certain height or size .
It was n't a scientific experiment , so its difficult to judge .
But its interesting we only saw it the one time . "
Origins of surf
The location of the shoot is appropriate as the South Pacific is reputed to be the place surfing started some 1,500 years ago .
The giant waves have since inspired the culture of the human colonisers of the islands .
The waves start as a swell on the opposite side of the ocean , arriving days later .
During the course of their journey , they move from travelling over deep water to water just two metres deep .
" That 's what causes them to rear up and barrel , " explains Mr Cordey .
The clip will be broadcast as part of the first programme of the six - part landmark series .
The South Pacific programmes explore the isolation of the region 's islands , the extraordinary journeys wildlife and humans have taken to reach these remote specks of land and what happened to both after their arrival .
Upcoming programmes will include footage of undersea volcanoes attempting to form new islands , tiger sharks snatching newly fledged albatross chicks and bizarre human rituals that involve people jumping from 20 - metre wooden scaffolds with only forest vines to break their fall .
South Pacific : Oceans of Islands will be broadcast on BBC

Advertisement British scientists have begun work on a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus .
Their efforts are under way at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control ( NIBSC ) in Hertfordshire .
The NIBSC is one of a small group of influenza centres around the world which will create a seed vaccine strain which could then be grown in bulk by manufacturers .
Its scientists need a steady hand to drill a hole in a hen 's egg .
For that is the first step in the creation of a vaccine against the swine flu virus .
Scientists at NIBSC , which is part of the Health Protection Agency , say eggs are ideal for growing up flu viruses .
" They are like virus production factories , " its principal scientist Dr John Wood explained .
Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu .
If they are asked to stop - there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine
Dr John Wood " Eggs have been used for decades to make flu vaccines .
It 's an old technology but it works very well . "
I was allowed into one of the containment labs which will be used to make the vaccine but not where the live virus is being used .
This is not because of infection but because I might contaminate the vaccine production process .
It involves scientists painstakingly injecting a small amount of virus into each egg which will then be incubated over the weekend .
By Monday , they should have enough virus to begin the next stage .
Two different techniques are being used .
First , " reverse genetics " , where scientists take the H and the N surface proteins from the H1N1 virus and mix them with a laboratory virus known as PR8 .
This creates a harmless hybrid virus which can be used for the vaccine .
The second technique involves injecting both the H1N1 and PR8 viruses into eggs and allowing the hybrid strain to be created through a natural re-assortment of their genes .
The vaccine will work by tricking the immune system into thinking it has been infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus so that it creates antibodies against it .
Bulk production
Then , if subsequently exposed to the virus , the immune system will destroy the invader before it can cause illness .
The first seed strain of H1N1 swine flu vaccine should be ready in three to four weeks .
It will then take another four or five months for vaccine manufacturers to produce the vaccine in bulk .
On Wednesday , when the WHO raised the threat level to five - one short of a pandemic , its director general stopped short of asking vaccine manufacturers to switch to an H1N1 strain .
Dr Margaret Chan said this was because it was not yet clear how severe the virus would be .
" It will be an extremely difficult decision for the World Health Organisation and governments to make , " said Dr Wood .
" Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu .
It could take manufacturers up to five months to mass - produce the vaccine " If they are asked to stop doing that it means there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine and vulnerable people could be susceptible if there was an epidemic of ordinary flu this winter " .
The WHO has a matter of weeks in which to make that decision if it does not want to lose valuable time .
No - one should expect a swine flu vaccine to be available before the Autumn .
In fact most of us will have to wait a lot longer .
Around 300 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine are produced globally each year .
The vaccine includes three different strains of human flu so each dose takes three eggs to produce .
If manufacturers switched to producing a single pandemic strain vaccine , they might feasibly triple the number of doses to around 900 million .
But it may not be that simple .
We do not know how well the virus will grow in eggs or how much antigen will be needed to create an effective vaccine .
It may require two injections to provide adequate immunity .
Long wait With a world population of more than six billion , there clearly will not be enough to go round and the disease will hit poorer countries hardest because they cannot afford to buy the vaccines .
The UK government has contracts with two manufacturers to produce 120 million doses of pandemic vaccine - enough for two doses per Briton , if required .
But unless you are a front - line healthcare worker or someone involved in an essential service , do not be surprised if you are not among the first to receive it .
If a pandemic is declared and vaccine production begun then most of us are likely to have to wait until well into next year before we are offered it .
That is why it is so important to try to prevent an epidemic in Britain now .
That would buy us valuable time in which to create a vaccine .

Summary : Gnote continues to earn good feedback and Hubert Figuiere puts his name down for a place in GNOME ’s board
G note may be a young project , but it is already superior to Tomboy in some ways and it has entered most of the ‘ big ’ GNU / Linux distributions by now [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
This program has just gotten another public endorsement , which is great .
What is a big deal is that Gnote does what I need it to do .
The controvery surrounding it be hanged ( and you can use your favourite search engine to learn about the controversy ) .
I like Gnote .
It ’s useful .
And until something better comes along , it ’s going to be my note application of choice
GNOME elections are coming and the developer of Gnote is among the listed candidates .
Below you will find a list of candidates who are running for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors .
A short summary statement from each candidate and a link to their full candidacy announcement is provided to help you learn more about them . [...]
5 . Hubert Figuiere Affiliation : None
Full statement at http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2009-May/msg00035.html
I have been involved with Free Software for a decade or so , mostly working on the application side : AbiWord , gnote , etc .
I have attended several Free Software conferences as resources permitted and given talk on several occasion .
I have a true faith in GNOME and what it brings to users of Free Software , and I truly believe that ’s where the future is .
Richard Stallman has told me that he invites Gnote ( and Hubert Figuiere ) to come closer to GNU .
This would have a positive effect when it comes to reducing Microsoft 's impact . █

Recession to Inspire New Crop of Successful entrepreneurs
If past history is any guide , economic recessions have a tendency to provide a burst in entrepreneurial activity .
This is one of the reasons why the economy tends to run in cycles , the upsurge in new small business startup provides fodder for future economic growth .
If you are thinking about becoming an entrepreneur , recession may be the best time to start a company .
Factors helping entrepreneurs start and thrive in an economic recession
Cheap resources : Everything from office supplies to rent to machinery are available at low prices .
Much lower than available just a few years ago .
Most of the equipment can be bought at liquidation prices as many existing businesses downsize or go out of business completely .
There is also a glut of commercial space in many business locations .
Which means that the rents are softening too .
Lower payroll costs :
With unemployment reaching higher and higher levels , there are many skilled workers coming on the market .
Many of them are willing to take a job at less than what they used to make in their past jobs .
Recessions are good for entrepreneurial companies to hire good employees at a reasonable cost .
At the same time , it makes sense for the existing businesses to start planning their growth strategy and invest in human resources while they are cheap
Lowered job opportunities :
Many of us have always dreamed of someday owning our own businesses .
As we get caught up in the grind of our daily lives : climbing the corporate ladder , raising kids , upgrading toys , somehow the dream remains in the back corner , unfulfilled .
During recession though , a job loss or a stalled career , may provide the right impetus towards this dream as good job opportunities are hard to find .
Many of us take this time to re-evaluate entrepreneurship as an option .
Sometimes , we only need a push and a nudge to finally take the step that we should have taken long time ago .
There are also some common traits of the entrepreneurs that start a business in a recession and become successful in the future
What to do when starting a business in a recession
Bootstrap your startup :
Gone are the days of readily available venture , angel or bank funding .
If you start a business now , you need to watch over every expense and really do more with less .
You do not have a luxury to hire well known names at large salaries to be executives .
Advertising budgets need to be barebones too ..
A large number of businesses that start up in a recession and are successful are built with sweat equity .
Apple Computers , Microsoft , Oracle , Genentech are prime examples of the businesses that started in a past major recession in US .
They were all launched on a shoestring budget .
Working within means and managed growth helps instill discipline and good fiscal management behavior .
These qualities are key to long term success .
Embrace new technology or better create one : Sounds like a cliche , but the economic upsurge after a recession lot of times piggy backs on a birth of a new industry .
Software and Bio- Tech are prime examples .
So what will be the new industry this time around ?
Hard to say and I am sure there are many experts with ideas , but looks to me , given the priorities of the new administration and the oil shock of the last year , alternative energy and green technologies may just fit the bill .
The state of technology today makes it possible for the new entrepreneurs to think of marketing and advertising in new ways .
Word of mouth marketing is now possible on the internet .
More and more we are living in a world where ideas have started to matter more than the sheer amount of money that can be thrown at it .
And when the economy returns , and it always does , the businesses that were started now will do well .
I think the time is ripe for new crop of entrepreneurs to emerge and one day rule the world .
What do you think ?
Apple is poised to introduce new versions of its Time Capsule wireless backup appliance and AirPort Extreme 802.11n wireless routers , regulatory filings with the Federal Communications Commission reveal .
A filing for a new AirPort Express ( ID Label diagram ) was originally lodged in January and granted on Monday , while a filing for a new Time Capsule ( ID Label diagram ) was first made back in August of 2008 and also granted this week .
The documents appear to indicate that Apple is adding a combined mode , allowing its AirPort base stations to simultaneously support iPhones and other 802.11b / g devices operating at 2.4 GHz , while also broadcasting 802.11n wide signals in the 5GHz band to maximize throughput for notebooks and devices such as Apple TV .
Existing models can only run in one mode or the other , providing either wide compatibility or the highest possible network performance , but not both .
As noted in our original review of Time Capsule , there is also significant room for improvement in the performance of its embedded file server , although the FCC documents only refer to the devices ' radio features .
There is no mention of adding femtocell 3G support to the AirPort products , for example .
The filings come two weeks after AppleInsider relayed a report from Australia 's whirlpool forums which recommended that Australian Mac users not purchase any of the company 's existing AirPort products because a source was informed by his employer that " there will be new Airport Extreme and Airport Express within the next few weeks . "
While Apple has reflected relatively healthy inventory of AirPort Extremes in the US and Canada , availability of the wireless routers has been close to non-existant for the past 2 - 3 weeks in parts of Europe , such as Sweden , Norway , Denmark , France , Germany , and Italy .
An AppleInsider blog post published earlier today noted rumors of six new Apple product part numbers that have turned up in the inventory systems of some of the company 's overseas resellers .
Typically when the FCC publishes authorization documentation for a new Apple product , that product hits the market within days of the grant being made public .
It should also be noted that Amazon recently slashed the price of the current generation Time Capsules by 13 - 22 percent , a move which may now be seen as an inventory clearing measure ahead of new models .
The 1TB Time Capsule was marked down $ 112 to $ 387.92 while the 500GB model was reduced by about $ 40 to $ 259.31 .

Gov. Bill Ritter has vetoed a bill that would have exempted some gun buyers from background checks , saying it contains “ inadequate safeguards ” to prevent ineligible people from buying firearms .
The bill would have allowed holders of valid concealed - handgun permits to avoid mandatory criminal background checks by presenting that permit along with one other piece of identification when buying a gun .
Critics said there would be no way to guarantee that the current holder of a concealed - weapons permit surrendered it in the event of their arrest for a violent felony .
A person in that circumstance would not be eligible to purchase a handgun but would be able to avoid the background check by showing the concealed - weapon permit .
“ ( The bill ) does nothing to help assure that a sheriff who issued a concealed - handgun permit is promptly notified of a disqualifying event , ” Ritter wrote in his veto message .
“ In short , it is easily foreseeable that a potential purchaser will be in possession of a concealed - handgun permit for a substantial period of time after the potential purchaser would no longer be qualified to purchase a firearm . ”
“ … House Bill 09 - 1180 significantly weakens the safeguards against the illegal purchase of firearms .
Accordingly , I have vetoed this bill . ”

Streetfilms : Bike Rush Hour on Portland ’s Hawthorne Bridge
The first time you visit Portland , Oregon , the gaggles of cyclists streaming over the Hawthorne Bridge during rush hour is a sight you will never forget .
It ’s something other cities need to see and be inspired by .
On a recent vacation there , I could n’t resist cranking out a Streetfilms shortie , so I hooked up with Crank My Chain ’s Dan Kaufman to capture the essence of the p.m. rush and find out what it feels like to be a part of the mass of cyclist humanity in Southeast Portland ’s Hawthorne corridor .
As Greg Raisman from Portland ’s Bureau of Transportation pointed out : 20 percent of all traffic on the Hawthorne Bridge is bikes , while the number of cyclists in Portland has risen 600 percent in the last 15 years and shows no sign of letting up .

Here we go again !
Just over a week ago there have been many Acai Berry tweets being sent throughout Twitter from bogus accounts .
These Twitter messages are promoting a free trial of an acai berry dietary supplement .
Security experts say that social - networking spam is particularly effective because it ca n’t be filtered at the corporate firewall and appears to come from a friend of the recipient .
These messages are n’t coming from friends you may know , as these accounts were hacked .
Not only hacked accounts are spreading the dietary supplement , but they ’re also coming from new squatted accounts created months ago .
This strategy allows the spammer to build up followers before tempting their trickery .
However , these links that are shortened can fool anyone into believing they ’re legitimate , but think again .
The links are going to websites that are full of Malware .
Here are some facts about Malware infected sites :
Web - based Malware more likely to be found on older domains
The common assumption that most web - based Malware resides on less reputable websites , perhaps touting adult content , was called into question when MessageLabs Intelligence identified that cybercriminals appear to be more likely to hide malicious content on older domains that have been well - established , but perhaps compromised or Malware being hosted in breach of their terms of use .
The latter being typical of domains connected with social networking environments , providing mainly user - generated content .
MessageLabs
Intelligence data3 from the week of 5 May 2009 revealed that :
84.6 % of website domains blocked for hosting malicious content are well - established domains that are over a year old
15.4 % of domains blocked are domains that are less than a year old
10.2 % are domains that are less than a month old
And 3.1 % are domains that are less than a week old
Older domains are almost certainly more likely to be well - established and more reputable , and the likelihood that they are legitimate sites that have been compromised in some way is increased .
Domains that are only a week old or less and implicated in hosting Malware are more likely to be temporary sites set up with the sole purpose of distributing Malware or spam , such as in the numerous domains that exist solely to distribute rogue anti-spyware or anti-Malware products .
Very new sites are often found to be used by affiliates , in order to redirect visitors to another site .
This helps to ensure that they receive payment for any click - thrus that their sites generate , but sometimes they will include drive - by attacks , using hidden HTML IFRAME exploits , for example .
Be extra careful before clicking on any link on any of the social networks .
Negative headlines once again are pressurizing global equities .
Doomsayers expect equity markets to pare close to 10 % before resuming this rally in the second half of the year .
S&PÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s has rallied close to 25 % from the beginning of Mar. ( a technical correction is somewhat overdue ) .
Europe recession is deepening , more than originally estimated last month , as GDP was revised down to - 1.6 % vs. the announced - 1.5 % .
Companies continue to scale back production as consumer spending declines .
Today , Ireland holds its 2nd emergency budget in 6 - months .
The former Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœCeltic TigerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ is expected to shrink the most of any Euro - zone this year .
Last week it became the 4th - member of the region to be downgraded this year .
How quickly one goes from the very top to the bottom !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
In this shortened trading week due to Good Friday , there is little Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœextraordinaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ data that will sway investors a great deal .
The FI market will probably get most of the attention as never ending supply of new issues ( $ 2.5t for this year ) continues to be pumped into the system .
The debate of demand vs. supply and an early close this Thursday could provide some fireworks at the 10 - year auction ( $ 18 b ) .
Analysts once again fear that ballooning bank losses will cripple the financials and the 4 - week Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœbullÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ or Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœbearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ equity rally has convinced a percentage of investors to pare some of their positions .
Headlines from Soros stating that US recapitalizations of financials has taken the wrong shape ( too similar to Bush policies ) and will not allow them to provide credit going forward certainly does not appease investorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fears !
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.38 % , GBP - 0.11 % , CHF - 0.04 % and lower against JPY + 0.47 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.19 % and AUD +0.02 % .
The loonie faltered yesterday as global equities and commodities took it on the chin , persuading speculators to gravitate towards the greenback as they shied away from riskier assets .
Canadian data showed that headline building permits fell by 4 - times the expected pace for Feb . ( - 15.9 % vs. - 3.6 % ) .
However , analysts note that a large percentage of the decline was due to data distortion that was underestimated by consensus , due to volatility in medical building permits ( +64 % once off in Jan . ) .
Digging deeper , another sharp decline in single family housing permits ( - 5.5 % ) is convincing enough of how weak the housing sector remains .
Other factors continue to contribute to a weaker CAD , BOC Governor Carney will announce at the end of this month a plan that would Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœflood banks with cash to halt the hoarding of capital and expand lending Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
We have witnessed other currencies depreciate significantly when their governments entertained quantitative easing methods ( BOE , BOJ , Fed ) .
Secondly , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s difficult to want to own the currency ahead of this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s employment numbers on Thursday ( Friday is a national Holiday ) .
For now , one should expect to buy USD on pull backs .
RBA governor Stevens surprised the market somewhat and only cut Australian O/N rates by 25 bp vs. the 50bp that the street was expecting ( 3.00 % ) .
He has now trimmed rates to a 49 - year low .
The AUD $ managed to pare its initial losses on the back of this less than aggressive ease .
Investors will now revert back to commodities and equities to gage the currency future value .
Expect Australians to receive further economic stimulus in next monthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s budget ( 0.7084 ) .
Traders continue to buy on pull backs for now .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 50.53 down - 52 c ) .
It was all too good to be true .
Crude prices slipped yesterday as US equities declined on speculation that bank loan losses will continue to increase .
Nervousness about the equity markets has heightened again after analysts recommended selling financials for that very reason .
It did not help that QatarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Oil Minister said he Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdoes not expect prices to rebound to $ 70 a barrel this yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as OPEC implements its biggest - ever supply reduction .
Inventory levels remain the curse for prices .
Until we see inventories decline substantially , there will not be a sustained gain in price .
Oil temporarily advanced last week after leaders at the G20 agreed on measures to fight the global recession .
However , industrial reports showing that rising oil inventories and falling demand continues to signal that the worst of the recession may not be over .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report showed that US stock levels rose to a 15 - year high as this global recession continues to curb demand .
It was the 23rd gain in 27 - weeks .
Inventories climbed + 2.84 m barrels to +359.4 m vs. an expected increase of +3 m .
Most surprising was gas supplies , which unexpectedly rose by +2.23 m barrels to +216.8 m w/w.
Investors should treat last weeks advances as a bear market rally until the 2nd - half of the year when by then we will have burned off some of the excess .
Gold fell yesterday for various reason , firstly , technical and secondly , some new found optimism .
The vulnerability of some medium term support levels had traders pushing prices to a new 2 - month low and erasing all of this yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gains .
The market also fears that the IMF will be in a situation to start selling some of their stocks levels to finance specific projects ( $ 877 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,832 down - 25 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,285 down - 64 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,951 down - 42 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 1 bp yesterday ( 2.89 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday despite the US continuing its buy back program ( between 10 and 17 - year product to keep long end borrowing costs down ) .
In this shortened trading week we will also see the US Government Issue another $ 55+b of new debt .
After the buy - backs , expect traders to shift their focus to the anticipated record supplies of US debt , and by default cheapen the curve once again .

The Oracle - Sun deal came little more than two weeks after I.B.M. ended its talks with Sun . The Sun board balked after I.B.M. lowered its offer to $ 9.40 a share from $ 10 .
The Oracle bid , at $ 9.50 a share , will have a net cost to Oracle of $ 5.6 billion , after accounting for the value of Sun ’s cash and debt .
Lawrence J. Ellison , Oracle ’s chief executive , said in a conference call Monday morning that Sun ’s Java programming language and its Solaris operating system were the main attractions .
He said Java , the language used in most computer science schools and a technology used daily by millions of software developers , was “ the single most important software asset we have ever acquired . ”
What Type of Web Commenter Are You ?
Sometimes , Howling Mobs of Commenters Wish for Your Early Death ; Others Are a Bit Nicer
For 20 years as a reporter and editor , I never worried about comments .
Sure , as a cub reporter , I used to die a thousand deaths every time a letter to the editor appeared in my newspaper that took issue with something I 'd written .
But it was n't long before I learned two things :
1 . In a newspaper , there is n't much room for letters to the editor -- maybe a half - dozen per day .
And very few of them , even after a big , controversial story , were about you ; and ,
2 . The editorial page editor is your best friend .
In order to keep a balanced page , he or she is only going to run ( at most ) a couple letters about you -- and even then will try to maintain a balance between the laudatory and the cutting … and leave the crazies out .
So , for the next 20 years , as a reporter , magazine writer and magazine editor , I never sweated the " Letters to the Editor " page .
Even as an editor , unless there was a serious factual correction I needed to investigate , I usually did n't even read the things -- but instead left it to my managing editor to decide what she wanted to print .
That all changed -- oh boy , did it change -- with the Internet .
Between this column and the various stories I 've written for publications that have appeared online , I figure in the last decade I 've received about 10,000 comments .
That 's the population of medium - sized towns in some parts of the U.S.
And fully half of those comments came with a single story -- the one I wrote last October about being ashamed of being a journalist .
For a few years , I went through the same shell - shock most bloggers and other online writers experience .
Seemingly overnight , you go from a handful of generally polite printed comments to hundreds of screaming comments by people who not only do n't agree with you , but call you a traitor , a Nazi , a communist , too stupid to live , a fraud … and who fervently pray that you will soon die horribly in a fire .
As you might imagine , this takes a bit of getting used to .
After all , in daily life few of us regularly encounter people who hate us with such virulence based on such little information -- and when you do , you run for you life .
So , for about the first 1,000 comments , you tend to actually read what the commenters are saying and take it personally .
And you start to understand why some really successful bloggers like Glenn Reynolds or James Lileks do n't have comments sections .
It must be very nice .
Still , you can get used to just about everything , even howling mobs of commenters wishing for your early death .
Then , something interesting happens :
You write that column or blog entry that receives zero comments .
Then you start missing all of those angry notes --
Why do n't they hate me anymore ? -- and wondering what you 've got to write next time to get them back .
Pretty soon , in a feedback loop between writer and reader never possible in the print world , you find yourself writing on those topics , and in that style , that will provoke the most reader response .
It may be craven , but it 's a more reader - responsive form of writing than anything I ever had to face back in my newsroom days .
Internet Commenters : From Pretenders to Pervs
By the time you get to 10,000 comments , you 've seen just about every permutation of commenter possible … and , as human beings do , find yourself categorizing them .
The other day , I found myself writing down all of those types -- something I 'd never done before -- and I thought I 'd share them with you .
Please do n't take them personally .
…
Actually , do take them personally ; but keep in mind that on those occasions when I comment on other sites , I myself quickly fall into one or more of these categories -- and not always the nice ones .
The Troll -- Everyone knows this guy ( and it 's usually a guy ) , who intentionally visits sites in order to stir things up , provoke a furious reaction from other posters and then disappear .
Classic examples are the Free Republic types who visit Daily Kos and vice versa .
The Droll --
The mainstay of all fun sites , this poster regularly tosses out clever comments , plays on words , one - liners or amusing pictures .
There are a lot of these characters on places like Fark.com
The Relentless Pol --
Posters who can't join any discussion without immediately using it to make a political point , i.e. , " The current lack of sunspots is the direct result of the Bush administration 's failed policies . "
The Skimmer --
The commenter , usually sour , who reads only a headline or sentence of a piece , draws exactly the wrong conclusion , and then embarks on an embarrassing rant .
The Trimmer -- A commenter who initially stakes a strong position , and then under withering attack from other commenters slowly backs off until he or she has completely abandoned that original position .
The Angry Man --
We all know this guy .
His solution for almost any problem in the world is the summary execution , in as grisly a manner as possible , of every possible perpetrator .
The Dismisser --
The ultimate arrogant commenter , this person never actually engages with the topic , but merely declares it beneath anyone 's interest , already resolved , or improperly stated -- and thus hardly worth the bother .
The dismisser 's only real message is : I 'm smarter than you and you need to acknowledge that fact .
The Butt - Kisser -- Famous writers and bloggers get this one .
It 's the poster who just can't say enough about how brilliant was that last entry , how they wish they could say it half as good , etc .
My assumption is that these folks are angling for some kind of personal relationship with the writer .
The Kumbaya --
These folks always show up two - thirds of the way through any heated on - line debate and ask , " Why ca n't we all just get along ? "
They are inevitably ignored or trashed .
The Parser -- What would we do without the Internet Grammar Police ?
These folks assiduously correct the online writings of others -- never quite catching on that the Web is designed to be fast , fresh and sloppy .
The Pretender -- Everybody is a pretender on the Web -- on the Internet , no one knows you 're a dog , as the New Yorker cartoon said .
Look at all of those made - up names and sexy icons .
But some people just take it to pathological extremes .
If the real world actually had that many war heroes , beauty contest winners , Mensa members and Olympic lovers , it would be a very different place .
The Defender -- Bloggers love these guys .
When you are getting hammered by other posters , this is the guy who watches your back , supports you , and tells your enemies off … and does a better job of it than your real - life friends .
The Perv --
These guys show up a lot on celebrity sites , announcing some really disgusting thing they 'd like to do to that famous figure … and of course will never get the chance to , thanks to stalker laws , restraining orders , and the fact they have no driver 's license .
It 's a toss - up in my mind whether the Web is a good outlet for these guys , or the platform they 've always dreamed of .
The Slut --
The best thing about slut commenters ( " What 's wrong with having sex with your best friend 's dad ? " ) is that they do n't know they 're sluts … until 800 other posters happily point it out to them .
The Boaster -- Few of us have ever driven a Lamborghini at 190 miles per hour .
But this guy has .
And can bench press 350 pounds .
And dated Jessica Alba in high school .
And …
The Tough Guy -- Remember the kid who talked tough , then ran off when confronted ?
The Internet is filled with these clowns , all secure in the knowledge that they will never be called to account .
The Pwn3R -- Most people are lucky to come up with a truly brilliant and devastating comeback a couple times in their lives .
But the Web , thanks to its unique characteristics , has bred a population of posters who regularly drop verbal and visual bombs on unsuspecting recipients ( like The Boaster and the Tough Guy ) that are so devastating that the victims can only slink off and be grateful for their anonymity .
I do n't know who these men and women are , but I both worship and fear them .
The Lecturer --
This is the buzzkill pedant who feels the need , even in a casual , light comments section , to post a 1,000 word exegesis on what everyone should be talking about .
Hey , thanks pal !
The Illiterate --
The blogosphere is still mostly a written medium -- so it 's always bizarre to encounter ( in about one out of 100 comments ) that poster whose spelling and grammar are so awful that you hope that they are just some drunk pounding on a Blackberry .
The Unacknowledged Expert --
A version of the lecturer , this is the undoubtedly insufficiently credentialed poster who feels the need to systematically point out how stupid everyone else is in order to prove how brilliant they are .
I always picture these guys as the frustrated adult result of smart kids who did n't listen to their high school guidance counselors .
The Mystery Genius --
These folks are just the opposite of unacknowledged experts .
Whoever they are , they post comments that are so shockingly clever or brilliant that you are left wondering who they are : Slumming Nobel Laureates ?
Bored nobility ?
The first glimpse of the Internet gaining consciousness ?
The Confesser --
You 're going along , casually reading some comment stream … and suddenly you are taken up short by a poster who , for some unknown reason , feels compelled to make some stunning confession -- " and that 's why I buried the drifter in my crawl space " -- and then disappears .
These are some of the most disturbing comments on the Web .
The Tomboy -- Every geek 's dream girl .
These women show up on sites frequented mostly by young men and instead of professing shock at the proceedings , actually raise the stakes : " Well , I happen to like playing World of Warcraft all weekend in my underwear and only eating Doritos and Top Ramen … "
The Handyman --
This poster is basically dad in disguise .
Someone mentions a mechanical or computer problem as an aside , and this poster instantly has the solution -- the wrong jets in your carburetor , a poor ground on your toaster , insufficient cache memory .
Whatever it is , they 've got the answer .
The Alien --
This is a poster from another country who has no context for what every commenter is talking about , and so asserts his or her own cultural solution : " Why this complain about wife ?
Sell gotes and buy more wifes ! "
The Martian -- Finally , these are the commenters whose combination of pretzel logic , conspiratorial tone and downright weirdness -- " Well , we all know the pope is behind that big lake of fire at the South Pole , do n't we ? " -- reminds you that the world is an even scarier place than we imagine , and makes you wonder if this writing for the Internet gig is such a good idea after all .
That 's my list for now .
Needless to say , I 'd love to hear what you think .
And I 'd love to hear what other commenter types you 've come up with .
But most of all , I 'd love to have you post your comments right here at ABCNews.com .
And feel free to post as many times as you like …

A few weeks ago , it was revealed that some Hindu leaders were offended by a new PS2 game that happened to be the first title developed in India .
Hanuman : Boy Warrior raised the ire of some Hindus because it " trivializes " one of the major deities of the Hindu religion .
As a result , the offended parties are calling for a worldwide boycott of Sony products .
The protest has been led by Rajan Zed ( pictured ) , president of Universal Society of Hinduism , and it 's largely been conducted via email so far .
In a press release this week , Zed explained that Sony 's officials stated they would look into the issue , but they have yet to actually give a response .
According to Zed , " If nothing was heard by Hindu leaders from Sony by May 21 , then all the protesting Hindu groups and leaders would re-evaluate the protest and announce the future course , which might include calling for boycott of Sony products world over by Hindus and other likeminded people and supporters . "
Exactly how effective this boycott might be is hard to determine , as it's difficult to determine how many Hindus are truly offended by the game outside of a small set of the community 's leaders .
That said , some different Hindu organizations have joined the protest on different continents .
The New York Fed , privately owned by the major banks in its region ( which is itself something I have a hard time reconciling with their possibly being pretty much broke ) is sometimes described as being more powerful than the central Federal Reserve .
At a minimum , it 's hugely powerful , and the sorts of conflicts of interest described here are highly disturbing .
Friedman says that he has done nothing wrong and just wants to prevent a " distraction " over bad appearances .
His letter of resignation is here .
I expect that people will have a bit to say ; I 'll stick around to monitor developments .
For a good backgrounder on the New York Fed , here 's an article from Eliot Spitzer .
I 'll quote three paragraphs of fair use :
The kerfuffle about current New York Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Stephen Friedman 's purchase of some Goldman stock while the Fed was involved in reviewing major decisions about Goldman 's future — well - covered by the Wall Street Journal here and here — raises a fundamental question about Wall Street 's corruption .
Just as the millions in AIG bonuses obscured the much more significant issue of the $ 70 billion - plus in conduit payments authorized by the N.Y .
Fed to AIG 's counterparties , the small issue of Friedman 's stock purchase raises very serious issues about the competence and composition of the Federal Reserve of New York , which is the most powerful financial institution most Americans know nothing about .
A quasi -independent , public - private body , the New York Fed is the first among equals of the 12 regional Fed branches .
Unlike the Washington Federal Reserve Board of Governors , or the other regional fed branches , the N.Y .
Fed is active in the markets virtually every day , changing the critical interest rates that determine the liquidity of the markets and the profitability of banks .
And , like the other regional branches , it has boundless power to examine , at will , the books of virtually any banking institution and require that wide - ranging actions be taken — from raising capital to stopping lending — to ensure the stability and soundness of the bank .
Over the past year , the New York Fed has been responsible for committing trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to resuscitate the coffers of the banks it oversees .
Given the power of the N.Y .
Fed , it is time to ask some very hard questions about its recent performance .
The first question to ask is : Who is the New York Fed ?
Who exactly has been running the show ?
Yes , we all know that Tim Geithner was the president and CEO of the N.Y .
Fed from 2003 until his ascension as treasury secretary .
But who chose him for that position , and to whom did he report ?
The N.Y .
Fed president reports to , and is chosen by , the Fed board of directors .
Go read the rest in Slate ; it 's worth your while .
UPDATE : Pluto wants you to see this .
Some investors in 401 ( k ) retirement funds who are moving to grab their money are finding they can't .
Even with recent gains in stocks such as Monday's , the months of market turmoil have delivered a blow to some 401 ( k ) participants : freezing their investments in certain plans .
In some cases , individual investors can't withdraw money from certain retirement - plan options .
In other cases , employers are having trouble getting rid of risky investments in 401 ( k ) plans .
Sigh .
Update 2 : Since this is ( most unexpectedly ) on the Rec List , the answer is " FAN " ! ; 7 )
Update 3 : Taunter thinks that we 're missing the big story and would like you to read this .
Update 4 : kovie beat me to this and I have no idea why this diary remains on the Rec List and that one does n't .
So : check out those comments as well , if you 're interested , as they are more plentiful .
Update 5 : from truong son traveler 's comment below ( and before that , Greenwald ) :
I would like to think that the Fed 's IG simply miscalculated the cost of not " giving up any details " in her testimony , but this is still incredibly ugly .
The exploration into cardholders ’ minds hit a breakthrough in 2002 , when J. P. Martin , a math - loving executive at Canadian Tire , decided to analyze almost every piece of information his company had collected from credit - card transactions the previous year .
Canadian
Tire ’s stores sold electronics , sporting equipment , kitchen supplies and automotive goods and issued a credit card that could be used almost anywhere .
Martin could often see precisely what cardholders were purchasing , and he discovered that the brands we buy are the windows into our souls — or at least into our willingness to make good on our debts .
His data indicated , for instance , that people who bought cheap , generic automotive oil were much more likely to miss a credit - card payment than someone who got the expensive , name - brand stuff .
People who bought carbon - monoxide monitors for their homes or those little felt pads that stop chair legs from scratching the floor almost never missed payments .
Anyone who purchased a chrome - skull car accessory or a “ Mega Thruster Exhaust System ” was pretty likely to miss paying his bill eventually .
Martin ’s measurements were so precise that he could tell you the “ riskiest ” drinking establishment in Canada — Sharx Pool Bar in Montreal , where 47 percent of the patrons who used their Canadian Tire card missed four payments over 12 months .
He could also tell you the “ safest ” products — premium birdseed and a device called a “ snow roof rake ” that homeowners use to remove high - up snowdrifts so they do n’t fall on pedestrians .
Testing indicated that Martin ’s predictions , when paired with other commonly used data like cardholders ’ credit histories and incomes , were often much more precise than what the industry traditionally used to forecast cardholder riskiness .
By the time he publicized his findings , a small industry of math fanatics — many of them former credit - card executives — had started consulting for the major banks that issued cards , and they began using Martin ’s findings and other research to build psychological profiles .
Why did birdseed and snow - rake buyers pay off their debts ?
The answer , research indicated , was that those consumers felt a sense of responsibility toward the world , manifested in their spending on birds they did n’t own and pedestrians they might not know .
Why were felt - pad buyers so upstanding ?
Because they wanted to protect their belongings , be they hardwood floors or credit scores .
Why did chrome - skull owners skip out on their debts ?
“ The person who buys a skull for their car , they are like people who go to a bar named Sharx , ” Martin told me .
“ Would you give them a loan ? ”
Some credit - card companies began using these and other discoveries to find new customers and to scrutinize existing cardholders .
A few firms began sending offers to people who had registered for baby showers or weddings , for example , since data showed that getting married or having a child — in addition to making people buy lots of new stuff — often also makes them more responsible .
Other companies started cutting cardholders ’ credit lines when charges appeared for pawnshops or marriage therapy because data indicated those were signs of desperation or depression that might lead to job loss .
But on the whole , companies , including Canadian Tire , stuck to more traditional methods of managing risk , like raising interest rates when someone was late paying a bill , because they worried that customers would revolt if they found out they were being studied so closely .
“ If you show us what you buy , we can tell you who you are , maybe even better than you know yourself , ” said Martin , who now works for Wal - Mart Canada .
“ But everyone was scared that people will resent companies for knowing too much . ”
Then last year , the economy blew up .
Three things became obvious very quickly .
First , all those extra charges that theoretically protected credit - card companies from losing money ?
Well , the worst - case models were way off , and some companies started hemorrhaging cash .
Second , many of the predictions that card companies built around their understandings of people ’s psyches were surprisingly accurate , even during an economic tsunami .
And finally , when people start losing their jobs and feeling poor , it suddenly becomes very , very important to figure out how to persuade them to pay their credit - card bills .
Mr. Osmanagic ’s " Archaeological Park : Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun " Foundation claims that its work is " transparent " ( en ) ( see also its statutes ( bs ) ) .
One particularly notable example of this " transparency " and scientific integrity is that of the report by the archaeologist Andrew Lawler .
I have succeeded in obtaining from the author ( who left the Foundation , partly because of this same episode ) the original of the report whose subject was the radiocarbon dating of a piece of fossil wood found in Ravne tunnel .
This original report can be found below :
Rapport originel d’Andrew Lawler Andrew Lawler ’s original report
But , under pressure from Mr. Osmanagic according to Mr. Lawler , the version of this report that was presented at the " First International Scientific Conference about the Bosnian pyramids " in September 2008 in Sarajevo has been heavily " amended " ; Mr. Osmanagic thought that the original one contained " too much geology " and " too much guesswork " .
So the following version was the one publicly presented in Sarajevo :
Rapport modifié par M. Osmanagic présenté à la conférence de Sarajevo
The report , incorporating Mr. Osmanagic ’s suggested amendments , that was presented to the Sarajevo conference
And , lastly , a third , much shorter , version , was published on the conference website ( section " reports " ( en ) ) and on the Foundation website ( en ) :
Rapport publié par la Fondation
The report published by the Foundation - Source
It is instructive to compare the three versions of this report .
At the beginning , each of the three is identical : introduction , sampling , results from Kiel and informations about the methodology used by the laboratory .
But , as I had already noted here and there , the version published on the Foundation website then stops abruptly , and does n’t mention a word concerning the implications of this result .
The other two versions both contain the discussion announced in the introduction ( implications of result and implications for further research ) , as well as a bibliography , but with important differences between the original report and the " amended " report presented at the conference .
Andrew Lawler ’s original report in fact clearly mentions ( pages 7 and 8 ) the discrepancy between the age , obtained by radiocarbon dating , of the sample ( about 30,000 years ) and the Miocene age ( at least 6 to 7 million years ) accepted by the Bosnian geologists for the conglomerate in which the sample was found ; and it rightly notes that the only one who gives a Quaternary age for this conglomerate is the Egyptian geologist , invited by the Foundation , Mr. Barakat ( see this article for more details ) .
The British archaeologist refuses to decide between the two options , the one presented ( and never subjected to scientific consideration ) by a single Egyptian geologist , and the one accepted by the local geology experts ; but he discusses the two scenarios and their various implications concerning the deposition of the sample of wood [ 1 ] .
Now , though , this whole discussion has disappeared from the amended version of the report , the only one that was presented to the participants in the Sarajevo conference .
In the new version , there is no mention of the ideas of the local geologists ( every reference to them has also disappeared from the bibliography , whereas the original bibliography gave the reference of two geological maps of Visoko region ) ; the only option that appears in this second version of the report ( pages 5 and 6 ) is of a recent age , Holocene or Pleistocene , for the conglomerates , and the single geological reference given is the 2006 " report " by Dr. Barakat - in which the Ravne conglomerates are only mentioned in one sentence .
Similarly , the implications for future research ( pages 8 and 9 in the original report , page 7 in the amended version ) are quite different : while Mr. Lawler ’s original report stressed the necessity for an independent geological study of the conglomerates ( " the priority in regards to further research leading to an accurate dateline of events in the Ravne tunnel system should be to ascertain the geological age of the medium into which the tunnels were originally cut " ) , the report amended by Mr. Osmanagic concludes that the sediment is certainly of recent date : " As the dates given by the AMS 14C laboratories comply with the suggested age of the sediments " ... forgetting that this age is " suggested " - and that ’s the most apposite word here - only by Mr. Barakat .
The curious - minded reader may enjoy picking out further minor variations between the two versions of the report .
These changes are not anecdotal : added to the numerous other instances of lies or omissions , already mentioned in the recent past , they confirm , if confirmation was required , that the work of a Foundation which conceals or censors the reports of its own researchers is anything but " transparent " and honest .

Increased pollution has enhanced plant productivity , the report says Air pollution may be helping the fight against global warming by enhancing the ability of plants to absorb carbon dioxide , scientists say .
Since the 1960s , increased levels of atmospheric pollution have enhanced plant productivity by as much as one quarter , research has found .
In terms of carbon dioxide , this means that an extra 10 % has been stored in the soil .
The research was published in the scientific journal , Nature .
It is a common assumption that plants grow best in clear sunny weather , but scientists say this is not always the case .
Research has shown that forests and crops can also thrive in hazy conditions because clouds and particles in the atmosphere scatter sun light so that it bathes more leaves .
That enhances photosynthesis , the process by which plants turn light and carbon dioxide into food .
Global dimming Researchers have now analysed the impact on plants of the dimmer , hazier skies that have resulted from increases in air pollution around the world since the 1960s .
They have calculated that this so - called " global dimming " is responsible for increasing plant productivity by as much as one quarter from 1960 to 1999 .
Dr Lina Mercado from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology , the lead author of the study , said : " This resulted in a net 10 % increase in the amount of carbon stored by the land once other effects were taken into account , " she was quoted as saying by the Press Association .
This study highlights some of the complications that arise when we try to tackle global warming .
As the world attempts to reduce the amount of smog and particulates in the atmosphere to improve human health , it will require even greater efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide .
This new research shows that plants will simply not absorb as much carbon dioxide in cleaner air conditions .
The research will also add weight to arguments about geo-engineering , the idea of curbing global warming by adding reflective materials to the atmosphere .
US President Barack Obama 's chief scientific adviser , Professor John Holdren , recently told reporters that such ideas , once dismissed as half - baked , would have to be seriously discussed , such was the scale of the climate challenge .

The Pope does not get paid .
He is actually living on and is supported by the people in and out of the Vatican City State , and all his needs are catered by the people of the Papal Household .
If he wishes to spend on for example , a new set of Tridentine vestments , with a not - so - big embroidery of his papal seal , he must ask and he will get it depending upon the availability and the reason why he wants it .
He only receives paychecks for and from :
a. gift by some clergy or any person who wishes it to be directed at his expense , but I think he divides it for this and that
b. for his family in his place , either if they want it or not .
c. if he wishes to ask one , and give it to somebody else he wants ( like victims of calamities etc . )
but still it passes through the Papal Household .
X - Files Actress on Vaccines : Ignore the Stars Amanda Peet joins the fray in the public debate over childhood vaccination .
Aug. 15 , 2008  -- Actress Amanda
Peet is not the first celebrity to speak out on childhood vaccination .
But her message is clearly different from that of many other stars on the subject .
And on Tuesday morning , she shared this advice with the public on ABC's " Good Morning America " : the public might be better off to turn a deaf ear to celebrities when it comes to vaccines .
" It seems that the media is often giving celebrities and actors more authority on this issue than they are giving the experts , " Peet said .
" I know it 's a paradox , but that 's part of why I wanted to become a spokesperson , to say to people , ' Please do n't listen to me .
Do n't listen to actors .
Go to the experts . ' "
Peet also apologized again during her appearance for comments she made in the July issue of the parenting magazine Cookie in which she stated , " Frankly , I feel that parents who do n't vaccinate their children are parasites . "
" I did n't mean to show disdain , and I did and do apologize for the use of the word ' parasites , ' " she said .
" But I do in no way , shape or form retract my position or the meaning behind the use of the word , which is that if there are vast reductions in herd immunity , our children will be at risk . "
Peet has taken her message to the Internet , sharing her story on www.vaccinateyourbaby.org.
And the actress , who stars in the new movie " X - Files : I Want to Believe , " last month announced her support of the group Every Child By Two ( ECBT ) .
She is scheduled to be part of a panel on Aug. 5 to encourage parents to have their children receive all recommended vaccinations by the age of 2 .
Peet says her interest in vaccines began with the birth of her daughter , Frankie , on Feb. 23 , 2007 .
" When Frankie was born , I started to learn about vaccine safety , " she told ABCNews.com in an email message .
" The more I learned , the more I realized how much misinformation there is about vaccines . "
Amy Pisani , executive director of ECBT , says she hopes Peet 's advocacy is " a 100 percent antidote " to the position of former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy 's position that the current vaccine schedule places children at a higher risk of developing autism .
Pisani says that the issue is too important to be reduced to a showdown between celebrities .
" We do n't want it to be a fight between Jenny McCarthy and Amanda Peet , " she says .
" This is between scientists and the public . "
Still , the entrée of the latest celebrity voice into the vaccine debate has made waves online .
In a message on ECBT 's Web site , Peet says she made the decision to support the organization when she was pregnant .
" Many of our friends in Hollywood were choosing not to vaccinate their babies or to delay vaccines because they feared that they might cause autism or other disorders , " she notes in her message .
" We had never thought about not vaccinating , but when we went online to educate ourselves on vaccines , we found Web site after Web site warning us about their dangers .
Naturally , we were very concerned about what we read . "
Peet says her discussions with doctors at once allayed her fears and introduced her to the dangers of skipping vaccinations .
It is this platform that she has pushed in recent weeks -- and some of her comments have been a source of ire for those who believe there is a link between childhood vaccinations and autism .
In particular , Peet 's " parasite " comment has been a sore spot for many parents who believe in a vaccine - autism link .
Rebecca Estepp , parent support and media relations manager for the advocacy group Talk About Curing Autism ( TACA ) -- of which McCarthy is a spokeswoman -- says the star 's comments were out of line .
" I guess she 's calling me a parasite , because I did not vaccinate my second son because of what I saw happened to my first son , " says Estepp , who adds that her first child developed autism shortly after his vaccination .
Science as a Celebrity Cause ?
While celebrity advocacy of certain health causes is not a new phenomenon , having McCarthy and Peet squaring off over the vaccine debate has taken public interest in the issue to another level .
Dr. Paul Offit , chief of the section of infectious diseases at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , says much of this has to do with the fact that the public , as a whole is , in many ways , more eager to listen to celebrities than to researchers .
" I think when Jenny McCarthy appears on " Oprah " and says , ' I think vaccines harm our kids , ' that has an effect .
When Amanda Peet comes out and says , ' I believe the scientists on this , ' that also has an effect , " Offit says .
" It 's a culture of celebrity , and we tend to trust what celebrities tell us . "
Offit , a leading advocate of the current vaccine schedule , is the doctor whose advice Peet sought early in her search for information .
Peet met with Offit through her brother - in - law , who is a fellow in the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia 's division of infectious diseases .
And Offit says that what Peet learned about the risks of skipping vaccinations is what drove her to take action .
" It angered her , " he says .
" She felt like this , at some level , put her children at risk . "
As for McCarthy , Estepp says the former model approached TACA in 2005 after her own son had been diagnosed with autism .
" When [ her son ] got better , she said , ' I want to help , ' " Estepp says , adding that McCarthy 's advocacy grabbed the attention of other celebrities .
" It looks like Jenny 's story kind of sparked like wildfire through the Hollywood community . "
Offit , too , notes that Hollywood has become a major battleground in the vaccination debate .
And he says that while scientific evidence on the importance of vaccination is irrefutable , celebrity culture goes a long way in shaping public discourse on the topic .
" [ Peet ] lives , to some extent , in the California culture and knows that people like Jenny McCarthy are not the minority there , " he says .
But Peet says she bases her arguments for vaccination on the expertise of doctors and medical groups .
" I do n't think parents should be taking medical advice from actors , " she told ABCNews.com via email .
" I take medical advice from several pediatricians , other doctors , the CDC , and the American Academy of Pediatrics . "
Following Peet 's appearance on " Good Morning America , " the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement further clarifying its position on the matter .
" We know vaccines protect children against potentially deadly and disabling diseases , " the statement reads .
" Vaccine side effects are usually minor and include fever , mild swelling and pain at the injection site .
In unusual cases , such as when children are ill or have certain chronic conditions , a pediatrician will advise delaying or skipping certain vaccines .
" Many valid scientific studies have shown there is no link between vaccines and autism , " the statement continues .
" The American Academy of Pediatrics supports further research into the causes of autism in hopes this will lead to optimal strategies for prevention , diagnosis and treatment . "
Offit says
Peet 's approach sets her apart from other celebrities weighing in on the topic .
" [ Peet ] says , ' I 'm not a scientist ; you should n't even be listening to me , ' which is refreshing , " he says .
Beyond Celebrity , Debate Rages
While the participation of Peet and McCarthy in the vaccination debate may make waves among the public , their convictions are unlikely to sway those of medical experts and autism advocacy groups .
" The risks [ of skipping vaccinations ] became no longer theoretical with the recent measles outbreaks , which have sickened 127 children in 15 states , " Offit says .
" Measles makes you sick .
One out of every 1,000 kids who gets it dies from it , and one in five are hospitalized . "
" We do not endorse vaccination for all children , and with the present schedule , because of the lack of safety testing and the number of reports from parents about losing their child after vaccination , " counters Stan Kurtz , executive director of the advocacy group Generation Rescue , in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
" My child and Jenny McCarthy 's child included . "
But Offit says , no matter what science may say , there is little doubt that celebrity advocacy goes a long way in swaying public opinion -- and public health .
" We 're in an information age more than any other time in history , and I think that 's both good and bad , " he says .
" It 's good because we have a lot of information to work with , but it 's bad because some people think that 's enough to make them experts .
That 's not true here . "

CINCINNATI -- Oh-oh , Ocho. The Cincinnati Bengals ' top receiver has yet another name .
The NFL had agreed to let the player formerly known as Chad Johnson wear his new name on the back of his jersey this season .
There 's one catch for the receiver :
It 's not exactly how he wanted it .
Instead of Ocho Cinco , he 'll be " Ochocinco " because that 's how he wrote it when he submitted his name - change form last August in Florida .
" It 's his legal name , " AFC information manager Corry Rush said Thursday .
The receiver said last year that he wanted his name to be " Ocho Cinco . "
Neither he nor his agent returned phone messages Thursday to discuss the name being one word instead of two .
Shirts and other gear are selling on his Web site under the " Ocho Cinco " name .
Mr. Leylaz said that Mr. Moussavi ’s announcement to run came unexpectedly last week , even though Mr. Khatami had consulted with him before announcing his own bid for the office on Feb .
8 . Before the announcement , Mr. Khatami had said that he would run only if Mr. Moussavi did not , to avoid diluting the reformist vote .
“ Mr. Khatami was offended and felt betrayed , ” Mr. Leylaz said .
Mr. Khatami , 65 , won a landslide victory in 1997 and was in office for two terms until 2005 .
A charismatic leader , he was expected to draw considerable support in the coming election .
More than 20,000 supporters showed up at his speech last week in the southern city of Shiraz , despite government restrictions .
But Mr. Khatami also has strong enemies among politicians who oppose more political and social openness .
His reform agenda , which included an easing of tensions with the West , suffered major setbacks when he was in office .
Powerful hard - line institutions blocked many of his efforts , and many of his allies were jailed .
Mr. Moussavi was the country ’s prime minister from 1980 to 1988 .
He is well remembered by many Iranians for managing the country during its eight - year war with Iraq .
His presidential platform is not yet clear , but in the past he supported protectionist economic policies .
Mr. Moussavi , who is also a painter and architect , stayed out of politics for the past two decades and had turned down calls to run for president in previous elections .
Mr. Ahmadinejad is supported by the conservative Iranian establishment , but his economic policies have unleashed inflation of over 25 percent , and two major setbacks last week suggested that he might be losing support ahead of elections .
Last week , Parliament rejected a major element of his proposed budget to cut energy subsidies and to distribute the money directly among the poor .
Another reformist candidate , Mehdi Karroubi , has said that he will remain in the race .
Adding a kitchen tile backsplash to your kitchen will increase the value of your house and it will help update or add pizazz .
And the great thing is it can be done inexpensively .
So it does n’t matter what your budget is , there is a tile for everyone and every style out there .
But before you get to choosing a new kitchen tile backsplash design idea , you need to get a handle on the numbers .
On a super tight budget ?
Tile starts under .20 cents a piece at your local home improvement big box store .
The tools , thinset and grout will run close to $ 30 .
So depending on the size of your project you could get this job done spending well under $ 100 .
And it ’ll make a big change in your kitchen .
Need something done with tremendous ease , in addition to sticking to a tight budget ?
How about backsplash ideas that are doable in about an hour !
There a few basic styles of tile you have to choose from
1 ) Ceramic tile : often comes in shiny for those of you that like a semi or hi-gloss look to your kitchen .
It ’s one of the most inexpensive tile and it ’s super easy to clean .
Common sizes are 4×4 , 3×6 ( often referred to as subway tile ) , and 6×6 .
2 ) Porcelain tile : often comes in a matte finish and common styles look like natural stone .
so you get the natural look in a more stain resistant and often times less expensive tile .
sizes range from 6×6 to 18 ×18 .
Porcelain is also a more durable tile .
. . though on a backsplash that should n’t matter as much … since you are not walking directly on it .
3 ) Natural stone : available in many types and sizes .
Slate , Travertine , Marble , Granite and Limestone are just a few that have been favored in kitchens .
Great because of its natural look , no 2 are exactly the same .
They range in price from reasonable to expensive .
If you are budget conscience make sure you keep the price tag in sight before you fall in love .
4 ) Glass tile and metal tile : range in size from 1×1 mosaics to 8×8 tiles .
most common are on mosaic mesh though .
the glass and metal both can bounce around the light in the room helping to make the space open up and look bigger .
great in kitchens with no windows or natural light .
they also range in price from reasonable to oh my .
. . so once again make sure you keep that price in sight before you fall in love .
Often times people will use one of the other types of tiles as their main and only use glass metal and natural stone as accent pieces .
this way the cost is kept down a little , and you still get some of that look you were wanting .
There are a lot of styles out there and a lot of choices to make before you start tiling .
make sure you know what you ’re in for and get a look around at what ’s out there before you start your project .
there are many books and websites out there to help guide you .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The tech industry , once one of the hottest sectors for job seekers , is falling victim to dried up spending as the recession takes its toll .
After three years of at least 2.5 % employment growth in the United States , information technology ( IT ) jobs are forecast to decline by 1.2 % this year , according to Forrester Research .
They have already fallen by nearly 1 % since their November peak , according to the Labor Department .
Year to date , 8,000 tech jobs have been slashed , including 4,100 just last month .
" As the economic situation gets worse , more and more companies are getting into trouble , and they 're forced to cut ... ( tech ) spending , " said Arpitha Bykere , jobs analyst for RGE Monitor .
" We 'd expect to see a growing number of layoffs due to slowing sales at IT firms . "
Technology spending this year is expected to fall 3.8 % worldwide and 1.6 % in the United States , according to technology research firm Gartner .
That 's down significantly from 2008 , which saw a 6.1 % rise worldwide , and is nearly double the decline that occurred when the tech bubble burst in 2001 .
One of the reasons tech spending held up pretty well in 2008 was because of strong demand for just day - to - day needs , said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels .
At the same time , job growth was relatively modest , leaving little " fat " to trim as the recession started taking a toll .
As businesses reluctantly began to slash their technology budgets this year , many technology firms and those companies that employ their own tech staff have had no choice but to cut tech - related jobs .
That 's especially true for hard - hit industries like services and finance , which combine to employ 50 % of the nation 's technology professionals , according to Forrester .
" Certainly , reduced spending will have an effect on IT jobs everywhere , " said Ken McGee , a tech analyst for Gartner .
" We 've already begun to see it with many users and vendors . "
Some tech jobs still ' safe '
Not all tech jobs are cut from the same cloth -- they encompass everything from systems managers to computer programmers to " help desk " support staff .
For the most part , those whose work is essential to the daily operations of a business , like systems experts for networks and communication , are expected to have more job security than others , according to Forrester .
Very strong demand for communication , e-mail and video conferencing have put experts in those fields in high demand .
" Jobs for systems analysts and network analysts will buck the downward trend and continue to grow in 2009 , " said Bartels .
" The recession will cause a slowdown in job growth , but no downturn . "
But those who work in fields that are n't as crucial to the day - to - day business , like research and development or software engineering , are expected to face steeper cuts .
Help desk professionals are also expected to be among the first to get handed pink slips , as companies with large - scale layoffs need fewer tech support staff members .
" These roles are a bit of a luxury that both IT vendors and departments can afford in good times , but not so much in bad times , " Bartels said .
2010 recovery ?
There is a debate among experts about how quickly the sector will recover .
Some experts believe the recovery will be slow , as businesses exercise hiring caution even as economic conditions improve .
" The jobs recovery will be very sluggish and prolonged , because companies will continue with their cost - cutting strategy until they are convinced that consumer demand is back to stay , " said Bykere
But others say the trend will quickly and rapidly reverse in 2010 .
They argue that pent - up demand for technology projects will force companies to bring back spending to pre-2009 levels once the recession has ended , because businesses realize how integral technological innovation is to growth .
Furthermore , a recent Obama administration report forecasted the creation of 50,000 new tech jobs by the end of 2010 , thanks in large part to economic stimulus package incentives to digitize health records .
Accordingly , Gartner estimates that tech spending will snap back 3.4 % in the United States in 2010 and continue to rise through 2013 .
" There will be so much pent - up demand in IT that the ramp up factor will occur just as fast as the demise , " McGee said .
" Companies will quickly turn to green - light funding for IT during the recovery . "
( Adds Monsanto statement paragraphs 8 - 9 )
HAMBURG , May 5 ( Reuters ) - A German court on Tuesday rejected an urgent application from U.S. biotech company Monsanto to end Germany ’s ban on cultivation of Monsanto maize containing genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
Monsanto , the world ’s largest seed company , had requested an urgent decision to lift the ban imposed on April 14 by German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner stopping cultivation and commercial sale of Monanto ’s MON 810 GMO maize which prevented it being sown for this year ’s harvest .
The court in Braunschweig in north Germany rejected an application for an emergency ruling to overturn Aigner ’s decision so as to allow sowings for the 2009 crop .
Monsanto now has the option of taking normal legal action against the decision , the court said .
But there was no indication of when a decision on such action could be made .
A statement from the court said Germany ’s law on GMOs laid down that a ban on a new plant variety did not need to be justified by proven scientific research which showed without doubt the crop to be dangerous .
It was enough when research showed there were indications that the crop could be dangerous , the court said .
The court ruled that German authorities had not made an arbitrary or biased decision in imposing the ban .
Monsanto would consider further legal action against the ban , said the CEO of its German unit Ursula Luettmer - Ouazane .
The court had damaged the freedom of farmers to use new technology , she said in a statement .
The European Union had already approved the maize type as safe and studies quoted by the German government in making its ban had already been previously examined by the EU , she said .
MON 810 GMO maize is resistant to the corn borer , a moth whose caterpillars damage maize plantings , reducing yields .
The court statement added : “ There is no proven scientific evidence that the genetic maize could lead to increased danger to the environment . ”
“ But new studies could indicate that the poisonous substance ( generated by genetic mutation ) could not only have an impact on the pests which it is aimed at combating , but also on other insects . ”
On April 27 , Aigner allowed open air test cultivation of a potato containing GMOs developed by German chemicals group BASF , saying trials presented no threat to public health or the environment .
Pedro Pereira and I are working on a new project in the Masters .
The second half of the Masters is composed of a single project suggested by a company .
Some companies are forming partnerships in the Masters formal methods , including : the Critical software , SIG and Galois .
We chose the Galois because we also are in the area of cryptography and we already knew some work of some people from this company .
The project suggested by Galois was study the Cryptol as a language of specification of cryptographic algorithms .
The cipher we used for this study is the SNOW 3G ( The SNOW website ) , later on I will talk about the specification of this cipher .
In this post I am only interested to show the language .
I ’m going to show you some details about the language .
This post is not intend to be a exhaustive explanation of Cryptol , if you looking for that you can go directly to the manuals .
This post only relates my experience , and what I like it most with the language .
Overview
Cryptol is a high - level language that is geared to deal with low - level problems .
Is a Domain - specific language to design and implement cryptographic algorithms .
This language has a high percentage of correctness of the implementation of a cipher , because it implements type inference , so we can say that a big part of the language implements correctness .
This correctness is also achieved thanks to the architecture of the language – functional .
We do n’t have side effects – a function only return something inside is codomain .
In Cryptol we have this philosophy that says that everything is a sequence .
This is very useful because we are working with low level data ( array of bits ) , so we use sequences to represent that arrays .
We can have nested sequences to have a more structured representation of data .
For example , we can simply transform a 32 - bit sequence in a 4 1 - byte sequence .
The size of this sequences could be implemented as finite or infinite , as we going to see later in this post .
Because Cryptol is a high - level language we can also implement polymorphic functions , most of the primitive functions are implemented in polymorphic mode .
The way we have to navigate throw the sequences is using recursion , or sequences comprehension , and with these two techniques we can implement recurrences .
If you are a Haskell programmer you just need the next section to learn Cryptol .
This language is so look a like with Haskell that even the philosophy seems to have a lot in commune .
Types in Cryptol
The type means that you have a sequence of 32 - bit size .
All the types in Cryptol are size oriented .
The unit is the , that you can use to represent .
To represent a infinite sequence we use the reserved word , and we write : to represent that .
If you want to generate a infinite sequence , we use the syntactic sugar of the sequences like that : .
Cryptol will infer this sequence as type
That means this sequence have infinite positions of 1 - bit words .
The type inference mechanism will always optimize the size that he needs , to represent the information .
So , it infer the type of as :
Because , it “ knows ” that needs only 7 - bits to represent the decimal .
But if you need more , you can force the type of your function .
We implement polymorphism in our types , if we have :
This means , that the function have polymorphism over , because we say that it domain is one sequence of size of type , and it codomain also .
Here we could also see : meaning that is a constant of sequences of size of type , times .
So , lets talk about some primitive functions in Cryptol , and its types .
The function have the following type in Cryptol :
As we can see , Cryptol is so size oriented , that we can use arithmetic operators in types .
We can probably infer what this function does just from it type : works for all and such that if we have one sequence os size of type it returns one sequence of size of same type .
In fact this function removes the first element of one sequence .
Because of this size oriented philosophy a lot of functions , that change the size of the sequences can be read just from the type .
As you can see in the following list of Cryptol primitive function :
Recursion and Recurrence
Cryptol implements Recursion , just like a lot of functional languages do .
Imagine the fibonacci function definition :
It implementation in Crytol is exactly the same as defined mathematically .
fib : [ inf ] 32 -> [ inf ] 32 ; fib n = if n == 0 then 0 else if n == 1 then 1 else fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ;
Cryptol uses recursion to permit us to iterate throw sequences .
But ,
If you prefer you can implement a more functional algorithm of fibonacci function in Cryptol :
fib : [ inf ] 32 -> [ inf ] 32 ; fib n = fibs @ n ; where { fibs : [ inf ] 32 ; fibs = [ 0 1 ] # [ | x + y || x <- drop ( 1 , fibs ) || y <- fibs | ] ; } ;
Here , as you can see , we define a infinite list of all the fibonacci numbers , by calling the inside the sequences comprehension , this is called a recurrence , and you can use that too in Cryptol .
Cryptol vs C
I ’m going to show you some part of the implementation of SNOW 3G in C .
This is a function called
MULa : [ 8 ] -> [ 32 ] ; MULa( c ) = join ( reverse [ ( MULxPOW ( c , 23 :[ 32 ] , 0xA9 ) ) ( MULxPOW ( c , 245:[32 ] , 0xA9 ) ) ( MULxPOW (c , 48 :[ 32 ] , 0xA9 ) ) ( MULxPOW ( c , 239 :[ 32 ] , 0xA9 ) ) ] ) ;
/* The function MUL alpha .
Input c : 8 - bit input .
Output : 32 - bit output .
See section 3.4.2 for details .
\*/ u32 MULalpha( u8 c ) { return (((( u32 ) MULxPOW ( c,23 , 0xa9 ) ) << 24 ) | ( (( u32 ) MULxPOW ( c , 245,0xa9 ) ) << 16 ) | ( (( u32 ) MULxPOW ( c , 48,0xa9 ) ) << 8 ) | ( (( u32 ) MULxPOW ( c , 239,0xa9 ) ) ) ) ; }
You can see that in Cryptol we just say that we want to work with a 32 - bit word , and we do n’t need to do any shift to our parts of the word .
We just join them together .
We reverse the sequence , because Cryptol stores words in little - endian , and we want to keep the definition like the specification .
This is a very simple function , so the result in C is not so that different .
But if we have a more complex function , we were going to start having a nightmare to write that in C .
Conclusion
Well , the conclusion is that Cryptol is a language that really help to write low - level algorithms .
With Cryptol the specification is formal and easier to read than other languages .
A value of Cryptol is that the code can be converted to other languages , such as VHDL and C .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The FBI for the first time has placed an animal rights activist on the bureau 's " Most Wanted Terrorists " list .
Daniel Andreas San Diego is 31 years old and a " strict vegan , " the FBI says .
The FBI announced Tuesday the addition of Daniel Andreas San Diego to the list , hoping a burst of international publicity associated with the move will help investigators find him after six years on the run .
San Diego , 31 , may appear to be out of place on a terrorist list with familiar names like al Qaeda 's Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri and Adam Yahiye Gadahn .
The " strict vegan , " according to the FBI , is charged with bombing two corporate offices in California in 2003 .
The blasts caused extensive property damage but no deaths .
Vegans eat no meat or any other food containing animal products .
Authorities allege San Diego bombed facilities in Emeryville and Pleasanton , California , because he believed the Chiron and Shaklee Corporations had ties to animal - testing labs .
The sophisticated homemade bombs had ammonium nitrate brand explosives and relied on " kitchen timer style mechanical timer devices , " according to an FBI affidavit .
After both bombings , e-mails from a group called " The Revolutionary Cells - Liberation Brigade " claimed responsibility for the acts .
Photographs of San Diego , who grew up in suburban San Francisco , California , show a well - groomed , bespectacled man .
But the computer network specialist also sports several elaborate tattoos .
According to an artist 's rendering of the body art , San Diego has one in the center of his chest of a burning hillside and the words " It only takes a spark " in a typewriter - style font .
An abdominal tattoo shows burning and collapsing buildings , while his back features a leafless tree rising from a road above buildings that are burning but still standing , the FBI says .
Last year , agents pursued reports that San Diego was hiding in Costa Rica .
They also received a report he was spotted in rural southern Virginia .

The victory gives Federer his first title since Basle in October
World number two Roger Federer finally ended Rafael Nadal 's superb run on clay to win the Madrid Open and take his first title of the year .
The Swiss came through 6 - 4 6 - 4 in one hour 26 minutes for only his second win against Nadal in 11 attempts on clay .
Nadal needed four hours to win an epic semi-final against Novak Djokovic on Saturday , and looked flat in the final .
But Federer was clinical throughout until nervously fending off two break points when serving for the match .
The defeat is only Nadal 's fifth on clay in 155 matches since 2005 , brings an end to his run of 33 consecutive victories on the surface , and takes the head - to - head record against Federer to 13 - 7 in the Spaniard 's favour .
I 'm very , very happy that I stayed positive and I got the win I needed badly
Roger Federer
It also gives Federer and the other leading men hope going into the French Open , which begins next Sunday , but the Swiss does not expect four - time champion Nadal to be overly worried by a rare defeat .
" I do n't think he 's going to take any damage away from this , " said Federer .
" I 'm sure he 's going to be rock solid in Paris again . "
Nadal insisted : " Playing four hours was not a problem for today .
Roger was much better than me and deserved to win . "
Federer 's only previous win over Nadal on the surface came two years ago in Hamburg , renowned as the fastest of the major clay tournaments .
Madrid replaced Hamburg in the schedule this year and also took on the mantle of fastest clay event because of the Spanish capital 's high altitude .
There was no sign of the extra pace helping Federer in the early stages of Sunday 's final as he held off two break points in his first three service games , but the Swiss worked his way into the match and earned a break point of his own at 4 - 4 .
606 : DEBATE
I think Roger will finally have some confidence heading towards the french that he actually has half a chance of beating Rafa
dalglish_in_disguise
Nadal faltered first in a tight rally , hooking a poor backhand into the net to give a pumped up Federer the initial breakthrough and the Swiss served out the set to love in 40 minutes .
And the home crowd was stunned into almost total silence when Federer earned another break point at 2 - 2 in the second with a superb drop shot , before Nadal sent a backhand long to fall behind again .
The Swiss calmly served his way towards victory until a nervous final game , which saw Nadal make two errors on break - back points before Federer netted a volley on his first match point .
Unlike in Saturday 's semi-final , when Nadal saved three match points , there was to be no comeback this time as Federer slammed down an ace on his second match point .
" I thought I took all the right decisions today and in the end it looked pretty comfortable so it was a perfect win for me , " Federer said afterwards .
" I 'm very , very happy that I stayed positive and I got the win I needed badly because I 've had some rather bad losses this year .
It 's very satisfying . "
Madrid was hosting the high - profile clay - court tournament for both men and women for the first time , but some players complained about the standard of the practice courts and dressing rooms at the much - heralded new Magic Box facility .
Tournament promoter Ion Tiriac said : " It 's my fault the courts are not perfect .
I hope next year the courts are going to be perfect .
" There was also a big discussion about dressing rooms .
Up to a certain point they are right .
My fault again .
" Give me two years and we 'll discuss once again .
Definitely whatever is wrong just throw it back to me . "

Mr. Obama continued on the offensive against straw men that day in Los Angeles , pointing out that critics told him not to go on “ The Tonight Show With Jay Leno ” on NBC because “ I ca n’t handle that and the economy at the same time . ”
Then , his audience primed , he delivered his standard kill line : “ Listen , here ’s what I say .
I say our challenges are too big to ignore . ”
And who can argue with that ?
Like most straw men , Mr. Obama ’s are not complete fabrications .
White House officials correctly pointed out that Senator Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona , took a crack at Mr. Obama for appearing on the Leno show , saying that his “ suggestion is that he come back , since he ’s taken full responsibility , and get his people together ” to confer on the budget .
But that is still a ways from the tortuous construct which Mr. Obama ended up with , that turned Mr. Kyl ’s remark into one that somehow needed the “ our challenges are too big to ignore ” rebuttal , since it suggests that one of those challenges was apparently appearing on Leno .
“ Here ’s the trick : Take your opponent ’s argument to a ridiculous extreme , and then attack the extremists , ” said William Safire , the former presidential speechwriter who writes the “ On Language ” column for The New York Times Magazine .
“ That leaves the opponent to sputter defensively , ‘ But I never said that . ’ ”
After a couple of betas , IE8 was finally released last month including version 5.8 of its JScript engine .
The main enhancements of the scripting engine are : JSON support , performance optimizations , ECMA 3 compatibility , a profiler plus a debugger .
Native JSON support .
The IE team boasts as having the first browser which implements JSON natively .
This significantly improves the serialization / deserialization process and is considered more secure having better protection against code injection and bad data .
Performance optimization .
One of the main problems developers complained about was string concatenation which has been addressed and is several times faster compared to previous JScript versions .
Array operations have been also optimized for speed .
The engine is now 2.5 times faster according to Greg Badros , Senior Director of Engineering , Google :
Some of the tests we have done show pure JScript performance improvements up to 2.5 times .
Key gains are in strings .
We also measured the performance gains on common Gmail operations , like loading the inbox ( 24 % ) , opening a conversation ( 35 % ) and opening a thread ( 25 % ) compared to IE7 .
Compatibility with ECMA 3 .
One of the main problems was full compatibility with ECMAScript 3 ( PDF ) .
The compatibility issues found have been gathered in a public document ( PDF ) and they are supposedly fixed as the IE team promised .
The circular memory leak .
While this problem started to be addressed in 2007 , it was fixed starting with IE8 Beta 1 in the COM infrastructure , according to Shreesh Dubey , Product Unit Manager , JScript :
We took a hard look at this problem and realized that this has to be fixed at the COM infrastructure .
We implemented a design that bridges the gap between COM ref-counting and automatic garbage collection models .
We extended the IDispatchEx interface to enable COM clients to simultaneously live in both the ref-counted and garbage collected worlds .
Profiler and Debugger .
IE Developer Tools now have an integrated JScript profiler and also a debugger .
SHANGHAI 
In another indication that China is growing increasingly concerned about holding huge dollar reserves , the head of its central bank has called for the eventual creation of a new international currency reserve to replace the dollar .
In a paper released Monday , Zhou Xiaochuan , governor of the People ’s Bank of China , said a new currency reserve system controlled by the International Monetary Fund could prove more stable and economically viable .
A new system is necessary , he said , because the global economic crisis has revealed the “ inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system . ”
While few analysts believe that the dollar will be replaced as the world ’s dominant foreign exchange reserve anytime soon , the proposal suggests that China is preparing to assume a more influential role in the world .
Russia recently made a similar proposal .
The latest April U.S. game sales have revealed Guerrilla Games ' debuting outside the Top 20 and selling 58,000 copies for the month , NPD has told Gamasutra , as it slows to 677,000 lifetime U.S. sales .
As part of the exclusive statistics provided to Gamasutra in its April 2009 NPD analysis , the key PlayStation 3 - exclusive title , which debuted on February 27th , is still selling solidly , but at reduced numbers compared to its first two months .
Even releasing so late in February , the title reached No.5 on the February 2009 NPD chart , selling 323,000 units , many of them likely in pre-orders from major retailers such as GameStop .
In March , it continued strong sales , making No. 7 on the chart with 296,000 units sold in the United States , but an overall slow April has majorly reduced its sell - through , dropping it out of the Top 20 .
As part of its responses to March 's NPD numbers , Sony announced that sales of the title had reached 1 million worldwide , and was the fastest Sony - published title in the U.S. to reach 500,000 unit sales .
The company particularly commented that " has garnered the biggest initial success at retail of any first party PS3 title to date , and will continue to drive incentive for hardware sales throughout the year .
" However , overall April 2009 sales were down 17 % , with the PlayStation 3 selling just 127,000 units for the month , compared to 340,000 units of the Wii and 175,000 units for the Xbox 360 .
Therefore , it seems that the global recession and the hardware 's slowdown -- as well as the slowdown of the built - up wave of pre-orders for -- has slowed the system - seller outside of the Top 20 , at least for now .
McCarthy 's Elephant language proposal was mentioned here several times in the past .
This talk from Etech provides a nice introduction to the fundamental idea behind Elephant and its background .
The talk includes interesting , though not entirely motivated , comments related to the paper Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines .
This is one of McCarthy 's most significant papers in my opinion , and deserves more attention and debate .
It is also rather amusing .
I hope I will find the time some day to put this paper in context ( McCarthy 's comments in the Etech talk notwithstanding ) , but for the time being I recommend it to anyone interested in this sort of thing .
One thing is for sure :
We can safely add to the 2009 predictions the prediction that Elephant will not be ready in 2009 ...

Charles Barkley Almost Kills A Spectator Golfing
Maybe it is true that every day you learn something new .
Today ’s lesson ?
If you are within 125 feet of a golfing Charles Barkley ( we estimate that to be as far as he can shoot ) , you should be considered “ at - risk . ”
Although some may have known this before , we all certainly do now !
Charles Barkley recently attended the Regions Charity Golf Classic in Alabama ( it must be Barkley ’s day ) .
After a few warm - ups he says “ Man I ’m gonna hit it to the concession stands , ” and takes a swing ( if that ’s what you want to call that ) , and drills the ball off the neck of a spectator .
After the man goes down to a knee , a young Alabama fan looks on worried .
Poor kid is much to young to understand how someone can be so bad in a sport .
But now that I think of it , I still do n’t understand that .
If there was ever a reason for Barkley to quit golfing , this would be it .
However , it is doubtful that will work .
Until then , can we at least get the fans to take a few steps back when he if at the tee .
Realistically , the man video recording the footage appeared to be directly in Barkley ’s line of fire .
As it turned out , he was .

Many supporters of reform in Iran are said to use the Facebook site
Iran has restored access to Facebook , the social networking site which had been blocked since Saturday .
Media close to reformists had suggested the site was suspended to prevent its use by backers of presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
On Monday President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sidestepped questions about whether the authorities had ordered the blocking ahead of the 12 June election .
He said officials had no need to shut down any sites .
' Disappointment '
Correspondents say websites like Facebook have become an important way for candidates to mobilise younger voters in Iran ahead of the election .
Facebook , which says it has 175 million users worldwide , had expressed its disappointment over the disruption .
It said the problems had come " at a time when voters are turning to the internet as a source of information about election candidates and their positions " .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , a former prime minister , is seen as one of the leading challengers to the incumbent , President Ahmadinejad .
Other candidates are a former speaker of parliament , Mehdi Karroubi , and an ex-head of the Revolutionary Guards , Mohsen Rezai .
On Tuesday , writing for The Bulwark , conservative editor Jonathan Last tore into President Donald Trump 's performance at the first presidential debate on Tuesday evening in Cleveland .
" Honestly : I can not understand how anyone with an IQ over 80 could have watched this disgrace and not come away understanding that the president of the United States is a sociopath , " wrote Last .
" But I ’ll try to put myself in the mind of voters and tell you what I saw . "
" He was a doughy , orange honey - badger , yelling , shouting , cajoling , needling and — this is the important part — never shutting up , " wrote Last .
" If you are a fan of the Trump lifestyle brand — if you have a Trump flag on your boat and wear a MAGA hat because you love pissing off the brown girl with the nose ring at Starbucks — then I suspect that you thought this was the greatest performance by any debater in the history of debates ...
On the other hand , it ’s not clear to me that Trump ’s act was effective with undecided voters . "

Seafaring adventure has sad end - but all safe SHIPWRECK
The Princess TaiPing sails off the coast of Taiwan .
Eleven crew members of a 54 - foot wooden Chinese junk were rescued after a freighter rammed into the replica vessel , splitting it in half off the coast of Taiwan , relatives of crew members from Hawaii said Monday , April 27 , 2009 .

The Chinese junk Princess Taiping paused at San Francisco last fall at the midpoint of a historical adventure - a round trip across the Pacific to show that Asian sailors might have reached North America before Columbus .
The adventure came to a sad end Sunday morning in the ocean off Taiwan when the 54 - foot vessel , built to the specifications of a Ming Dynasty ( 1368 -1644 ) war junk , was hit by a large freighter and sunk .
The 11 Princess Taiping crew members survived .
The large ship did not stop or render assistance .
The Princess Taiping was only hours away from completing an 14,000 - mile voyage .
Nelson Liu , the captain , said he felt " more than regret .
" We were less than 30 miles from the end of the voyage , " he said by phone from Taipei .
" But I still feel lucky that everyone survived .
It was a miracle .
God or Buddha kept us alive . "
The big ship hit the wooden junk amidships , splitting it in half .
The crew clung to the wreckage .
Liu said the other ship hung around awhile , then steamed off .
However , the Princess Taiping 's emergency beacon sent out a signal , which was picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard in Los Angeles and relayed to Taiwan authorities , who sent a helicopter and a rescue ship .
One of the crew members , an American named Thomas Cook , suffered neck injuries , but the rest had only minor injuries or were unhurt .
Six of the 11 crew members were Americans who joined the junk when it called at Honolulu in December ; two were Japanese ; two were from Taiwan and one from China .
Endangered species are “ breathing a sigh of relief today ” with the announcement that President Obama will issue a presidential memorandum reversing a December 2008 Bush administration decision that “ eviscerated ” the Endangered Species Act .
The move will restore a longstanding and key protection of the ESA , stripped away by the Bush administration , that required federal agencies to consult with independent federal wildlife experts and scientists to determine how their actions would impact threatened or endangered species .
“ Bringing science back into decision - making ”
Carl Pope , the Sierra Club ’s executive director , issued a statement saying that the Bush rules “ would have allowed agencies with little or no wildlife expertise to make decisions that could mean life or death for animals like the polar bear .
When it comes to protecting wildlife , we should listen to the scientists who spend their lives studying these animals , ” adding that “ President Obama is bringing science back into decision - making . ”
House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall ( D - W.V. ) , who had been actively seeking to reverse Bush ’s decision through the legislative process , also applauded Obama ’s decision :
“ I wholeheartedly support the president ’s proposal to restore the protections for endangered species that the Bush administration spent so many years trying to undermine . ”
“ It is one more indication that the new administration truly represents change for the better and is committed to the protection of our natural resources and our environment .
I think we know who would have been the winner in this fox guarding the hen house scenario advanced by the Bush administration , and it would not be the hens . ”
Speaking from Department of Interior headquarters today , where he helped the agency celebrate its 160th birthday , president Obama said that “ the work of scientists and experts in my administration , including right here in the Interior Department , will be respected .
For more than three decades , the endangered species act has successfully protected our nation ’s most threatened wildlife .
We should be looking for ways to improve it , not weaken it . ”

After hours of hearing arguments in the case questioning the legality of the ban on same - sex marriages in California , in the United States , the state 's Supreme Court deferred ruling on the ban , known as Proposition 8 .
The court could issue a ruling in the next 90 days .
Opponents of the ban were fighting to have the law overturned — saying it was unconstitutional for the state to have banned same - sex marriages .
Californians voted in November 2008 to ban same - sex marriages , leaving the nearly 20,000 married same - sex couples wondering if their marriages , which were legal at the time they were married , would be voided .
" Prop 8 opponents would have the court choose between the inalienable right to marry and the right of the people to change the constitution as they see fit , and what I 'm picking up from the oral argument in this case is this court should willy - nilly disregard the will of the people , " Justice Joyce Kennard said while addressing Shannon Minter , the lawyer representing the opponents of the ban .
One of the petitioners in the case against Proposition 8 , Robin Tyler , told Reuters that she thinks " they [ the court ] are going to uphold our marriages and they are going to uphold Proposition 8 , and it's a loss . "
In June 2008 , the state supreme court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional .
Between that time , and November 2008 , 18,000 same - sex couples were legally married in California .
Currently in the United States , same - sex marriages are only legal in Connecticut and Massachusetts .

If Mike Tomich is to be believed , coloring , video games and keyboard use are crippling our children .
According to Tomich , each of these activities is responsible for deforming the youngin's hands .
FOREVER .

Take a look at mine .
Just awful .
I started playing Super Mario Bros. in ' 86 , and my digits just went downhill from there .
I write for Gizmodo on Sundays in constant pain , but my love for the craft , and you , gives me the strength to tell this sobering story .
I started writing that warning on the little card at 10 a.m this morning , if that tells you anything .
Tomich , armed with a quiver full of photos with lines drawn on them , takes the video games industry , Congress , and even the OLPC project to task for ruining hands and fingers with their skeleton - deforming devices and policies .

To his credit , Tomich does n't ask that we drop technology or Crayola for good .
He only asks that we ban children from playing any kind of video game until age eight , and that we deny them the pleasure of coloring inside the lines up until age 5 .
" Children develop the injuries because their bones are too soft ( not calcified hard ) and readily yield to the strong repeating forces , " writes Tomich on his web site ( itself the result of 5 1/2 years of unofficial research ) .
" The permanent and accumulative damage from these forces is silently inflicted without pain because of the numbing effects they deliver to the soft bones . "
The results of premature gaming can be seen in these pictures , which purportedly show curved fingers — some allegedly the result of only three months of playing Nintendo 64 .
I 've never heard of this before , but Tomich does call it a " Silent Epidemic , " so maybe that 's why .
Can anyone provide a little more medical info on whether this is bunk science or not ?
Having typed , colored or played games from pretty much age 3 , I 'm a prime candidate for this , and yet my hands , arms and everything else feels fine .
Weird .
P.S. Yes , that last sentence means my earlier one about feeling excruciating pain while writing here was a lie .
However , I still write for you .

The Supreme Court put a new limit on police searches of cars Tuesday , saying that “ countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation ” have had their vehicles searched in violation of their rights .
In a 5 - 4 decision , the justices set aside a 1981 opinion that had given police broad authority to search cars whenever they made an arrest .
Instead , the justices said that an arresting officer could search a vehicle only if weapons were potentially in reach of the suspect or if there was reason to believe that the car contained evidence related to the arrest .
For example , if the driver was arrested in a drug crime , the car could be searched for drugs .
Justice John Paul Stevens , speaking for the court , said that merely arresting a driver does not “ provide a police entitlement ” to search the vehicle without a warrant .
Advertisement
He said the court ’s past rulings had given police too much leeway , allowing them to search cars even when there was no threat to officers ’ safety .
For example , if a motorist was handcuffed and put in a patrol car , there was no danger that he could reach a weapon in his car .
The lineup behind Stevens was unusual .
Justices Antonin Scalia , David H. Souter , Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg formed the majority .
The case arose when Rodney Gant was arrested in Tucson for driving with a suspended license .
His car was parked in his driveway , and officers handcuffed Gant and put him in a patrol car .
Then they searched the car and found a gun and cocaine in a jacket in the back seat .
Gant was convicted on drug charges , but the Arizona Supreme Court threw out evidence on the grounds that the search of his car without a warrant was unreasonable .

The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that decision Tuesday in Arizona vs. Gant .
The dissenters , led by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. , said the court should have stuck with the old rule that permitted vehicle searches whenever a driver or an occupant was arrested .

Ashley Swendsen , 26 years old and nearly six months pregnant , was chased into traffic by a bear as she went for a walk during her lunch hour in Colorado Springs Thursday .
A car brushed her to the ground and the driver slowed as Swendsen screamed that she was being chased by a bear .
But the driver , an older woman , sped off and the three cars behind it passed by as well , said Swendsen , reached by cell phone at the hospital .
Her physical injuries are believed to be minor , but the nervousness was still evident in her voice as she waited to see a doctor at about 4 p.m .
As the bear first appeared about 2 feet away from her on a hiking trail between the Vincent Drive Bridge and Interstate 25 , she said “ I thought … ‘ what am I going to do ? ' ”
She walked quickly for a few seconds before her fear overcame her and she began to run .
The 4 - foot - tall brown bear galloped behind her for about 20 seconds until she reached the roadway at 1005 Garlock Way .
“ I started screaming for help , but nobody could hear me , ” she said .
Wildlife officers soon located and killed the female bear .
No cubs were found nearby .
Swendsen said she was going to see its body after she was checked out at the hospital .
Colorado Springs police are still looking for the hit - and - run driver , a woman likely to be in her 70s driving a black four - door Mitsubishi sedan .

When I went to law school , it absolutely shocked me to learn how much the legal academy despises legal practitioners .
In fact , laypeople might not know that for those who aspire to teach in a law school , it is considered to be a negative to have “ too much ” practice experience .
The conventional wisdom is that once you ’ve practiced for three years , that ’s all you need in order to be a professor .
More than that , and you ’re considered to be “ too experienced . ”
Less than that , however , is just fine .
Go poke around some law school websites and look at the C.V.s of law professors .
You may find some experience there , but you ’ll be shocked at how many people with a few months of experience practicing law are responsible for training the next generation of lawyers .
We do n’t teach you how to practice law .
We teach you how to “ think like a lawyer . ”
PFFFFFT !
One infamous quote that gets batted around the practical blawgosphere is this one :
We do n’t want law school to be lawyer - training school .
When we cave in to demands of that sort from the ABA and assorted study commissions , we actually invite alienation among law students and lawyers .
Legal education should appreciate the depth of the legal discourse and explore its rich complexities .
It should operate on a graduate - school level and graduate people truly learned in the law .
– Marquette Prof. David Papke .
Papke took a beating for this from the practical blawgosphere .
See , e.g. , Greenfield , Gideon , Tannenbaum , and Bennett .
Of course , no full - time law professors criticized him .
Nobody wants to upset the academic apple cart — more appropriately described as a circle jerk .
Is it any wonder then that law schools do n’t usually teach law students jack about how to practice law ?
Can you imagine any other profession where it would be a bona fide occupational requirement that you should be relatively ( if not entirely ) inexperienced in whatever it is you are teaching ?
As Tannenbaum put it :
In medical school we teach students about the body , its organs , how it works , how it reacts to certain factors , and what causes disease and sickness .
Then the “ doctors ” do a “ residency ” where they focus on the practicalities of “ doctoring . ”
In law , we give “ lawyers ” a degree , that they can immediately frame , hang up in an office and greet unknowing clients .
The law school having “ done their job . ”
Some law schools embrace clinical programs and practical education , others , believe that a practicing lawyer is evidence of the failure of the law school ’s education .
Apparently the people trying cases and arguing motions are not well versed in the law .
They ’re “ just lawyers . ” ( source )
With this as an introduction to the legal academy , there are a couple of stories going around in which the legal academy either acknowledges its uselessness , or it damn well ought to .
At least to those of you outside the bubble , it should demonstrate that legal education is broken and should be completely overhauled and reinvented .
Go Solo —
Even though we did n’t teach you a damn thing !
A dispatch laugh from the guild of “ I do n’t know how to do it , but I ’ll teach others how . ”
At least one law school is suggesting that students consider going solo after graduation .
Back in the “ good old days , ” ( last year ) law students went to law school for three years .
While at law school , ( for the most part ) they attended lectures by , by and large , professors who never practiced law .
They learned nothing .
After three years , some law firm picked up that student on the basis of his grades in his “ think like a lawyer ” classes , and then gave him two years worth of paid training until he had a clue how to practice law .
That ’s how I became a lawyer .
When I got my shiny new Georgetown Law degree , but had absolutely no clue how to draft a notice of appearance .
I had no idea how to bill a client .
My memos of law were like law review articles .
My client letters were even worse .
A client would ask a simple question and get a 10 page , well - written and well - researched treatise on the issue – but that is n’t what a client is looking for .
Fortunately , I had patient mentors who told me “ forget all the crap you learned in law school , we will teach you how to be a lawyer now . ”
Unfortunately , the legal profession is in a state of free - fall because clients have gotten sick of paying for first - year associate billing when the first - year associate does n’t know a damn thing about how to practice law .
Clients are , correctly , saying that they should n’t have to pay to train new lawyers .
So clients do n’t want to pay to train them , but the law schools do n’t want to train them either .
So , they tell them to go solo !
Should we really turn out a few thousand solo practitioners a year who have been taught by those who could n’t hack it as practitioners ?
Then what ?
Just have them “ figure it out ” on their own ?
This all as a reaction to the glut of lawyers created by — you guessed it , the academy .
I have news for the academy .
If they want to turn out solos ( which is n’t a bad idea ) they had better get over this idea that law schools are not lawyer - training schools .
That is precisely what they should be — or they should be shut the hell down .
I ’m trying to do my part , but I am only one professor .
In my classes , I require students to do projects like ( gasp ) client advice letters .
I also require my students to submit bills with each assignment .
When I have pro-bono cases , I try and drag in as many students as I can to help out .
In other words , I try and turn my classes into lawyer training , despite the fact that some would call this blasphemy .
When you learn how to be a doctor , you work on cadavers until you learn how to work on real people .
When you learn to fly a plane , you spend some time in the simulator .
If you want to be a lawyer , you still need to attend law school .
Unfortunately , most of the legal academy does n’t think it should stoop to actually teaching students how to be lawyers .
Even if law schools wanted to , how could they ?
The majority of tenured law professors do n’t know how to be lawyers either .
With that kind of “ training , ” dumping hundreds of clueless solos on the market will result in : 1 ) an avalanche of legal malpractice suits ; 2 ) a hailstorm of unethical and unprofessional behavior by solos who lack the institutional mentors to teach them better ; and , 3 ) a swarm of unsupportable litigation by desperate solos who are just trying to pay the rent .
Oh , but for $ 41,500 , we ’ll train you now .
One law school has reacted to the economic collapse by offering law students one more year of law school .
Yes , for the bargain basement price of $ 41,500 , and another year of your life , UCLA will actually teach students what they THOUGHT they were getting for the first three years of tuition payments — how to practice law .
In response to the changing employment situation for graduates of U.S. law schools , UCLA School of Law announced today that it is reopening its LL.M. program application process for the 2009 - 10 academic year , and will accept up to 20 additional students who are graduates of U.S. law schools , including deferred hires .
The newly admitted LL .M.s will have the option of participating in the new Transition to Practice program , which will focus on enhancing the practical skills and development of the new lawyer .
The program will replicate significant parts of the learning that comes in the first year of practice , but in a controlled learning environment .
( source )
An LLM to teach you how to practice ?
This is what the students should have been getting all along for the cost of their JD !
This new “ program ” at UCLA is an admission that law school is severely broken .
Many people already say that law school is a year too long .
I partially agree .
It is a scam .
You spend three years of your life and $ 120,000 to take law classes from people who , by and large , have no idea how to practice law .
After those three years , you are n’t even prepared to take the BAR EXAM !
You have to spend the next summer , and another couple thousand dollars , taking a bar preparation course .
$ 120,000 and most law schools do n’t even bother to teach you how to pass the bar ( my school does have a bar prep course ) .
Those that do are mocked by the “ prestigious ” end of the academy .
So now UCLA is going to let you pay for yet another year of school , after you ’ve paid for your JD and your bar preparation course , to “ replicate significant parts of the learning that comes in the first year of practice , but in a controlled learning environment . ”
Three questions :
1 ) Why the hell is n’t UCLA , and every other law school , already doing that for their students ?
This is the very thing that the academy has rejected for years …
I guess if you ’ll pay them for another year , they ’ll lower themselves to such pedestrian pursuits .
2 ) I wonder who UCLA is going to get to teach in this LLM program .
Their best professor , Eugene Volokh , did n’t even know about the plan .
And , as much as I admire him ( if I were President , he would be my first choice to fill a Supreme Court vacancy ) , I ’m not sure how much practical experience even he has .
If the LLM program is nothing more than a few more full - time , “ I practiced for 13 months and then clerked for a judge and now I teach theory and write law review articles ” types , I ca n’t see how it will be remotely useful .
3 ) What kind of an abject fool would actually pay to attend this program ?
Honestly , anyone with this LLM on their resume should be blackballed as someone too incompetent to be a lawyer in the first place .
Anyone with the poor judgment to pay an ADDITIONAL $ 41,500 to “ replicate significant parts of the learning that comes in the first year of practice , but in a controlled learning environment ” is a complete asshat , and I would n’t want them handling my parking tickets — let alone my valuable legal work .
They will be paying $ 41,500 to get less experience and practical training than they could get for free from an unpaid internship in a law office .
What if they ca n’t find an internship ?
If you graduate with a JD and you ca n’t find someone to hire you FOR FREE , then the market has spoken .
You should be doing something with your life , but practicing law is NOT it .
But , have no fear : I have an alternative !
Announcing the “ Practical LLM Program in First Amendment , Intellectual Property , and Internet Law ”
If you are a prospective UCLA LLM student , send me a copy of your resume and a cover letter .
I only require that you delete any reference to which law school you attended from your resume , because I do n’t think that alma mater means jack .
I ’m not impressed by my own , and I ’m certainly not going to be impressed by yours .
If you are accepted to the program , I will let you work in my office as an associate attorney ( you ’ll need to pass the Florida or Massachusetts bar first ) .
I ’ll teach you how to practice law in a REAL learning environment ( none of this “ controlled ” bullshit ) .
I ’ll not only teach you how to actually draft pleadings , do real legal research , actually litigate and / or do transactional work , but I ’ll also teach you how to talk to a client , develop clients , and how to practice with ethics so that you do n’t develop a reputation for being a douchebag .
Even better , I ’ll have you work on a few pro-bono free speech cases that I might not have otherwise taken .
At the end of the year , I guarantee you that you ’ll be MUCH better prepared to practice law than any donkey who spent $ 41,500 at UCLA , AND you ’ll have one year ’s worth of experience on your resume .
Plus , I can assure you that you will work on at least one really fun free speech case .
If you are selected , tuition for this program is $ 20,750 ( half UCLA ’s tuition ) .
For that price , you will get your own office , your name on the door , and all of your overhead covered .
You will be expected to generate at least $ 80,000 in collections — as the overhead for a new attorney is about $ 100,000 .
If you do n’t have the money up front , never fear .
I can put you on a payment program , and I ’ll let you work a flexible schedule so that you can have another part time paying job .
However , you ’ll need a sizable portion up front , and if you are late on your payments , you ’ll be expelled .
After six months , if you are showing a profit , you ’ll start getting paid a salary based on your profitability .
If you can demonstrate adequate progress , talent , ethics , sense of humor , financial success , and future promise during that year , I will guarantee you a job as as an associate for at least one more year once you finish the program .
That year WILL be a paid gig .
Your salary will be based on your performance during the “ LLM program . ”
Even better than that , if you show that you can make it rain ( and I ’ll teach you how to do that too ) , you very well may become a partner with me .
You know how long that will take ?
As long as it takes you to prove to me that it will be more profitable to be your partner than to lose you .
Any takers ?
Operators are standing by .

In his new book on global warming , the distinguished sociologist Anthony Giddens coins a paradox .
What he helpfully calls Giddens 's Paradox runs thus : however massive the dangers posed by climate change , their lack of immediate visibility in daily life means many people will do nothing concrete to tackle it ; by the time they are prompted to action it will , by definition , be too late .
Other issues are semi-invisible to the naked eye but huge in their consequences .
It has been apparent for years that our energy infrastructure needs renewal and yet , as we report today , business leaders warn that ministers are still not doing enough to ensure the UK does not run out of power .
Today 's energy strategy from the Confederation of British Industry is not averse to a plea for a subsidy here and a sop there .
Ministers should approve new coal plants , it says , even without carbon capture and storage .
One can not blame business lobby groups for lobbying .
Where the CBI certainly is right is in pointing out that renewing our energy infrastructure offers an important route to move the economy to a lower - carbon footing .
After all , nearly 40 % of Britain 's carbon emissions come from electricity generation .
Yet the credit crunch is having a particularly disastrous impact on the renewables industry , which is struggling to raise finance .
Even big players are pulling in their horns .
Last week BP announced that it is to cut 620 jobs from its solar energy business .
The company 's " Beyond Petroleum " slogan should be revised - " Back to Petroleum " would now be more appropriate .
Markets do not ever do the long term especially well , but they get particularly myopic during a crisis .
This poses a particular problem for Labour , which has long favoured a private led approach to both energy provision and to adapting to climate change .
Worryingly , there was little sign of this altering at last week 's G20 summit .
True , there were the necessary warm words in the communique .
But a summit that was supposed to define the terms on which the world economy is to be rebuilt has ducked the toughest challenge - how to reconcile prosperity with environmental security .
The same is true of the fiscal stimulus being launched by so many countries .
Much of the money is being burned trying to reheat the old , carbon - intensive economy .
For every South Korea , which claims 81 % of its stimulus is green , there is a Britain , at just 7 % .
That pathetic figure is half the world average .
Amid a market crisis , the UK government is still failing to assume a leadership role .
This must change - and soon .
Taken to its logical conclusion , Giddens 's Paradox does not point to a happy ending .
Jim Tedisco finally conceded and it's official .
The GOP 's ship has sunk completely .
GOP congressional candidate Jim Tedisco has conceded the congressional race in the 20th district .
Tedisco moments ago called Democrat Scott Murphy to concede and Murphy has declared victory .
Murphy will be issuing a press release shortly , and will organize a press event with volunteers tomorrow in Glens Falls .
The location has not yet been determined .
Here 's the DCCC 's remarks :
“ In trying to win the NY - 20 special election , the RNC , NRCC , and their Republican allies went all in on the losing gamble that voters would prefer their ‘ just say no ’ approach to President Obama ’s bold plans to get the economy back on track .
“ Scott Murphy ’s victory in this district where Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 70,000 represents a rejection of the obstructionist agenda and scare tactics that have become the hallmark of House Republicans .
This race should never have been close , but to think Murphy beat Tedisco in a mostly Republican district is stunning .
He was up by over 20 points before they turned into the Limbaugh National Committee and Michael Steele and the GOP started blocking everything President Obama tried to do .
Do n't forget , there were ads there targeted at Limbaugh and they did not disappoint .
As for Steele , has the Death Watch begun ?
I wrote this a little while ago .
The latest word on the street is that if he fails to deliver NY - 20 , a Republican district , he will be ousted , but Tedisco has a solid lead in the polls .
According to multiple former high - level RNC staffers familiar with the dynamics involved , Steele is unlikely to survive in the post if favored Republican Jim Tedisco loses his open - seat race to Democrat Scott Murphy .
The special election , scheduled for March 31 , is to fill a vacancy left when Kirsten Gillibrand took Hillary Clinton ’s Senate seat .
If Tedisco loses , the ex-staffers said , “ Steele is done . ”
Completely , definitively ?
In all likelihood , NY - 20 will turn Republican no matter who had won the RNC job , but that wo n't give Steele a reprieve for very long .
If Tedisco had won , Republicans and the media would be screaming that Obama 's leadership caused the win for him and that the Democratic Party is in BIG trouble .
The media would have done segment after segment asking the question , Is President Obama 's agenda in trouble ?
And then he would have had to defend himself over and over again .
Let 's see how it plays out in the media .
And now for the some comedy musings of Rep. Pete Sessions :
Rep. Pete Sessions ( Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , said that although Tedisco came up short that his message of fiscal discipline provided GOPers a blueprint on which to run next year .
" Since Election Day , we continue to hear the growing chorus of frustrated and concerned citizens who demand more from their government than profligate spending and mountains of debt that will be paid for in higher taxes by our children and grandchildren , " said Sessions .
" Although Jim was unsuccessful in his hope to change Washington , he has shed light on our Party 's efforts to win back the majority in the House . "
Chris Cillizza gives a mild response to the outcome , but does say :
As we have said before , the closeness of the result makes it tough to draw too many national conclusions from this race .
One thing is for sure : this is an opportunity lost for Republicans .
With the Teabaggers leading the way , Tedisco never had a chance .

Niets nieuws onder zon , want een aantal jaren later is idereen dat al vergeten .
Een 16 jarig meisje van de Sickles High School in de Amerikaanse plaats Tampa is het zeker wel gelukt om een onvergetelijke indruk te maken op de klassenfoto , want zij was die dag vergeten ondergoed aan te doen en omdat ze op de eerste rij zat van de klassenfoto is dat ook erg goed te zien in het jaarboek .

an amazing litany of Fox ’s nonstop hatred and attacks targeting President Obama :
" It has often been found that profuse expenditures , heavy taxation , absurd commercial restrictions , corrupt tribunals , disastrous wars , sedition ’s , persecutions , conflagrations , inundation , have not been able to destroy capital so fast as the exertions of private citizens have been able to create it . "
~ Lord Thomas B. Macaulay , 1st Baron ( 1800 — 1859 )
The Scythian Philosopher , Anacharsis ( 6th century BC ) , is claimed to have penned : " Written laws are like spiders ’ webs , and will , like them , only entangle and hold the poor and weak , while the rich and powerful easily break through them . "
Anacharsis ’ truism contains the very essence of what we know as " Machiavellism . "
This philosophy historically asserts that in politics efficiency is paramount ; political motives and actions should not be constrained by considerations of morality .
Thus , the acts of the state are not to be held to any common standards of good and evil ( i.e. law ) but rather the actions of the state are in and of themselves justified , independent of civil and moral law .
The models contained in " Machiavellism " did not originate with Niccol Machiavelli but are as ancient as they are interminably evil .
The very idea that political power was exempt from the norms of ethical behavior was rampant throughout the ancient world .
Both Cicero
( De officiis — " On Obligations , " Book 3 : chapter 2 ) and Tacitus ( Annals , Book 14 : chapter 44 ) advance the idea that political violation of moral law was not only permissible but required for the " public welfare . "
Cicero declares that " there never can be such a thing as a conflict between expediency and moral rectitude . "
Both these ancient writer ’s thoughts reverberate in Machiavelli ’s instruction that " … it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong , and to make use of it or not according to necessity . "
( The Prince , Chapter IV )
So here is the crux of the matter : " necessity " and " public welfare " stand as the excuses for the state to act outside the bounds of common decency and at the same time to become the archenemy of the population under its control .
It is " public welfare " and " necessity " that stood as the justification for the most barbaric acts of ancient state paganism : that of human sacrifice .
The ancient historian Sanchoniathon — who we know through the works of the Christian bishop , Eusebius of Caesarea — writes concerning the pagan Phoenician religion : “ It was the custom among the ancients in times of great calamity , in order to prevent the ruin of all , for the rulers of the city or nation to sacrifice to the avenging deities the most beloved of their children as the price of their redemption . ”
So also Julius Caesar , speaking of the Druidical religion in Gaul , says : “ They who are engaged in battles and dangers , either sacrifice men as victims , or vow that they will sacrifice them , and employ the Druids as the performers of these sacrifices , because they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man , the mind of the immortal gods cannot be propitiated , and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes .
Others have figures of vast size , the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men , which being set on fire ; the men perish enveloped in the flames . ”
Some authors have shown , with great skill and clarity , that this abhorrent practice was common among almost every civilization prior to the fall of Troy .
Nor were these atrocities confined to the ancient world .
Archeologists and historians are now telling us that as late as 800 AD the Maya of Southern Mexico and Central America were known to sacrifice children .
There is also the remarkable custom of the sacrificing priest tearing out the heart of the living victim and holding it up as an offering to the Sun god in the hopes of securing the " public welfare . "
How many died in such a horrific manner is anyone ’s guess .
Some will argue that modern man is long removed from such inhuman acts .
I would offer two thoughts to the contrary .
First , what is the ostensive difference between ecclesiastical rule , which claims the right of directing the lives of a people through " divine guidance " and that of a civil authority comprised of elitists who claim the same right through legislation ?
If , as it has often been stated , both ecclesiastical law and civil law are obligatory because of the threat of civil force ; is one less odious than the other ?
Do n’t both set aside moral law for the benefit of the state ?
Second , is a society , which will continually relinquish its freedoms , rights , and markets to a ruling authority , capable of refusing the ultimate demand of the state , i.e. , the inhuman right to commit wholesale murder ?
Ah , here is the real meat of the matter is n’t it ?
We as a collective have surrendered almost every aspect of our lives to state control and now are faced with the very real possibility of the unthinkable and we are the intended victims in waiting whether figuratively or in actuality .
We pretended to be the benefactors of the majestic Roman law , which some claim was the single greatest element responsible for bringing civilization back to Europe following the Dark Ages .
Yet , it was wantonly forgotten that Roman law left untouchable the power and authority of the emperor .
It sanctioned slavery ; it allowed that free men could be tortured and deprived of the right to a fair trial when suspected of treason , which then as now , was loosely defined and its definition relied on the whim of the emperor .
Punishments for crime were cruel and could include being torn apart by wild beasts , to the crowds delight , and it was far more " just " when applied to the " connected " wealthy than to those of lower social , economic classes .
As a result we sit and watch as one Administration after another takes the mantel of emperor , and backed by congresses that even the Roman Senate would deem spineless cowards , prance and strut as if they are the authors of creation ; untouchable gods of all they survey .
We complain about the gluttonous ways these same cretins consign us and future generations to abject slavery via mountains of debt , with numbers that are unfathomable .
We worry that these self - same leaders will release the dogs of war on our streets , accompanied by the same torture and depravity witnessed by those of foreign ancient civilizations under the guise of restoring social order .
We see judicial decisions , congressional law , and presidential orders that , like ancient Rome , deprive us of our property and wealth and label anyone who objects as " terrorist " while turning a blind eye to the criminal temerity of our deluded , nocuous saviors .
In truth , the English historian , Bishop William Stubbs says of Roman law that it was " a most pliant tool of oppression … no nation using the Civil Law has ever made its way to freedom … wherever it has been introduced the extinction of popular liberty has followed sooner or later . "
( Letters , p. 159 ) Few dispute that royal absolutism , as it developed in the Middle Ages , was directly due to the revival of the Roman law .
The Emperor Justinian codified Roman law but that law was nothing less than the common law of " pagan " Rome which had developed over the centuries and as we have seen " paganism " has predictable " pagan " consequences .
No longer is state intrusion into our private and business lives called " paganism . "
We have developed new titles — collectivism , socialism , communism , democracy etc… — to convey the state ’s acts that equate with those ancient governmental systems , but the results are the same .
So we are facing a seemingly black hole , from which there is no apparent escape .
Certainly , societies around the world are faced with hard times , which may last for decades .
However , there is hope .
History , time and time again , shows that governments fail and disappear , societies along with their economies realign and adjust , governmental monetary systems evaporate returning to the abyss from which they came , and distribution systems collapse .
Yet through it all the markets , while they may be suppressed , do n’t stop working .
For as long as there is any market demand , human energies and resources will be employed in a productive manner to offer a supply .
But as long as any society continues to accept government and its pagan policies over personal liberty , and the market place , laissez - faire will , by necessity , take a form the state will consider criminal and we will find foreign or uncomfortable .

Peanut lovers everywhere may have reason to celebrate .
Doctors in England believe they have cured the peanut allergy , at least on a temporary basis .
Using the simple technique of desensitization , doctors at the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge exposed four children to peanuts over six months , during which time they successfully built up a tolerance .
The children were started on 5 milligrams ( .02 percent of an ounce ) of peanut flour daily and by the end of the trial were able to ingest 880 milligrams a day , the equivalent of 5 whole peanuts .
The study , which has been published in Allergy , continues and now includes 20 children between the ages of seven and 17 , some of whom are able to ingest 12 peanuts a day .
They would be monitored for the next three or four years to assess their tolerance levels , [ lead researcher Andrew ]
Clark said , adding that there was no reason why the clinical trial could not be extended to adults [ AFP ] .
Consultant allergist Pamela Ewan said , “ Until now there has been no treatment that has modified the disease .
There has only been effective management of the problems ” [ Medical News Today ] .
The new research brings hope to the many people , adults as well as children , who suffer from peanut allergy , which most often triggers breathing problems but can also cause potentially fatal anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest .
Effective management usually means simply avoiding contact with peanuts , which for the most severely allergic requires a level of care that can be daunting to constantly maintain .
Trials in the 1990s attempted to build a similar tolerance using peanut injections , but were unsuccessful , and the concept of desensitising people to allergies has been successfully done with bee and wasp stings and pollen allergies , but this is the first time it has been achieved with a food - related allergy [ BBC ] .
In the trial , the initial assessment showed the children were able to tolerate between 5 and 50 milligrams — equivalent of up to a quarter of a peanut — while the post - trial re-assessment demonstrated each child able to tolerate 10 or more peanuts .
Clark said , “ Unlike other childhood food allergies like cow ’s milk , [ the peanut allergy ] rarely goes away .
For all our participants , a reaction could lead to life - threatening anaphylactic shock … .
It ’s not a permanent cure , but as long as they go on taking a daily dose they should maintain their tolerance ” [ The Guardian ] .

Some inmates were subjected to controversial interrogation techniques Spain 's attorney general has rejected an attempt to bring a criminal case against six former US officials over torture allegations at Guantanamo Bay .
The officials , including former US attorney general Alberto Gonzalez , were accused of giving a legal justification for torture at the US detention centre .
But Candido Conde - Pumpido said the case had " no merit " as they were not present when the alleged abuse took place .
Spanish courts can prosecute people for crimes committed outside Spain .
Using the principle of " universal justice " , they have also investigated alleged crimes in Argentina , Tibet , El Salvador and Rwanda .
' Plaything '
The Spanish judge , Baltasar Garzon , who is best known for issuing an arrest warrant for former Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet in 1998 , had requested the attorney general 's advice last month on whether to investigate the six former US officials following a complaint from human - rights lawyers .
It is a terrible precedent if those intellectually responsible for crimes can no longer be held accountable
Gonzalo Boye
Spanish human rights lawyer " We cannot support that action , " Mr Conde - Pumpido told reporters .
" If one is dealing with a crime of mistreatment of prisoners of war , the complaint should go against those who physically carried it out . "
He said a trial of the men would have turned Spain 's National Court " into a plaything " to be used for political ends .
While saying his office supported the principal of universal justice , Mr Conde - Pumpido said that if there was a legitimate reason to file a complaint against the six accused , " it should be done before local courts with jurisdiction , in other words in the United States " .
Correspondents say that while Mr Conde - Pumpido 's recommendation reduces the chances of Judge Garzon launching an investigation , he could still do so anyway .
Gonzalo Boye , one of the lawyers who filed the complaint , said the decision was politically motivated and set a " terrible precedent " .
" The attorney general speaks of the court being turned into a plaything .
Well , I do n't think the attorney - general 's office should be turned into a plaything for politicians , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
In addition to Mr Gonzales , the complaint named former Undersecretary of Defence Douglas Feith ; former Vice - President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , David Addington ; Justice Department officials John Yoo and Jay Bybee ; and Pentagon lawyer William Haynes .
It is alleged the men advised former President George W Bush that he could ignore the Geneva Conventions , and provided legal cover to allow interrogators to use techniques such as " water - boarding " .

I am very pleased to announce the release of version 0.1 of CL - RABBIT : an interface from LispWorks via the JFLI to the RabbitMQ implementation of the AMQP messaging protocol .
http://www.nicklevine.org/cl-rabbit/
It 's released under an MIT - style license , a copy of which appears in each source file .
Many thanks to Wiinz Limited for giving me permission to do all this and I 'm sorry it 's taken so long to get around to kicking the brute through the door .
Here 's how it goes .
More details in the readme .
Kaine's were the latest in a string of public statements where Democrats have sought to push Limbaugh 's incendiarity to prominence :
White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday that Limbaugh is now the GOP 's leader , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs urged cable news hosts to ask Republican guests whether they agreed with Limbaugh 's desire for President Obama to fail , and liberal activist group Americans United for Change has begun running a TV ad accusing the GOP of listening to Limbaugh too much .
And it 's a message that is n't likely to go away anytime soon , according to one Democratic strategist .
" We 're going to keep trying to draw this wedge , because we know that most Republicans in Congress ... hanging him [ Limbaugh ] around their necks , there 's not a lot they can do about it , " a Democratic strategist told me over the phone today , pointing to Rep.
Phil Gingrey 's ( R - Ga. ) apology to Limbaugh in January after criticizing the commentator .
" Rush really represents a polar point in the Republican Party , and I think , again , it is a way to make Republicans have to choose " between his rhetoric and more inclusive , bipartisan politics , the strategist told me .
" Republicans are going to have to answer for every incendiary thing their leader says , " a Democratic leadership aide told me .
And that seems to be the goal for Democrats : to make Republicans answer for Limbaugh 's comments as a voice for the party .
It was n't that long ago that Democrats were the ones seen as having a unity problem ; now , disagreements between Limbaugh and more mainstream Republicans over the " fail " remark ( Rep. Eric Cantor , one of the most prominent Republicans in Congress , distanced himself from Limbaugh over the weekend ) have given Democrats an opportunity to spread some " disunity " messaging of their own .
By suggesting Limbaugh is the leader of the GOP , Democrats are seizing on a moment of rebuilding for the Republican Party .
Since John McCain lost the 2008 election , Republicans do n't have a single , widely recognized leader the way Democrats do in Obama .
And , in the midst of that rebuilding moment , Democrats are granting a national megaphone to ( debatably ) the most polarizing voice in the GOP 's ranks .
The notion of " Steele vs. Rush " became widespread after Steele 's original comment on CNN and Limbaugh 's subsequent tirade against the RNC chairman .
But it is a " Democrats vs. Rush " dichotomy that Democrats are establishing by promoting Rush as the GOP 's de facto leader - - a dichotomy that seeks to marginalize Steele and other mainstream Republicans and offer moderates an easier choice between Republicans and Democrats ( after all , how many non-conservatives are likely to follow Rush ? ) .
That and , as the strategist told me , it offers Republicans a tough choice on where they stand .
Nowadays ( meaning Tuesday morning ) , everyone 's a deconstructionist : Democrats are seeking to deconstruct the GOP , and Michael Steele must seek to deconstruct both the " Steele vs. Rush " media narrative and the " Democrats vs. Rush " choice being offered to voters by Democratic messengers .
His statement to Politico began to do so , but that does n't mean Democrats will stop hammering .

My grandma turned 93 today .
It 's been a tough year for her .
Things have n't gotten a lot better since her stroke about a year ago .
Fortunately , they have n't gotten worse either , and she 's been pretty stable .
But it 's still awfully sad and frustrating , and it 's been a real loss .
She knows who I am , and her long - term memory is n't bad -- she remembers things from her past , she remembers fundamental things about the world and her life and , in the moment , she makes a lot of sense and can carry on a conversation .
But her short - term memory is n't there , and new information just does n't stick for more than a few seconds .
So every day , it 's the same conversation , more or less , at least on her end , changed only based on however it is I respond . "
" It 's so good to hear your voice .
Where are you ? "
" I 'm back in New York .
Nina and I just moved into a new apartment . "
" In Brooklyn ? "
" No , Manhattan . "
" Oh , Manhattan 's very elegant .
It used to be quite a big deal , to tell someone you were living in Manhattan .
How can there be anything more impressive than that ?
How many rooms is the apartment ? "
" Two rooms .
A bedroom and a living room .
Plus a bathroom , of course .
And there 's a little kitchen area attached to the living room . "
" And who 's living there ? "
" Me and Nina . "
" You already moved there ? "
" Yep , last week . "
" And it 's in Brooklyn ? "
" No , Manhattan . "
" Oh , Manhattan 's very elegant .
It must be very expensive , "
" It 's small . "
" But you 're not married yet , right ? "
" The wedding 's in two weeks . "
" Two weeks ??
How come I did n't know about that ? "
" You did . "
" No one told me about that !
You already sent out the invitations ? "
" Yes .
You have one , on your refrigerator . "
" Are you sure ? "
" Yep .
But that 's okay .
Now you know .
Two weeks . "
" And it 's all planned ? "
" Yep . "
" That 's exciting .
But where are you going to live ? "
etc .
If nothing else , it has taught me patience .
But it 's hard , and sad .
My whole family went out for dinner tonight with my grandma to celebrate .
She seemed to have a really nice time , she was definitely happy to see everyone , and had a whole bunch of leftovers to take home .
As we were walking her back to the house from the car , she asked , " Did I eat dinner yet ? "
The brain is very interesting .
( CNN ) -- Rupert Murdoch 's plan to put News Corporation websites behind a pay wall is " going to be like putting toothpaste back in the tube . "
Murdoch said the existing Internet business model was " malfunctioning . "
That 's according to Jack Matthews , chief executive officer at Fairfax Digital Media , the online arm of one of the News Corp .'s biggest rivals in Australia .
" I do n't know of too many industries where something has been given away for free for 10 or 15 years , and then suddenly charged for it , " said Matthews , whose company publications include the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age .
Murdoch believes the days of freeloading through the Internet are coming to an end .
In a conference call to analysts early this month , he announced that within a year he wanted the company 's titles -- which include the New York Post , the Times in the UK and the Herald Sun in Australia -- to introduce charges for online access to stories .
" The current days of the Internet will soon be over , " he told analysts .
What is Murdoch 's game ?
Is this a money grab , or the act of one of the last media barons to save the ink - stained world of print ?
" I think it 's to make money , " Matthews said .
" But the thing I will say about Murdoch 's comment , I think he has very forcefully put ( online pay structure ) on the agenda for discussion . "
Free access to information is n't free .
For this story alone , there were the long - distance calls , computers , electricity , wages , health benefits and at least two Starbucks lattes ( grande size ) involved .
The problem for media , especially newspapers , is that revenue earned from online advertising is not replacing cash lost by the departure of subscribers and advertisers .
" There 's the argument that you 're creating a model that 's not sustainable for the content creator , " Matthews said .
Battle lines are beginning to form over whether news organizations allow their material to be used by aggregator sites such as Google News and Yahoo .
" On one hand , it gets you a lot of distribution , content and brands in front of a wider audience ... the flip side of the coin is why is Google News doing very well on the back of other people 's investment , " Matthews said .
" The people who created the content are suffering the pain . "
So far , Fairfax Media is following the lead of most other news organizations with the view that the benefits of sharing content with Google and other search engines outweigh the downside .
" But that is something we are evaluating at on a day - by - day basis , " Matthews said .
It 's an irony of the information age that providers of information are the biggest losers .
News Corp .
International results showed that flagship papers in the U.K. , The Times and Sunday Times , lost $ 1.5 million a week last year .
Globally , News Corp. saw its latest quarterly profits slide 47 percent .
It 's a story played out in media organizations across the developed world .
" It 's clear that the days of 30 percent profit margins are over , " said William Yarker , director of media consulting for Deloitte in London .
" The question with this recession is what is a cyclical change , what is structural change , and what would be an acceptable rate of return ? "
One group betting that the media industry is ready for a change is Journalism Online .
Led by Steve Brill , a journalist and entrepreneur who started Court TV , and Gordon Crovitz , the former Wall Street Journal publisher , Journalism Online is building an iTunes - like model for micropayments of media content .
" For those people who say it can't be done , there are examples of companies doing it every day , " Crovitz said .
" WSJ.com and the Financial Times have long done it .
ESPN.org and Consumer Reports have successful premium content models .
Publishers just need to decide what part of their access is worth paying for . "
Murdoch and Journalism
Online are stepping into a breach most media companies have feared to enter .
" The key question media organizations are going to have to ask : ' Do we think our content is unique enough that people will come to us to charge for it ? ' " said Yarker of Deloitte .
" Once you 're through that minefield , then how do you manage technology and processes so that is not a cause of failure ? "
For Matthews at Fairfax , attempts to monetize page views may be too late for most news Web sites , but opportunities abound for new platforms such as mobile devices like iPhone and electronic book viewer Kindle .
" I 'm quite bullish about mobile devices , " Matthews said .
" It 's like the difference between cable TV news and free - to - air , " Matthews said .
" People thought they would n't pay for something that was free , but it succeeded because of the convenience factor ... if you were n't home by 7 p.m. , you did n't miss the news . "
Craigslist recently toppled MySpace as the most visited site
The boss of classified adverts website Craigslist says the firm is being unfairly targeted by US prosecutors over its adult listings .
The attorney general of South Carolina has threatened to sue the firm for continuing to have " advertisements for prostitution and pornographic material "
Last week , Craigslist said it would eliminate its erotic services category and screen all adult services adverts .
Craigslist boss Jim Buckmaster said he was being " publicly condemned " .
In a blog post , Mr Buckmaster said : " South Carolina Attorney General , Henry McMaster , today announced that our recent improvements , which go far beyond measures he himself personally endorsed with his own signature six months ago , not only are n't good enough , but actually require a criminal investigation .
" He evidently feels justified in singling out Craigslist for investigation , and publicly condemning me personally as being worthy of criminal prosecution . "
Mr Buckmaster said there were a greater number and more explicit adult adverts available on other websites and publications in South Carolina .
' No alternative '
It follows Mr McMaster 's assertion that the site still contained advertisements for prostitution .
The attorney general said : " We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution . "
Craigslist was in the headlines last month after a Boston - area man was accused of fatally shooting a woman , Julissa Brisman , 26 , who placed an ad on the site .
Police believe 22 - year - old Philip Markoff may have been involved in other crimes against women who also posted advertss on the site .
The case was widely covered in the media , with Mr Markoff being dubbed the Craigslist Killer .
Craigslist was started in 1995 as a hobby by Craig Newmark , who put together an e-mail list of events happening in San Francisco .
Today , the firm employed 28 people working out of San Francisco , although Buckmaster says his priority is making users ' lives easier , not making money .
Forty million adverts are posted on Craigslist each month .

In eCommerce usability improvements usually have a huge impact on conversion rates .
However , usability does n’t only mean better visual guide or better site hierarchy .
It also means a better communication with potential customers using a professional , trustworthy design , delivering the right information at the right time and communicating with users instead of throwing ad - slogans at them .
In this article you ’ll learn what to consider when preparing a perfect landing page for your product , how to focus user ’s attention on the most important parts of your sites and also how you can use videos and user ratings to improve your conversion rates .
Professional Design Builds Trust
The most important rule for website usability is to keep it simple .
Make your links speak for themselves .
Make the structure of your website predictable .
Provide clear and visible feedback .
Comfort your visitors and make it hard for them to do serious mistakes .
However , while these ( quite obvious ) guidelines may help your readers to get a solid understanding of how your site works , they will not necessarily lead to more sales .
Besides , you may have some goals that conflict with this paradigm of simplicity , the most important of which are probably up - selling and cross-selling .
Build Trust and Credibility
When it comes to building customer ’s trust in your company , a professional , trustworthy design becomes crucial .
In the Web , people are very likely to mistrust online - business , so you better make sure that you appear credible and serious .
Inkd.com does just that with a professional look , a solid grid - based layout and following classic usability conventions .
Inkd
For everything you do on your website , keep in mind that the user always has to be in control of what ’s happening .
This holds true for expert users , who will use your internal search to quickly access products they are interested in .
They may want to be able to filter search results in a certain way .
And it holds equally true for the users - newbies , who wants to see proof of the teasers on your home page and will likely use your primary menu to navigate .
When a user is attracted to the advertising campaign of a product , you have no alternative but to lead that user directly to the product page itself .
The next click after that should lead the user directly to the purchase page .
By the way , why should you use a shopping cart in this case , if the user wants to buy only one product ?
The cart becomes totally useless and creates more steps in the sales process .
With each additional step , the risk of cart abandonment increases .
The rule of thumbs : if a user finds a product through your internal search engine , he or she should n’t have to click more than twice to find essential information about the product .
Deliver the right information at the right time
Speaking of good information , another important rule for leaving users in control is delivering the right information at the right time , whether the information is related to the product , shipping , credit card security risks , privacy or what have you .
Because of the large amount of information you can deliver to the user , you need to sort it by priority .
Delivering the right information at the right time is important .
Scribbles : before users type in any data , the site informs them about payment methods , privacy and purchase opportunities for educational purposes .
However , both privacy data and the “ education ” - link could be given more visual weight on the page .
The user will have certain questions at each stage of the shopping process ; focus on the answers to these questions , and make them the most prominent on the page at that time .
Additional useful information can be “ hidden ” behind a hyperlink ( as the “ education ” link in the Scribble - example above ) .
Do n’t advertise , lead the users
Be careful about using graphic elements to prioritize information ; do n’t make them look like advertisements .
People tend to overlook page elements that look like ads .
Of course , you can illustrate the advantages of your products with big pictures — really big pictures .
Jakob Nielsen even recommends using full - screen - sized views : “ If I click on a product image on a product page , I am certainly asking for a bigger version of that image .
And as I intentionally clicked , I ’m able to wait for the really great picture .
I ’m not only able to but I even expect to wait for some loading delay . ”
The paradigm of simplicity means that store designers have to be very careful experimenting with new techniques such as AJAX and rich Internet applications based on Flash .
If you use these , you will have to run usability tests .
New studies show that many people are still unfamiliar with functions like dragging and dropping and do not know what words like “ tagging ” mean .
Newsberry
Newsberry uses a beautiful layout with attracitve design elements .
However , it fails to attract readers to sign up for the service immediately – users need time to find the obscure , modest “ sign up ” - button .
How much time do you need to find it ?
Probably making the button stand out would work better in this case .
Be careful about using visual elements to prioritize information ; do n’t make them look like advertisements .
Good example : Five Simple Steps
Mark Boulton ’s Five Simple Steps does a good job of focusing users ’ attention to purchasing options while not making them look like advertisements .
Clear visual design and layout reinforce the sales funnel effect .
Getting back to the questions that customers pose , one of their big questions on landing pages is , “ What next ? ”
Take a look around the Web .
You ’ll find tons of stores that hide their order buttons or label them with ambiguous terms .
For example , the German store Werbemittelguide includes the terms “ Order or ask for an offer ” on a single button .
While distinguishing between direct orders and solicited offers gives users more control , placing these two different ideas on one button is confusing .
In this particular case , clicking on the button does nothing other than put the product in your cart .
And the cart is positioned in the bottom - left corner : a clear violation of user expectations .
Highlight What ’s Important And Use Proper Wording
Go to the website guut , look for a second and then close your eyes .
Open them again for a second and then close again .
What did you notice ?
The big product picture on the left ?
The countdown ?
The huge orange order button ?
The label on the button says “ Order now ” — a couple of years ago , a lot of Web designers would have regarded that as outrageous , outdated design .
Today , it ’s state of the art .
“ Tell people clearly what they should do next , ” says US e-commerce expert Peter Blackshaw .
What works with online shopping also holds true for online communication , downloading a PDF brochure or any other form of conversion .
Make the most important option the biggest .
Links to “ More information , ” “ Details ” and “ Technical data ” are also important , but less important than the conversion itself .
They should be displayed in a smaller font or in less aggressive colors .
The US agency MarketingExperiments learned first - hand how strongly wording can influence conversion rates .
It tested its own campaign , which aims to convert readers to paid subscribers .
Every single element of the email campaign was tested .
The button that triggered conversions was labeled “ Continue here , ” which at first glance would seem to work perfectly .
The outcome of the test surprised even experienced experts .
A new button labeled “ Continue to article ” converted 3.3 % better than the first ; and a third version , labeled “ Click to continue , ” convinced almost 10 % more users .
After inserting an Amazon - style order button , Al Carlton doubled sales on his website .
Video Is Often A Silver Bullet
It is becoming common sense for product descriptions and product pages to include videos that show the products in action .
In Germany , almost 60 % of all retailers surveyed by the BVDW indicated that they planned to increase their efforts with video .
The bike retailer Fahrrad .de invited sales agents from all brands to its new studio , which was built solely for producing videos for its website .
The sales agents were advised to explain why their products were better than others .
And most brands sent not only sales people but also cross-country world champions to stand in front of the camera .
Some retailers might argue that their products are not suited to online video .
By now , though , we can quickly find many products that are being advertised with online videos .
Both Getbackboard.com …
… and GoodBarry used prominent video blocks on their start pages .
Videos are often used to quickly explain what the product is all about and what advantages it can bring to the customers .
What is very important to understand is that the videos do n’t have to be full - throttle studio productions with enormous budgets .
In many cases a hand - made personal video will do .
It may even perform better than a traditional advertising video because it ’s more honest .
Websites that push new concepts , like eBags.com , try to build community websites around their product videos , and users can vote on which video they like best .
A very nice idea was used by Pleo , a company that sells a kind of robot pet that looks like a dinosaur .
Pleo hit the sidewalks in certain cities , put the dinosaurs on the ground and shot people ’s reactions .
You could hardly advertise with more authenticity .
And do n’t let anyone fool you , there is only one format for online video these days : Flash .
Only Flash allows video to be seamlessly embedded onto a Web page and integrated with other elements on the page .
Because of YouTube ’s success , most users are able to play back Flash video .
And producing video is really not expensive , even if it is farmed out to an agency .
Do n’t Underestimate The Importance Of User Ratings And Customers Reviews
This may be one of the most important topics of all these days .
In tourism , about 60 % of all travellers base their decisions on online research .
They visit ratings websites to find the best destinations and hotels , free from the marketing overtures of the companies themselves .
Similar websites can be found in the electronics and other industries .
This leads us to two questions :
Should store owners build their own ratings system ?
How should one deal with criticism ?
The first answer is pretty simple .
In most cases the answer is , “ No . ” And there are a lot of reasons for that .
The most important reason is that no retailer is trustworthy in this way .
People would know that commercial interests are behind any recommendation ; the cost and effort to maintain such systems are immense ; and only the biggest websites attract enough users to build a valuable rating system .
If a website owner decides to build his own system , he must provide the ratings right in the spot where users expect it : beside the products .
Take Thomas Cook Travel an example .
After a lot of research , it built its own user ratings system , which is now one major filter in its internal search .
An external system like Idealo.de ( or PriceGrabber.com ) might be a better alternative .
Idealo gathers ratings from a lot of platforms and aggregates them with tests and reviews from websites and magazines .
The plattform itself is neutral because individual retailers cannot influence the content .
PriceGrabber
The second question is also easily answered , but the consequences are significant .
When criticism comes its way , a company would do well to leave it on its system , as long as it is n’t obscene and does n’t violate laws .
This is what experts recommend .
It is a very sensitive issue for retailers , their suppliers , the producers and brands , all of whom are trying to cooperate for mutual benefit .
If you face this kind of criticism , forward it to the relevant partner and allow them to respond .

This article is the second part of our 3 - part - series “ Optimizing Conversion Rates ” .
DEARBORN , Mich . — On Nov. 29 , 2006 , Ford Motor made a surprising pitch to the nation ’s biggest banks .
In a packed ballroom at a New York hotel , Ford ’s chief executive , Alan R. Mulally , said he would mortgage all the company ’s assets for billions of dollars in loans to finance an overhaul of the troubled automaker .
Although the economy was healthy then , Mr. Mulally said the money would give Ford “ a cushion to protect for a recession or other unexpected event . ”
At the time , the request was considered an act of desperation .
But the $ 23.6 billion in loans it received turned out to be Ford ’s salvation .
Plunging car sales have driven its two American rivals , General Motors and Chrysler , to the brink of bankruptcy , forcing them to borrow $ 17.4 billion from the federal government to stay in business .
The future of both companies will be decided in the weeks to come by President Obama and his special auto task force .
But because of the money it borrowed nearly three years ago , Ford is in far better shape than its two crosstown rivals .
The loans have kept it independent and on a course to survive the worst new - vehicle market in nearly 30 years .

The British government plans a tenfold increase in the penalties for criminal breaches of intellectual property law .
Infringement of IP laws will be punishable by fines of up to £ 50,000 rather than the current £ 5,000 , according to Government plans .
The measures , though , do not involve increasing the possible jail sentences for online infringement as proposed by 2006's Gowers Review of Intellectual Property .
The Intellectual Property Office ( IPO ) has consulted with the public and industry on possible changes to sentencing and has received support for the increase in the penalties for copyright and other IP law infringement .
" Government will therefore work to identify the suitable legislative options for taking this forward , " said its report on the consultation process .
The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property recommended that the punishments for IP law infringement be the same regardless of whether the offence was on the internet or to do with physical goods .
Someone engaged in the piracy of physical goods for commercial gain can face 10 years in jail .
The Gowers Review proposed making that true for online infringement as well .
Though the Government accepted all Gowers ' recommendations , it rejected this one when it came to formulating its consultation .
" It is Government policy that prison should be used mainly for serious and dangerous offenders and that sentences should only be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection , " said the consultation , which rejected even asking whether jail sentences should be increased .
" It is worth noting that the Crown Courts already deal with the more serious IP cases under general law such as the Fraud Act 2006 . "
Instead , the Government decided to consult on increasing the maximum fines available in all copyright or IP cases to £ 50,000 .
It offered industry and the public the choice of keeping the law unchanged , where fines are capped at £ 5,000 in England and Wales and £ 10,000 in Scotland ; increasing fines to £ 50,000 for copyright infringement ; and increasing fines to £ 50,000 for all IP infringement .
The majority of respondents backed the third option , and the Government said it would create legislation to implement that idea .
" On the introduction of an exceptional statutory maxima [ higher fine caps ] , responses were generally positive , believing it would serve as a deterrent for would - be offenders , " said the IPO 's report on the consultation .
Responses were largely from industry bodies representing copyright holders , such as the UK Film Council , publishers ' associations and game developers ' representatives .
Though the increase in fines was welcomed , people responding to the consultation warned against their indiscriminate use .
" There was concern that this level of penalty should be used with care and only when the case required it , " said the IPO 's report .
" A few responses thought that exceptional statutory maxima should be set in accordance with the seriousness of the offence and the profit gained .
Several noted that the courts would need to set a fine appropriate to the circumstances for each case . "
All of the respondents who agreed with the need for an increase in the fines said that the increase should apply not just to copyright infringement but to all IP - related offences .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An author who saw the global financial crisis coming fears the next bubble will come in the form of inflation and has little confidence U.S. President Barack Obama ’s team is up to the challenge ahead .
“ The Democrats have replaced the Republicans as the big benefactors to the financial community , ” said Kevin Phillips , author of “ Bad Money : Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism . ”
“ The financial community is donating more to Democrats than ever before and you ’ve got more Democrats in the financial community , creating a very powerful pattern there .
I do n’t think you ’re going to see the Obama administration and Congress willing to be tough enough in dealing with these things , ” he told Reuters .
Phillips , a former strategist in the Nixon White House who has turned highly critical of the Republicans and voted for Obama in 2008 , published “ Bad Money , ” his 13th book , a year ago .
The paperback edition came out March 31 with a revised preface and afterward , interpreting the events of the past year , but the prescient body of “ Bad Money ” remains unchanged .
A year ago , he warned of a the pending explosion of a 25 - year “ multibubble ” that started in the 1980s , when the financial sector accounted for 10 percent to 12 percent of the U.S. economy had started metastasizing into an “ arguably crippling ” 20 percent to 21 percent by the middle of this decade .
Overleveraging and easy credit was bound to create disaster , he warned .
Phillips assigns much of the blame to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , but perhaps even more on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who he calls a “ disaster , ” and his predecessor , Alan Greenspan .
Phillips calls Paulson a Wall Street insider who was looking out for his own , and Bernanke an academic misguidedly trying to refight the 1930s Great Depression .
Together they formed the wrong team at the wrong time whose ad hoc approach threw away hundreds of billions of dollars and more than doubled the Fed ’s balance sheet , he says .
“ What you ’re seeing Bernanke do is he ’s trying to create a bailout reflationary bubble , which he ca n’t describe as a bubble , just as Greenspan could n’t describe the housing mortgage bubble as a bubble .
What we ’re seeing by Bernanke is a covert attempt to rebubble , ” Phillips told Reuters .
Moreover , a commodities cycle probably started early in this decade and is only being masked now by recession , Phillips says , presaging a repeat 1970s style inflation , he said .
“ The danger is that the great unwind -- the unraveling of the mammoth buildup of debt -- is under way .
If that predominates , Bernanke ’s theory is you ’re going to have deflation , ” Phillips said .
“ My theory is that if we are in a commodities cycle , what you will get will be more like 1973 - 74 - 75 ... where as soon as the recovery begins you get rising inflation because you ’re going to play havoc with all money supply and liquidity that ’s been unleashed ” he added .
Meanwhile , the taxpayer and small investor have little defense .
“ The average person is going to be on the periphery of concern and I think that ’s rotten , ” Phillips said .
How To Save Money , Invest , Pay Off Debt , Travel and Still Live The Life of Your Dreams
Chances are , if you ’re reading this blog you ’re already well on your way to being more in control of your finances .
You ’ve probably read a personal finance book or two and maybe you already have your own home business and some non-registered investments for the future .
We all know what we need to be doing to get our financial act together ; the problem is doing it .
The problem is that there is so much to do .
It ca n’t happen overnight .
Yet sometimes we ’re impatient and we take actions which we unconsciously think will get us to where we want to go , faster .
Examples : coming into some extra , unexpected money and putting it all on your credit card ; getting a pay raise and deciding to put it all into an investment ; finding out that your credit card company bumped your rate up , so now you ’re not going to see any more movies or eat out again until you get that debt paid off .
You are n’t going to get ahead by privileging one component of your financial health above all others .
It ’s such a simple point , and it can take a long time to sink in .
The path to financial health is BORING .
I ’m assuming you do n’t want to have a six - figure income if it means you ’re also one million dollars in debt .
I ’m assuming you do n’t want to have all your debts paid off by the time you ’re 70 , only with nothing left to retire on .
The only way to be debt - free and swimming in cash flow so that you can retire early and live the life you want is to tackle ALL of these problems at once , bit by bit .
Long - term buy - and - hold investments only work if you start them early enough .
You ’ll pay less interest on your loans and credit cards if you pay them off sooner rather than later .
The sooner you pay off your mortgage , the sooner you ’ll free up your expenditures .
These things all need to happen sooner rather than later .
The problem with solving one of these leaky faucets at the expense of the others in the short - term is that pretty soon you ’ll be forced to attend to the other , and you will sabotage the forward - momentum you achieved in taking care of your debt , for example .
The analogy I like to use is that of keeping a rowboat steady .
You do n’t want to rock it too far in one direction if it just means you ’re going to fall into the water again .
Solution : Imagine you ’re already as wealthy as you need to be .
Imagine you are free from all finance - related stress .
Now think in reverse to envision what allocations of capital got you to this stress - free financial place .
In other words , what balance of capital inflows and outflows do you need in order to balance your obligations with what you need in order to get to where you want to go ?
If you have $ 1000 in monthly debt payments , $ 1000 in monthly shelter payments , $ 1000 in living expenses , and you also need $ 500 for your investment fund and $ 500 for a future travel fund , you need to find a way to pay all of this each month just in order to stay afloat .
You ca n’t let one “ money channel ” fall behind , because it will just mean that you ’re sabotaging the progress of another “ money channel ” in the future .
You also ca n’t forgo developing the money channels you will need in the future , because then you will never make room for them in your portfolio .
Sounds pretty basic , and it is .
But it ’s the subtle shift in perspective that ’s important .
Rather than think of your financial obligations in terms of balls you have to juggle — on which view you can only hold onto one at once and it ’s the balls that are really controlling you — think of it as a pie that you slice up each month .
( Apologies for the awkward metaphors . )
You ’re in control .
The difference is that each month you start with a full pie .
As you become wealthier , the size of your pie will grow , but you will always start each month with a full pie .
So how do you want to cut that pie up ?
The trick to pay off debt , save money for Costa Rica , buy a second home , and still sock cash away for retirement is to do ALL of these things all at once .
You need to make room in your portfolio TODAY for everything you want to achieve and have in the future .
That includes finding ways to keep that monthly pie growing .
You may feel broke today , but just remember that you always start each month ( or each new paycheck ) with a full pie .
Do n’t give half of it to Mr. VISA only to starve Ms. Costa Rica , because later on she ’ll be stealing from Mr. VISA again just to get even .
[ As the controversy over DRM in PC games continues , Gamasutra talks to 2D Boy and Stardock on their attempts to pioneer less restrictive or even non-existent DRM , as Ubisoft and EA comment on their loosening of protection controls for Prince Of Persia and The Sims 3 . ]
If 2008 was the year of consumer resistance to digital rights management ( DRM ) , then 2009 seems to be the year that developers are seeking more relaxed , gamer - friendly ways to thwart piracy .
Indeed , some outspoken developers have even suggested that game makers suck it up and accept the piracy , perhaps generating income in alternate ways , like micro-transactions .
Even leading publishers , like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft , are softening their DRM efforts .
Ubisoft , for instance , shipped its Prince of Persia in December with no DRM whatsoever .
And EA has announced that when The Sims 3 is released next month , no online authentication will be required to play the game , simply a CD key .
" I definitely believe this is all the result of a change in the public perception of DRM , a sort of grass roots uprising , " observes Ron Carmel , co-founder of San Francisco - based developer 2D Boy .
" Gamers are much more vocal about it than they used to be , perhaps because they are so accustomed to downloading music without too many restrictions . "
Carmel believes that the extent to which a game is pirated is approximately the same whether it uses any of the DRM technologies or not .
If it is that ineffective , he asks , why use it at all ?
Many PC game retail publishers typically use DRM to limit the number of systems on which a game can be installed -- most games allow no more than five .
But that hamstrings customers who own more than five computers , or who have to re-install their machine multiple times .
Additionally , the ways that some DRM - based systems hide their copy protection mechanisms and online install checking within Windows often concern gamers who consider them ' spyware ' -- with a few examples of behind - the - scenes systems that affect operating system efficiency .
But in general , the concept that a game is installing something unknown on the user 's system to check on them is psychologically unsettling , whether or not it 's actually disruptive .
It has been claimed -- albeit without any demonstratable proof -- that , last year , a gamer backlash was a significant factor in EA 's Spore becoming the most pirated game in 2008 .
Critics of excessive DRM believe that some gamers simply chose to pirate rather than buy the long - anticipated game whose DRM technology infuriated them .
EA / Maxis ' Spore
" Spore was the final straw that broke the camel 's back , " recalls Brad Wardell , president and CEO of Plymouth , Michigan - based developer Stardock .
" Someone who buys software does not want to be made to feel like a chump for buying it .
Much of the outcry came from legitimate customers who said that they should n't be restricted by DRM , especially since people with pirated versions were n't . "
But the Entertainment Software Association believes otherwise .
" DRM is a reasonable response to high piracy rates , " says Ric Hirsch , senior VP for intellectual property enforcement at the ESA .
" Just because some users circumvent DRM protections to gain unauthorized access to game software does not mean that the technologies do n't serve their intended purpose .
No security technology is 100 % effective . "
" Most people in the United States who play games do not circumvent DRM in their use of game software , a fact sometimes overlooked because of widespread illegal downloading and usage of games .
There is little doubt that piracy would be far more widespread without game publishers ' use of DRM . "
However , 2D Boy 's Carmel says that DRM is used not so much to thwart piracy -- since it 's not very good at that -- as it is to combat the used game market .
" Publishers are n't stupid .
They know that DRM does n't work against piracy , " he explains .
" What they 're trying to do is stop people from going to GameStop to buy $ 50 games for $ 35 , none of which goes into the publishers ' pockets .
If DRM permits only a few installs , that minimizes the number of times a game can be resold . "
Me : “ Thank you for calling [ Garden Store ] .
This is [ My Name ] .
How can I help you today ? ”
Caller : “ Yeah , I have mites on my , uh … tomato plants .
I need something to put on them to kill the mites ”
Me : “ Well , sir , we have many different types of sprays and powders for bug eradication that can work . ”
Caller : “ I need something that can work indoors . ”
Me : “ Indoors ?
Like a greenhouse ?
Because the products we have are all natural and can be used in a greenhouse . ”
Caller : “ I mean indoors like in my house .
I do n’t want to use a spray in the closet in my room . ”
Me : “ Sir , you ’re growing tomatoes in your closet ? ”
Customer “ Uh , yeah … so what can I use ? ”
Me : “ Well , we have a powder made of diatomes you can use to kill the mites , and you can still eat the tomatoes without any issue .
It ’s all natural and perfectly safe . ”
Caller : “ That sounds good , but … umm , what if I were to smoke the tomato plant ?
Would that still be safe ? ”
( I finally realize he ’s NOT really talking about tomatoes . )
Me : “ Umm , sir , tomato plants are part of the nightshade family and are actually poisonous if ingested .
I would n’t recommend smoking them or eating the plant itself .
Just the tomato . ”
Caller : “ But , if I had a plant that was smokeable , I could use the powder stuff and it would be okay ? ”
Me : “ Yeah , just make sure you wash it good before you um … smoke it … as you would with any home - grown vegetables and fruits . ”
Caller : “ You ’re sure ?
Because I do n’t wanna die for smoking something I ’m not supposed to . ”
Me : “ Then make sure you are n’t smoking the tomato plants in your closet and you ’ll be fine .
Have a nice day ! ”

“ I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al - Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and to prevent their return to either country in the future , ” Obama said .
“ If the Afghan government falls to the Taliban – or allows al - Qaida to go unchallenged – that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . ”

Obama announced the deployment of more than 4,000 additional troops , hundreds of civilian specialists and increased foreign aid to Afghanistan and Pakistan .
He acknowledged that his decision could try the limits of Americans ’ patience – particularly the new investments in civilian nation - building .
“ At a time of economic crisis , it is tempting to believe that we can short - change this civilian effort , ” Obama said .
“ But make no mistake : our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we do n’t invest in their future . ”
The roughly 4,000 new troops mainly will be trainers to help expand the Afghan army .
The training troops are in addition to the 17,000 troops Obama ordered in February , in what he told CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes ” last week was the most difficult decision of his young presidency .
Obama ’s message was not only directed to the American people , however ; he also had a message for listeners in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The president repeatedly went out of his way to make the case that a stepped - up American presence in these countries would ultimately be in their own interest .
“ The terrorists within Pakistan ’s borders are not simply enemies of America or Afghanistan – they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of Pakistan , ” Obama said .
“ They have blown up buildings , derailed foreign investment , and threatened the stability of the state .
Make no mistake : al - Qaida and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within . ”
And to the people of Afghanistan , Obama warned : “ The return in force of al - Qaida terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence . ”
The president ’s policy announcement came just days ahead of his first foreign trip since taking office .
And in advance of his visit to the G - 20 summit and several European countries , he signaled that the United States would be asking for additional help from its allies and pledged the creation of a new “ Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region . ”
“ What ’s at stake now is not just our own security – it is the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security , ” Obama said .
The plan won high marks from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , who told reporters Friday morning that the plan is “ stressing things that should have been stressed before . ”
“ There ’s no chest - thumping , there ’s no bring ‘ em on , there ’s no mission accomplished .
What we ’re going to do , based on what President Obama has outlined , is have a more narrow focus .
. . . to protect America , ” Reid said .
Here are the elements Obama announced :
Military :
The additional troops will help provide capability for the Afghan government and military until they ’re able to do it themselves , an official said .
Benchmarks :
The president embraced the notion of measuring progress through a series of benchmarks .
“ We ’re not going to pursue a policy indefinitely if it ’s not working , ” an official said ahead Obama ’s address .
“ We need to be able to judge it . ”
Accountability : With all this new money going into the war , the administration is funding more inspector - general - type accountability programs to ensure the money is efficiently and effectively spent .
Civilian side : Obama proposed a significant increase in civilian capacity — “ civic engagement . ”
Afghanistan may need more experts on rule of law to enhance the judicial system .
The country needs more police trainers , agriculture experts , veterinarians and experts on water systems .
Pakistan : Obama wants to tie an increased $ 1.5 billion a year in aid to Pakistan to progress by that nation at battling against extremists within its borders , something it has resisted in the past .
Apparent con-artist Kari Ferrell told Animal NY the other day that she 'd turned herself in to Philadelphia police .
Surprise : She lied !
A Philadelphia musician she knew lured her back with talk of a trip to Portland .
Sam Tremble ( pictured ) had let Ferrell stay at his house in Philly for a few days after meeting her at his band 's show in Brooklyn .
She told various lies , including that she could n't go to the South by Southwest music festival in Austin with the band because she had surgery scheduled .
Then a fellow band member got an email warning about Ferrell 's grifter ways , from a mutual friend ; a Google search turned up her warrant in Salt Lake City ; and then the Observer story hit .
Deciding he could catch Ferrell , Tremble emailed her , " feigning concern for her health " and ignorance of all the news stories about her , and pretending he could take her on tour out West .
No doubt wanting to get as far from New York as possible , Ferrell took the bait .
Soon she was on a Chinatown bus to Philly .
Officers DeLuca and Green drove me to Chinatown in an unmarked black Explorer .
They watched from across the street .
When the bus arrived , I waved to Kari to get their attention .
I want to say I hugged her , but I was anxious and I do n't remember .
I picked her bag out of the luggage storage and started walking behind her .
The officers crossed the street and stopped her .
I dropped her bag and walked away .
They took her aside and questioned her for a moment .
She did n't struggle .
Then Ferrell called Animal NY to say she had turned herself in .
Because it 's not like that lie would be almost immediately exposed in court .
Wow .
For some people , lying really is like breathing .

Saw the new STAR TREK movie last night .
No spoilers here , just a resounding thumbs down .
Take a pass .
The actors do a very creditable job of creating young versions of all the familiar characters from Classic Trek , but the writing sucks start to finish , and the science fictional aspects are ludicrous even for STAR TREK .
Fans of the old show might like the film ... but then again , maybe not , since it 's a " reboot " ( Hollywoodese for " retcon " ) and pisses all over the original continuity .
Me , I think they should just let this tired , tired franchise die .
STAR WARS too .
I do n't ever need to see another wookie , or another klingon .
( They wo n't , of course .
Not so long as there 's one more nickle to be made .
I know how Hollywood works ) .
I love SF , and I love space opera , but can't we have some new characters in a new universe ?
Even BATTLESTAR
GALACTICA was a retread , albeit a much more interesting one than anything Trek or SW has done in decades .
We did have FIREFLY , short lived as it was ... but there 's room for more .
Let 's have television versions of Honor Harrington and Miles Vorkosigan .
Let 's have someone film the Praxis series by Walter Jon Williams , the best space opera I 've read in years .
Let 's have anything that is n't Trek or STAR WARS .
If they really must remake old shows , screw it , let them remake Tom Corbett , Space Cadet , or Rocky Jones , Space Ranger .
Pinto Vortando rules !!!
Simon Johnson , an econ professor at MIT and former IMF economist , started blogging recently at TPMCafe .
And David Kurtz interviewed him in today ’s episode of TPMtv .
The argument Johnson makes is one that ’s been tossed about in a loose aphoristic way in the public debate but seldom gets put in such blunt and concrete terms .
What Johnson argues is that in economic crises in recent decades where the IMF has worked to step in and put things right , seldom if ever do things get fixed unless the political power of the group that caused the mess is somehow disrupted — in most cases the political power of the group that ran the big financial institutions .
Not that political elites are wholly displaced or overturned .
But there ’s got to be some fundamental break in their power to get the necessary reforms through .
A couple things occur to me about this .
One is that whatever you can say about the IMF and the World Bank , the key factor behind their role as crisis - fixing and stabilizing institutions in the post - war era is that they had the power of the US behind them ( and the developed countries more generally ) .
So whatever the wisdom of their interventions , they usually had the power to dictate solutions .
And that very often meant overruling political elites who either would not face problems or had vested interests in not facing them .
Now , let me stipulate that the record was by no means perfect .
I know that .
But for the purposes of this discussion , my point is that there was an external power that could step in in a politico - economic situation that had become dysfunctional or stuck .
For the US ( or probably Europe , for that matter ) , though , there ’s no outside force .
Back to the initial point .
Everyone is always saying : how can we fix the problem as long as the people we have in charge are the people who created the problem in the first place ?
Very true in many ways .
I ’ve said it a lot myself .
But this point has brought it home to me in a much more concrete way .
The assumptions , the vested interests , the wealth , the political power are just too much to overcome .
Here ’s the interview …
GI Bill 's wording costs state 's student vets EDUCATION

After four years in the Marine Corps , Paul Miller was looking forward to going back to school - in his case , to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music to study the clarinet .
He auditioned well and won a scholarship - not enough to cover the full master 's program tuition , but student loans covered the rest of his $ 33,000 tuition last year .
He figured the new Post - 9/11 GI Bill would replace his need for loans when he begins his second year this fall .
But last week , Miller , 28 , learned the amount of his tuition the bill would pay : none .
Miller ran into an anomaly unique to California 's university system - a difference in a single word that could cause thousands of California veterans like him to miss out on educational benefits available in every other state .
Because California calls the money students pay to attend its public universities " fees " and not " tuition , " veterans like Miller , who are attending private campuses or seeking higher degrees , are ineligible to receive thousands of dollars that they would receive in other states .
In Miller 's case , it 's nearly a $ 13,000 difference .
" I thought it was a mistake , " he said .
The problem lies in an interpretation of the Post - 9/11 GI Bill , which was intended to be flexible , supporting students in public and private schools and undergraduate and graduate programs .
Because educational costs vary widely by institution and state , the bill included a standardizing formula : Students would be reimbursed for tuition up to an amount equal to the most expensive public undergraduate tuition charged by their state .
That meant veterans seeking an undergraduate degree at a public institution would have their full tuition reimbursed , while students seeking graduate degrees or attending private institutions would receive tuition reimbursement equivalent to the costs of tuition in undergraduate public institutions .
California wrinkle
But California has a wrinkle : Since 1960 , state law has affirmed that California residents should attend public colleges and universities " tuition free , " although students could be charged fees for housing and other costs .
As the state reduced its support for higher education , however , universities raised fees to pay for services that in other states would have come from tuition .
California State University fees , for example , more than doubled between 1993 and 2009 .
Tuition remained " free " - but mainly in name .
For most students , the distinction hardly matters - they write checks each semester and do n't think about what the money is called .
But , according to the Department of Veterans Affairs , the Post - 9/11 GI Bill reimbursement rate is specifically based on public education tuition , not on fees .
Tuition in California 's public universities : zero .
The upshot is that veterans can attend California 's undergraduate public institutions for free under the federal law but veterans seeking graduate degrees or to attend private institutions will receive no money for tuition .
They can be reimbursed for fees up to about $ 6,600 per term - the top amount charged in California 's public universities - but fees in most private institutions are a small portion of total cost .
" Apparently the VA missed the memo or something , " said Miller .
" They 're not existing in the same world logically as any of the people they purport to serve . "
Forced to change plans
The problem was revealed as applications for the new GI Bill began to be accepted at the beginning of May for benefits to be paid beginning in August .
Already some veterans have been forced to change their educational plans - and more .
" I did want to come to California , " said Teresa Guerin , who is in the Air Force with her husband and had been planning to move with him from Texas to Santa Rosa , where he would be a recruiter and she would pursue a master 's of business administration after her enlistment .
But after finding that the new GI Bill would not pay her graduate tuition , Guerin and her husband requested reassignment in Texas .
" I could n't put my life on hold to see how they were going to fix it , " she said .
One kind of fix already exists : the Yellow Ribbon Program , in which the VA matches contributions by participating private institutions .
The program is intended to make up the difference between what the GI Bill pays and the actual tuition .
But not all schools participate - including the Conservatory of Music , Miller said - and some veterans worry that the California discrepancy will discourage schools from signing up .
What 's more , the Yellow Ribbon Program requires a minimum of 36 months of service .
People like Darren Matt of Walnut Creek , who was in the Air Force Reserve and was activated for a year after the Sept. 11 attacks , are therefore ineligible .
He would be eligible for up to 60 percent of the Post - 9/11 GI Bill benefits - if not for the California anomaly .
' Huge group excluded '
" So I still get nothing .
There 's a huge group of people who are going to be excluded from this , " said Matt , who is seeking an MBA .
" I can't imagine that was the intent of the bill . "
This week , Rep. Mike Thompson , D - St. Helena , co-sponsored with Rep. Howard " Buck " McKeon , R - Santa Clarita ( Los Angeles County ) , a bill designed to fix the problem .
In a conference call Thursday , Thompson said he remains hopeful that the VA can fix the problem without congressional action .
" I'm hoping that we do n't have to go through the whole legislative fix , " he said .
" This is no more than a bureaucratic snafu . "
As bad as California ’s budget crisis is for the state ’s $ 1.8 - trillion economy , just wait .
It could get worse .
The spectacle that played out in the national media this week of a state unable to get its fiscal act together is reinforcing the notion that the Golden State is a rotten place to do business , experts say .
Corporate leaders and Wall Street investors , watching the daily festival of seeming incompetence , political partisanship and governmental dysfunction , could be persuaded to limit or eliminate their investments here .
“ We lose competitive advantage by being the state that ca n’t solve its problems , ” economist Stephen Levy said .
“ Regardless of what we think the solution is , the fact is we ca n’t find a solution . ”

The budget crisis threatens to further weaken the state ’s job market , which lost 63,700 more jobs last month , according to figures released Friday .
The state ’s overall unemployment rate actually fell slightly , to 11 % from 11.2 % .
But new job losses could prolong the vicious cycle in which the California economy is now trapped , with rising joblessness reducing consumer spending and delaying a housing rebound , thus leading to more layoffs .
The long - term effects of Sacramento ’s financial woes , meanwhile , could far outweigh the near - term effects .
In particular , the expected deep cuts in education spending could thin the state ’s human capital , potentially forcing California companies to look elsewhere for skilled workers as well as new plants or even headquarters .
It ’s the equivalent of “ eating the seed corn , ” said Levy , chief economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .
Of course , there would still be plenty of short - term pain to go around .
How much wo n’t be known for a while .
But eliminating as much as $ 24 billion from the proposed $ 95.5 - billion general - fund portion of the 2009 - 10 state budget would further corrode an economy already creaking under the weight of a national recession .

Distressed car dealers could see sales to state agencies shrink , printing shops may lose business as courts and other government operations shorten their workweek , and office - equipment suppliers would lose sales as cash - strapped agencies make do with aging copiers .
And cutting as many as 5,000 state jobs , and perhaps thousands more as budget reductions cascade down to schools and local governments , would hit especially hard in a state that already has the fifth - highest unemployment rate in the nation .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed slashing state spending on education by $ 3 billion to help close the budget gap , and the state would pay dearly for canceling classes , firing instructors , cutting class days and shortening the school year , experts said .
Promising students would go to other states , taking their future skills , earnings and , possibly , Nobel Prizes elsewhere .
California companies would then find it harder to attract high - value employees who might be dubious about moving to a state with sub -par schools .

The implications hit home to Ross DeVol this week while he attended a national biotechnology conference in Atlanta .
Governors of Maryland , Massachusetts and Texas were stalking biotech firms in hopes of luring them to their states with promises of job - training funds , improved educational systems and other inducements , said DeVol , head of regional economics at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica .
California ’s shortcomings , both real and perceived , “ make it difficult not just to recruit new business but to keep what we have , ” he said .
John Sedgwick , co-founder of Santa Clara solar - energy company Solaicx , agreed .
Advertisement
“ When you think about the genesis of Silicon Valley , it really started from its superior educational base ” at Stanford and UC Berkeley , said Sedgwick , whose company makes the building blocks for photovoltaic cells .
“ That indicates that you do n’t want to kill the goose that ’s laying the golden eggs . ”
The failure of the budget measures at the ballot box this week has some Californians calling for a constitutional convention that could , among other things , rewrite the state ’s tax system .
Businesses have long complained about big-spending government in California .
But with state and local spending accounting for about one - fifth of the state ’s gross domestic product , California is in line with some other heavily populated , expensive - to - manage states , such as New York and Florida .
Still , companies such as Solaicx have found the burden heavy enough to look elsewhere to invest .
Advertisement
In 2007 , the company built a plant in Portland , Ore. , in part because the state offered a tax incentive unavailable in its home state .
California had an added disincentive :
It is one of only a handful of states that charges sales tax on manufacturing equipment .
Schwarzenegger and state lawmakers have said they “ got the message ” that voters want to see the budget gap closed with spending cuts , not tax increases .
Though that may be somewhat reassuring to corporate executives , it wo n’t necessarily allow them to sleep easily .
“ At some point , you have to believe that somebody ’s taxes are going to go up , ” DeVol said .
Even before that day comes -- if it does -- many businesses would already be smarting from the loss of state and local government dollars .
It will take weeks to thrash out where and by how much the state budget will be cut .
But some businesses are bracing for the worst .

At Folsom Lake Ford near Sacramento , the fleet department has seen fewer orders from state and local government agencies , said government sales manager Mark Paoli .
A few years ago , government purchases amounted to more than 50 % of the Folsom dealership ’s new - car sales , with as many as 2,000 vehicles sold for rescue units , pursuit cars and other transportation .
This year , Paoli estimated that the dealership would sell only 300 cars to government entities in California , or about 20 % of the store ’s projected total new - car sales for 2009 .
But after Tuesday ’s special election , Paoli worried that government sales would decrease further .
“ We knew 2009 would start the downward spiral , and we ’re anticipating the same thing next year , if not worse , ” he said .
“ I ’m worried for myself and for my workers , people whose livelihoods rely on government business .
It has been an integral part of our dealership ’s operations and we hate to see it go away . ”
Advertisement
The cuts would affect business in more subtle ways , experts said .
If hours for state and local offices are cut back and personnel reduced , it would take longer for building applications , environmental permits and other paperwork to clear , adding to the time and cost of completing a project .
“ Government is supposed to be a stabilizing influence , and instead they ’re becoming part of the problem , ” said Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics .
“ They should be spending when everyone else is cutting back .
They should be buying cars when no one else is buying cars . ”

A front page report in the Business section of the New York Times should bestir some of Harvard Medical School alumni .
200 Harvard Medical School STUDENTS are confronting the administration demanding an end to pharmaceutical industry influence in the classroom .
“ The students say they worry that pharmaceutical industry scandals in recent years – including some criminal convictions , billions of dollars in fines , proof of bias in research and publishing and false marketing claims – have cast a bad light on the medical profession .
And they criticize Harvard as being less vigilant than other leading medical schools in monitoring potential financial conflicts by faculty members . ”
Harvard received the lowest grade–an F - - from the American Medical Student Association , a national group that rates how well medical schools monitor and control drug industry money .
Harvard Medical School ’s peers received much higher grades , ranging from the A for the University of Pennsylvania , to B ’s received by Stanford , Columbia and New York University , to the C for Yale .
The revolt began when a first year medical student “ grew wary ” when a professor promoted cholesterol drugs and “ seemed to belittle a student who asked about side effects . ”
He later discovered that the professor , a full - time Harvard Medical faculty member , was a paid consultant to 10 drug companies , including manufacturers of cholesterol drugs .
Another first year student said : “ Before coming here , I had no idea how much influence companies had on medical education .
And it ’s something that ’s purposely meant to be under the table , providing information under the guise of education when that information is also presented for marketing purposes . ”
The fact is , no one is keeping track of faculty income from industry , or covert marketing pitches infiltrating the classroom :
“ The school said it was unable to provide annual measures of the money flow to its faculty . . ”
One Harvard professor ’s disclosure in class listed 47 company affiliations .
On one side of the confrontation : the administration and most of the faculty who admittedly loath to “ tighten the spigot ” of cash from industry :
“ school officials see corporate support for their faculty as all the more crucial , as the university endowment has lost 22 percent of its value since last July and the recession has caused philanthropic contributors to retrench . ”
An outspoken supporter of ties between industry and academia–who served on numerous pharmaceutical advisory boards , Professor Thomas Stossel who is unconcerned about industry influence .
He views industry support as “ a huge opportunity we ought to mine . ”
A smaller faction of students calls for “ continued interaction between medicine and industry at Harvard . ”
They are led by Vijay Yanamadala , 22 .
On the other side : students such as Kirsten Austad , 24 , a first - year Harvard Medical student who is one of the movement ’s leaders , who said : “ Harvard needs to live up to its name .
We are really being indoctrinated into a field of medicine that is becoming more and more commercialized . ”
The students are joined by Dr. Marcia Angell , a faculty member and former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine who has vigorously advocated for an end to liaisons between academia and Big Pharma : “ Too many medical schools have struck a ‘ Faustian bargain ’ with pharmaceutical companies .
If a school like Harvard ca n’t behave itself , who can ? ”

Harvard Medical School in Ethics Quandary
By DUFF WILSON
BOSTON – In a first - year pharmacology class at Harvard Medical School , Matt Zerden grew wary as the professor promoted the benefits of cholesterol drugs and seemed to belittle a student who asked about side effects .
Mr. Zerden later discovered something by searching online that he began sharing with his classmates .
The professor was not only a full - time member of the Harvard Medical faculty , but a paid consultant to 10 drug companies , including five makers of cholesterol treatments .
“ I felt really violated , ” Mr. Zerden , now a fourth - year student , recently recalled .
“ Here we have 160 open minds trying to learn the basics in a protected space , and the information he was giving was n’t as pure as I think it should be . ”
Mr. Zerden ’s minor stir four years ago has lately grown into a full - blown movement by more than 200 Harvard Medical School students and sympathetic faculty , intent on exposing and curtailing the industry influence in their classrooms and laboratories , as well as in Harvard ’s 17 affiliated teaching hospitals and institutes .
They say they are concerned that the same money that helped build the school ’s world - class status may in fact be hurting its reputation and affecting its teaching .
The students argue , for example , that Harvard should be embarrassed by the F grade it recently received from the American Medical Student Association , a national group that rates how well medical schools monitor and control drug industry money .
Harvard Medical School ’s peers received much higher grades , ranging from the A for the University of Pennsylvania , to B ’s received by Stanford , Columbia and New York University , to the C for Yale .
Harvard has fallen behind , some faculty and administrators say , because its teaching hospitals are not owned by the university , complicating reform ; because the dean is fairly new and his predecessor was such an industry booster that he served on a pharmaceutical company board ; and because a crackdown , simply put , could cost it money or faculty .
Further , the potential embarrassments – a Senate investigation of several medical professors , the F grade , a new state law effective July 1 requiring Massachusetts doctors to disclose corporate gifts over $ 50 – are only now adding to pressure for change .
The dean , Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier , who says he wants Harvard to catch up with the best practices at other leading medical schools , recently announced a 19 - member committee to re-examine his school ’s conflict - of - interest policies .
The group , which includes three students , is to meet in private on Thursday .
Advising the group will be Dr. David Korn , a former dean of the Stanford Medical School who started work at Harvard about four months ago as vice provost for research .
Last year he helped the Association of American Medical Colleges draft a model conflict - of - interest policy for medical schools .
The Harvard students have already secured a requirement that all professors and lecturers disclose their industry ties in class – a blanket policy that has been adopted by no other leading medical school .
( One Harvard professor ’s disclosure in class listed 47 company affiliations . )
“ Harvard needs to live up to its name , ” said Kirsten Austad , 24 , a first - year Harvard Medical student who is one of the movement ’s leaders .
“ We are really being indoctrinated into a field of medicine that is becoming more and more commercialized . ”
David Tian , 24 , a first - year Harvard Medical student , said : “ Before coming here , I had no idea how much influence companies had on medical education .
And it ’s something that ’s purposely meant to be under the table , providing information under the guise of education when that information is also presented for marketing purposes . ”
The students say they worry that pharmaceutical industry scandals in recent years – including some criminal convictions , billions of dollars in fines , proof of bias in research and publishing and false marketing claims – have cast a bad light on the medical profession .
And they criticize Harvard as being less vigilant than other leading medical schools in monitoring potential financial conflicts by faculty members .
Dr. Flier says that the Harvard Medical faculty may lead the nation in receiving money from industry , as well as government and charities , and he does not want to tighten the spigot .
“ One entirely appropriate source , if done properly , is industrial funds , ” Dr. Flier said in an interview .
And school officials see corporate support for their faculty as all the more crucial , as the university endowment has lost 22 percent of its value since last July and the recession has caused philanthropic contributors to retrench .
The school said it was unable to provide annual measures of the money flow to its faculty , beyond the $ 8.6 million that pharmaceutical companies contributed last year for basic science research and the $ 3 million for continuing education classes on campus .
Most of the money goes to professors at the Harvard - affiliated teaching hospitals , and the dean ’s office does not keep track of the total .
But no one disputes that many individual Harvard Medical faculty members receive tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through industry consulting and speaking fees .
Under the school ’s disclosure rules , about 1,600 of 8,900 professors and lecturers have reported to the dean that they or a family member had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching , research or clinical care .
The reports show 149 with financial ties to Pfizer and 130 with Merck .
The rules , though , do not require them to report specific amounts received for speaking or consulting , other than broad indications like “ more than $ 30,000 . ”
Some faculty who conduct research have limits of $ 30,000 in stock and $ 20,000 a year in fees .
But there are no limits on companies ’ making outright gifts to faculty – free meals , tickets , trips or the like .
Other blandishments include industry - endowed chairs like the three Harvard created with $ 8 million from sleep research companies ; faculty prizes like the $ 50,000 award named after Bristol - Myers Squibb , and sponsorships like Pfizer ’s $ 1 million annual subsidy for 20 new M.D. ’s in a two - year program to learn clinical investigation and pursue Harvard Master of Medical Science degrees , including classes taught by Pfizer scientists .
Dr. Flier , who became dean 17 months ago , previously received a $ 500,000 research grant from Bristol - Myers Squibb .
He also consulted for three Cambridge biotechnology companies , but says that those relationships have ended and that he has accepted no new industry affiliations .
That is in contrast to his predecessor as dean , Dr. Joseph B. Martin .
Harvard ’s rules allowed Dr. Martin to sit on the board of the medical products company Baxter International for 5 of the 10 years he led the medical school , supplementing his university salary with up to $ 197,000 a year from Baxter , according to company filings .
Dr. Martin is still on the medical faculty and is founder and co-chairman of the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center , which researches degenerative diseases , and actively solicits industry money to do so .
Dr. Martin declined any comment .
A smaller rival faction among Harvard ’s 750 medical students has circulated a petition signed by about 100 people that calls for “ continued interaction between medicine and industry at Harvard Medical School . ”
A leader of the group , Vijay Yanamadala , 22 , said , “ To say that because these industry sources are inherently biased , physicians should never listen to them , is wrong . ”
Encouraging them is Dr. Thomas P. Stossel , a Harvard Medical professor who has served on advisory boards for Merck , Biogen Idec and Dyax , and has written widely on academic - industry ties .
“ I think if you look at it with intellectual honesty , you see industry interaction has produced far more good than harm , ” Dr. Stossel said .
“ Harvard absolutely could get more from industry but I think they ’re very skittish .
There ’s a huge opportunity we ought to mine . ”
Brian Fuchs , 26 , a second - year student from Queens , credited drug companies with great medical discoveries .
“ It ’s not a problem , ” he said , pointing out a classroom window to a 12 - story building nearby .
“ In fact , Merck is right there . ”
Merck built a corporate research center in 2004 across the street from Harvard ’s own big new medical research and class building .
And Merck underwrites plenty of work on the Harvard campus , including the immunology lab run by Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher – a professor who also sits on the board of the drug maker Bristol - Myers Squibb , which paid her nearly $ 270,000 in 2007 .
Dr. Glimcher says industry money is not only appropriate but necessary .
“ Without the support of the private sector , we would not have been able to develop what I call our ‘ bone team ’ in our lab , ” she said at a recent student and faculty forum to discuss industry relationships .
Merck is counting on her team to help come up with a successor to Fosamax , the formerly $ 3 billion - a - year bone drug that went generic last year .
But Dr .
Marcia Angell , a faculty member and former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine , is among the professors who argue that industry profit motives do not correspond to the scientific aims of academic medicine and that much of the financing needs to be not only disclosed , but banned .
Too many medical schools , she says , have struck a “ Faustian bargain ” with pharmaceutical companies .

A gunman is believed to be among the 14 people found dead following a shooting rampage at an immigrant services centre Friday morning in Binghamton , N.Y. , the city 's chief of police said .
Chief Joseph Zikuski told reporters at a Friday afternoon news conference he " had very good reason to believe " the shooter was among those killed , but could not confirm that .
But he said the man believed to be the shooter was found with a satchel around him containing ammunition .
" We have no idea what the motive is , " he said , adding that the man had ties to the centre .

Zikuski said the gunman barricaded the rear door of the building with his car before entering the building of the American Civic Association through the front .
Zikuski said the man entered a foyer and shot two receptionists .
One receptionist was killed , but another pretended to be dead .
When the shooter went down the hallway , she crawled under a desk and called 911 , he said .
The gunman then went to a room off the reception area and shot several more people , he said .
People in the room were part of a citizenship class .
" The people were trying to better themselves , trying to become citizens , " Zikuski said .
He added that 26 people , when they heard the shots , took refuge in the basement .
Police recovered two handguns at the scene , he said .

Earlier , police emerged from the building with two men in restraints , but Zikuski said neither one was the shooter .
Initial reports indicated 41 hostages were in the American Civic Association building , but Zikuski did not confirm that , saying instead the police removed 37 people safely .

Five people were wounded .
Three people with gunshot wounds were being treated at Wilson Medical Centre in nearby Johnson City , according to hospital spokeswoman Christina Boyd .
Their conditions ranged from stable to critical , and two of them were undergoing surgery , she said .
She told CNN another person had been taken to a local community hospital .
A spokeswoman at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton confirmed that a student from Binghamton University was being treated at the emergency room .
Spokeswoman Linda Miller said she did n't know the nature of the injuries .
Rich Griffiths , who works across the street from the building , told CBC News a large number of police vehicles appeared at the scene about 10:30 a.m .
The Press & Sun Bulletin reported that 10 people , their hands on their heads , were released from the building shortly after noon .
Police searched some of them .
About 40 minutes later , another group of 10 was released , the paper reported .
Binghamton , N.Y. , is about 225 kilometres northwest of New York City and 260 kilometres southeast of Rochester . ( ( CBC ) )
The identity of the gunman has n't been made public , but Tuong Hung Nguyen — a professor at Binghamton 's Broome Community College who is fluent in Vietnamese — was asked to communicate with the shooter earlier in the day , the Press & Sun Bulletin reported .
Gov. David Paterson called the shooting " a tragic day for New York " when he spoke earlier Friday afternoon .
" When are we going to be able to curb the kind of violence that is so fraught and so rapid that we can't even keep track of the incidents ? " he said in a later news conference .
The American Civic Association says it " assists immigrants and refugees with immigration and personal counselling , resettlement , citizenship , family reunification , interpreters and translators " at the centre .
The immigrant centre had planned classes for Friday , according to the Press & Sun Bulletin .
Binghamton , a town of 50,000 , is about 225 kilometres northwest of New York City and 260 kilometres southeast of Rochester .
Most of the general public is fascinated by Hugh Hefner ; most men envy him and see him as some sort of hero .
Women find him attractive due to his money , fame , and sex appeal , and even those who do n’t feel this way about Hef still find him to be very interesting .

Tiger rebels have admitted for the first time that their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is dead .
A statement issued by the Tigers said their " incomparable leader " had " attained martyrdom " and declared a week of mourning .
A spokesman for the group also told the BBC that it would now use non-violent methods to fight for Tamils ' rights .
Sri Lanka 's army last week released pictures it said showed Prabhakaran 's body after its final offensive .
The Sri Lankan army released pictures it said were of the dead leader The statement from the Tamil Tigers ( LTTE ) said he was killed " fighting the military oppression of the Sri Lankan government " last Sunday .
The rebels had made a last stand in the north - east of the island after Sri Lankan troops cornered them in a coastal strip .
The Tigers ' defeat brought to an end their 26 - year fight for a separate Tamil homeland .
The statement was signed by the defeated group 's head of international relations , Selvarasa Pathmanathan .
We have already announced that we have given up violence and agreed to enter a democratic process to achieve the rights for the Tamil ( self ) determination of our people
Selvarasa Pathmanathan
How Sri Lanka 's military won Agony in Sri Lanka 's refugee camp Humanitarian challenge Winning the peace
It said that the LTTE had declared a week of mourning for their dead leader , starting on 25 May .
The statement called on Tamils all over the world to " restrain from harmful acts to themselves or anyone else in this hour of extreme grief " .
In a telephone interview with the BBC , Mr Pathmanathan said Prabhakaran had died on 17 May but did not give details of the circumstances .
Mr Pathmanathan said the Tigers would now use non-violent methods to fight for the rights of Tamils .
" We have already announced that we have given up violence and agreed to enter a democratic process to achieve the rights for the Tamil ( self ) determination of our people , " he said .
Most of the Tamil Tigers senior leadership is believed to have been killed in the fighting .
Conflicting reports Sri Lankan officials gave conflicting reports of the death of Prabhakaran .
They initially said he had been killed in an ambush by commandos as he tried to break through government lines in an ambulance .
But the army later said his body was found on the banks of the Nanthikadal lagoon and he had been shot in scrubland - probably during fierce fighting .
Sick and injured civilians displaced by the war are crammed into camps Tamil Tiger officials at first denied Prabhakaran 's death , insisting that he was " alive and safe " .
Sri Lankan officials have said that more than 6,200 security personnel were killed and almost 30,000 wounded in the final three years of the war .
Estimates for Tamil Tiger deaths vary from 15,000 to more than 22,000 .
About 275,000 Sri Lankan civilians are still displaced because of the fighting , posing a huge problem for international aid agencies .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Sri Lanka on Friday to see the situation for himself .
At the end of his visit a joint UN - Sri Lankan statement said that the government had pledged to investigate claims of human rights violations committed during the conflict .
But the government has rejected UN calls to allow aid agencies unhindered access to refugee camps .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa said authorities had to identify any remaining rebel fighters in the camps .

" The said constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress
to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens
from keeping their own arms . "
The universe is indeed a curious place .
Even stranger are the processes and phenomena that occur in the universe , some are without explanation , some are quite dangerous , and some are just really cool .
10 . Life itself
It is truly amazing what goes on in our body .
Think about it .
You are nothing more than a random assortment of tiny molecules called atoms that individually have no life themselves .
Then the atoms somehow find a way to make up cells , which in turn drive the processes that allow you to live the way you do .
There is a plethora of these cells doing the same jobs over and over again at speeds we would n’t even dream possible for seemingly no reason whatsoever .
Why do they do this and what made them do this ?
These questions stem off from the general philosophical questions that have been bothering us since the beginning of time : “ Why are we here ?
How are we here ?
And who or what did this ? ”
9. Spontaneous Human Combustion
Spontaneous human combustion is probably the most controversial natural phenomenon .
Spontaneous combustion has been known to occur in other animals and such incidents have been observed and recorded .
Spontaneous combustion is defined as the burning of the human body without an external source of ignition , in other words , you explode for no reason whatsoever .
Evidence for this strange occurrence includes shrunken organs of the human body with clothing still attached , and several theories have been created .
One theory is the “ wick effect , ” which states that your clothing can absorb melted human fats and thus can act like the wick of a candle .
Scary , huh ?
8. Fire Rainbow
The circumhorizontal arc , or the fire rainbow , is an optical phenomenon caused by the refraction of sunlight through thick , flat , horizontal ice crystals in cirrus clouds .
Atmospheric conditions have to be very specific and perfect , and it can only be observed in certain locations of the world .
To get an idea of just how truly complicated things have to be for it to form , check out this quote from Wikipedia : “ In order to be observed , the sun must be very high in the sky , at an elevation of 57.8° ( 90 - 32.2° ) or more , and can only occur in the presence of cirrus clouds .
As a result it cannot be observed at locations north of 55 °N or south of 55 °S , although occasionally at higher latitudes from mountains .
In areas of Northern Europe it can only be observed around the time of the Summer solstice .
If cloud conditions are right it is seen along the horizon on the same side of the sky as the sun .
It reaches its maximum intensity at a sun elevation of 67.9° . ”
Has it really been photographed ?
7. Lucid Dreaming
Not all strange things occur in nature , but they sometimes can occur in ourselves .
But what about the mind ?
Lucid dreaming occurs when someone becomes aware that they are dreaming while in the dream .
While it may not sound so special on paper , imagine the endless possibilities of being able to have full control of your imagination .
Some people have even flown in their dreams and all of them say it is one of the thrilling experiences of their lives .
6. Moonbow
Everyone knows the rainbow and just how beautiful it is , but what about its not - so - distant and not - so - pretty cousin the moonbow ?
Moonbows are created when droplets of water combine with mists made from waterfalls to provide the perfect medium to produce this phenomenon .
Because the moon is not nearly as bright as the sun , moonbows are much harder to see than rainbows , but when you do , it is a sight to behold .
5. Ball Lightning
Ball lightning does not look like regular lightning .
Instead it takes the form of a glowing sphere drifting horizontally through the air .
It can vary in size from a minuscule pea to a large bus .
No real theories have been formed and yet at least five percent of the total population has seen ball lightning in some point of time .
4. Aurora Borealis
Undoubtedly one of the most beautiful events to occur in our world , the Aurora Borealis , also known as the Northern Lights , has both astounded and amazed people since it was first discovered .
It is much easier to stare at the phenomenon and enjoy its beauty than to understand why exactly it occurs .
Here ’s the “ concise ” explanation from http://finland.fi/finfo/English/aurora_borealis.html:“‘The sun gives off high - energy charged particles ( also called ions ) that travel out into space at speeds of 300 to 1200 kilometres per second .
A cloud of such particles is called a plasma .
The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind .
As the solar wind interacts with the edge of the earth ’s magnetic field , some of the particles are trapped by it and they follow the lines of magnetic force down into the ionosphere , the section of the earth ’s atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 600 kilometers above the earth ’s surface .
When the particles collide with the gases in the ionosphere they start to glow , producing the spectacle that we know as the auroras , northern and southern . ’”
3. Sprites
Sprites are large scale high - energy electrical discharges that occur above thunderstorm clouds .
They are caused by the discharges of positive lightning between a thunderstorm and the ground and give rise to a large variety of bright and unusual visual shapes .
Sprites have been reported since 1886 but only last for a few milliseconds and are very rare , so there are few photographs and videos of them .
2. Green Flashes
Sometimes , when the sun sets or rises , the top edge of that sun will appear to be a bright green , but one usually has to see it through a distant horizon .
Atmospheric conditions have to be nearly perfect with no clouds all the way down to the horizon .
It may last for around a second this phenomenon is called a green flash , and it is caused by a certain refraction of light in the atmosphere .
You can learn more about what causes green flashes here :

1. The Taos Hum
The Taos Hum is a low - frequency humming noise that occurs frequently in Taos , New Mexico .
Similar hums like the Taos Hum have been reported all over the world and have been attributed to sounds caused by machines or other industrial - related things .
The thing that makes the Taos Hum so special that it deserves a spot on this list is that no one has ever found the source of the hum , and what ’s even more interesting is that the sound is often intensified and much louder in buildings but is only heard by around 2 percent of the population .
You can download and listen to the hum here : http://www.eskimo.com/~bilb/freenrg/taos.wav

It 's hard to say what 's going on in the heads of children , but a new study shows how it 's going on .
Kids ' brains are organized differently than those of adults , scientists have learned through a series of brain scans .
The workings of children 's neural connections are more governed by proximity to one another than is the case in adult brains , said Steven E. Petersen of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
Petersen and his colleagues are interested in normal brain organization and development to learn more about how developmental disorders and brain injury can impair mental capabilities .
Their new findings on children 's brains could be used to develop new treatments for such disorders .
Story continues below ...
{{ video = " LS_090515_brain - changes " title= " How the Brain Changes as We Grow Up " caption = " Brains scans of volunteers age 7 to 31 shows how organizational structures in the human brain undergo a major shift . "
}}
Brain networks
The researchers use resting - state functional connectivity MRI to identify and study brain networks .
These scans show the spontaneous activity that takes place in brains while study subjects do nothing .
When this brain activity rises and falls at the same time in different brain regions , researchers conclude that those areas likely work together .
For the new study , Petersen and his colleagues scanned the brains of 210 subjects ranging from 7 to 31 years old .
Researchers set the lower limit for study subjects at 7 years of age because the brain is approximately 95 percent of its adult size at this age .
Previous research revealed four brain networks with varying responsibilities in the adult brain that typically involve tight links between several brain regions that are physically distant from each other .
The new research found that this is not the case in children : Instead of having networks made of brain regions that are distant from each other but functionally linked , most of the tightest connections in a child 's brain are between brain regions that are physically close to each other .
That does n't mean that kids are more scatter - brained than adults though .
" Regardless of how tempting it might be to assume otherwise , a normal child 's brain is not inherently disorganized or chaotic , " Petersen said .
" It 's differently organized but at least as capable as an adult brain . "
The scans also showed how the organization of the brain changes as we age .
" The result was a detailed movie of how the organizational transition from a child 's brain to an adult 's brain takes place .
It clearly shows a switch from localized networks based on physical proximity to long - distance networks centered on functionality , " said study team member Damien Fair , a graduate student at Washington University during the research , and now at Oregon Health and Science University .
As a person ages , those long - range networks become more efficient and then brain can use more of them , said study co-author Alex Cohen , a graduate student at Washington University .
" They 're trying to solve the task of being a brain in a human body , " he said .
Kevin Bacon on the brain
Researchers also checked children 's brains for " small - world " organization , another organizational quality present in adult brains .
This is the same idea as the game " six degrees of Kevin Bacon , " which connects any actor or actress to Kevin Bacon in six movies or less through their co-stars .
In this case , the " co-stars " are nodes in the brain .
" It 's the idea of a large network that lets you connect one node with another in a relatively short number of steps via special nodes , " Fair says .
" Like Kevin Bacon , these special nodes have many connections to other nodes , allowing them to help shorten the amount of steps that have to be taken when connecting nodes . "
Scientists already had some idea that children had many fewer long - distance links among brain regions than adults , but did n't know whether those connections could be seen in the function of the brain .
When they looked more closely they found there were enough of these links and nodes with multiple connections to establish small - world organization .
The researchers are now examining ways to adapt the study , detailed online in the journal PLoS Computational Biology , to the changing physical geography of younger brains .
The research was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation , John Merck Scholars Fund , Burroughs - Wellcome Fund , Dana Foundation , Ogle Family Fund , Washington University Chancellor 's Graduate Fellowship and UNCF / Merck Graduate and Postgraduate and Science Research Fellowship .
Just a few years ago downloading from the Internet was a relatively niche activity but now all kinds of big names are getting in on the action .
In a new promotion about to launch , motor manufacturer Mitsubishi has hidden parts of its new Colt car on BitTorrent sites and other P2P - networks .
First to find and assemble them all gets a free car .
When it comes to collecting pieces of something from the far - flung corners of the web and re-assembling them to make not only a cool , but also free item , BitTorrent users are the reigning champions of the Internet .
Time to turn those skills into hard cash – well , a car at least .
In preparation for a brand new promotion set to launch in hours , Japanese motor manufacturer Mitsubishi has ( virtually ) disassembled a brand new 2009 Colt car and uploaded its parts to the Internet .
The components ( 30 different types in all ) have been hidden on hundreds of regular plus BitTorrent and eDonkey websites .
Find the parts and win a car .
The first Internet user to find all 30 parts will be the winner of a brand new Mitsubishi Colt car – already assembled for their convenience .
The promotion is premiered to coincide with the launch of the Barcelona Motor Show , which begins this Friday May 8 .

Some of the brightest colors in nature are created by tiny nanostructures with a structure similar to beer foam or a sponge , according to Yale University researchers .
Most colors in nature — from the color of our skin to the green of trees — are produced by pigments .
But the bright blue feathers found in many birds , such as Bluebirds and Blue Jays , are instead produced by nanostructures .
Under an electron microscope , these structures look like sponges with air bubbles .
Now an interdisciplinary team of Yale engineers , physicists and evolutionary biologists has taken a step toward uncovering how these structures form .
They compared the nanostructures to examples of materials undergoing phase separation , in which mixtures of different substances become unstable and separate from one another , such as the carbon - dioxide bubbles that form when the top is popped off a bubbly drink .
They found that the color - producing structures in feathers appear to self - assemble in much the same manner .
Bubbles of water form in a protein - rich soup inside the living cell and are replaced with air as the feather grows .
Solved !
The research , which appears online in the journal Soft Matter , provides new insight into how organisms use self - assembly to produce color , and has important implications for the role color plays in birds ’ plumage , as the color produced depends entirely on the precise size and shape of these nanostructures .
“ Many biologists think that plumage color can encode information about quality – basically , that a bluer male is a better mate , ” said Richard Prum , chair of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and one of the paper ’s authors .
“ Such information would have to be encoded in the feather as the bubbles grow .
I think our hypothesis that phase separation is involved provides less opportunity for encoding information about quality than most biologists thought .
At the same time , it ’s exciting to think about other ways birds might be using phase separation .
” Eric Dufresne , lead author of the paper , is also interested in the potential technological applications of the finding .
“ We have found that nature elegantly self assembles intricate optical structures in bird feathers .
We are now mimicking this approach to make a new generation of optical materials in the lab , ” said Dufresne , assistant professor of mechanical engineering , chemical engineering and physics .
Prum believes it was the interdisciplinary approach the team took that led to their success – a result he plans on celebrating “ with another practical application of phase separation : champagne ! ” Article : Eric R.

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - General Motors Corp on Tuesday detailed plans to all but wipe out the holdings of remaining shareholders by issuing up to 60 billion new shares in a bid to pay off debt to the U.S. government , bondholders and the United Auto Workers union .
General Motors CEO Fritz Henderson pauses , as he talks about changes at GM including cutting 21,000 more factory jobs by 2010 and phasing out the Pontiac brand , during a news conference at GM headquarters in Detroit , Michigan April 27 , 2009 .

The unusual plan , which was detailed in a filing with U.S. securities regulators , would only need the approval of the U.S. Treasury to proceed since the U.S. government would be the majority shareholder of a new GM , the company said .
The flood of new stock issuance that could be unleashed has been widely expected by analysts who have long warned that GM ’s shares could be worthless whether the company restructures out of court or in bankruptcy .
The debt - for - equity exchanges detailed in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission would leave GM ’s stock investors with just 1 percent of the equity in a restructured automaker , ending a long run when the Dow component was seen as a bellwether for the strength of the broader U.S. economy .
GM shares closed on Tuesday at $ 1.85 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The stock would be worth just over 1 cent if the first phase of GM ’s restructuring moves forward as described .
Once GM has issued new shares to pay off its debt to the U.S. government , bondholders and its major union , it said it would then undertake a 1 - for - 100 reverse stock split .
Such a move would take the nominal value of the stock back to near where it had been before the flood of new shares .
But in the process , GM ’s existing shareholders would see their stake in the 100 - year - old automaker all but wiped out .
The automaker said it expected to draw another $ 2.6 billion from the U.S.
Treasury before a June 1 deadline set by the Obama administration for it to reach agreements with all of its key stakeholders .
That borrowing would take GM ’s debt to the U.S. government to $ 18 billion , and the automaker said it expected to have to borrow a total of nearly $ 27 billion .
GM has asked its three major creditor groups to write off at least $ 43 billion in debt in exchange for ownership of a restructured company .
By contrast , the current market value of GM ’s current 610 million shares is about $ 1.7 billion .
The stock has lost about 43 percent of its value since the start of the year .
GM bondholders , who are owed $ 27 billion , have also been offered new stock in exchange for writing off debt in a bond exchange the automaker launched last week .
The automaker is targeting a debt - reduction of at least $ 24 billion of its bond debt under the plan and has warned that it could be forced into bankruptcy if that can not be achieved .
Representatives of GM bondholders , who would be given a 10 - percent stake in the new company under the automaker ’s restructuring , have said they are being offered an unfairly low payout .
They have asked instead for a majority stake in the restructured company .
But GM has asked the U.S. autos task force to accept a majority stake in a new GM in exchange for at least half of the government debt that the automaker has run up over the past four months .
Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said on Tuesday that the U.S. Treasury , which oversees the task force , was continuing to evaluate the company ’s restructuring plan and its progress .
“ The Treasury will continue their evaluation through the month , which is fine .
But we ’re not waiting , we ’re implementing .
The bond exchange needed to be launched when we launched it , ” Henderson said .
“ Now we ’ll have to see . ”
In its filing , GM said it was in “ ongoing discussions ” with the U.S. Treasury on its proposal to swap government debt for equity in the largest U.S. automaker .
Finally , GM is negotiating with the UAW and is seeking to get the union to take GM stock in exchange for $ 10 billion owed to a trust fund for retiree healthcare .
Those talks were set to resume this week in Detroit , Henderson said .
GM said in its SEC filing that its three - pronged effort to slash debt could take its total authorized share issuance -- including new and existing shares -- to 62 billion shares .
Because food - related illnesses are so common , measuring whether food is getting safer or more dangerous is critical to public health .
But it is also a daunting challenge .
The disease control agency uses three very different methods to routinely track sickness caused by food .
Of these , FoodNet  the one whose most recent data were made public Thursday  is the most reliable , because government epidemiologists routinely survey more than 650 clinical laboratories that serve about 46 million people in 10 states .
Such active surveillance tends to be more accurate than other tools that rely on voluntary , and generally spotty , reporting by doctors and hospitals .
Even so , FoodNet captures only a tiny slice of all those sickened by food .
For a case to be included in FoodNet , someone must become sick enough to see a doctor , the doctor must be concerned or well trained enough to ask for and get a stool sample , and the laboratory to which the doctor sends the sample must be part of the government ’s system .
Since 1996 , when the system began , the burden of illness from campylobacter , listeria , shigella , E. coli O157 and Yersinia has decreased , although all of that decrease occurred before 2004 .
There has been no statistically significant change in the incidence of salmonella and cryptosporidium since 1996 , and there has been a marked increase in cases of vibrio , a relatively rare disease mostly associated with raw oysters .
There are unexplained variations in infection rates among the 10 states in the FoodNet system .
The incidence of campylobacter , for instance , is highest in California , while salmonella infections are highest in New Mexico and Georgia .
Geographic differences in diet may be the cause , officials said .
Dr. Tim Jones , the state epidemiologist in Tennessee , said many of the easy improvements in the nation ’s food - safety system had already been made .
“ You can only tell people so much to wash their cutting boards and wash their hands , ” Dr. Jones said .
“ I think we ’re running out of things to do to make dramatic improvements . ”
Even as the government issued its report , the Texas Department of State Health Services announced Thursday that it had assessed a $ 14.6 million fine against a Texas plant owned by the Peanut Corporation of America , the company involved in a national salmonella outbreak that sickened nearly 700 people .
The fine resulted from violations that included unsanitary conditions and product contamination .
The plant was closed in February .
Computing Gröbner bases in Haskell
20 March 2009 at 7:47 pm
I wrote a small package to compute Gröbner bases in Haskell with the Buchberger algorithm ( with applications to variable elimination ) .
Performance is quite bad compared to specialised software like Macaulay , but it seems to work !
I put a Cabal package here .
Maybe I ’ll add several functions afterwards .
A testcase :
import Data.Polynomial
import Data .
Ring
import Algebra.GroebnerBasis
import Algebra .
Elimination
type R = Polynom QQ VarXYZ
[ x , y , z , t , u , v ] = map returnp [ X , Y , Z, T , U , V ] : : [ R ]
-- projection from a point on the intersection of quadrics
main = do
print $ step_eliminate [ T ] $ MakeIdeal
[ x ^2 - 3 * y* z + z*t +
2*x*t ,
z ^2 + 5 * y^2 + z*x - 2*t*z ]
The output should be :
[ x*y ^2+2/5*x^2*z+1/2*y^2*z+3/10*x*z^2+-3/5*y*z^2+1/10*z^3 ]

OMG So Cute Dept. : Majesco said Wednesday that it will revive the cult classic NES game A Boy and His Blob for Wii , releasing unto the world this batch of heartbreakingly adorable screenshots .
Developed by WayForward , creators of critically acclaimed games like Contra IV and Shantae , the game will be released this holiday season .
2009 is the 20th anniversary of the original 8 - bit game 's release .
One of the last console games created by legendary Activision guru David Crane , * A Boy and His Blob * featured stunningly innovative gameplay – you fed your Blob from your bag of many - flavored jellybeans , which caused him to transform into a variety of different helpful items .
Using your transformed Blob was key to solving the game 's puzzles , collecting enough items so that you could return to the Blob 's home planet and defeat the evil emperor .
What the NES game did not have was graphics this unbelievably cute .

President Obama ’s selection Saturday of former astronaut Charles F. Bolden Jr. to head NASA gives a boost to the agency ’s manned space program and its stated goal of returning humans to the moon by 2020 .
During the presidential campaign , Obama had seemed lukewarm toward NASA and its hugely expensive human spaceflight program .
Space enthusiasts were particularly worried after Obama staffers floated the idea of taking money from the agency to fund domestic programs .
But now , with the selection of a retired Marine general and astronaut to run the agency , observers are asking whether this means the president has suddenly gotten religion for manned spaceflight .
The answer , according to space policy experts and NASA watchers around the country , is a qualified yes .
Advertisement
They say Bolden ’s view on specific projects , such as extending the shuttle program beyond the 2010 retirement date chosen by the Bush administration , are still emerging , but his knowledge of the space agency ’s inner mechanics make him a strong voice for continuing manned flight .
“ Clearly Charlie Bolden would not have taken the job if he were being asked to shut down human spaceflight , ” said John Logsdon , a space policy expert in Washington .
Bolden ’s name surfaced early and gained momentum , based on his record as an astronaut and his military record of flying more than 100 Marine combat missions in Vietnam .
He would also be the first African American administrator of NASA .
The announcement was supposed to coincide with the return of the shuttle Atlantis on Saturday .
But bad weather over Cape Canaveral in Florida caused shuttle controllers to wave off the landing for a second day .
Rather than keep the guessing game going , the White House announced Bolden ’s selection .
Advertisement
Bolden , 62 , would be the second astronaut to run the agency .
Richard H. Truly , a retired Navy vice admiral and shuttle commander , led NASA from 1989 to 1992 .
Bolden has been on four shuttle missions and was the pilot on the flight that put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit in 1990 .
He lives near the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , who was among the crew on Bolden ’s first shuttle flight , played an important role in the selection .
Nelson led the charge against Obama ’s first choice for administrator , retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. J. Scott Gration , and was an early and vocal advocate for Bolden .
“ I trusted Charlie with my life -- and would do so again , ” Nelson said .

Former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin called Bolden “ a great choice . ”
“ He deserves the status of national hero .
This is a guy who has spent most of his life serving his country , ” Griffin said .
Logsdon said he believed the skepticism about Obama ’s support for manned flight was “ misguided ” from the first .
The comment about taking money from NASA was made by a junior campaign aide , he said .
He added that a recent announcement of the administration ’s plans to review the Ares 1 rocket and Orion spacecraft , which are to replace the space shuttle by 2015 , is not a shot across the bow of NASA ’s human spaceflight program .

He said it would be a review of the hardware , not the destination or goals .
Roger Launius , a space expert at the Smithsonian Institution , said it was too soon to know how aggressively Bolden would support President George W. Bush ’s plan of returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and later going to Mars .
Or whether Bolden would , as many expect , extend the life of the shuttle program to close the nearly five - year gap between the last scheduled shuttle flight and the first planned flight of the Ares - Orion system , a period during which NASA astronauts would have to beg rides on Soviet rockets .
“ We do n’t know exactly what this means yet , ” Launius said .
But “ I think in Charlie Bolden you ’ll have an individual who will be strong enough to speak to the administration ” when he thinks the agency is going in the wrong direction .
One possible stumbling block to Bolden ’s approval by the Senate could be new ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest .
An Obama executive order prohibits appointees from doing work that is “ directly and substantially related ” to a former employer or former clients .

Until March 2008 , Bolden served on the board of directors for Rancho Cordova , Calif . - based GenCorp Inc. , whose Aerojet subsidiary makes propulsion systems and maneuvering engines for the space shuttle and the Orion spacecraft .
He would probably need a “ limited waiver ” from the regulations to head NASA .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Phishing scams have grown up from the unsophisticated swindles of the past in which fake Nigerian princes e-mailed victims , who would get a big windfall if they just provide their bank account number .
This Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) computer screen image shows an online forum called " Dark Market " where it educates users where to buy skimming devices to penetrate bank accounts , how to distribute malware through spam , and buy stolen credit cards among other things .

Even as authorities try to stamp out that con and other e-mail and online scams , scammers are getting more wily and finding new loopholes to exploit .
The vast majority of e-mail is spam and an unknown percentage of that is meant to defraud .
The scale of electronic fraud means that that the criminals can make huge profits even if only a small percentage of people are duped .
Phishing commonly refers to hoax e-mails purportedly from banks or other trustworthy sources that seek to trick recipients into revealing bank or credit card account numbers and passwords .
The U.S. government scored a big victory in November when the web hosting company McColo Corp. was taken offline .
Estimates vary , but the Washington Post said that 75 percent of spam worldwide had been sent through that single company .
But the spam e-mails offering celebrity diets , cheap printer ink , erased credit card debt and amazing orgasms quickly found a new way to inboxes , according to Google ’s security subsidiary Postini .
Now spammers use a variety of computers to send out spam e-mails to obscure their origins , meaning that a dramatic McColo - style takedown will be harder to reproduce , said Adam Swidler , product marketing manager for Google ’s Postini .
And they ’ve largely abandoned scams that are easy to see through -- like the Nigerian prince -- in favor of more sophisticated “ location - based spam , ” which directs the victim to a Web site discussing a local disaster or similar issue .
If they click on the offered video , the Web site downloads a virus to the user ’s computer , Google said in a blog on security .
Tim Cranton , a Microsoft cybersecurity expert , said there was no way to know how much money is stolen .
“ We do n’t have a way to estimate numbers because there are so many victims that you ’re not aware of , ” he said .
WHAT IS ‘ SMISHING ’?
New technology means new ways to steal .
One of the latest is “ smishing , ” which is nothing more than a phishing fraud sent via SMS text messaging .
E -con artists are getting more sophisticated in approaching potential victims .
One tactic has been to write spam that purports to come from a trusted source , like Paypal .
When Paypal , which is owned by eBay , learned that spammers were using its name , they put a digital signature on their e-mails and asked providers like Yahoo and Google to block any e-mail purporting to come from them which did not have that signature .
“ We know how many they throw away and it ’s approximately speaking about 10 million a month , ” said Michael Barrett , Paypal ’s chief information security officer .
“ If the consumer never sees the e-mail in the first place then it ’s hard for them to get victimized . ”
“ Phishing was not just impacting consumers , in terms of general loss , it was impacting their view of the safety of the Internet and that it was indirectly damaging our brand , ” added Barrett .
Security experts say they are seeing more and more shifts from outright fraud , where the victim will hand over their money , to the use of malware , basically malicious software which , among other things , collects passwords and credit card numbers for thieves .
“ Those will then be sold on the underground market , ” said David Marcus , a threat research expert at McAfee computer security firm .
The person purchasing the passwords and card numbers will use that information to make purchases , get cash or create fake identities .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation , working with police in the United Kingdom , Turkey and Germany , shut down one such online forum called Dark Market in October 2008 which , at its peak , had more than 2,500 registered members , according an FBI press release issued at the time .
But experts agreed that they did n’t expect the problem to go away anytime soon , and that more people out of work could well mean more people like to fall for scams .
Marcus said many of the scams were nothing more than the digital equivalent of confidence tricks , although on a massive scale that can net some scammers more than $ 100,000 a month .
“ These things only have to be 2 percent successful , ” he said .
“ Those campaigns are sent out to tens of millions of people at the same time .
How can you tell when U.S. forces in Afghanistan are operating alone ?
When they call it “ the coalition ” .
That ’s not a joke .
It ’s just how things work in Afghanistan , where two separate forces with two separate command structures — one completely American , the other about half American — operate side by side under the command of the same U.S. general .
“ When we say ‘ coalition ’ , basically that means it ’s just us , ” a helpful U.S. military spokeswoman explained last month to a reporter who had just arrived in country after being away for a couple of years .
“ Otherwise , it ’s the ‘ alliance ’ . ”
And it ’s not just words .
“ The alliance ” and “ the coalition ” maintain completely separate press offices , each of which is often allowed to give only bits and pieces of detail about the same incident .
The result can be a bit confusing .
First , some history .
The “ coalition ” refers to Operation Enduring Freedom , the U.S. ( or , as they like to say , “ U.S. - led ” ) mission ordered by President George W. Bush back in 2001 to catch Osama bin Laden and overthrow the Taliban .
Occasionally over the past eight years it has actually operated as a coalition , with contributions from Britain and other countries .
But these days , it ’s strictly an American mission , with thousands of U.S. troops engaged in hunting insurgents , training Afghans and providing air support .
( Well , maybe not quite strictly American : there could be a handful of British or Australian special forces in there too .
But that ’s a secret . )
“ The alliance ” , meanwhile , refers to NATO , which now leads the International Security Assistance Force , set up by the United Nations to provide a small number of mostly European peacekeepers for the capital after the fall of the Taliban , also back in 2001 .
ISAF ’s role gradually expanded until 2006 , when it spread throughout the country , got a lot bigger and began fighting the Taliban , especially in the south and east .
ISAF now includes contributions from around 40 nations , but these days the force is about half American and getting more so by the week as thousands of U.S. reinforcements arrive .
Since last year , ISAF and “ the coalition ” have both been commanded by the same U.S. General , David McKiernan , who is about to be replaced by another , Stanley McChrystal .
Because ISAF — unlike “ the coalition ” — actually IS a coalition , it has stringent rules on what its members let it say .
When its troops are involved in an incident , ISAF wo n’t say what country they come from , or precisely where in Afghanistan the incident took place .
The defence ministry of each country is supposed to reveal that information back home , but that can take hours or even days .
And if troops from more than one Western country are involved — not to mention Afghan soldiers and police — piecing details together can require the skills of Sherlock Holmes .
Here ’s an example : a few weeks ago , “ the coalition ” said one of its soldiers was killed in an incident .
NATO said four of its soldiers had died .
Neither said where : somewhere in eastern Afghanistan .
It took several hours and phone calls throughout Afghanistan and Riga to determine that three of the soldiers were Americans , two were Latvians , and that the incident was the same as one Afghan troops had already reported in Kunar province .
The investigation ended with a conversation that went like something like this :
Reuters :
You ’ve said one American was killed , right ?
U.S. military spokeswoman :
That ’s what we ’ve said , yes .
Reuters :
And four NATO soldiers were also killed , right ?
U.S. military spokeswoman :
Yes , that ’s what ISAF has said .
Reuters :
And two of those NATO soldiers were also American ?
U.S. military spokeswoman : Yes , I can confirm that .
Reuters :
So actually three Americans were killed , yes ?
U.S. military spokeswoman :
Yes , that ’s correct .
Confused ?
Join the coalition …
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As the economy melted down last year , so did CEO paychecks .
The average compensation for 200 chief executives at America 's largest public companies fell 5.1 % last year to $ 10.8 million , according to a survey published Sunday by the New York Times and research firm Equilar .
The decline marked the first time in five years that top executives ' pay packages shrank compared to the year before .
" We could begin to see a fundamental sea change in the compensation of executives , " Charles M. Elson , director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware , told the Times .
" If shareholder value has fallen , so should the value of the executive pay package . "
Last year 's biggest payday went to Sanjay Jha of Motorola ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) , who was lured away from Qualcomm in August to try to turn around Motorola 's struggling mobile phone business .
Jha earned $ 104.4 million in total compensation , although almost all of it - $ 103.6 million - came from stock options and grants .
Jha's co-CEO at Motorola , Gregory Brown , had a 2008 pay package that totaled $ 24.2 million .
Other top earners were Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) CEO Larry Ellison , with total compensation of $ 84.6 million ; Walt Disney 's ( DIS , Fortune 500 ) Robert Iger ( $ 51.1 million ) ; American Express 's ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) Kenneth Chenault ( $ 42.8 million ) ; and Citigroup 's ( C , Fortune 500 ) Vikram Pandit ( $ 38.2 million ) .
The New York Times / Equilar calculations include executives ' base salary , cash bonuses , perks , stock options and grants .
The biggest cash bonus of the year went to Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) CEO Mark Hurd , who made $ 23.9 million extra on top of his $ 1.5 million salary .
Unsurprisingly , CEOs of financial services companies saw the biggest decline in their paychecks .
The median compensation of those in the study - a group that includes troubled giants like Bank of America and Citigroup - fell 40 % .
But in other fields , executive pay rose .
In technology , median CEO pay rose 10 % last year , while health care CEOs commanded highest median pay : $ 13.8 million .
" We are witnessing a seismic shift among top corporate earners , " Equilar research manager Alexander Cwirko - Godycki told the Times .
" Wall Street and the financial sector were once at the pinnacle of the corporate world , and their pay reflected that .
Because of the current crisis , we see new pay leaders emerging , particularly in health care and technology .
To some extent , that probably reflects where the future strengths in this economy lie . "

I have a very good friend who is from Eastern Europe , a country in the former Eastern Bloc where gypsies roam and belief in the paranormal flourishes .
It ’s little wonder , for a country that took its first steps out of a modern Dark Age only twenty some years ago , that its people are deeply accustomed to folk wisdom and traditional healing methods .
In a nation whose healthcare system was decades behind the world and offered few tools of value , you often were better off staying home and applying a poultice .
One night we were out for drinks and were discussing a few Skeptoid episodes where I ’d discussed various non-scientific alternatives to healthcare .
Soon , he ’d had enough .
And he told a story that went about like this :
“ In my village there is an old man who cures people .
He ’s well known throughout the region , and people come from all over just to see him .
And they do it because it works .
All day , every day , he has a long line of people waiting outside his door .
They bring their elderly , their children , their sick .
No matter what their problem is , he heals them by the laying on of his hands .
He ’s poor and does n’t do it for money .
He does n’t want fame or thanks .
He only wants to help people .
What do you say about that , Mr. Skeptic ? ”
And , I should mention , my friend was quite passionate about it .
He ’s also 6 ’ 5 ″ and had a couple beers in him .
Not someone you want to contradict when his blood is up .
But I had no desire to contradict him or argue with him anyway .
However , nothing would please me more than to see his loyalties move away from folk medicine and toward modern medicine .
In his profession he gets injured sometimes , and avoids treating his injuries ; thus they persist , to the detriment of his career .
His other friends and I have urged him to see a doctor , but one characteristic of many immigrants is that they often have a large circle of fellow countrymen ; so he always has as much , or more , support from his folk medicine friends as he ’ll ever hear from us .
Now it ’s one thing to sit in the comfort of your office , research materials close at hand , and contemplatively write a well - framed argument to make a point .
It ’s quite another to have something sprung on you by surprise in a social situation .
Everyone was expecting me to take him on , but I did n’t have my ducks in a row , and I really did n’t want to offend my buddy .
I was concerned about coming off as a blabbering , hateful , closed - minded skeptic .
Frankly , my usual preference would have been to change the subject and move on .
I think that ’s usually best in such a situation .
But he would n’t have it .
He really wanted to know what my problem was with the old man .
( He rightly assumed that I ’d be skeptical of the old man , in fact I had n’t even said anything yet . )
So I was dragged into battle .
There are a number of ways I could have gone :
Be the nice , positive skeptic .
Say that the prospect of such a thing is very exciting , and that I eagerly await its being tested and proven and certified and made available to the rest of the world .
A more cynical and confrontational approach .
If he can do these miracles , why has n’t he won Randi ’s million dollars ?
Why has he jealously kept this power to himself and not given it to the rest of the world ; is he an asshole ?
Apply the scientific method .
I ca n’t comment on this guy specifically because I do n’t know anything about him ; but many other claimants to such powers have come forward and failed to perform once controls were applied .
So despite your personal experience with the old man , I would need to see him perform under controlled conditions in order to be convinced .
# 1 is probably the best choice in such a situation where friendships are on the line .
It shows open mindedness , it expresses a positive attitude about the old man , and it even hints at the need for testing .
But it does n’t encourage my friend to think more critically in a way that ’s likely to lead him to seek useful treatment for his own injuries .
# 2 is rarely successful .
It ’s like the dark side of The Force .
It ’s easy and seductive .
Anyone can be confrontational .
While it ’s intended to raise alarm about the old man ’s motives , it does n’t have that effect .
Instead it builds barricades , it draws lines in the sand .
It encourages disagreement and fighting .
And that ’s the wrong path to take when the goal is enlightenment and knowledge .
# 3 is kind of a compromise .
It lacks the argumentative edge of # 2 , but it also lacks the positive tone of # 1 .
It ’s a good way to put the debate to rest quickly , because it ’s not really something that can be argued against .
It ’s intended to plant the seeds of skepticism , and help my friend to conclude “ Hey , maybe I should also demand a higher standard of evidence . ”
In this case , I doubt that it would have that result .
My friend knew friends of friends who had been cured by the old man , and that ’s a profound experience in his mind .
In his mind , the old man has already passed all the tests he needs , with flying colors .
A great way to follow up # 3 is to cite other examples of controlled tests from other sciences .
Most people love to hear about exciting science , and if it ’s clear that it ’s going to be hard to plant the seed you want , you can always make some progress planting a similar seed .
The best thing to do would have been to start with # 1 to set the right tone , and to let my friend see that I ’m on his side , and that our goals are the same :
To bring better treatments to the world .
This establishment of shared motivations is essential .
And then , in discussion , gradually move into # 3 .
I ’d probably avoid saying something as specific as this old man has not passed any controlled tests .
That would be too confrontational , and anyway my friend has not tried to argue that the man has passed any controlled tests .
Move the conversation away from the sore point , and talk about other exciting areas of science where tests have been applied .
What could have become a debate turns into a shared adventure through science , and it instills proper appreciation for good science .
What I ended up doing , however , was not the right thing .
I tried to open with # 3 , but I did so as a preamble to a great , raging tirade on # 2 .
Essentially , I made the worst argument possible .
I did offend my friend ; I did not in the slightest encourage him to reconsider his own mistrust of evidence based medicine ; and I made myself look like a jackass whose opinion is not likely to be sought again .
Such failures are how we gain experience .
The important point is to be able to learn from such experience , and to do a better job next time .
I ’ve done that to some degree , but there is always room for improvement .
Helping people to understand the way the world works , and to be able to make good life decisions based on good information , is important work ; and we can all do a better job of it .
Israel is suspected of committing war crimes in its recent offense on the Gaza Strip .
( Hatem Omar / MaanImages )
The following press release was issued on 23 April 2008 :
Calling the Israeli military ’s self - exoneration “ lacking in credibility , ” the National Lawyers Guild ( NLG ) on Thursday categorically rejected the Israeli military ’s findings that its soldiers did not commit war crimes during “ Operation Cast Lead ” in the Gaza Strip .
The NLG reiterates its call to US President Barack Obama to lend strong support to the UN — commissioned investigation into the conduct of both Israel and Hamas during Israel ’s 22 - day offensive — something Hamas has already agreed to , but Israel has indicated it will block .
“ The Israeli military ’s conclusions that it acted in accordance with international law are at odds with the findings of several organizations including our own , ” said Vermont - based attorney James Marc Leas , part of an NLG fact - finding delegation to Gaza .
“ This discrepancy underscores the importance of an independent investigation . ”
The Israeli military claims that it made a small number of errors and that no civilians were purposefully harmed by Israeli troops .
The NLG delegation traveled to the Gaza Strip from 2 - 8 February 2009 , to investigate the circumstances that led to the high rate of Palestinian casualties during Israel ’s offensive .
Contradicting Deputy Chief of Staff Maj - Gen Dan Harel ’s claim that no Israeli soldier ever deliberately targeted Palestinian civilians , the Delegation ’s 37 - page report , released earlier this month , documents a number of disturbing instances of Israeli soldiers engaging in the willful killing of Palestinian civilians .
One such case is that of Khaled Abed Rabbo .
Israeli soldiers shot dead Abed Rabbo ’s two young daughters and severely injured a third daughter while his family stood , carrying white flags , in front of the soldiers .
Another incident is that of 72 - year old Ahmed Shrahi .
Israeli soldiers shot the unarmed Shrahi from a distance and then approached to execute him at close range .
On the issue of Israel ’s use of white phosphorus , the military report concluded that use of the shells adhered to the restrictions imposed by international law .
According to Israeli military officials , the military decided to halt use of white phosphorous on 7 January after receiving criticism .
Nonetheless , several incidents in which phosphorus shells were used were recorded after the military claims it gave a cease and desist order , including on a United Nations warehouse , located in the center of Gaza City , on 15 January .
Following the release of the investigation results , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that the army ’s willingness to probe itself “ proves that the IDF [ Israeli army ] is one of the most moral armies in the world . ”
The NLG considers a whitewash and attempt to cover possible violations of international law and war crimes as the antithesis of morality .
“ If Israel has nothing to hide then it should cooperate fully with the UN investigation , ” said Huwaida Arraf , one of the organizers of the delegation .
“ Since Israel receives over $ 3 billion in military aid annually , the US should do its part insisting that Israel complies with the law of nations . ”

Just a handful of people have proved willing to negotiate miles of red tape and pay tens of thousands of dollars for the right to sell you cart food more interesting than the lowly hot dog .
Eight vendors finally will be allowed to peddle their ethnic specialties in May , including jerk chicken and pad thai .
It 's been a long time coming .
Nearly two years have passed since Queen 's Park amended regulations to expand the cuisine on Toronto 's streets beyond hot dogs and sausages .
But actually bringing in the variety of street foods that flavours other cities around the world quickly got mired in red tape in Toronto .
City officials were keen to control the process , citing concerns about food safety , nutrition and preventing conglomerates .
Yesterday , at least one of the successful applicants was cautious about her chances for success .
" This is new .
This is expensive , " said Bridgette Pinder , who had to borrow money to finance her Caribbean - fusion food cart at Yonge and St. Clair .
" It 's been very tough .
I have n't jumped all the hurdles yet ... I have a good product .
You take a chance . "
Vendors will have to fork over between $ 21,000 and $ 28,000 for new carts chosen by the city , plus pay annual location fees ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 .
In return they get near - monopolies at one of eight locations .
At one point , the city considered borrowing $ 700,000 to buy carts and lease them to vendors in an effort to prevent " cart conglomerates " from emerging , but that was quickly shot down as a waste of taxpayer money .
Then the city looked at getting a private foundation to fund the carts , and then there was even talk of a five - year pilot project .
Eventually , the latest model – called " a la Cart " – was set up to place carts in 13 locations across the city .
Though scores of would - be cart owners packed meetings to introduce the program , many were discouraged by the city 's stiff requirements .
Only 19 applied to participate , and 12 finalists made it to a taste test with a four - chef judging panel .
In the end , just eight vendors were announced yesterday after a rigorous selection process that included scoring for nutrition , food safety , locally produced food , ethnic diversity , taste and business plan .
Suman Roy , one of the judges , praised all the finalists , saying the food had a home - cooked quality .
" It was more heart to heart ... something a mother or grandmother would make at home .
The flavours were there , " Roy said .
However , three candidates withdrew when they did not get their pick of a location , which was determined based on overall scores .
Another dropped out , citing personal reasons .
It is unclear whether the daunting financial investment was a factor .
It 's also unclear how easy it will be for the vendors to turn a profit .
Menu items will be priced from about $ 3 to $ 7 .

Councillor John Filion , who spearheaded the street food idea , attributed the small number of applicants to uncertainty and the investment required .
" It was a significant financial outlay .
I think some people wanted to wait and see how it went . "
The pilot will run three years , but officials will assess it this fall to consider expanding it .
The program requires owners to spend at least 70 per cent of the operating time at the cart themselves to ensure they are owner - operated .
Andnet Zere , an immigrant from Eritrea , plans to set up her cart at the Roundhouse Park near the convention centre from 11 a.m. to midnight or even beyond .
" During the summer , I hear people are walking around at 2 or 3 in the morning , and I will accommodate that , " said Zere , a registered practical nurse who will cut back her hours at Humber River Regional hospital to work at the cart with her husband , Michael Kifle , selling injera , a type of wrap .
Councillor Karen Stintz says the food cart saga shows how difficult it is to do business with the city .
" Our goal was to provide healthy options , " she said .
" For the last two years , we have been mired in regulation . "
Hot dog vendor Marianne Moroney complained the city has a bias against hot dog vendors , pointing out that existing sellers were shut out of the program .
" They chose to overlook the existing industry completely , " said Moroney , executive director of a 100 - member association of hot dog vendors .
The city also has plans to allow 15 existing hot dog vendors , for a $ 1,000 fee , to offer an expanded menu of healthier foods such as bagels , salads and fresh fruits and vegetables – but that pilot project is still in the works .

Exercise triggers chemical changes in the body Taking vitamins after exercise may undo some of the beneficial effects of the workout , research suggests .
Some advocate taking antioxidants like vitamin C and E to help protect the body from harmful chemical by - products it creates in breaking into a sweat .
But German scientists now believe these " free radicals " may actually be good for us and even buffer against diabetes , PNAS reports .
And mopping them up with antioxidants may do more harm than good .
Sometimes we need to consider whether taking supplements is actually beneficial
Dr Sarah Aldred
Exercise biochemistry expert at the University of Birmingham
It is thought that antioxidant vitamins may be able to prevent damage to the body 's tissues called " oxidative stress " by eliminating the free radicals which are said to cause it .
This damage has been implicated in several major diseases including cancer and heart disease as well as normal ageing .
But Dr Michael Ristow , of the University of Jena , and his team have shown free radicals may have a positive effect on the body by increasing its sensitivity to insulin - something that is lost in type 2 diabetes .
And this effect is blocked by antioxidant vitamins .
Too much of a good thing Men who took vitamin C and E supplements showed no changes in their free radical levels , whereas those who did not take these antioxidants showed increased levels of free radical oxidative stress .
After four weeks of intensive exercise training , insulin sensitivity was restored only in the group of men who did not take antioxidant supplements .
The men who took the vitamin supplements fared worse , metabolically .
Dr Sarah Aldred , a lecturer in exercise biochemistry at the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Birmingham , said : " It does n't mean that antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E are bad for us , it just means that sometimes we need to consider whether taking supplements is actually beneficial .
" As this study shows it is not actually always the case . "
Dr Elisabeth Weichselbaum of the British Nutrition Foundation said : " Antioxidants protect the cells in your body from damage and therefore help to reduce the risk of certain diseases such as cancer .
" But you should not consume high doses on a regular basis as this can have negative effects on your body .
" If you stick to a healthy and varied diet , you generally get enough of the nutrients you need and you do n't run the risk of consuming large amounts that may be harmful for you . "

For a few hours , there were distinct bouts of excitement over the net as many thought that Microsoft would be announcing the availability of free online streaming service , Hulu , on the popular Xbox 360 .
The commotion was caused by Olivia Munn , presenter of " Attack of the Show " , who updated her Twitter account with a message saying " Just finished promos for hulu / microsoft event I 'm doing on june 8 ! "
She was actually referring to a Microsoft Bing event , not to a Hulu / Microsoft partnership but these few words were enough to start the rumour .
But a Hulu integration with Microsoft's Xbox Live system is perfectly viable .
The gaming platform , which now has sold more than 30 million units , will be offering Sky Live TV via Microsoft 's Xbox Live through the user 's broadband line .
Hulu could be the US - counterpart of Sky in the UK , albeit as a free version .
According to Gizmodo , Microsoft has already said that they will be investigating Hulu compatibility with the Xbox 360 .
The online video streaming service , co-owned by NBC , Fox , Disney and many other networks and studios , has also released a new desktop client which could well be the beginning of a plan to make Hulu more universal .
and join more than 1450 other followers .
Our Comments
Users are already able to watch movies through the Xbox Live and Netflix .
The latter offers a wide variety of instantly watchable movies and TV episodes on the Xbox 360 console for as little as $ 4.99 a month .

As a government owned corporation the BBC has a duty to educate , and be evenhanded in its dealings with subjects .
Yet in a recent segment on their long - running ' Film ' program , currently hosted by Jonathon Ross , the BBC ran a biased segment straight from the MPAA .
The BBC on the other hand , believes it was fair and balanced .
Let ’s get things straight from the off , we know that as a major television producer the BBC has a vested interest in the goings on of copyright policy .
However , the BBC also has a mission to ‘ inform , educate and entertain ’ , so when the March 31st edition of “ Film 2009 with Jonathon Ross ” featured a section talking about piracy , it was worth investigating .
The 5 minute segment focused on an MPAA funded study by a group called the RAND corporation .
The study – which was widely criticized early last month – is back with a new coat of paint .
This time though , it ’s being broadcast to the movie - going British public with the appearance of solid fact , and has addressed none of the questions we brought up just after the study was released .
Perhaps the choice of interviewees might shed some light on ‘ why ? ’ a bit better .
* Keiron Sharp – Director General , Federation Against Copyright
Theft .
* John Woodward – CEO , UK Film Council .
* Gregory Treverton – Director of RAND , the study ’s authors .
* Callum McDougall – Executive Producer for Quantum of Solace .
This selection seems to be a bit one sided to say the least .
If you ’re wondering what ’s so special about the last name , it might be because you did n’t go to see that film at the cinema .
Just before the film was played , a short advert voiced by Quantum star Daniel Craig , talked about how “ piracy was costing people jobs ” .
McDougall also gave a speech last winter to a UK copyright industry lobby group saying how the industry will fall “ like a house of cards ” if downloading continues at current levels .
This same group , the Industry Trust for IP Awareness , tried to push much the same message on terrorism and piracy almost 5 years ago .
One of our readers was angered by the bias of the segment and wrote a complaint to the BBC .
After a few weeks of waiting a reply came back from BBC Complaints , and it was none too satisfying .
Thank you for your e-mail regarding ‘ Film 2009 with Jonathan Ross ’ as broadcast on 31 March .
I note you felt the report on this programme about copyright theft was n’t adequately balanced as it only featured interviews with people from the film industry .
I appreciate you felt we allowed a distorted view of this issue to be portrayed and note you have strong views regarding this matter .
This report focused in on a legitimate problem for both the film industry and the authorities as they try to tackle what is an ever increasing and profitable criminal activity .
We feel the report outlined the laws surrounding the issue of film piracy adequately and that the interviewees from the film industry were entirely appropriate people to comment on the problem .
Impartiality is the cornerstone of all our output , and we feel this report was fully balanced in it ’s coverage of copyright theft .
Nevertheless I appreciate our audience has a wide range of opinions and inevitably this means that not every viewer will agree with the content of every programme we broadcast .
We know all our editorial decisions are subjective and we ’d never expect our audience to agree with every decision we make .
With this in mind that I ’d like to take this opportunity to assure you that I ’ve recorded your comments , including that you believe this topic deserves a more in depth investigation , onto our audience log .
This is an internal daily report of audience feedback which is circulated to many BBC staff including senior management , producers and channel controllers .
The audience logs are seen as important documents that can help shape decisions about future programming and content .
Thanks again for contacting us .

Of course , there ’s also a fine piece of irony in this show .
The preceding segment was about a film called ‘ The Boat That Rocked ‘ , a film about a 60 ’s pirate radio station .
The irony is that it ’s written and directed by one Richard Curtis .
The same Richard Curtis that last year co-signed a letter to The Times urging ISPs to stop piracy .
It seems it ’s only ok to profit from piracy , if you ’re making a film about it .
UPDATE : The video of the segment is now available .
Governments are ignoring the poorest people 's basic needs , Amnesty says
The global economic crisis is exacerbating human rights abuses , Amnesty International has warned .
In its annual report , the group said the downturn had distracted attention from abuses and created new problems .
Rising prices meant millions were struggling to meet basic needs in Africa and Asia , it said , and protests were being met with repression .
Political conflict meant people were suffering in DR Congo , North Korea , Gaza and Darfur , among others , it said .
' Time - bomb '
The 400 - page report , compiled in 157 countries , said that human rights were being relegated to the back seat in pursuit of global economic recovery .
See region by region
The world 's poorest people were bearing the brunt of the economic downturn , Amnesty said , and millions of people were facing insecurity and indignity .
Migrant workers in China , indigenous groups in Latin America and those who struggled to meet basic needs in Africa had all been hit hard , it said .

Where people had tried to protest , their actions had in many cases been met with repression and violence .
The group warned that rising poverty could lead to instability and mass violence .
" The underlying global economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis : a combination of social , economic and political problems has created a time - bomb of human rights abuses , " said Amnesty 's Secretary General , Irene Khan .
The group is launching a new campaign called Demand Dignity aimed at tackling the marginalisation of millions through poverty .
World leaders should set an example and invest in human rights as purposefully as they invest in economic growth , Ms Khan said .
" Economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations , " she said .
See below for highlights of the report by region AFRICA Amnesty says the economic crisis has had a direct impact on human rights abuses on the continent .
" People came into the streets to protest against the high cost of living , " Erwin van der Borght , Amnesty 's Africa programme director , told the BBC's Network Africa programme .

" The reaction we saw from the authorities was very repressive .
For example , in Cameroon about 100 people were killed in February last year . "
But the bulk of Amnesty 's report concentrated on the continent 's three main conflict zones : the Democratic Republic of Congo , Somalia and Sudan .
In DR Congo , the focus was on the east where it said civilians had suffered terribly at the hands of government soldiers and rebel groups .
The Hutu FDLR movement , for example , was accused of raping women and burning people alive in their homes .
Amnesty said it was also the civilians in Somalia who bore the brunt of conflict , with tens of thousands fleeing violence and hundreds killed by ferocious fighting in the capital , Mogadishu .
It also highlighted the killing and abduction of journalists and aid workers .
In Sudan , Amnesty catalogued a series of abuses including the sentencing to death of members of a rebel group , a clampdown on human rights activists and the expulsion of several aid groups following the issuing of an international arrest warrant against President Omar al - Bashir .
A number of countries , including Zimbabwe and Ethiopia , were criticised for intimidating and imprisoning members of the opposition .
And Nigeria came under fire for the forced evictions of thousands of people in the eastern city of Port Harcourt .
ASIA Across the region , millions fell further into poverty as the cost of basic necessities rose , Amnesty said .
In Burma , the military government rejected international aid in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis and punished those who tried to help victims of the disaster .
It continued campaigns against minority groups which involved forced labour , torture and murder , Amnesty said .
In North Korea , millions are said to have experienced hunger not seen in a decade and thousands tried to flee , only to be caught and returned to detention , forced labour and torture .
In both North Korea and Burma , freedom of expression was non-existent .
In China , the run-up to the Beijing Olympic Games was marred by a clamp - down on activists and journalists , and the forcible evictions of thousands from their homes , the report said .
Ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet continued to suffer from systematic discrimination , witnessing unrest followed by government suppression .
Millions of Afghans faced persistent insecurity at the hands of Taliban militants .
The Afghan government failed to maintain the rule of law or to provide basic services to many .
Girls and women particularly suffered a lack of access to health and education services .
In Sri Lanka , the government prevented international aid workers or journalists from reaching the conflict zone to assist or witness the plight of those caught up in fighting between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels .
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA Israel 's military operation in Gaza in December 2008 caused a disproportionate number of civilian casualties , Amnesty said .
Its blockade of the territory " exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation , health and sanitation problems , poverty and malnutrition for the 1.5 million residents " , according to the report .
On the Palestinian side , both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were accused of repressing dissent and detaining political opponents .
The death penalty was used extensively in Iran , Iraq , Yemen and Saudi Arabia .
Across the region , women faced discrimination both under the law and in practice , Amnesty said , and many faced violence at the hands of spouses or male relatives .
Governments that included Algeria , Iraq , Lebanon , Syria and Yemen are said to have used often sweeping counter - terrorism laws to clamp down on their political opponents and to stifle legitimate criticism .
AMERICAS
Indigenous communities across Central and South America were disproportionately affected by poverty while their land rights are ignored , Amnesty said .
Development projects on indigenous land were often accompanied by harassment and violence .
Women and girls faced violence and sexual abuse , particularly in Haiti and Nicaragua .
The stigma associated with the abuse condemned many to silence , the report said , while laws in some nations meant that abortion was not available to those who became pregnant as a result of abuse or assault .
Gang violence worsened in some nations ; in Guatemala and Brazil evidence emerged of police involvement in the killings of suspected criminals , the report found .
America continued to employ the death penalty , the report noted , and concern persisted over foreign nationals held at America 's Guantanamo Bay detention centre , although the report acknowledged the commitment by US President Barack Obama to close it down .
EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA Civilians paid a high price for last year 's conflict between Russia and Georgia , Amnesty said .
Hundreds of people died and 200,000 were displaced .
In many cases , civilians ' homes and lives were devastated .
Many nations continued to deny fair treatment to asylum seekers , with some deporting individuals or groups to countries where they faced the possibility of harm .
Roma ( gypsies ) faced systematic discrimination across the region and were largely excluded from public life in all countries .
Freedom of expression remained poor in countries such as Belarus , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan and other Central Asian nations .

Optimism is a trait best reserved for fools and salespeople , but I will always bet on the sun coming up .
I know it ’ll come around even if I have n’t seen it for days - otherwise the world would be a much colder place .
In this cynical age it ’s easy to mistake taking stock for counting chickens , but rose - tinted glasses are n’t required to see possibility .
Remember that despair is like a vampire - it steals our strength and leaves us hollowed husks , but it can only be invited in .
For even as we float up shit creek , at least the water is warm .
Today we 've tread enough water to pass our 300th post !
It has n't been easy to keep this up for so long , and I 'm sorry that recently work has prevented me from posting our regular 3 - a - week , but this blog is n't the only thing I 'm trying to keep from sinking ...
If you 've got anything to contribute , anything at all , please email us or leave a comment .
It is , unfortunately , easy to get ripped off in the music industry .
Getting caught up in a music industry scam might not damage your career , but it could cost you money you probably do n't have .
You can avoid a lot of music business rip - offs simply by knowing what you should pay for and what you should n't .
Here 's a list of things to avoid paying for as you get established in the music business .
Lists of Music Industry Contact Information
At some point in your music career , especially if you are a musician , someone is going to try to sell you a list of phone numbers and email addresses or both for labels , agents , managers , etc .
Do n't bite .
First of all , you have no way of knowing if the information is legitimate .
Second , if that is the private Blackberry number of head honcho X at label Y , they may not take kindly to being called by a stranger .
Spend a few hours with a list of your desired contacts and a search engine , and you 're likely to track down the best way to reach that person yourself .
Labels are hip to the fact that people want them to check out their demos , and to save themselves the trouble of fielding endless requests about how to send them , they make their desired methods of contact public information .
The gray area ?
There are a few industry guides published every year to which labels submit their contact information for this very purpose .
These books can be handy to have , and you can relax knowing that ( most ) of the people listed in the book have opted in and specified their desired contact method .
Still , most of the information you need is still available for free online if you 're willing to look for it .
Paying to Play a Show
If you 're still building an audience , you may not get paid a lot to play a show if you get paid at all .
You may end up out of pocket when you figure at the expense of getting to the show .
But do n't increase your costs by paying some promoter or venue to let you take to the stage .
You may be asked to pay a fee to play a " showcase " gig for " industry professionals . "
Occasionally these shows do put you in front of media and labels , but they usually do n't .
At the very least , you should weigh up these opportunities very , very carefully .
Proceed with caution .
The real gray area here is the tour buy - on .
Paying for Advice
This is a tricky one .
There are some legitimate music industry consultants out there that charge for their services and music industry consultants who work for a fee .
These consultants may be able to give clients great advice about how the industry works .
The flipside of this is that there are many , many consultants out there who charge musicians an hourly rate for the privilege of receiving basic ( at best ) or bad ( at worst ) advice .
This is not money well spent , and it could send you down the wrong road in terms of reaching your goal .
Before you pay for the services of a music consultant , find out what you can about their background and their past clients .
Look for someone who can motivate you while being realistic .
Above all else , look for a good price for good service .
It would be silly to divert money from other things you need to pay for these services .
A great thing to look for is a consultant who can offer advice while doing something tangible for your career , someone like a manager or a PR person you can call on for advice .
That way you 're getting more bang for your buck as this person is n't merely supervising your career but is invested in your career .
As a rule , one - size - fits - all solutions are difficult to come by in the music industry .
For a consultant to be effective at helping you , they will need to know a lot about your music , your background , and your goals to make sure that they are invested .

The ruling does not exclude a case being brought against other officials The US Supreme Court says FBI Director Robert Mueller and ex-Attorney General John Aschcroft cannot be sued by a former 9/11 detainee for alleged abuse .
The justices on Monday reversed a lower court ruling that had allowed a lawsuit brought by Javaid Iqbal to go forward .
Mr Iqbal , from Pakistan , argued the two officials were responsible for a policy that saw him singled out for abuse on the basis of his religion and race .
The court ruled that his complaint failed to back up this claim .
Mr Iqbal spent some six months in solitary confinement in a federal prison in Brooklyn in 2002 .
In his lawsuit , he said he had suffered physical and verbal abuse and had been singled out for mistreatment because of ethnic and religious discrimination .
The government argued that there was nothing to link Mr Mueller and Mr Ashcroft to the alleged abuse of Mr Iqbal .
' Secure conditions '
In a ruling by five votes to four , the Supreme Court justices overturned a ruling by a New York appeals court that had allowed Mr Iqbal 's lawsuit to proceed .
" The complaint does not show or even intimate that petitioners purposefully housed detainees " in prison " due to their race , religion or national origin , " wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the court 's majority opinion .
" All it plausibly suggests is that the nation 's top law enforcement officers , in the aftermath of a devastating attack , sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity . "
The court ruled that Mr Iqbal may be able to bring a case against others officials if " unconstitutional misconduct " could be proved .
Mr Iqbal was arrested in November 2001 on charges unrelated to terrorism .
His lawsuit alleged that two months later he was moved to a prison in New York where he was held for more than 150 days in solitary confinement , the Associated Press reports .
He was cleared of any links to terrorism and deported to Pakistan in January 2003 after pleading guilty to fraud , according to AP .
Monday 's ruling appeared to be narrow , limited to the facts of this particular case , although it could be cited as precedent in other lawsuits , Reuters reports .
Dozens of Muslim men were arrested in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks , and the justice department 's inspector general found that many of those held at the Brooklyn detention centre suffered abuse .
In 2006 , the US government agreed to pay $ 300,000 ( £ 195,000 ) to settle with Mr Iqbal 's co-plaintiff , Egyptian Ehab Elmaghraby .

Musings on Software Engineering and Application Security from Jim Manico
Cape Town — Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir will not attend South African President - elect Jacob Zuma 's inauguration Saturday , a top South African official said at a media briefing Thursday .
According to Johannesburg ’s Business Day , a government spokesman said earlier this week that Bashir had been invited to the ceremony .
However , a presidential source told Business Day , “ If he does [ attend ] , that will create a situation , and we would be forced to arrest him , and we do n't want that . "
The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant for Bashir 's arrest on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
South Africa is a signatory to the Rome Statute , which established the court , which would compel authorities to arrest Bashir were he to visit the country .
South Africa ’s Department of Foreign Affairs director - general Ayanda Ntsaluba said at the Thursday briefing that although Bashir will not be attending , Sudan was sending a government delegation for the inauguration ceremonies .
Even without Bashir , South Africa is grappling with a few sticky issues in diplomatic protocol .
In the past two years , Kenya and Zimbabwe have formed fragile coalition governments in response to disputed elections .
In both countries , there are disagreements over the balance of power between the president and the prime minister .
At the briefing , Ntsaluba told reporters that “ in the case of Zimbabwe , where we are facilitating discussions and are strongly supportive of the inclusive government , we have discussed the possibility of inviting some parties in the inclusive government .
This is being attended to as we speak . ”

His statement raised the possibility that Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai would be at Zuma ’s inauguration .
However , Ntsaluba did not comment on whether Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga was invited .
Last week , Odinga called for early elections after his request to be made head of government business – technically , the chair of the House Business Committee in the legislature – was rejected .
According to the Nairobi Star , Raila told a crowd of supporters in his Nairobi constituency last week “ our role in the coalition must be respected because we ceded more ground than we expected for the sake of peace , but our partners have pushed us to our limit .
If they do n't honour the national accord , ODM [ his party , the Orange Democratic Movement ] is ready for fresh polls . ”
The topic was the recent release of the torture memos .
On one side , Ari Fleischer , who wondered aloud if the declassifying of state secrets opens a Pandora 's Box of prosecution , one that sets a precedent for the next administration to investigate every evil Obama will commit ( because in Fleischer 's twisted view , every president must commit at least one human rights violation per term as a matter of course ) .
On the other side , Paul Begala , feisty Clintonite - cum - CNN 's token Democrat , who said a lot of good things about how Obama was compelled , by a lawsuit , to release the torture memos - and how it must be a change of pace for Ari to experience a president who actually bent to the will of the law .
Which was a nice little zinger - but not the main course .
Credit ( very little credit , but credit nonetheless ) must go to Anderson Cooper , who pressed Fleischer on the question of torture .
See , the whole interview , Fleischer squirmed around the issue of actually acknowledging torture took place .
He referred to waterboarding as an ' advanced interrogation technique ' , for instance .
To which Cooper responded to the effect of , " If waterboarding is n't torture , why did the CIA destroy evidence of it ? "
Fleischer 's reply , verbatim : " The CIA destroys lots of things .
That 's what they do . "
He then went on to state that he did n't believe waterboarding was torture .
It was close , but it was n't torture - and therefore , Bush was not lying when he said " We do not torture " .
Enter Paul Begala .
I wish I could find the video to show you because this was fucking classic :
BEGALA : We -- our country executed Japanese soldiers who water - boarded American POWs .
We executed them for the same crime that we are now committing ourselves .
How do you defend that ?
Thus ensued a good five seconds of the most satisfying awkward television silence I have ever experienced in my young life .
To Mr. Begala : kudos , sir .
Kudos .
Update : Wow !
My first rec !
Now I really do have to find that video .
I am anxious .
Update 2 ( thanks to Partially Impartial ) :
Link
COOPER : Do you believe that it did work in this case , as the vice president has -- as Vice President Cheney has indicated ?
FLEISCHER : No , again , Anderson , your premise is that it is torture .
And I think the only people who can determine that are people from the Department of Justice .
COOPER : But it 's interesting , though ...
FLEISCHER : If it is torture , if it is torture ... ( CROSSTALK ) COOPER : ... when the Khmer Rouge did it , when the Khmer Rouge did it at Tuol Sleng prison , and you can go there , and you can see the instruments they used to water - board people , I mean , we labeled it as torture .
FLEISCHER : And , Anderson , that 's why I said the only people who are in a position to make an authoritative judgment on it should be career , independent - minded people at the Department of Justice , without anybody at the White House interfering or anybody else interfering .
And then , if they decide it was , then they have got a very careful decision to make about how far and extensive do you prosecute people .
Is it the people who did it ?
Is it the Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who were briefed on it and did n't object to it ?
And who in the administration would you have to apply that standard to ?
This is where this whole thing can go .
But , going back to the memo , and going back to bipartisanship , you know , it 's not just the Bush people who said it was wrong to release that memo .
Bill Clinton 's head of the CIA said it was wrong to release those memos , because you 're teaching al Qaeda operatives exactly what our techniques are .
And why do we want anybody in al Qaeda to know what the limits of our techniques are , Paul ?
BEGALA : The techniques that -- the techniques that we no longer use , the techniques that were in " The New York Review of Books " and half of the newspapers and magazines in North America , Ari .
I mean , it is ...
FLEISCHER : Paul , it was your administration 's head of the CIA who objected to the release of those memos .
BEGALA : It does n't -- it does n't make ...
FLEISCHER : It 's a Clinton official who said that .
BEGALA : It does n't make him right .
Torture is always wrong , Ari .
We executed ...
FLEISCHER : I agree with you that torture is always wrong .
BEGALA : Excuse me for talking while you 're interrupting .
( CROSSTALK ) COOPER : Let Paul finish .
BEGALA : We -- our country executed Japanese soldiers who water - boarded American POWs .
We executed them for the same crime that we are now committing ourselves .
How do you defend that ?
FLEISCHER : Well , again , Paul , I guess you already are the jury , the prosecutor , the judge , and a citizen all rolled into one .
You have already pronounced judgment that it is a crime .
So , if it is a crime , my question goes back to .
Which Democrat members of Congress who sat in on the briefings , were authorized , were told about it , while -- particularly at a time when the Democrats had the majority in the Senate , would you say need to be prosecuted , Paul ?
BEGALA : Here 's the thing .
Ari , you think it 's a political issue .
And , so , you say , well , Democrats knew , or George Tenet said this , and he used to be a Democrat .
And ... ( CROSSTALK ) FLEISCHER : Because the only people you want to blame , Paul , are Republicans .
BEGALA : Again , excuse me for trying to make a point here .
FLEISCHER : That 's why .
BEGALA : No , no , no .
FLEISCHER : The only people you want to blame are the Bush administration .
BEGALA : I just said a moment ago -- I just said a moment ago , if -- if George Tenet , who was head of the CIA when I was in the White House , if he says this , he 's wrong , too .
Gotta love how the pubs always try to make doing the right thing a partisan issue .

“ It ’s pretty extraordinary , ” the Irish Catholic mayor said , in an office filled with Kennedy memorabilia and the ghosts of the Harvey Milk - George Moscone murders .
“ Now you have four states that are legally sanctioning same - sex marriage , and New York and California are not among them .
Who could have predicted that ? ”
The Dream Factory is being left in the dust by the Field of Dreams .
Matt McCoy , an openly gay Iowa legislator , was so excited by the court ’s unanimous decision that he posted a video inviting everyone , “ gay and straight , ” to come get married and settle in Iowa .
Max Mutchnick , the co-creator of “ Will and Grace , ” who married the entertainment lawyer Erik Hyman in Beverly Hills just days before Proposition 8 passed last November  theirs is among the 18,000 or so marriages now in legal limbo  was tickled by the idea of Iowa as the new California .
“ Will we see David Geffen rollerblading in the Des Moines skywalk ? ” Mutchnick mused .
“ Will paparazzi chase after farmers looking for candid shots ?
Will Ashton and Demi be BlackBerrying friends from their corner table at Applebee’s ?
Will there be a new line of Kiehl ’s products for goats ? ”

Mutchnick , who is raising twin girls with Hyman , frets that President Obama may be behind the country on this issue , and that the Obamas do not have enough gays around them .
Out - of - step Italy shows scant respect for the EU In making overtures to Iran and Libya , Italy is trampling agreed EU policy underfoot .
Franco Frattini , the foreign minister of Italy , broke ranks with his European Union colleagues last week by announcing that he would travel to Iran for talks with the country ’s leadership .
Under an informal agreement , the member states have delegated all contacts with the isolated Islamic republic to Javier Solana , the EU ’s foreign policy chief .
No EU politician of Frattini ’s rank has travelled to Iran since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005 .
The timing of the announcement on 20 May was significant : Ahmadinejad faces a presidential election contest on 12 June in which none of the four candidates - two reformists and two conservatives , including the incumbent – is thought capable of gaining an outright majority in the first round .
Disillusionment with Ahmadinejad is running high .
Pictures of a smiling president receiving the highest - ranking EU politician to visit Tehran in many years would not have been unwelcome to him .
As things turned out , the visit did not happen .
The Iranians insisted that Frattini meet the president not in the capital Tehran , but in Semnan , where Ahmadinejad was attending the test launch of a new missile .
But the cancellation did nothing to reassure Frattini ’s EU colleagues , whom he had failed to notify of his plans at a meeting in Brussels of EU foreign ministers only two days earlier .
Italy ’s foreign ministry denied to foreign reporters that such a trip was planned and then briefed Italian journalists about it , which contributed to the awkwardness – and to suspicions that the trip had a commercial purpose .
Italy is Iran ’s leading EU trade partner .
On Thursday ( 21 May ) , the chief executive of ENI , an Italian energy company , denied Iranian reports that the two sides were about to sign an oil exploration contract worth € 1.15 billion .
Iran is a troubling subject for the EU because years of sanctions have failed to check the regime ’s ambition to acquire nuclear weapons .
The US , since the change from George W. Bush to Barack Obama , is seeking to re-engage with Tehran .
So Italy ’s desire to involve Iran and to be involved in the EU ’s Iran policy , which has been run by a steering group of Germany , France and the United Kingdom , is out of step , but not out of touch with the broader international climate .
The pattern is evident in other policy areas as well .
The EU has been seeking a rapprochement with Libya – until a few years ago seen as a rogue state – and has been negotiating about an agreement with Tripoli since November .
Libya is stand - offish about the EU ’s neighbourhood policy and its Union for the Mediterran - ean , but open for closer co-operation on sectoral issues .
But , and once again mainly for domestic reasons , Italy has gone beyond established EU policy .
Earlier this month , Italy began sending migrants intercepted by Italian coastguard vessels back to Libya .
According to the UNHCR , the United Nations ’ refugee agency , the policy risked violating the 1951 refugee convention Libya has not signed up to the convention and a UNHCR spokesperson said on 12 May that there was “ no assur - ance that persons in need of international protection may find effective protection in Libya ” .
Yet , according to UNHCR figures , 75 % of those who made it to Italy ’s shores claimed asylum and 50 % of them had their application granted .
Silvio Berlusconi , the prime minister of Italy , justified the change in policy by comparing Italian collection centres for refugees to concentration camps – though he had earlier said that inmates were “ free to go out for a beer anytime ” .
Berlusconi made the comparison during a joint press conference in Rome on 19 May with José Manuel Barroso , the president of the European Commission .
Both Barroso and Italy ’s EU partners have remained very subdued in their comments on the change in policy , perhaps because it is superficially modelled on procedures used by Frontex , the EU ’s border control agency , which alerts local coastguards in Morocco , Senegal and other countries to the presence of refugee boats in their waters .
But Frontex itself does not return asylum - seekers to countries where they might be at risk , as is the case with Libya .
Italy and Malta – at the forefront of combating illegal migration in the Mediterranean – have long argued for burden - sharing with other EU member states and Italy ’s actions may well be calculated to send a message to partners .
This will be little consolation for those hundreds of migrants who were return - ed , a good number of whom – judging by last year ’s figures – will have been genuine refugees .
They have now been deprived of their right to lodge an asylum application .
As in the case of Iran , Italy appears to have been motivated at least in part by commercial considerations .
Libya has invested billions in Italian firms , including ENI and UniCredit , a bank .
Finmeccanica , a defence company , intends to open a plant in Libya and hopes to win a Libyan contract for border technology – which , incidentally , would also help the Libyans stem the flow of illegal migrants .
By tradition , Italy , a founding member of the common market , has been very supportive of the EU .
What may trouble its European partners , is that Italy ’s unilateralism , laced as it is with a disregard for the EU , appears not to be harming the government .
Berlusconi , who has concentrated power in his hands in a way that no Italian politician has managed since 1945 , remains Italy ’s most popular politician .
As others note , using Python ’s Ellipsis object in slices is rather obscure , and there are hardly any good examples out there .
So I thought I ’d do my bit with a nice , simple example , complete with comments :
# Portable way to get the You - Know - Which object without naming it class __ : def __getitem__ ( __ , _ ) : return _ ___ = __ ( ) [ ...]
#
An Ellipsobinary - to - ASCII convertor class __ : def __getitem__(__ , _ ) : return chr ( sum ( 1 < < i if _ [ - i - 1 ] is ___ else 0 for i in range ( len ( _ ) ) ) ) _ = __() # Finally , use the That - Which - Must - Not - Be - Named object print ( _[ ... , _ , _ , ... , _ , _ , _ ] + _[... ,... , _ , _ , ... , _ , ... ] + _[... ,... , _ , ... ,... , _ , _ ] + _[... ,... , _ , ... ,... , _ , _ ] + _[... ,... , _ , ... , ... , ... , ...] + _[... , _, ... ,... , _ , _ ] + _[... , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ] + _[... , ... ,... , _ , ... , ... , ...] + _[... ,... , _, ... , ... , ... , ...] + _[... ,...,... , _ , _ , ... , _ ] + _[... ,... , _ , ... ,... , _ , _ ] + _[...,... , _ , _ , ... , _ , _ ] + _[... , _ , _ , _ , _ , ... ] )
And you thought Python code could n’t be obfuscated ?
Seriously , though … do any non-NumPy programmers actually use Ellipsis ?
I have yet to find other ( non-NumPy ) uses of it in the wild .

Advertisement A police sergeant seen in video footage hitting a woman during a G20 protest in London has been suspended , Scotland Yard has said .
He is shown hitting the woman in the face with his hand and her leg with his baton after allegedly being sworn at .
The sergeant works for the Territorial Support Group .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission - probing Ian Tomlinson 's death during the 1 April protests - is examining the 2 April incident .
Opposition members of the London Assembly said the latest incident proved that Mr Tomlinson 's assault was not an isolated incident .
The woman who was seen being assaulted by the officer has been identified only as Nicky .
Her sister Natalie Thompson , from Brighton , said : " It has been stated that there are injuries but I 'm not allowed to comment but I have been misquoted already . "
Officers ' accountable '
The latest video footage featuring the female protester has been passed to the IPCC , a Metropolitan Police spokesman said .
" The officer has been identified and suspended pending further investigation .
The officer works as a sergeant in the territorial support group , " he added .
Earlier , police said the actions of the officer featured in the footage raised " immediate concerns " .
" Every officer is accountable under law , and fully aware of the scrutiny that their actions can be held open to , " police said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The decision to use force is made by the individual police officer , and they must account for that . "
The IPCC said it had been made aware of the latest footage by the Met and would now be looking at the " best way to progress an investigation into the actions of the officer involved " .
Jenny Jones , the Green Party 's home affairs spokesman on the London Assembly , said she was worried officers may have hidden police uniform numbers to avoid identification .
" This new video footage confirms what many of us knew , that the assault on Ian Tomlinson was far from being an isolated incident during the G20 protest , " she said .
She added : " Any attempt to avoid accountability by hiding police uniform numbers , destroying video images , or collusion over statements , must be severely dealt with . "
A
Met spokesman said the grey epaulette flashes on the officer should also have carried his sergeant stripes .
David Howarth , the Liberal Democrat 's justice spokesman , has called for a " full - scale inquiry " .
" The fact that this video shows another example of an officer with his number obscured assaulting a member of the public indicates that there is a systematic problem here , not just a series of individual acts of misconduct , " he said .
" The question is on my mind whether the police are using a some kind of ' designated hitter ' system . "
Investigation ' right ' Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , said : " It is no doubt a pressure cooker environment , however highly trained professionals are supposed to be better at defusing the situation . "
Andrew
Or , a photographer who was standing near the woman , said the strike across the face could have been accidental .
" I was actually quite shocked when I saw the movement of the arm and her being hit by the policeman , " he said .
" He may not have meant to hit her , he may have been swinging his arm in a movement to say move back . "
The video footage of the female protester emerged as the IPCC continues to investigate the death of Mr Tomlinson , who suffered a heart attack and died during the demonstrations on 1 April .
The IPCC took up the case after footage taken by a New York fund manager showed Mr Tomlinson being pushed to the ground by a police officer shortly before his death .
Days later more video footage aired on Channel 4 appeared to show the newspaper vendor being struck by an officer with a baton .
The police officer seen in the video of Mr Tomlinson has been suspended by the Met. Labour MP Keith Vaz , chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee , said it was " absolutely right " any allegations regarding the new video footage should be thoroughly investigated .

Video : Space storm sighting
A space storm has been observed exploding from a central point in Earth ’s upper atmosphere for the first time .
The result could one day lead to better predictions of the storms , which can harm satellites and power grids on the ground .
The energy that powers space storms comes from clouds of plasma hurled at Earth by the sun .
These clouds stretch our planet ’s magnetic field like a rubber band , storing energy in a long magnetic tail behind our planet .
The energy released when the field snaps back into place creates the ethereal glow of auroras ( see a gallery of the light shows ) .
It also floods the space around our planet with radiation that can incapacitate satellites and sicken astronauts , and can trigger electric currents on Earth capable of knocking out power grids .
Now , scientists have obtained the clearest view yet of the energy that was released in the magnetic tail arriving and initiating a disturbance in Earth ’s upper atmosphere , or ionosphere .

‘ Rock in a pond ’
Jonathan Rae of the University of Alberta in Edmonton led a team that made the observations of the onset of a space storm in March 2007 , using a network of cameras and magnetic instruments at ground stations scattered across Canada .
The observations show magnetic ripples in the ionosphere spreading at speeds exceeding 100,000 kilometres per hour from an initial point above Canada .
A strong auroral display , characteristic of a space storm , followed less than three minutes later .
“ The magnetic oscillations come down and hit the upper atmosphere in a particular location and then spread out from that location , ” says Rae .
“ It almost looks like a rock in a pond . ”
Power down
Scientists hope the new insight into how space storms begin and unfold will help pave the way for better predictions .
“ If we can predict these events with some certainty , hopefully more than minutes , maybe hours before they occur , we collectively can take remedial action , ” says David Kendall of the Canadian Space Agency , which is funding the ground - based observation network .
That would allow astronauts to take cover inside their spacecraft and satellites to power down to prevent damage , he says .
Rae reported the results on Monday at a geophysics conference in Toronto .

To be sure , there were few ready remedies .
Some critics argue that the United States could have pushed Beijing harder to abandon its policy of keeping the value of its currency weak  a policy that made its exports less expensive and helped turn it into the world ’s leading manufacturing power .
If China had allowed its currency to float according to market demand in the past decade , its export growth probably would have moderated .
And it would not have acquired the same vast hoard of dollars to invest abroad .
Others say the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department should have seen the Chinese lending for what it was : a giant stimulus to the American economy , not unlike interest rate cuts by the Fed .
These critics say the Fed under Alan Greenspan contributed to the creation of the housing bubble by leaving interest rates too low for too long , even as Chinese investment further stoked an easy - money economy .
The Fed should have cut interest rates less in the middle of this decade , they say , and started raising them sooner , to help reduce speculation in real estate .
Today , with the wreckage around him , Mr. Bernanke said he regretted that more was not done to regulate financial institutions and mortgage providers , which might have prevented the flood of investment , including that from China , from being so badly used .
But the Fed ’s role in regulation is limited to banks .
And stricter regulation by itself would not have been enough , he insisted .
“ Achieving a better balance of international capital flows early on could have significantly reduced the risks to the financial system , ” Mr. Bernanke said in an interview in his office overlooking the Washington Mall .
“ However , ” he continued , “ this could only have been done through international cooperation , not by the United States alone .
The problem was recognized , but sufficient international cooperation was not forthcoming . ”
The inaction was because of a range of factors , political and economic .
By the yardsticks that appeared to matter most  prosperity and growth  the relationship between China and the United States also seemed to be paying off for both countries .
Neither had a strong incentive to break an addiction : China to strong export growth and financial stability ; the United States to cheap imports and low - cost foreign loans .
In Washington , China was treated as a threat by some people , but mostly because it lured away manufacturing jobs .
Others argued that China ’s heavy lending to this country was risky because Chinese leaders could decide to withdraw money at a moment ’s notice , creating a panicky run on the dollar .

UPDATE : The ACLU of Michigan is happy to announce that Edwina Nowlin was released today after being represented by the ACLU at an emergency hearing in Delta County Probate Court today .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan asked for an emergency hearing today on behalf of an Escanaba woman sentenced to 30 days in jail because she is too poor to reimburse the court for her son ’s stay in a juvenile detention facility .
" Like many people in these desperate economic times , Ms. Nowlin was laid off from work , lost her home and is destitute , " said Michael J. Steinberg , ACLU of Michigan Legal Director .
" Jailing her because of her poverty is not only unconstitutional , it ’s unconscionable and a shameful waste of resources .
It is not a crime to be poor in this country and the government must stop resurrecting debtor ’s prisons from the dustbin of history . "
In December 2008 , Ms. Nowlin ’s 16 - year - old son was sentenced to the Bay Pines Center and Ms. Nowlin was ordered to pay $ 104 per month for his lodging .
At the time of this order , Ms. Nowlin was homeless and working part - time with a friend after being laid off from her job .
She told the court that she was unable to pay the ordered amount , however the judge found her in contempt for failing to pay .
In addition , Ms. Nowlin ’s requests for a court appointed attorney were denied .
Since March 3 , 2009 , Ms. Nowlin has been serving her sentence at the Delta County Jail .
On March 6 , 2009 , she was released for one day to work .
Once released she picked up her $ 178.53 check from work thinking that she now could pay the $ 104.00 to get out of jail .
However , upon her return to jail that evening , the sheriff forced her to sign over her check to the jail to cover $ 120.00 for " room and board . "
She was also charged $ 22 for a drug test and the booking fee .
According to the ACLU ’s motion : " This country did away with debtors ’ prisons more than a century ago .
The imprisonment of Ms. Nowlin because she is too destitute to make payments to the court is a miscarriage of justice . "
In representing Ms. Nowlin , the ACLU of Michigan argues that the court unconstitutionally sentenced Ms. Nowlin to a debtors ’ prison without assessing her ability to pay the court .
Additionally , the court violated her rights by denying her request for a court appointed lawyer .
Recently , the ACLU of Michigan represented David Sutton of Detroit whose probation was extended because he could not afford his supervision fees .
Mr. Sutton has no assets and his only income is the $ 262 monthly disability check he receives from the government .
In 2003 , Sutton was sentenced to probation for a year following a conviction in Wayne County Circuit Court .
He performed community service and fulfilled all the conditions of his probation except one – he was not able to pay the supervision fee .
Consequently , a Wayne County Circuit Court judge extended his probation year after year .
In February , the ACLU successfully represented him at a hearing where the state had moved to revoke his probation once again .
In addition to Steinberg , Ms. Nowlin is represented by Karl Numinen of Pence and Numinen , P.C. in Marquette .

The rapper is the latest butt of their jokes ...
The latest episode of South Park has poked fun at Kanye West , labelling him a ' gay fish ' .
The hip - hop star appeared in the show last night ( April 8 ) in the US in an episode called ' Fish Sticks ' .
The episode centered on a joke made by Cartman and Jimmy about fish fingers that everyone in the world - except Kanye - found hilarious .
The joke goes :
" Do you like fish sticks ? "
When the answer comes back ' yes ' everyone replies : " Then you 're a gay fish ! "
The play on words between sticks and dicks then sweeps South Park , but Kanye can't get it and goes on the rampage trying to find the boys who created the joke .
Still unable to get to grips with the punchline the star gives into public opinion and dives into the sea looking for underwater love - which he finds with a cartoon carp !

It 's the difficulty levels .
That 's what I love most about Thief .
Looking Glass 's genre - exploding first - person sneaker epic is an incredible work for many reasons , but I think it 's best summarised by the difficulty levels .
Garrett , a master thief , works independently of the three societal groups that populate the game 's expansive city .
He 's a loner , trained by the Keepers , but has long since abandoned them to pursue his own interests .
Your first adventure is to break into Lord Bafford 's Manor to steal his jewelled sceptre .
But here 's the thing :
On the Normal setting you 're charged with successfully breaking into the building and finding the sceptre .
Hard raises the stakes in more predictable ways such as having to escape the manor once the prize is stolen , and asking you to loot 350 gold pieces worth of items while you 're there .
But it 's the final requirement that 's significant .
" Do n't kill any of the servants ; they 're harmless . "
Bring it up to Expert and now you 're tasked with getting 700 gold , but also : " Do n't kill anyone while you do the job .
No servants , no guards , no pets ... no one . "
It 's this that captures the spirit , the essence of this most extraordinary game .
This is a game where turning the difficulty up reduces the number of enemies you have to kill .
Certainly it also increases the number of guards ( but slightly and smartly , never feeling unfair or unrealistic ) , and repositions them into more strategic patrol routes .
But it does n't make your weapons less effective , or raise enemy hit - points , or artificially hinder you in any ' gamey ' way .
It simply asks you to be a better , subtler , smarter thief .
This particular phrase from one Expert mission briefing says it all perfectly : " Violence is the mark of the amateur .
Do n't kill anyone . "
Out of darkness A giant pile of bodies .
It 'd be fun to be around when they all woke up from their snooze .
Well , actually , what I love most about Thief is the darkness .
I love making the room dark before I play .
Lots of games have that gamma check at the beginning , asking you to make sure the logo is barely visible in the box or whichever , but it 's rarely of much importance .
With
Thief you tape the curtains to the window frames and stuff socks in the crack under the door .
I love entering a heavily guarded location , crouching in a safely shadowed corner , then snuffing the wall - mounted torches with a couple of water arrows .
In the darkness I make quick methodical work of the patrolling guards , thwacking them over the back of the head with my trusted blackjack , and quickly depositing their unconscious bodies in a secluded , neat pile .
Then having the safe run of the place , robbing every chest , shelf and hidden lockbox .
The use of lighting was remarkable in 1998 , and still feels special 11 years later .
Finding a shadow , watching your light meter fade to that comforting dark green , and waiting for your victim to stroll past - it's a feeling of incredible power , but power without armoured rifles or rocket launchers .
Needing to pass through a room lit by non-extinguishable lamps , powered by this steampunk Middle Ages ' mysterious magic , creates a sensation of helplessness , the nearest dreary corner looking homely and welcoming .
The more you play , the more you crave the darkness , until you find yourself flinching when walking into your fluorescently lit kitchen , or instinctively picking the darkest path when walking home in the evening .
Rugged gaming
This is how the game really looks most of the time .
Nowhere will ever print a realistic screenshot of a Thief game , because it 's all but pitch black .
But Eurogamer is brave enough .
And damn right .
But of course it 's the carpets I love most about Thief .
After the light , the second most important aesthetic character in the game is the floor .
Of how many games could you write that sentence ?
You 're always acutely aware of what you 're standing on .
Tiled , stone floors make up most of the streets and buildings you encounter , loudly registering your clip - clop footsteps .
( It does seem that if Garrett really wanted to be a master thief , he might consider not wearing the high - heel shoes that can only be responsible for the ludicrous noise he makes while running . )
Exaggerated it might be , but it allows you to register exactly how much of a racket you 're making .
Crouched down , inching forward , disguising your footsteps can be astonishingly difficult .
And then you spot the worst sights of them all : gravel or ceramic tiles .
Each makes such a noise , and if you 're out of moss arrows to soften your step , drastic long - cuts may need to be taken .
But then , there it is : carpet .
Sweet , blessed carpet .
On carpet Garrett can run , jump and be merry , producing nothing more than a soft scuffing .
Sneaking up on the enemy is a cinch , picking their pockets and being long gone before they 've a clue you were ever there .
Oh , heavens , a completely dark carpeted room : sheer bliss .
Thanks to everyone who likes this , really it warms my heart .
I 've read and continue to read every comment that 's been made here .
You 're all very nice and I love you for that .
For everything from the daily deviation to just the pageviews , it may seem insignificant but it means more to me than I can express .
Thank you .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - On Thursday , the U.S. government is expected to reveal the results of stress tests applied to the 19 largest U.S. banks , including which ones need to raise additional capital and how much .
It is still unclear how much information on each bank will be released .
Reuters asked some top investors and analysts what would make the whole exercise credible or not , and what results would concern them or make them feel favorably toward the sector .
THE ADVERSE SCENARIO
“ First of all , let ’s remember what this is not .
It is not a solvency test , ” said Jim Bianco , president of independent firm Bianco Research in Chicago , which tracks and analyzes macroeconomic and market trends .
“ All of these banks are currently solvent as we know it .
The government has laid out what they call the ‘ more adverse ’ scenario .
And the question is if that scenario happens , are the banks capitalized enough to meet that scenario .
“ So the first bit of information we need to get from the banks is what do they think the markdowns are going to be on the more adverse scenario .
“ In other words , if we get the minus 3.3 percent fall in GDP this year , if we get the 9 percent unemployment rate and the 22 percent fall on home prices this year , then they expect various types of loans to fall by how much ? ”
Bianco said : “ The first thing we are going to have to look at is :
Is the more adverse scenario a credible thing for us to view ?
If you do think that that ’s plausible , then are the markdowns and losses the banks expect under this scenario realistic ?
Third , do you think they ’ve actually got the capital ratios right ? ”
The problem with all of this is that the results of the stress tests were delayed by four days , he added .
“ They ’ve delayed this precisely so that they could politicize the capital numbers . ”
A GUIDE TO GOOD AND BAD BANKS
“ It is clear that the test would lose credibility if everyone passed , ” said Keith Wirtz , president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management , which manages $ 22 billion .
“ That would suggest that the bar was set low and this was all a gimmick to begin with and a way to give the market a sense of comfort .
I do n’t think that is what is really going on , however .
We do take the test seriously to some degree .
“ If the government really does favor banks to have tangible common equity , or TCE , of about 4 percent of a bank ’s assets over the next two years to withstand losses in case the recession worsens , then that brings some legitimacy to the test , ” Wirtz said .
“ TCE is more objective and clear while so - called Tier 1 capital worth -- a broader measure monitored by regulators -- has more subjectivity associated .
The market will start to discriminate between good banks and bad banks , in my opinion . ”
Fifth Third Bancorp is one of the 19 firms undergoing the stress tests .
THE SURVIVORS CAN EARN GREAT RETURNS
“ Clearly there was a whole lot of pessimism baked into bank share prices , ” said David Harris , chief investment officer at Rockefeller & Co , with about $ 25 billion in assets under management .
Referring to Wells Fargo & Co , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp , he said : “ They ’re going to be earning a lot of money over the next few years ; their deposit bases are bigger by far than they ’ve ever been , which will reduce competition and help improve net - interest margins .
“ The survivors are bigger , stronger and will earn great returns that will offset this balance sheet deterioration , ” he added .

FP - Syd # 13 .
Just today , Richard Collins reminded me that I forgot to blog the last FP - Syd meeting .
I 'm correcting that now .
Last Thursday ( March 26th ) was the 13th meeting of FP - Syd , the Sydney Functional Programming group .
The meeting was held at Google 's new offices in Sydney and we had about 35 people attending to hear our two presenters .
The first presentation was by Simon ( Horms ) Horman , who volunteered to give a presentation the morning of meeting after our scheduled speaker pulled out due to illness .
Horms ' presentation was titled " Using Haskell to Write a Very Small Portion of Xen " .
He started out by explaining how he is relatively new to Haskell and that most of his coding is actually in C , for the Xen hypervisor .
Xen hypervisor Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( APCI ) which is programmed in a very simple C like language called ACPI Source Language ( ASL ) .
Programming ASL is a rather repetitive and error prone task , so Horms ' solution was to write a simple Haskell program to generate the ASL code .
Horms ' slides , Haskell code and output ASL code is available in this tarball .
The second presentation was by Mark Wotton on his attempts to improve predictive text entry on mobile phones .
Mark explained how he wanted to improve predictive text by using the previous three words instead of just the current word .
He chose Haskell for its rapid prototyping capabilities and explained some of the difficulties he had with performance , especially with large corpora and how he got around these problems .
Mark has put up his slides up here and even has a demo available on the web .
A big thanks goes to Shane Stephens and Google 's Sydney office for making their facilities available .
Thanks also to Horms and Mark for their presentations .

A substantial increase in the amount of electricity produced from renewable energy would require building a transmission system that would carry a price tag of up to $ 100 billion , according to a new study .
The new system would be needed because the existing eastern grid could n't handle the volume of power coming from the wind - producing states .
In addition , the new grid would need to be able to handle the fluctuating nature of wind power , which can surge at some moments and drop sharply at others .

( see itinerary , and show details below ) .
Looking for an update on CSS - based web design , so took a look at CSS Reboot and css Zen Garden .
What you mainly find are layouts tall , skinny , and top - heavy with large headers .
User ’s screens - with growing use of “ widescreen ” panels - are becoming mainly very wide , but not very tall .
As a result , most of those clever examples fit very poorly on most user ’s screens .
On many current screens , about the only thing showing is the designer ’s beautiful and clever graphics ( surrounded by acres of empty horizontal space ) .
This may make the web designer happy , but the user will be less happy with the scarce scrap of content visible ( if visible at all ) at the bottom of the screen , and less happy with the amount of scrolling needed for a viewing a tall skinny column .
When low - end laptops ship with 1280x800 panels , large headers above tall / skinny content seem a very poor design .
Designs that suit common screen sizes seem a little scarce .
Was hoping for inspiration , but left the above - mentioned CSS example sites feeling very uninspired .

In an era where most Hollywood singers sport commanding attitudes and resplendent clothing , Lisa Fischer ’s humble nature and casual attire convinces the world to re-examine what makes someone a star .
Fischer strolled onto the stage in Bryn Mawr College ’s Goodhart
Theatre with a deep purple shawl draped gently across her body .
A long , flowing yellow skirt occasionally floated away to reveal glittery sandals and painted toes .
But do n’t let this casual look fool you .
This singer got her start as a back - up singer for legendary names like Tina Turner , The Rolling Stones and Luther Vandross .
Despite their talent , background singers tend to go unnoticed , and their voices are often overshadowed by the star of the show .
Filmmaker Morgan Neville made a documentary in 2013 called “ 20 Feet From Stardom , ” which examined the dynamic between background singers and the stars they work with .
The film features renowned back - up singers like Lisa Fischer , Darlene Love , Merry Clayton and Judith Hill , portraying the struggles each woman went through in her quest to start a solo career .
Both Merry Clayton and Darlene Love show a small hint of disappointment when they speak about their solo careers .
They express disappointment that they did n’t end up being the big stars they expected .
Fischer differs from these women in that she always found comfort in “ walking the street and not having to worry about putting on sunglasses and hiding out . ”
In the documentary she describes her record deal as “ just one of those things that just kind of blossomed , ” and explains that she understands how fortunate she was .
In 1992 , she won a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for her song “ How Can I Ease the Pain . ”
While the modern Grammy Award winner featured in an episode of MTV’s Cribs has a mansion decked out with the latest technology and impressive memorabilia , a scene in the documentary shows Fischer ’s modest and cluttered apartment , giving the viewer insight into Fischer ’s genuine humility .
The camera pans around the room showing the apartment in a light state of disarray .
We see a pile of clutter in the corner — clutter that turns out to be several gold albums and gifts from the musicians she has toured with .
Later in the film we see her Grammy on a shelf with various other knick - knacks and picture frames .
She blushes as she points it out and playfully admits , “ Oh and here ’s my Grammy … I just kinda keep it there .
I do n’t know what to do with it . ”
After winning her Grammy she started to pursue a second record deal , but things did n’t go exactly as planned .
“ I was working on a second record and I do n’t know .
I just took too long .
There was this window and it just took too long . ”
Despite this setback , Fischer kept singing simply because she just likes to sing .
In the film she is quoted as saying , “ I love melodies .
I ’m in love with the sound vibration and what it does with other people .
It ’s familiar but so special and you ’re just so happy when you get there and you try to stay there for as long as you can . ”
And stay there she does .
Her music combines elements of smooth jazz and soul that make the listener feel instantly relaxed .
Her songs consist of mostly melodious tones and a cacophony of oos and ahhs that seem to never end .
She ’s careful to hit every note , and she leaves the audience to breathe in each note she makes and anxiously await the next one .
In the film , she compares her singing style to that of a feather that was blown into the air .
“ You just go , never hit a hitch , ” she says .
“ You just land .
That ’s what it feels like to me . ”
This is clearly conveyed to anyone who has had the pleasure of hearing her sing .
There is so much effort that goes into every sound she makes , and the sound seems to come from her whole body , not just her mouth .
She sways around the stage as if she is using her body to bounce the notes around the room .
She does n’t just hold the microphone ; she tangos with it , creating different sounds by moving it in circles around her mouth .
Her voice is genuine and warm .
Even audience members with limited musical background ( such as myself ) had chills throughout the performance .
She began touring with the band , Grand Baton , in 2014 , and in this setting she is advertised as the main attraction .
However , her years as a backup singer have clearly left an impact on her , as she makes sure that the talent dynamics on stage are horizontal rather than vertical .
She takes care to keep the main focus of the stage is not herself , and she dedicates generous time in her performance to feature each of her band members and allow them to go “ off book ” and show the room their talent .
Once she finished singing , several audience members came up to the stage to bring her bouquets of flowers .
She graciously accepted the gifts , taking the time to bend down and thank each person individually .
She walked back to center stage , put the flowers down , and softly thanked the audience , saying , “ Thank you so much for these gifts , but just know that the best gift you could have given me was coming here tonight . ”
Her concerts convey her desire to sing purely because she loves to sing .
At the same time , they invite you into her heart and soul for an hour , and you walk away in paralyzing peace .
In the documentary , Sting makes an appearance .
He comments on what separates real stars from the rest of the performers out there and argues that there is a “ spiritual component to what they do that ’s got nothing to do with worldly success . ”
He describes singing as “ more an inner journey , ” for true stars and that “ any other success is just cream on the cake . ”
Despite her start near the back of the stage , Fischer ’s presence on stage and distinct musical talent have earned her a place among the stars of modern music .
From the print edition published Dec. 7 , 2016
U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency ( CMA ) officials have announced the destruction of 60 percent of the U.S. declared stockpile under the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
This milestone was achieved Saturday , April 25 .
CMA reached the 50 percent milestone in December 2007 and is poised to destroy its two - millionth munition in the coming months .
" We have increased our efficiency at destroying the nation 's chemical weapons stockpile while maintaining the highest safety and environmental compliance standards , " said Conrad Whyne , CMA Director .
" This accomplishment is the result of a true team effort between our storage and destruction staff consisting of both government and contractor personnel , and I commend the dedication of the members of our highly skilled work force , " he added .
" It took eight years to destroy the first 10 percent of agent , including agent destroyed before the CWC entered into force .
Back then , the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System ( JACADS ) was our first operating facility , and we were still mastering operations , " said Col. Robert Billington , CMA Project Manager for Chemical Stockpile Elimination .
" Since then , we have systematically applied the lessons learned from JACADS and our other operating sites to continually improve our efficiency , " he said .
Another big success of CMA 's chemical demilitarization program is safety .
" We have worked hard to instill a safety culture throughout the program , " said Greg St. Pierre , CMA Director of Risk Management .
" Over time , our work force has reduced our Recordable Injury Rate or RIR - the rate of injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked which we report to OSHA - from more than 4.0 at JACADS to 0.62 , our March 2009 rate .
By contrast , the construction industry RIR is 6.3 .
Industries with a lower injury rate are finance , data processing and libraries , " he added .
In reaching the 60 percent destruction mark , CMA has also reduced the overall continued storage risk from the nation 's stockpiled chemical weapons by 94 percent .
Much of this reduction is due to CMA 's complete destruction of VX and GB nerve agents at its chemical demilitarization sites , achieved in December 2008 .
The storage risk continues to decrease with every new destruction milestone CMA achieves .
Destruction of chemical weapons is complete at Newport , Ind. ; Aberdeen , Md. ; and Johnston Island .
Operations continue at CMA 's remaining destruction sites in Tooele , Utah ; Umatilla , Ore. ; Anniston , Ala . ; and Pine Bluff , Ark .
These sites are now destroying or preparing to destroy blister agent .
CMA continues to safely store chemical agent munitions near Richmond , Ky. , and at Pueblo , Colo .

Instant Compost
This Antique Tool works wonders on rotten Leaves ,
or making cheap Bird Seed .
Hidden in your Rain Gutters are decomposing Leaves .
It is not unusual to find a half Bushel or more up there .
A little imagination can turn them into
Vitamins and Minerals for your House Plants , and give you more incentive
to keep your Rain Gutters cleaned .
We sell Hand Grinders HERE
FINDING A GRINDER -
A visit to your local Flea Market should turn up a Meat Grinder .
Be sure to get a Grinder with large round or rectangular holes like those shown above .
Plates with 1/4 " round holes are made to grind Hamburger , and may not allow wet Leaves to pass through .
1/2 " holes are the minimum for a Compost Grinder .
A large Hopper is a definite plus .
WHAT TO LOOK FOR -
The Grinder shown has a conical Plate and 3 - bladed Cutter .
This type is very difficult to sharpen .
A better choice has replaceable flat Plates and Cutters , which can be sharpened by rubbing them in a circular motion on Emery Cloth placed on a flat surface .
Some Plates are reversible which is an added advantage .
HOW TO USE IT -
Always wear Safety Glasses when working with any Tools .
Mount the Grinder on a sturdy table or step .
There 's not much room for a container under the Grinder , but our cereal box worked nicely after a little customizing with a Scissors .
Mounting the Grinder on a narrow surface will allow the Compost to drop into a Bucket .
Twigs , Acorns and other seeds , and spent blooms will grind right up with the leaves .
Use a gloved hand to feed the Grinder , these tools have been known to pinch fingers ; especially when one person fills the Hopper and a second person turns the Crank .
Clean and dry the Grinder after usage to avoid the Plates and Cutters from getting rusty and losing their sharpness .
The decomposing Leaves and Pine Needles in the background have been transformed into this great finished product .
It will rival those sold at your Nursery or Garden Center , and there 's not much chance that it will contain chemicals .
Your friends and neighbors may be willing to contribute to your new endeavor from their own Rain Gutters , and may even turn the Crank for a cup or two .
Not only will the Grinder pay for itself , but it 's fun to see the transformation and know that you " made " the Compost all by yourself .
If you grind anything that is not from the Gutters , make sure there are no pebbles or soil in it since these materials will dull the Cutters in short order .
You might even want to start a Gutter cleaning business ,
and sell Compost on the side .
If you have Oak or Pine Trees in one area of your House and other Trees in another area , then you may have acidic Compost from the former and alkaline from the others .
Keep them separate ; Blueberries , Holly , Hydrangeas , Rhododendrons , and Azaleas love acidic Oak Leaf Compost .

Tweeting Cat Door Tweeting Cat Door
After receiving many emails requesting Instructions and Kits for building the Tweeting Cat Door , I decided to make a version that is stand - alone and does n't need a computer to be run and that is easy to be put together by anyone with a soldering iron and a little time on hand .
All the software is available to download , but feel free to modify it to make it better or to better suit your needs .
The Tweeting Cat Door works as follows :
When a pet tries to enter the pet door , a RFID reader will read the RFID tag that your pet has on the collar .
If the tag is authorized , the latch of the pet door will open , a picture is taken of the pet , and uploaded to Twitter along with a funny random message , for example : " Penny is in playing with a ball of yarn . "
The pet door works in the same way when the pet tries to go out .
A picture is taken and uploaded to Twitter along with a message , for example : " Gus is out to play poker with the fellas . "
The messages are chosen at random from a list of possible messages .
Here are some examples :

http://twitpic.com/29jcd2
Here is
Note :
The twitter part of the project is optional .
You can just build the Arduino controller , the latch to lock / unlock the pet door , mount the RFID reader and the latch on the door and you are ready to go .
Your pets would be " sorted " by the RFID tag they are waring .
Here you 'll find detailed step by step instructions and kits with all the components ( you can buy kits , PCB , preprogrammed Arduino chip , etc , by contacting me ) .
By following the instructions on this page , you will have - in no time - your own RFID enabled , twitting pet door , just like the original Tweeting Cat Door .
How does the RFID ( Radio - frequency identification ) enabled pet door works ?
Each pet will have a small RFID tag on the collar and the pet door will open ONLY for your pet for entering the house .
The RFID enabled pet door has 3 settings that can be controlled by pressing a button .
For each setting a LED will light in a different color :
GREEN - Open , your pet is allowed to exit the door and to enter the door .
When a pet tries to enter the pet door , a RFID reader will read the RFID tag that your pet has on the collar .
If the tag is authorized , the latch of the pet door will open , a picture is taken of the pet , and uploaded to Twitter along with a funny random message , for example : " Penny is in playing with a ball of yarn .
"
The pet door works in the same way when the pet tries to go out .
A picture is taken and uploaded to Twitter along with a message , for example : " Gus is out to play poker with the fellas .

Gus died a while back ( probably a fight with a raccoon or other cats ? ) and not long after , Penny followed .
The twitter part of the project is optional .
You can just build the Arduino controller , the latch to lock / unlock the pet door , mount the RFID reader and the latch on the door and you are ready to go .
Your pets would be " sorted " by the RFID tag they are waring .
Here you 'll find detailed step by step instructions and kits with all the components ( you can buy kits , PCB , preprogrammed Arduino chip , etc , by contacting me ) .
By following the instructions on this page , you will have - in no time - your own RFID enabled , twitting pet door , just like the original Tweeting Cat Door .
How does the RFID ( Radio - frequency identification ) enabled pet door works ?
Each pet will have a small RFID tag on the collar and the pet door will open ONLY for your pet for entering the house .
The RFID enabled pet door has 3 settings that can be controlled by pressing a button .
For each setting a LED will light in a different color :- Open , your pet is allowed to exit the door and to enter the door .
BLUE - In -only , your pet is allowed to only enter the door ( for example at night when you want your pet inside ) -
In - only , your pet is allowed to only enter the door ( for example at night when you want your pet inside )
RED - Locked , the door will stay locked and no exit or entering is allowed .
- Locked , the door will stay locked and no exit or entering is allowed .
Note :
The entering through the door is controlled by RFID , exiting is controlled by a infrared beam .
Note :
The entering through the door is controlled by RFID , exiting is controlled by a infrared beam .
pet door controller is based on ATmege328 chip with Arduino bootloader .
In this tutorial we wo n't use an already made Arduino board , we will build our own customized one to fit just our needs .
Note :
You are welcome to use your own Arduino board .
If you look at the schematic it would be very easy to build it around a standard Arduino board , but we wo n't cover it in this article .
Here is the schematic for the pet door controller we will use ( click on the image to zoom in ) .

You can also download the Eagle files
On the schematic , you will see a bunch of header connectors , here is the description for each of them :
VCC1 : connect the power supply here
ICSP : you will use this for uploading your software to the Arduino chip .
IRT : the Infrared transmiter LED goes here
IRD : the infrared detector
WIFI : serial connection that goes to the Open Wrt router
RFID : your RFID reader ( the software supports both ID12 and Parallax readers , selectable from RJP )
BTN : button to control the way the door operates ( open , in only , locked )
RGB : RGB LED ( common anode , common cathode , both work , selectable from JP1 )
SERVO : the servo that will open / close the pet door latch
SETSERVO button : when pressed you are going to be able to set the max values the servo goes to right or left .
The settings are made using the trimpots TPR ( max right ) and TPL ( max left ) .
PROGTAG button : when pressed , arduino will switch in " learning mode " and you can program new RFID tags .
The tags are " learned " by passing them in front of the reader .
JP2 : disconnects the RFID reader from the serial , and this way the ICSP can be used to reprogram arduino chip .
Here is the list of all the parts you are going to need for this project :

A webcam ( for automatically taking pictures of your pet and uploading them on twitter ) is optional .
Here is a picture with all the parts that you need to build your arduino , including the RFID reader ( parallax in the picture ) .
For Internet enabling the cat door you would need a wireless router that accepts OpenWRT .
For a list of routers supported by OpenWRT , please see the OpenWRT website .
In my example I 'm using an ASUS WL - 520gU ( it has a USB port that can be used for a Webcam ) .

If you only want to control your pet door and do n't care too much about posting to Twitter , you should skip this part .
The " pet door " controller is done now and fully functional .
Like we decided in previous steps , we will need Open Wrt on the router .
We are going to build our own openwrt firmware that includes everything we need .
For this you need a linux machine ( or linux running in vmware player ) .
I 'm using vmware image of ubuntu on a windows machine with vmware player installed .
Open a console and type :
sudo apt - get install build - essential subversion libncurses5 - dev zlib1g - dev gawk bison gcc
mkdir ~/ kamikaze
cd ~/ kamikaze
svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/8.09/ .
./ scripts / feeds update -a
make menuconfig
Select the following options :

kmod - video - core [* ]
Save the configuration and then type in console :
make world V=99
This will take a while ...
When is done , type this in console :
wget http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/embedded/KernelPatch/usb-2.4.31LE06.patch.tar.gz
tar xvfz usb-2.4.31LE06.patch.tar.gz

cd ~/kamikaze/build_dir/linux-brcm-2.4/linux-2.4*/drivers/usb
patch - p1 < usb -2.4.31LE06.patch
Now we have to modify usb.mk .
Open with a text editor ~/ kamikaze / package / kernel/modules/usb.mk and add the following code to it :
define KernelPackage /usb - spca5xx
$ ( call usbdep , )
TITLE :=spca5xx WebCam driver
#KCONFIG:=$( CONFIG_USB_SPCA5XX )

AUTOLOAD :=$ ( call AutoLoad,70 , spca5xx )
endef
$ ( eval $ ( call KernelPackage , usb - spca5xx ) )
Save usb.mk with the new settings .
Now we have to build the image again .
In Kernel -> modules ->USB
Supoprt you 'll have a new line " kmod-usb - spca5xx " , make sure is marked as [ M ] .
cd ~/ kamikaze
make menuconfig

The compiling stopped twice to ask me to to select an option , I selected " m " .
When is done , you 'll have in ~ / kamikaze / bin / brcm - 2.4 / the new firmware :
openwrt-brcm-2.4-squashfs.trx
and in ~ / kamikaze / bin / brcm - 2.4 / packages / the compiled spca5xx package :
kmod-usb - spca5xx_2.4.37.5-1_brcm-2.4.ipk
Let me know if you have questions or if something is not clear .
Now replace the old firmware with the new built one :
( I used window for this , for linux or mac follow the instructions on openwrt.org http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/asus/wl520gu)
Download : http://www.shadowsoftware.net/shadowgameworld/downloads/tftp2.exe
Change the IP on the windows machine to 192.168.1.8 .
Connect the computer 's LAN port to one of router 's LAN ports .
Run the application prev.
downloaded : tftp2.exe
In the Server field put 192.168.1.1 , leave password empty , and in the File field , select the openwrt - brcm-2.4-squashfs-spca5xx-curl -stty .trx file .
Set the retry to 99 .
DO NOT press Upgrade button yet .
With the unit powered on , press and hold the reset button on back of unit for 30 seconds
Without releasing the reset button , unplug the unit and hold reset for another 30 seconds
Plug the unit back in STILL holding the reset button a final 30 seconds ( please note that this step can put Asus devices into recovery mode )
NOW press Upgrade button .
Wait 5 full minutes and then reboot the router .
Wait a minute for it to boot , then :
telnet 192.168.1.1
Now the router is ready to be configured to connect to your WiFi network .
Telnet into your router and then change the router 's default password :
telnet 192.168.1.1
passwd
After selecting a new password , you will only be able to connect to the router using ssh .
A ssh client for windows is
Now you will have to edit the network configuration to make your router be able to connect to the internet .
( From this point on you can think of your router as a small computer that runs linux and the only " screen " that you have to see what 's going on in the router is telnet or ssh ) .
Using putty , ssh in your router and then :
vi /etc / config / network
edit it to make it look like this :
( Note : if you do n't know how to use vi editor under Linux ,
#### VLAN configuration
config switch eth0
option enable 1
config switch_vlan eth0_0
option device " eth0 "
option vlan 0
option ports " 1 2 3 4 5 * "
config switch_vlan eth0_1
option device " eth0 "
option vlan 1
option ports " 0 5 "
#### Loopback configuration
config interface loopback

option proto dhcp
save and exit vi editor , then :
vi /etc / config / wireless
make this file look like this :
config wifi - device wl0
option type broadcom
option channel 11 # the channel your wireless network is on
# REMOVE THIS LINE TO ENABLE WIFI :
# option disabled 1 ( comment out or remove this line )
config wifi-iface
option device wl0
option network lan
option mode sta # tell router to connect to your network as a client
option ssid MySSID # the SSID of your network
option encryption wep # the encryption mode of your network ( none , wep , psk )
option key xxx # replace xxx with your network key
save and exit the vi editor and then :
reboot
Wait for the router to boot and then ssh back in now using the new IP ( 192.168.1.7 in our example ) .
Now your router should be connected to the internet , you could try to ping google .com to try the connection .
ping www.google.com

your router is a small linux computer now .
Open your router :
On the back of the router you will find 4 screws ( two of them are under the rubber feet ) .
Unscrew the four screws and open the plastic box .
You will find a circuit board that looks like the one in the picture .
Remove the PCB from the plastic enclosure by gently pulling it up and towards you ( ethernet ports facing away ) .
Just to the left of the ASUS logo you will see four solder filled vias in a row .
Solder 4 pins to the vias .
From Left to right you will have :
GND , TX , RX , 3.3V

From Left to right you will have :
For this project we are going to use only the GND and RX pin ( the router just receives instructions from the Arduino board ) .
After the 4 pins are in place , connect two wires , one to the GND pin ( black wire ) , one to RX pin ( a red wire ) .
Make a small hole in the plastic enclosure for the two wires and now you can close the router back up .
Screw the 4 screws back , and put the 2 rubber feet back in place .

Screw the 4 screws back , and put the 2 rubber feet back in place .
Now the router is ready to communicate with the pet door controller .
To make the pet door controller communicate with the OpenWrt router you must connect the controller 's TX pin to the router 's RX pin and the controller 's GND to router 's GND ( In our situation the communication is one way , from the controller to the router ) .
First of all , comment ( add # in front of them ) the lines in /etc / inittab :
tts/0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
ttyS0 ::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
tty1::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
this will disable login console terminal on serial port , so we can use it for back and forth communication with the arduino based controller .
Both the router 's serial port and controller 's serial port must have same speed to be able to communicate .
The router 's serial speed to is set to 9600 by executing :
root@OpenWrt:~# stty 9600 < / dev/tts/0
For each RFID tag read by the pet dor controller , the controller will write to the serial the RFID tag with . txt at the end of line , for example , if the tag is 01068E2081 , and the pet went out the door ( breaking the IR beam ) the controller is going to write to the serial 01068E2081 - out. txt and if the pet went in the door ( door opened by the RFID tag ) , the controller is going to send over the serial 01068E2081 - in.txt
On the router , to read what 's coming over serial communication from the controller , your code should look something like this :
# Tell the AVR we 're ready to start doing stuff
echo " start " >
/ dev/tts/0
while true # loop forever
do
inputline= " " # clear input
# Loop until we get a valid command from arduino
# the line should be the text file we have to open to get
# a random message
until inputline= $ ( echo $ inputline | grep -e " .txt " )
do
inputline=$ ( head -n 1 < / dev/tts/0 )
done
[...]
by looking for . txt we will know when we got a new command from the pet door controller .
After we got a new command , for example 01068E2081 - out. txt , we are going to read a random line from the file with the same name :
LINES=`wc -l $ inputline | awk '{ print ( $ inputline + 1 ) }'`
RANDSEED=`date '+ %S%M%I'`
LINE=`cat $ inputline | awk -v COUNT=$LINES - v SEED=$RANDSEED ' BEGIN { srand ( SEED ) ; i=int ( rand ( ) * COUNT ) } FNR==i { print $ 0 }'`
take a picture from the Webcam :
ln -s /dev/v4l / video1 /dev/video1 # create / dev/video1
spcacat -d /dev/video1 - g -f jpg -p 10000 -o > / dev/zero # take a picture every 3 sec
and upload them to twitter ( twitpic ) :
# tell curl to send a multipart form to twitpic
# save returned XML in a variable
RET=$ ( curl -s - S -F " $ myname " - F " $ pword " - F " $ cargo " - F " $ tweet " $ target )
echo " $ RET "
Note :
In this project the communication is just one way , the Open Wrt router just receives messages from arduino based controller .
If you want to communicate both ways , in your bash script on the router use following command to send messages to arduino based conntroller :
echo " test message sent from Open Wrt router to arduino " >
/dev/tts/0
Basically on the OpenWrt router you will have 2 scripts , one that starts the webcam capture and one that handles the communication with the pet door controller and uploads the messages and pictures to twitter .
On the router , create a dir in ~/ called catdoor :
mkdir ~/ catdoor
then , in this directory put the following script :
tp.sh
#!/bin/sh -
# store some paths in handy variables
picsdir= / www/
pic=SpcaPict.jpg
TNAME=your_twitter_username
TWORD=your_twitter_password
# set serial port to 9600 baud
# so we can talk to the AVR
# turn off local echo to make TX / RX directions
# completely separate from each other
stty 9600 - echo < / dev/tts/0
# Tell the AVR we 're ready to start doing stuff
echo " start " >
/ dev/tts/0
while true # loop forever
do
inputline= " " # clear input
# Loop until we get a valid command from arduino
# the line should be the text file we have to open to get
# a random message
until inputline= $ ( echo $ inputline | grep -e " .txt " )
do
inputline=$ ( head -n 1 < / dev/tts/0 )
done
# got a valid line - text file name - from arduino
# example : gus-out.txt
# now open the file and get a random line from the file
if [ -f $ inputline ] ;
then
LINES=`wc -l $ inputline | awk '{ print ( $ inputline + 1 ) }'`
RANDSEED=`date '+ %S%M%I'`
LINE=`cat $ inputline | awk -v COUNT=$LINES - v SEED=$RANDSEED ' BEGIN { srand ( SEED ) ; i=int ( rand ( ) * COUNT ) } FNR==i { print $ 0 }'`
# got the random line
# create the twitpic message and send it
# store everything in vars to make
# curl opts for multipart form a bit more manageable
picfile=$picsdir$pic
cargo=" media=@$picfile "
myname=" username=$ TNAME
"
pword= " password=$ TWORD "
tweet =" message=$LINE
"
target = " http://twitpic.com/api/uploadAndPost "
# make sure the file exists and is readable
while [ !
-r $ picfile ] ;
do
picfile=$picsdir$pic
done
# tell curl to send a multipart form to twitpic
# save returned XML in a variable
RET=$ ( curl -s - S -F " $ myname " - F " $ pword " - F " $ cargo " - F " $ tweet " $ target )
echo " $ RET "
fi
done
in /www dir create the file pic.sh :
#/bin/sh
sleep 10
#cd /www
ln -s /dev/v4l / video0 / dev/video0 # create / dev/video0
spcacat -d /dev/video0 - g -f jpg -p 3000 -o > / dev/zero # take a picture every 3 sec
in /etc / init.d create a file called webcam ( this is going to start every time the router boots ) :
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# webcam script
# Copyright ( C ) 2007 OpenWrt.org
START=10
STOP=15
start ( )
{
echo start
# commands to launch application
/www/pic.sh &
}
stop ( )
{
echo stop
# commands to kill application
}
In ~/ catdoor dir create two files for each RFID tag your pets are using .
Name the files _the_tag_ - in.txt and _the_tag_ - out.txt ( replace _the_tag_ with tag 's code , for example 01068E2081 - in.txt and 01068E2081-out.txt ) .
Put some funny messages in those files .
Here are some examples that I used :
Gus is in to drink from the faucet .
Gus is in to smoke a catnip cigar .

echo " $ RET " Now the router is ready to communicate with the pet door controller .
To make the pet door controller communicate with the OpenWrt router you must connect the controller 's TX pin to the router 's RX pin and the controller 's GND to router 's GND ( In our situation the communication is one way , from the controller to the router ) .
First of all , comment ( add # in front of them ) the lines in /etc / inittab : this will disable login console terminal on serial port , so we can use it for back and forth communication with the arduino based controller .
Both the router 's serial port and controller 's serial port must have same speed to be able to communicate .
The router 's serial speed to is set to 9600 by executing :
For each RFID tag read by the pet dor controller , the controller will write to the serial the RFID tag with . txt at the end of line , for example , if the tag is 01068E2081 , and the pet went out the door ( breaking the IR beam ) the controller is going to write to the serial 01068E2081 - out. txt and if the pet went in the door ( door opened by the RFID tag ) , the controller is going to send over the serial 01068E2081 - in.txt
On the router , to read what 's coming over serial communication from the controller , your code should look something like this : by looking for . txt we will know when we got a new command from the pet door controller .
After we got a new command , for example 01068E2081 - out. txt , we are going to read a random line from the file with the same name : take a picture from the Webcam : and upload them to twitter ( twitpic ) :
In this project the communication is just one way , the OpenWrt router just receives messages from arduino based controller .
If you want to communicate both ways , in your bash script on the router use following command to send messages to arduino based conntroller : Basically on the Open
Wrt router you will have 2 scripts , one that starts the webcam capture and one that handles the communication with the pet door controller and uploads the messages and pictures to twitter .
On the router , create a dir in ~/ called catdoor : then , in this directory put the following script : tp.shin /www dir create the file pic.sh : increate a file called webcam ( this is going to start every time the router boots ) :
In ~/ catdoor dir create two files for each RFID tag your pets are using .
Name the filesand ( replace _the_tag_ with tag 's code , for example 01068E2081 - in.txt and 01068E2081-out.txt ) .
Put some funny messages in those files .

Tweeting Cat Door
Click here to see a preview of the next version being built .
Best use of Twitter , the Tweeting Cat Door :
We have two cats Gus and Penny :
They live indoors and outdoors .
Some other cats from the neighborhood learned that the food my wife buys is better than what they get from the owners , so regularly we find other cats in our garage feasting on the food .
I 'm a programmer and I like to build stuff ... so I had to build something to solve the problem .
Meet the Tweeting Cat door :
Each cat has a small RFID tag on the collar .
When a cat is in the close proximity of the door , a small RFID reader reads the tag and if the cat is authorized , a servo will unlock the cat door .
The RFID reader and the servo controller are connected to an old laptop .
The software on the laptop is written in Delphi and for each " cat door event " is sending a Twitter message and a picture to twitter.com : http://twitter.com/GusAndPenny
Below are some details on how I build the " Tweeting cat door " .
Please click on the picture to see it in full size : 1 . USB Hub .
Used to connect all the components together .
2 . Micro switch .
The micro switch is connected to the joystick hardware .
When the cat door is open , one of the joystick buttons is pressed .
This helps the software decide if the cat went in or out .
3 . Cat door .
4 . Servo . I used " HiTec HS - 322HD Standard Servo " .
5 . This originally was the electronics from a joystick .
Currently , I use the electronic board from a guitar made for the game " Guitar Hero " .
The original joystick hardware burned after few days of use .
6 . Servo controller .
I used " PhidgetServo 1 - Motor " .
7 . RFID Reader .
I used PhidgetRFID .
8 . There is also a Webcam ( not visible in the picture ) used for the " Tweeting cat door " .
Listen to the story of the Tweeting Cat Door on Canadian Public Radio : cbc.ca Tweeting Cat Door on Spiegel.de
Here is a funny story .
My son , Vlad , ( he 's 11 ) always plays pranks on me ... and one Saturday while I was sitting on the toilet reading the news on my handheld internet enabled computer ( Nokia N810 ) , I heard him saying to my wife " I saw a weird animal outside , around the cat door dad made ! " .
Curious to see what he is talking about , I fired up VNC and connected to the laptop that handles the cat door and .... here is the picture I found ...
I did n't know how to get out of the bathroom fast enough to see what the heck was the animal in the picture !
Of course , when I got out , he was laughing and I realized that he 's the monster !
Capitals Outsider suddenly has been approved by the Capitals to get the inside scoop in the form of press credentials .
So , here I am , up in the box with journalists from The Washington Post , The Washington Times , washingtoncaps.com , the Associated Press and many others for the Saturday night game against Eastern Conference rivals Carolina Hurricanes .
Here ’s the press drill :
We enter on 6th Street , sign in , walk through the underbelly of the Verizon Center ( very close to the locker rooms – I even spotted a few players ) .
We ’re given dinner before we head upstairs to sit in the press box on the 400 level .
There are two sides to the press box , and two levels on each side .
Eight Samsung flat screen televisions hang in front of us on each side .
When a goal is scored or a penalty is taken , a separate announcement is made to the press just to make sure we get the facts straight .
Before the game , the friendly Capitals press folks pass out the rosters .
In between periods , they pass out the ongoing game stats , complete with time on ice data ( total , power play , shorthanded ) .
Much of this data are not even available on the web .
Several packets of up - to - date info are available , including Daily Clips ( complete with a Mike Vogel preview , the latest Washington Post and Washington Times articles ) , a huge packet of game notes with info on what each player did in each game all season , extremely detailed NHL statistics , and a Capitals supplemental statistics packet .
This is where Joe Beninati and Craig Laughlin get their obscure facts they mention during the broadcasts .
Press box etiquette :
No cheering .
And no wearing your team gear .
We keep it professional up here .
Though I ’ve been up here before representing my former employer , washingtonpost.com , it ’s been about nine years .
I remember the last game I was at , because it was Ted Leonsis ’s first season as owner , and the Penguins ( who else ? ) eliminated the Caps from the playoffs when Jaromir Jagr ’s shot deflected off of Calle Johansson ’s skate , past Olaf Kolzig .
Tonight , the Capitals won in a shootout on goals by Alex Semin ( goal , three assists ) and Alex Ovechkin ( goal , assist ) .
As the fans were celebrating , I headed back downstairs and hung out near the locker room .
I did n’t see much , but did see ( and smell ) the Hurricanes ’ equipment in their bags being carted away .
A bit later , Coach Bruce Boudreau came out to the podium and took questions from journalists .
I had the opportunity to go into either locker room , but passed .
I ’ve been in them before .
The players are trying to get clean and dressed while journalists are interviewing them , and that ’s about it .
So , there you have it .
That ’s life in the press box .
Not a bad gig , huh ?
FAILED stars may be more common than anyone thought .
If so , it would change our idea of how stars form .
In 2007 , a star near the centre of our galaxy appeared to brighten because another object had focused the star ’s light onto Earth .
From the way the object bent the light , Andrew Gould of Ohio State University in Columbus and colleagues have now found that it is a brown dwarf – a “ failed star ” with too little mass to sustain the nuclear reactions that power stars .
Current estimates of how common brown dwarfs are suggest this finding is improbable – so …

Timor - Leste : Gently combating harmful childbirth traditions

UNHCR is not responsible for , nor does it necessarily endorse , its content .
Any views expressed are solely those of the author or publisher and do not necessarily reflect those of UNHCR , the United Nations or its Member States .
DILI , 15 April 2009 ( IRIN ) - Infant and maternal mortality rates in Timor - Leste are being adversely affected by harmful traditions and practices , according to experts .
But fighting them is a sensitive issue .
Nadine Hoekman , country director and programme manager for Health Alliance International ( HAI ) , a Washington - based NGO working with the Health Ministry , told IRIN it was difficult to quantify the problem .
" There are no stats available regarding mortality or morbidity specifically related to these practices , " she said , adding that even accurate information on exactly how many mothers and newborns are dying is difficult to ascertain since the deaths often go unreported .
" It happens quite a lot that when a mother gives birth , they stay by a fire for three months , " said Macu Guterres , the coordinator of the National Breastfeeding Association for the Alola Foundation , an NGO that supports women and children in Timor - Leste .
" They make a small bed beside the fire and sleep there while the fire burns 24 hours a day , " she said , explaining that the heat from the fire is believed to help dispel " dirty " blood from the body after birth .
" This can affect the baby 's health as well as the mum .
The baby can develop asthma or may find it hard to breathe because of the smoke .
It happens a lot in Oecussi , " she said , referring to the Timorese enclave deep inside Indonesian territory .
According to figures published by the UN Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , the infant mortality rate in Timor - Leste in 2007 was 77 per 1,000 live births , which is " relatively high " for the region .
Timor - Leste has one of the fastest - growing populations in the world , with women having an average of 6.5 children each , according to the UN World Population Prospects .
Several NGOs are working to raise awareness of the potential danger of such customs for mothers and babies , but this is not easy given that the adult literacy rate is just over 50 percent ( UN Human Development Index ) .
Traditional birth attendants
Traditional birth attendants ( ' dukuns ' ) , using traditional medicines and sometimes harmful practices , are common , especially in rural areas .
The Alola Foundation estimates that only 10 percent of women in Timor - Leste give birth with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant .
According to HAI , harmful practices by ' dukuns ' include encouraging the mother to push before she is ready , and placing rice or other substances in the birth canal to " lure the baby out " .
" Sometimes this choice [ of birth attendant ] is related to a stronger belief in the skill and practices of a traditional birth attendant in the community as compared to a trained health person , " Hoekman said .
Another common belief is that colostrum , the nutrient - rich milk mothers produce in the late stages of pregnancy and immediately after birth , is bad for the baby .
" They believe using water and honey instead of colostrum will wash the baby 's stomach and intestines and remove dirty blood , " Alola Foundation 's Guterres said , adding that the Foundation has 436 volunteers in nine districts working in " mother support groups " .
Rogerio Pedro Sam , an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Mother of Perpetual Help Pharmacy and Clinic in Bidau ( part of Dili ) , said another harmful custom was the taking of a really hot bath , and drinking really hot water , after delivery .
" Sometimes they burn their skin , " he said , explaining that the hot water is believed to flush out " dirty " blood after childbirth .
Sam said harmful practices were most prevalent in rural areas , where 70 percent of the country 's one million people live .
" Behaviour change is a long process .
We try for a multi- pronged approach in our work - using different strategies to address issues , keeping messages simple and consistent , but delivering them in a variety of ways , " HAI 's Hoekman said .
" Rather than operating under the assumption that anything traditional is bad , and modern is good , we have chosen to look at how non-harmful traditional practices can be supported . "

If the auto industry is allowed to dump their pension plans through bankruptcy , it could put the pensions of millions of other retired workers at risk .
The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation , the government insurer that backs pension plans , would quickly run out of funds and be overwhelmed with claims .
It would be forced to slash promised benefits to retirees .
It would also open the door to other companies looking to dump their pension obligations through bankruptcy court .
The dire state of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ’s decision to gamble its money in the stock market certainly has n’t helped things , as we noted here earlier this month .
The holes in the pension fund and related dire circumstances of 401 ( k ) programs have been apparent for some time .
James Ridgeway reported on corporate America ’s plans to ditch their obligations to retired workers back in this article from 1999 .
We can only hope that the current situation will put an end to any more calls to privatize Social Security , which is becoming the default retirement plan for more and more Americans .
From the NYT :
Pension experts predict that a government takeover of the two giant plans would spur other auto companies and all types of manufacturers to abandon such benefits for competitive reasons . …
“ If one of these companies solves its pension problem by shunting it off to the federal government , then for competitive reasons the others have to do the same thing , ” said Zvi Bodie , a professor of finance at the Boston University School of Management and longtime observer of the government ’s pension insurance system .
“ That is the death spiral . ”
Though the automakers ’ plans each have a gap between what they have on hand and what they owe their retirees over the years , if they failed , most of that shortfall would be made up by workers in the form of smaller benefits – not by the companies or the government .
…
For years , traditional pensions – those that shield workers from market risk – have been in a slow decline , with troubled sectors like aviation and steel shedding their plans in bankruptcy court as new types of individually managed benefits like 401 ( k ) plans have taken hold .
But big sectors , particularly manufacturing and financial services , have clung to the old plans .
The Pension Rights Center , a consumer group in Washington , estimates that 18 million Americans are still building up such benefits every year , and millions more retirees are receiving guaranteed payments from their former employers .
“ Those that are fortunate enough to have those plans are sleeping soundly , ” said Karen Ferguson , director of the center .
The loss of the auto pensions would be devastating partly because Detroit sustains many other businesses and partly because of their history .
It was the United Automobile Workers union , more than any other force , that pushed Congress to enact laws forcing companies to put money behind their pension promises and creating the federal guarantor .
The failure of a major auto workers plan would be a blow to the whole system .
Not only would Ford have reason to opt out of the expense of maintaining a pension plan , but so would Toyota and Honda , which also have pension plans at their American plants , said Teresa Ghilarducci , a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research and former member of the P.B.G.C. ’s advisory board . …
For traditional pension plans , “ maybe this is their last stand , ” said Jeffrey B. Cohen , a partner with the law firm Ivins , Phillips & Barker in Washington who was chief counsel for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation from 2005 to 2007 .
If the automakers ’ plans fail , he added , “ the biggest domino will have fallen for the P.B.G.C. ”

The children were found in sewers close to railway stations
Italian police have found more than 100 immigrants , including 24 Afghan children , living in the sewer system beneath railway stations in Rome .
The children range in age from 10 to 15 years and are now being looked after by the city 's social services .
They were found when the railway police followed up reports of children living near the city 's stations .
The police say they do not speak Italian and broke into the sewers by removing manhole covers .
The charity Save the Children Italy says that more than 1,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Rome last year from various countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America .
Container stowaways
Railway police had been following up reports that groups of homeless immigrants were living in unhygienic conditions in and around Rome 's three main railway stations .
Police said the Afghan children appeared to have arrived in the Italian capital as stowaways on board trailer trucks arriving from Turkey and Greece .
Some children were sleeping at night in sewers under the railway station to shelter from the cold , police said .
The number of foreign minors arriving in Italy has risen substantially over the past five years , according to children 's charities .
Roman police also recently discovered groups of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and China living crammed 20 or more to a room .
As fast as the authorities find them proper accommodation , their places are taken by new arrivals , the BBC's David Willey reports from the Italian capital .
Most major Web companies – Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , etc. – have announced support for OpenID , meaning that you can use your credentials from any one of those services to register and login to third - party websites that support OpenID .
But Facebook is taking a big leap beyond all of these companies today by enabling you to login to its own site using either Gmail or OpenID .
That means that if you ’re not one of the 200 million people on Facebook yet ( ok , you probably are , but for everyone else … ) , you can now signup using the same username and password you use to login to Gmail , or , in a bit more cumbersome fashion using an OpenID URL from another identity provider .
A bit more on how it works , from Facebook :
“ Existing and new users can now link their Facebook accounts with their Gmail accounts or with accounts from those OpenID providers that support automatic login .
Once a user links his or her account with a Gmail address or an OpenID URL , logs in to that account , then goes to Facebook , that user will already be logged in to Facebook . ”
The implementation does n’t seem to be live yet for everyone , but the focus on Gmail is especially interesting , given Google , through Friend Connect , is a bit of a competitor to Facebook , and Facebook , MySpace , and Google are all offering identity platforms of their own that would seemingly compete with OpenID .
But , the integration seems to serve Facebook ’s goal of establishing your social graph on the site , by helping you friend your existing Gmail contacts that use the social network .
Facebook adds that Gmail users “ get up and running after registering even faster than before , find their friends easily , and quickly engage on the site . ”
This is big news in the world of OpenID , and it will be interesting to see if it paves the way for other major Web companies that have become identity providers to also do what Facebook is doing – becoming what ’s known as a “ relying party " and , for example , letting you login to Gmail with your Yahoo credentials .

Did you get your juice today ?
PARIS — Israel has always believed in " creating facts on the ground , " whose existence may later come as an unpleasant surprise to others .
Iran now seems to have learned from this Israeli precedent , to Israel ’s disadvantage .
In diplomatic circles , in Europe as well as the Arab states , there has been discussion of the possibility of Iran ’s being designated a " civil nuclear power , " exercising its right , under the Nonproliferation Treaty ( which it has signed ) , to develop power for civilian uses .
This is what Iran has persistently claimed to be all it wants .
The proposal goes on to say that whatever military work Iran has done is already faits accomplis — " created facts , " that are useless to contest .
The proposal is that if the U.S. were to join Europe and the Sunni Arabs in a drive to push Israel — which has plenty of concealed nuclear " facts " — to join the non-proliferation pact , which it has always refused to do , and open up to inspectors , just as Iran has done , the Iran - Israel discussion could at least be switched onto a new track .
The foreign policy position of Israel under the Benjamin Netanyahu government remains officially unknown .
It undoubtedly will not be clarified until the new Israeli prime minister visits the United States to meet President Barack Obama .
The atmosphere is chilly , the unction of Shimon Peres during his American visit notwithstanding , because of the less - than - enthusiastic welcome the Obama administration gave the America - Israel Public Affairs Committee convention last week .
Vice President Joe Biden attended , and Rahm Emanuel was the star of a fund - raising reception .
But both stuck to the U.S. position that there must be a two - state solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was not there , and has been rumored to be fighting on Israel ’s side in a conflict with National Security Adviser Gen. James L. Jones , whose insistence on the two - state agreement is seen by the Israelis as a threat .
They want to throw out all previous agreements with the Palestinians , the Quartet and the United States and start negotiations all over .
Israel has set two conditions for new talks , both conflicting with U.S. policy .
The first is Iran ’s effective nuclear disarmament , which is impossible because of those Iranian facts on the ground , and because the U.S. has set itself against military action .
The second demand is also made for propaganda purposes , and is of transparent bad faith .
It is that Israel be " recognized as a Jewish state " by all its interlocutors .
This is impossible because Israel refuses to describe which " Israel " is to be recognized .
The 1948 state recognized by the U.N. ?
Israel within the 1967 armistice borders ( long ago violated by colonies and annexation of Palestinian lands ) ?
Or an Israel with frontiers yet to be defined — since annexation and colonization continue today ?
This comes at a moment when Israel ’s Jewish population actually is falling through emigration .
Israel already is internationally recognized within its legal borders .
Everyone knows that it is a Jewish state .
But the demand to recognize it as such is meant to exclude the Arab citizens of Israel , who were there long before there was an Israel .
Netanyahu ’s new foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has already demanded that they be forced to take a loyalty oath ( or be expelled ) .
The demand is also meant to foreclose Palestinian claims on illegally seized property in 1948 or after , and most important , to close off any Palestinian " right to return " ( or recompense ) .
This position is not meant to be taken seriously .
It is propaganda to impress foreign public opinion and Jews living in Europe and America : " You see , the Arabs wo n’t even recognize us as a Jewish state ! "
The demand that the threat of Iran be eliminated before Israel negotiates on Palestine replays a well - worn record .
The issue could still be considered live a year ago , when Israel sought American permission ( and assistance ) in an attack on Iran .
That was rejected by President George W. Bush , probably to greater surprise in Jerusalem than in Washington , where the political class has no desire for still another war sure to involve the United States .
President Netanyahu will probably tell President Obama that he will be happy to negotiate but only on conditions that cannot be met , including total suppression of Hamas , denial of a sovereign Palestine state in full control of its territory , and without removing established Israeli colonies or Israeli air and water rights .
Since none of this can be taken seriously , the great question is what response Barack Obama will give .
That will reveal to the world whether there will or will not be more war in the Middle East .

The OLC gave the CIA Approval in 2002 for " harmless " waterboarding .
Two August 1 , 2002 memos authored by John Yoo on behalf of Jay Bybee established the OLC definition of torture and gave approval for waterboarding .
The " " 2002 Techniques Memo " ( PDF ) " described waterboarding as harmless .
Coupled with this description of waterboarding as harmless , the " " 2002 Torture Definition Memo " ( PDF ) " held that a technique would only be torture if it caused severe harm :
They treat severe pain as an indicator of ailments that are likely to result in permanent and serious physical damage in the absence of immediate medical treatment .
Such damage must rise to the level of death , organ failure , or the permanent impairment of a significant body function .
These statutes suggest that to constitute torture ' severe pain ' must rise to a similarly high level -- the level that would ordinarily be associated with a physical condition or injury sufficiently serious that it would result in death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions .
Thus the OLC definition of torture from August 1 , 2002 until it was withdrawn by Jack Goldsmith in June 2004 , considered torture to be what happens when , but for medical intervention , a technique causes death , organ failure , or serious impairment of body functions .
The Waterboarding Began With Tapes Rolling
The CIA waterboarded Abu Zubaydah " at least 83 times during August 2002 " .
In November 2002 the CIA acquired the alleged USS Cole mastermind , Abd al Rahim al Nashiri , from Dubai , and used the waterboard on him at least 2 times .
The CIA recorded ( PDF ) 90 videotapes of interrogation sessions with Abu Zubaydah and 2 tapes of sessions with al - Nashiri in 2002 .
A heavily redacted description ( PDF ) of the videotapes notes the tapes captured 12 [ enhanced interrogation sessions ] including the waterboarding of al - Nashiri .
The taping stopped in 2002 .
Although initial reporting by Mark Mazetti suggested that Two of the 90 videotapes were destroyed in 2005 , later reporting indicated that all the tapes were destroyed together .
Regardless , destruction of the videotape of the two detainees who were waterboarded suggests cover -up :
They were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that tapes documenting controversial interrogation methods could expose agency officials to greater risk of legal jeopardy , several officials said .
What was on the tapes ?
I am convinced that the videotapes captured events that " shocked the conscience " that occurred during the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah in August 2002 and al - Nashiri in December 2002 .
This conclusion is supported by important evidence that one or more major " ADVERSE EVENTS " occurred in the CIA enhanced interrogation program before January 1 , 2003 :
Timing
Robert Mueller ordered FBI agents to withdraw from Zubaydah interrogation because he thought enhanced techniques were illegal .
This is consistent with FBI agents witnessing " ADVERSE EVENTS " in the waterboarding of Zubaydah , August 2002 .
The CIA totally stopped videotaping after December 2002 and the CIA allegedly told the Chair and Vice Chair of the SSIC they wanted to destroy videotapes in February 2003 .
This is consistent with " ADVERSE EVENTS " on videotapes ( through December 2002 ) .
" Interrogation Guidelines " -
The CIA changed the rules for interrogation in January 2003 , and two memos , both dated January 28 , 2003 , memorialize the changes .
The first Memo signed by George Tenet is heavily redacted , but part of its title and its contents are referenced in the recently released 2005 Memo from Stephen Bradbury ( " 2005 Bradbury Memo " ( PDF ) ) :
If the plan calls for the use of any of the interrogation techniques discussed herein [ enhanced interrogation techniques ] , it is submitted to CIA Headquarters , which must review the plan and approve the use of any of these interrogation techniques before they may be applied .
See George J. Tenet Director of Central Intelligence Guidelines on Interrogations Conducted Pursuant to the [ redacted ] ( Jan 28 , 2003 ) ( " Interrogation Guidelines " )
.
This rule change suggests a CIA response to " ADVERSE EVENTS " that occurred prior to January 2003 .
" Confinement Guidelines " - The Second Tenet Memo of January 28 , 2003 is also cited in the " 2005 Bradbury Memo " ( PDF ) , and has not yet been released , even in redacted form .
This memo , Guidelines on Confinement Conditions for CIA Detainees ( Jan. 28,2003 ) ( " Confinement Guidelines " ) may require medical personnel at CIA interrogation facilities , as it is cited after this paragraph :
Medical and psychological personnel are on - scene throughout ( and , as detailed below , physically present or otherwise observing during the applicatlon of many techniques ; including all techniques involving physical contact with detainees ) , and " [ d ) aily physical and
psychological evaluations are continued throughout the period of [ enhanced interrogation technique ] use "
Together with the Interrogation Guidelines memo of the same date , this memo indicates major internal changes to the CIA program in January 2003 , likely in response to " ADVERSE EVENTS " from December 2002 or before .
In January , 2003 , the CIA Office of Inspector General initiated " a special review " of the CIA terrorist detention and interrogation program .
Although the CIA stated that the review was not initiated in response to an allegation of wrongdoing , the timing suggests this may have been coincident with unrest in the intelligence community over enhanced techniques employed before January 2003 .
Evidence that the " ADVERSE EVENTS " occurred during waterboarding of Zubaydah and al - Nashiri
The sequence of waterboarding was :
Abu Zubaydah - 83 times in August 2002
al - Nashiri - at least 2 times in November - December 2002
Khalid Sheik Mohammed ( KSM ) - 183 times in March 2003
The only high - value detainees in custody before January 2003 were Zubaydah , Binalshib and al - Nashiri , of whom only Zubaydah and al - Nashiri were waterboarded .
Videotapes of Zubaydah and al Nashiri tapes were destroyed , implicating adverse events in interrogations of both men .
A heavily censored footnote on page 15 of the " 2005 Bradbury Memo " ( PDF ) discusses what appears to be a near - death episode excerpted from the still - secret CIA Inspector General report :
In our limited experience , extensive use of the waterboard can introduce new risks .
Most seriously , for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation , the subject may simply give up , allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness .
An unresponsive subject should be righted immediately and the interrogator should deliver a sub - xyphoid thrust to expel the water .
If this fails to restore normal breathing , aggressive medical intervention is required .
Any subject who has reached this degree of compromise is not [ censored hereafter ] .
Zubaydah and KSM are the only detainees known to undergo " extensive waterboarding " by the CIA , and KSM was waterboarded differently than Zubaydah ( KSM had medical personnel in the room , see below ) .
Indeed , Zubaydah is the only detainee who reported losing control of his bowel or bladder function or his consciousness during his interrogation .
From the recently - leaked International Committee of the Red Cross report on " High Value " Detainees ( " ICRC Report ( PDF ) " ) , Zubaydah described his interrogation including waterboarding :
On this occassion my head was in a more backward , downwards position and the water was poured on for a longer time .
I struggled without success to breathe .
I thought I was going to die .
I lost control of my urine .
Since then I still lose control of my urine when under stress .
< snip >
I collapsed and lost consciousness on several occasions .
Eventually the torture was stopped by a doctor .
Thus it appears the IG report footnote is referring to a waterboarding " ADVERSE EVENT " of Zubaydah that required resuscitative medical intervention .
The CIA only waterboarded al - Nashiri two times .
Considering that Zubaydah and KSM were together waterboarded 266 times , this low number for al - Nashiri is consistent with an " ADVERSE EVENT " in his waterboarding in December 2002 , that made them reluctant to try again .
They dramatically altered the protocol for waterboarding by March 2003 .
Specifically ,
The ICRC report description of the waterboarding of AZ and KSM is almost identical with the exception of one detail .
KSM had a pulse oximeter ( a device to measure blood oxygen levels ) attached to his finger to measure the level of oxygen in his blood during waterboarding , and he noted that there was a doctor present in the room each time this procedure was used .
This suggests that " ADVERSE EVENTS " in the experience of waterboarding Zubaydah or al - Nashiri led to this drastic change in protocol requiring close medical supervision .
They stopped waterboarding after KSM in March 2003 .
This suggests they knew waterboarding was prone to " ADVERSE EVENTS " .
After Goldsmith withdrew the 2002 OLC memos in June 2004 , the waterboarding was in legal limbo , and as such so were the actions of the waterboarders .
A December 2004 memo from the CIA Office of Medical Services ( OMS ) [ OMS Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Rendition , Interrogation and Detention ( Dec. 2004 ) ( " OMS Guidelines " ) ] is cited in the " 2005 Bradbury Memo " .
These OMS guidelines require that a physician with emergency surgical tools be present while waterboarding takes place , in order to resuscitate the detainee should he suffocate .
Thus it seems that the most problematic of the enhanced interrogation techniques was waterboarding , and the reason for this is that it could lead to death in the way that the CIA used it on Zubaydah and al - Nashiri .
Conclusion
Before August 2002 - The CIA told the OLC waterboarding was harmless .
August 2002 -
In response , the OLC established a definition of torture that excluded " harmless " techniques .
August 2002 - The CIA waterboarded Zubaydah 83 times , to the point he " gave up " , and required medical intervention .
August 2002 - The FBI withdraws agents from harsh interrogations .
Nov / Dec 2002 -
The CIA started waterboarding al - Nashiri but stopped after 2 sessions , likely after he too almost drowned .
December 2002 -
The CIA stopped videotaping interrogations when they realized they were recording torture .
January 2003 - Upset CIA agents , realizing non-harmless waterboarding fit the OLC definition of torture , stirred up the IG investigation and sparked the new January 28 , 2003 guidelines requiring CIA headquarters permission and some medical precautions .
February 2003 -
The CIA briefed a few select members of Congress , and almost certainly told them that waterboarding was harmless , consistent with the operational definition of torture and what OLC had approved .
March 2003 - The CIA waterboarded KSM , this time using medical personnel and a pulse oximeter to make sure he did not get asphyxiated ( drowned ) like his predecessors .
June 2003 ( and July 2004 ) - George Tenet gets Memos from the White House endorsing the harsh techniques the CIA was asked to use .
getting retroactive permission for the enhanced interrogation techniques .
By early 2004 - Goldsmith and other OLC lawyers figured out that if the CIA is using advanced medical techniques to resuscitate during waterboarding , they are fitting the 2002 OLC definition of torture .
June 2004 - Jack Goldsmith pulls the 2002 opinions in the wake of Abu Ghraib .
December 2004 - OMS Guidelines published ;
They finally Consult CIA doctors , who tell them they need a Physician with a tracheotomy kit in the room to waterboard , ending the fantasy that waterboarding is harmless .
Bradbury writes a new memo ( " 2005 Bradbury Memo " ( PDF ) ) , redefining torture and making it OK to use waterboarding , even though it can lead to death in the absence of medical and surgical intervention .

Update :
The concept that there were two " special " CIA videotapes in an original version of this diary was based on the initial report by Mark Mazetti in the NY Times .
Subsequent reporting indicated that the tapes may have been destroyed all at once .
Regardless , the destruction of videotape evidence is consistent with cover - up , and I have changed the body of the diary to reflect the more complete picture .

Interesting Ruby Tidbits That Don’t Need Separate Posts # 25
By Peter Cooper
A handful of random Ruby links , articles , and resources to end off the week ..
Is It JRuby ? - Track which gems work on JRuby
Is it JRuby ? is a " fork " of Brightbox 's Is It Ruby 1.9 that focuses on JRuby .
As with the Ruby 1.9 site , Is It JRuby lets you track gems , allowing you to mark them as either working or not working with JRuby ( yet ) or to track reports from others .
Remember that since these sites are community driven , the reports should never be taken as gospel and simply used as guidelines .
Ruby Enterprise Edition 's 3rd Sponsorship Campaign
The Phusion guys ( behind the awesome Passenger / mod_rails ) are looking for contributions to their third sponsorship campaign for Ruby Enterprise Edition .
If you 're not already aware , Ruby Enterprise Edition ( aka REE ) is a specially patched / adapted version of the MRI ( Matz 's Ruby Interpreter ) that uses less memory , has a tweaked garbage collector and memory allocator , and several other performance enhancements .
The target this time is $ 9000 and they have about $ 6000 left to go .
As an aside , Mike Perham 's article , Memory - hungry Ruby daemons , demonstrates how REE can prove useful in reducing memory use on long - running daemons .
MacRuby - Changing the Ruby Ecosystem ?
In MacRuby , Changing the Ruby Ecosystem , Matt Aimonetti writes about how MacRuby - the Apple sponsored , open source , Objective C driven Ruby implementation - fits into the Ruby ecosystem and , ultimately , how the big developments coming along could change it .
Key points include MacRuby 's rubyspec compliance , that MacRuby does n't require OS X , and MacRuby 's potentially explosive performance .

Engine Yard Takes Over Ruby 1.8.6 Maintenance
With both Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.1 , poor old Ruby 1.8.6 has been left in the dust support - wise .
Despite this , it 's still the most popular Ruby implementation out there and a lot of people depend on it .
Given this , hosting company Engine Yard 's team of engineers have decided to take over the legacy maintenance duties .
Hats off to them !
Apparently what the other clients of Palisade Systems are doing : accessing porn , carelessly slinging health records and Social Security information , and accessing hacking Web sites .
And these are the businesses .
Palisade gives the data to PCMag.com to prove it .
What are your kids looking at online at school ?
How secure is the personal information you provide to your doctor ?
Is your mortgage company going to send an IM that contains your Social Security number ?
Despite countless reports of identity theft and data leaks due to careless handling of peoples ' personal information , this type of behavior persists and is often more pervasive than most business owners would like to acknowledge , according to data from security firm Palisade Systems .
Small and medium - sized businesses like credit unions , schools , or hospitals will hire Palisade to run a 10 - day check of their operations to make sure sensitive data is being handled properly .
If problems are uncovered , they can sign up for Palisade 's monitoring system  a customizable , cable - like box that can attach to any network and either scan for additional problems or block certain activity from occurring .
" We 'll give clients [ our reports ] and they 'll say , ' I do n't believe you . '
That 's got to be a bunch of crap .
You 're just trying to sell me a box , " said Christian Renaud , vice president of strategy for Palisade Systems .
" Then we flip a couple pages and start showing them the actual violations  an example of a Social Security number in an e-mail , an attachment with credit card numbers  and then they do the ' Oh God , we actually have a problem ' moment . ' "
Palisade 's findings provide a disturbing complement to a , which found that default passwords and other easily - bypassed security was still surprisingly common at companies that had been hit by data breaches .
Palisade provided PCMag.com with redacted copies of some their reports to illustrate exactly what type of information is being sent or accessed .
At a school , for example , Palisade found that during a two - week period in October 2008 , schools officials sent 1,167 Social Security numbers , 42 credit card numbers , and the personal financial information of 4,646 people in an insecure manner .
This was done in a variety of ways  from e-mails ( " Hey , can you pull a record for this student .
Social Security number below . " ) and instant messages , to attachments and P2P .
In terms of network activity from students and faculty alike , Palisade found that P2P  in particular BitTorrent  is a favorite pastime .
But while that latest illegal track downloads onto school computers , what 's a person to do ?
Surf porn , apparently .
Palisade found that there were 49,466 incidents of pornography
Web site access in that two - week period , more than half a million visits to hacking Web sites , almost 50,000 to e-gambling sites , and more than 20,000 hits for what Palisade called " crime Web sites " .
Crime
Web sites can vary from best practices on how to pick locks , sites that detail where police are stationed to pick up speeders , or insider tips on surveillance camera locations , Renaud said .
Schools were not alone , however .
With all the emphasis on securing electronic medical records these days , how are the nation 's medical labs and hospitals faring ?
At a medical lab that was scanned between Sept. 30 and Oct. 15 , 2008 , Palisade found that employees improperly sent 144,095 Social Security numbers , four credit card numbers , the personal health information of 75,595 patients , and the personal financial information of 405 people .
At a healthcare company , meanwhile , the personal health information of 24,840 people was handled incorrectly , as were 740 Social Security numbers , and 94 credit card numbers .
But how about your average mid-size manufacturing company ?
Employees at the company scanned by Palisade improperly handled 498 Social Security numbers and 3,430 credit card numbers  possibly because they were distracted by the all the weapons and porn and drugs they were Googling on company time .
Palisade 's investigation of the manufacturing company logged 100,154 porn hits , more than 7,700 visits to crime - related sites , and more than 6,800 hits to weapons - related Web sites .
More than 70,000 searches were also made to job - search Web sites .
Most of the companies that approach Palisade have done so in order to make sure they are complying with federal privacy and security regulations while " other people got a whiff of something and they want the right forensic tools to go look around , " Renaud said .
" It 's a combination of factors . "
What can be done ?
" More often than not , it 's just bad training and bad processes , it 's not necessarily a bad actor or someone who wants to send out source code to the competition or sell Social Security numbers for cash , " he said .
WASHINGTON  As Taliban militants push deeper into Pakistan ’s settled areas , foreign operatives of Al Qaeda who had focused on plotting attacks against the West are seizing on the turmoil to sow chaos in Pakistan and strengthen the hand of the militant Islamist groups there , according to American and Pakistani intelligence officials .
One indication came April 19 , when a truck parked inside a Qaeda compound in South Waziristan , in Pakistan ’s tribal areas , erupted in a fireball when it was struck by a C.I.A. missile .
American intelligence officials say that the truck had been loaded with high explosives , apparently to be used as a bomb , and that while its ultimate target remains unclear , the bomb would have been more devastating than the suicide bombing that killed more than 50 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in September .
Al Qaeda ’s leaders  a predominantly Arab group of Egyptians , Saudis and Yemenis , as well as other nationalities like Uzbeks  for years have nurtured ties to Pakistani militant groups like the Taliban operating in the mountains of Pakistan .
The foreign operatives have historically set their sights on targets loftier than those selected by the local militant groups , aiming for spectacular attacks against the West , but they may see new opportunity in the recent violence .
Intelligence officials say the Taliban advances in Swat and Buner , which are closer to Islamabad than to the tribal areas , have already helped Al Qaeda in its recruiting efforts .
The officials say the group ’s recruiting campaign is currently aimed at young fighters across the Middle East , North Africa and Central Asia who are less inclined to plan and carry out far - reaching global attacks and who have focused their energies on more immediate targets .
We tend to think of Neanderthals as one species of cavemen - like creatures , but now scientists say there were actually at least three different subgroups of Neanderthals .
Using computer simulations to analyze DNA sequence fragments from 12 Neanderthal fossils , researchers found that the species can be separated into three , or maybe four , distinct genetic groups .
The evidence points to a subgroup of Neanderthals in Western Europe , another in Southern Europe near the Mediterranean , a third in Eastern Europe and the Middle East , and possibly a fourth in Western Asia .
These groups have been postulated before , but this is the first study analyzing DNA data to look for genetic variations differentiating the subgroups .
Neanderthals are a hominid species that lived between about 130,000 and 30,000 years ago .
They coexisted with humans for a while , and may even have interbred with us .
" Because the Neanderthals lived in a very vast territory , and their evolution took place over a very long time , we wonder if there were sub-populations , or if it was a unique population , " said researcher Silvana Condemi , a paleoanthropologist at the Universite de la Mediterranee - CNRS - EFS in France .
" Other studies show differences between Neanderthals and modern humans .
For the first time we are working just within Neanderthals and taking into account the diversity within that group . "
Condemi and Virginie Fabre and Anna Degioanni , also of the Universite de la Mediterranee , describe their findings in the April 13 issue of the journal PLoS ONE .
The researchers tested various hypotheses , including that all Neanderthals belonged to a single homogeneous population , or that Neanderthals could be divided into two , three , or more subgroups .
They found that the three - and four - group model best fit the data by accounting for the genetic discrepancies seen in the samples .
The authors admit that their categorization is based on limited data , since they only have fragments of mitochondrial DNA sequences from a small sample of individuals .
Princeton University paleoanthropologist Alan Mann agreed , and said it 's too early to draw bounds around sub-populations because we do n't have any data from individuals outside of the bounds , such as from Neanderthals in Africa or Southeast Asia .
" My view is this is very interesting research but it 's very premature in our study to be able to draw any but the most generalized and preliminary conclusions , " he said in a phone interview .
" I like the data they present .
But at the moment we have to be extremely careful about exactly what we make of this . "
In the future , the researchers would like to compare their genetic data to what is known about physical distinctions among Neanderthals from different regions , as well as cultural differences , such as unique tool use among various populations .
" What is nice is that there are some variations in the genetics , and we see also from the bones and teeth that there is some variation , " Condemi told LiveScience .
" We give a confirmation that the Neanderthals are not one homogeneous group . "
It is not known for sure what eventually caused Neanderthals to die out , while we Homo sapiens have survived to this day .
Likely reasons for their demise are competition with humans and climate change .

When we think about frugal living , there are a number of easy things we turn to to cut back on costs : cheaper food , using less car , eating out less .
But what about all the unconscious spending habits we ’ve acquired , or those other ways of parting with our money that we often forget about ?
For a moment I want to make you think about some of your own “ money traps ” – places where your usual rules seem to “ go out the window ” at just the wrong time .
Here are some of mine .
Try To Avoid These 10 Dumb Ways of Wasting Money
Tourist traps .
The main culprit here are the “ gift shops ” which persuade you into thinking that you ’re never going to be able to remember the nice time you had unless you buy the t- shirt or gizmo , which of course , is only available on location at the site .
“ Get your picture taken next to the ____ ” or sites located in the middle of nowhere that have one tiny cafe that sells water for $ 5.00 a bottle – take your own picture and bring your own water !
Gift shops are great – for looking maybe .
Next time you ’re in one , try to remember where all that stuff is going to go when you get back home – or if there ’s even enough room in your suitcase for it in the first place .
Travel Books and Maps .
While maybe these should n’t be considered an outright “ waste ” of money , I think they ’re very unnecessary for a number of reasons .
If you spend on these at least do n’t buy the brand new ones .
Travel books go out of date ; they ’re heavy ( when you want to travel light ) ; if you have a laptop you can always or usually find an internet connection somewhere and get your info that way .
Do your research online – all maps are also online .
You can print them off .
Finally , just talk to the locals as well for great , current ideas on how and where to spend your time .
Besides , are you ever going to use that travel guide again once you ’re back from vacation ?
Library / video rental fines .
An obvious one , hopefully a bit easier to avoid these days with the slow disappearance of “ late ” fees .
I bet I ’ve lost at least a thousand dollars on this mistake .
Speeding / parking tickets .
Luckily I ’ve only had about three of these in my life , but it still does n’t feel good to have to fork over $ 25 - $ 80 because of parking in the wrong place or not coming to a very full stop .
This one ’s a no - brainer if you ’re trying to save money .
Getting ripped off .
Recently I tried a new Vietnamese restaurant in my area and had the pad thai .
Within five minutes of leaving the restaurant ( after not being able to finish the meal ) , I became violently nauseous .
Unfortunately , I had to get sick in a public place .
Luckily , I felt quickly better as soon as the food was out of my system – the problem was obviously something in the food .
I spent $ 15 on that meal , but I did n’t go back to try to get my money back .
I should have .
I did end up going back the next day to tell them about it , but I could n’t bring myself to ask for the money .
Make sure you eat your food slowly ( for this reason among others ! ) and make sure you ’re getting value for what you pay for .
Check your receipts and statements and inquire about anything that does n’t make sense .
Get Rich Quick ( or Eventually ! )
Services , aka “ How to Make Money Doing X ” .
Sometimes it makes sense to spend money to make money .
Other times it does n’t .
Unfortunately it takes some experience to be able to make a judgment either way .
I confess , I once bought one of those “ adsense secrets ” - type books for ten bucks .
I wish I had n’t .
All that information is already on the web somewhere if you take the time to read it and filter it all out and test it for yourself .
Other bloggers will help you too , and often post about their experiences .
Buying too much furniture and “ house stuff ” before you ’re ready or able to settle down .
This might apply more to those just starting out , but I made the mistake of getting “ house - happy ” etc. and buying great living accessories when I did n’t even have a full - time job to pay for them , let alone a mortgage or long - term lease .
And if you ’re already settled in a house , reconsider what you really need to fill it with .
Do n’t spend on kitsch knick - knacks and decorations .
Sometimes less is more , and I think that applies here .
Keep your home a minimalist oasis , a place for relaxation .
It ’s more practical and will help energize your life as well as save you money .
Remember , you have to take care of all these things and someday you ’ll probably end up just selling many at a garage sale , so just do n’t buy them .
Invest that money instead .
Skip the DVDs , CDs and Magazines / Newspapers .
Unless you have a professional need for these , it ’s much easier nowadays to rent or buy / watch these and listen / read online for a fraction of the cost of buying them .
No , I ’m not advocating stealing them by burning them for free , despite what “ open - source ” advocates argue for .
Producers need to be paid for their work .
I ’m just saying that not only is it less expensive for you , but you do n’t have to worry about storing them or misplacing them .
Simplify your life !
Help the environment .
It ’s not just the paper but all the ink that goes into these publications that matters .
Gift - giving for the Wrong People and the Wrong Reasons .
Gifts make sense when they ’re genuine and meaningful , not when they ’re expected or part of some social obligation .
Opt - out of Hallmark cards and token party gifts except in cases that really reflect your values .
Do n’t be guilted into spending money on gifts , especially because these so often coincide with the heavily - marketed calendrical holidays that usually go hand - in - hand with candy so you can thin your wallet and loosen your belt .
Unexpected purchases under $ 5.00 .
These are tricky and ca n’t be listed in advance .
They ’re hard to notice because they cost so little .
We wo n’t even think about buying them because it feels like the price does n’t matter – it wo n’t make much of a dent on our card , after all .
I ’d say it might be worth trying to make a list of all the things you buy for less than $ 5.00 and see what you learn .
How much of it is really necessary ?
Are you spending a lot more on gum than you think ?
How will it make you feel to know that at the end of the month you not only ate 20 chocolate bars but spent $ 35 to do so ?
Uugh .
Some purchases might seem extravagant ( a Starbucks latte ) but might add quite a bit to quality of life ( spending an hour chatting / reading in the cafe ) .
If a purchase adds to your life experience or education , then I ’d say it ’s giving you something back .
But if you can find an effective , cheaper substitute for it , then I ’d try to do so .
What are your money traps ?
Do you share any of the above ?
I ’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below .

Evolution of the Unhealthy American , Part 1 : We 're a fat , unhealthy nation
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Obesity and its related health problems have reached epidemic proportions in the United States .
For visual proof , just spend some time at the mall or other highly populated areas , but how did we get here in the first place ?
The rise in the prevalence in overweight and obese individuals started in the mid-70s with a striking increase starting in the mid-80s .
As illustrated in the above graphic , in 1985 , 12 states had a prevalence of obesity less than 10 percent ; eight states had a prevalence between 10 percent and 14 percent ; and no states reported a prevalence of 15 percent or higher .
In 1990 , 10 states had a prevalence of obesity less than 10 percent ; 34 states had a prevalence between 10 percent and 14 percent ; and no states reported a prevalence of 15 percent or higher .
In 1998 , not one state had a prevalence of obesity less than 10 percent ; seven states had a prevalence between 20 percent and 40 percent ; and no state had a prevalence equal to or greater than 25 percent
In 2007 , only one state ( Colorado ) had a prevalence of less than 20 percent .
Thirty states had a prevalence equal to or greater than 25 percent ; three of these states ( Alabama , Mississippi , Tennessee ) had a prevalence of obesity equal to or greater than 30 percent .
According to two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) , the prevalence of obesity for adults between the ages of 20 and 74 increased from 15 percent in the 1976 – 1980 survey , to 32.9 percent in the 2003 – 2004 survey ( 1 ) .
These same surveys also showed the number of adults considered to be overweight increased from 47 percent to an astounding 66.2 percent , with the sharpest swell in overweight and obesity occurring in the '90s .
Thankfully , there seems to have been a leveling off of obesity rates since 1999 , with no significant change between 2003 and 2006 for either men or women ( 2 ) .
However , despite this leveling of obesity rates , two - thirds of the people in the U.S. remain over weight or obese , and this is unacceptable .
Overweight and obese individuals are at an increased risk for many physical ailments , many of which result in disability and death ( 3 ) .
High blood pressure , hypertension
High blood cholesterol , dyslipidemia
Type II ( non-insulin dependent ) diabetes
Insulin resistance / glucose intolerance
Hyperinsulinemia
Coronary heart disease
Angina
Congestive heart failure
Stroke
Cholecystitis ( inflammation of the gall bladder ) and cholelithiasis ( gallstones )
Gout
Osteoarthritis
Obstructive sleep apnea
Asthma
Some types of cancer ( endometrial , breast , prostate and colon )
Complications of pregnancy including : gestational diabetes , gestational hypertension , preeclampsia and complications in operative deliveries ( i.e. , c- sections )
Poor female reproductive health ( menstrual irregularities , infertility and irregular ovulation )
Bladder control problems
Psychological disorders like depression , eating disorders and low self esteem
Compared to individuals with normal weight , those who are overweight and obese are significantly more likely to be associated with diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol levels , asthma , arthritis and fair to poor health ( 4 ) .
The primary physical effects of being overweight , besides being cumbersome , are cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and Type II diabetes .
Hypertension , which is an independent risk factor for CVD , increases progressively as one becomes heavier .
" Obese persons are six times as likely to have hypertension as compared to lean adults .
These increases in hypertension translate into a 12 percent increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and a 24 percent increased risk for stroke " ( 5 ) .
The relationship between diabetes , CVD and being overweight and inactive are nearly inescapable .
Diabetes comes with the territory .
Data from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) shows that more than 80 percent of people diagnosed with Type II diabetes are overweight or obese .
The heavier you are , the higher the risk .
And according to the American Heart Association , 75 percent of the people who have diabetes die from some type of CVD .
Other problems associated with Type II diabetes include nerve damage , kidney damage , blindness , lowered immunity , osteoporosis and Alzheimer’s .
In the early 1900s , people with clogged arteries at any age were very rare .
Most physicians during this time never witnessed a heart attack during their practice .
Physicians who were trying to study cardiovascular disease had to search the country for patients .
By the mid ' 50s , CVD became our number one killer , and it remains the leading killer today .
It was around this time that the lipid hypothesis started to gain popularity .
The lipid hypothesis , which was proposed by Ancel Keys in the late ' 50s , is a theory claiming there is a direct relationship between the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet and the incidence of CVD .
Today in the United States one person will die from CVD every 37 seconds ( 6 ) .
This year an estimated 1.26 million people will have a new or recurrent heart attack , and just short of half will die ( 7 ) .
About 80 million people , or more than 25 percent of the U.S. ’ population , has one or more forms of cardiovascular disease ( 7 ) .
In 2002 , CVD mortality was nearly 60 percent of " total mortality " in the U.S. ( 6 ) .
That means that out of 2.4 million deaths from all causes , CVD was listed as a primary cause on about 1.4 million death certificates .
CVD causes more deaths than the next seven causes combined .
It ’s safe to say that CVD had a meteoric rise from the 1930s to the 1950s to become number one , and to this day the incidence is still rising to a great extent because of our expanding waistlines .
As a result of the inherent health risks , and the increasing number of obese individuals , obesity is the number two preventable cause of death in the United States ( 8 ) .
In 2000 , obesity accounted for 365,000 deaths , which is 16 percent of all deaths .
Tobacco , which is still the number one preventable cause of death , accounted for 435,000 deaths , or 18 percent of all deaths .
And according to the study , the gap is narrowing .
In 1990 obesity caused about 300,000 deaths , or 14 percent of the total , with tobacco causing 400,000 deaths , or 19 percent .
If this trend continues at the same rate , obesity will soon reach the number one spot .
Unfortunately , the inherent health problems are n’t the only aspect of obesity we need to be concerned about .
Being overweight and obese have a major economic impact on our health care system , with both direct and indirect costs .
Direct costs may include prevention , diagnosis and treatment services ( like physician visits , hospital and nursing home care ) .
Indirect costs relate to morbidity and mortality .
Morbidity costs are the value of wages lost from decreased productivity , disability and absenteeism .
Mortality costs are the total value of future income lost by premature death .
The Surgeon General ’s " Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity , " updated January 2007 states , " in 1995 the total ( direct and indirect ) costs attributable to obesity amounted to an estimated $ 99 billion .
In 2000 , the total cost was estimated to be $ 117 billion ( $ 61 billion direct and $ 56 billion indirect ) .
Most of the costs associated with obesity are due to Type II diabetes , CHD , and hypertension . "
Fortunately , for our physical as well as economical health , the incidence of obesity among adults has statistically leveled off in recent years .
We can only hope we ’ve reached the peak of this trend and are on the downward side .
Unfortunately , as the trend appears to have come to a halt with adults , it may continue to increase through our youth , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Here is the situation :
In 2005 , only 33 percent of adults consumed fruit two or more times per day , and only 27 percent consumed vegetables three or more times per day .
Despite the proven benefits of physical activity , fewer than half of American adults in 2007 engaged in enough physical activity to provide health benefits .
( Should n’t adults lead by example ?
Many parents are neglecting their children ’s health by leading unhealthy lifestyles . )
) Estimates suggest that since 1994 , the overweight trend in youths has not leveled off as in adults , and is increasing to even higher levels .
The 2003 - 2004 CDC findings for children and adolescents suggest another generation of overweight adults .
Estimates suggest that since 1994 , the overweight trend in youths has not leveled off as in adults , and is increasing to even higher levels .
The 2003 - 2004 CDC findings for children and adolescents suggest another generation of overweight adults .
It has been shown that the 80 percent of children who are overweight at aged 10 to 15 years were obese adults at age 25 years .
More than a quarter of the children born in 2004 were never breastfed .
Breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk for obesity .
The percentage of young people who are obese has tripled since 1980 .
More than one third of adolescents in grades 9 to 12 had a soft drink ( not diet ) at least one time per day during the previous seven days .
( Soft drinks are almost exclusively sweetened with fructose or HFCS . )
)
In 2007 , 65 percent of young people in grades 9 to 12 did not get the recommended amount of physical activity ; 35 percent watched TV for three or more hours on the average school day .
70 percent of obese children between the ages of five and 17 have at least one CVD risk factor , while 39 percent had two or more .
Type II diabetes , which used to be referred to as adult onset diabetes , is now begun to emerge as a health - related problem among children and adolescents .
How did we as a country get so unhealthy ?
What caused our weight gain and its inherent health risks ?
Many self - proclaimed experts say , " Americans are eating too much . "
" It ’s just a matter of calories - in versus calories - out . "
Is it really as simple as reducing the amount of food we eat , exercising more or both ?
Are we really eating too much , or is it what we ’re eating ?
Do manmade substances in our food really make a difference in our ability to maintain a healthy weight ?
Most importantly , what can we do for ourselves and our children to ensure a healthy life ?

When your hobby is baiting 419 scammers ( also known as Nigerian scammers or advance - fee fraudsters ) , a death threat is n't cause for concern — it 's a trophy worth bragging about to your friends .
Scam baiters are the vigilante enforcers who come together to waste hours , weeks , or months of 419 scammers ' lives for nothing more than the satisfaction of knowing that they are distracting them from real victims .
Though the world of 419 scams has existed since long before the Internet , people continue to fall for scammers in droves — certainly , scammers are making millions of dollars every year by promising money , goods , and romance that they never deliver on .
That 's part of why scam baiting has actually become a somewhat popular pastime online , with thousands of users flocking to scam baiting forums to share stories and ideas on how to string along more scammers .
And hey , why not ?
Most of us end up spending too much time screwing around on the Internet anyway — these folks just use that time to make scammers miserable .
But when you hear stories like this , it makes you wonder .
" I get death threats on regular basis , " a student who goes by - C - told Ars .
" Death threats are not uncommon and are actually considered achievements : they are a testament to the fact that the baiter managed to annoy his / her scammer nicely . "
Why would you want to start baiting scammers ?
When the scammer sends you a fake passport that looks like it was made by a blind hamster with a piece of charcoal in ten seconds , you praise it and say it really helps you to build trust .
Who are these people ?
As it turns out , the scam - baiter demographic is more diverse than one might think , though much of the reasoning for participating is the same .
" My initial reason for baiting was to give myself an outlet for the practical jokes that I am ' too old ' to play on my dog / little sister / friends / neighbor 's cat , " a 32 - year - old baiter who goes by blah told Ars .
" But after I joined 419eater , I realized that we actually do make an impact on the entire scamming business by running interference and wasting these scammer 's time . "
Other scam baiters we spoke to ( all of which wished to remain anonymous for their own safety ) echoed this sentiment , many relaying feelings of boredom or frustration with scammers .
They also had heard humorous stories from experienced baiters and wanted to get involved .
And , of course , there 's always those who simply do it because they feel like it 's payback .
" I 'm an absolute stickler for justice and hate any form of abuse , " a UK production company owner who goes by Paddy told Ars .
The things baiters do to scammers range from " boring , " menial tasks like seeding false information or questionable wording into the scamming community ( tasks that do n't necessarily bring the glory , but are equally necessary ) to sending scammers on full - on safaris across Africa — or sometimes , the globe — in search of money that will never come .
The baiters we spoke with said that they spend anywhere from a an hour per day ( usually arranged around other things , like TV or just casual Internet surfing ) to a full 8 to 10 hours per day , especially if they are working on a collaborative safari .
We 'll get to that in a minute .
Some of the more menial tasks involve posing as experienced scammers trying to befriend newbies in order to give them sage advice .
" For example , scammers like idioms , but many of their native idioms are different to those of English language and they may not know that many from the latter .
Teach them a new one : tell them that ' take this offer of mine with a huge grain of salt ' means ' this is the chance of your life time and I am very serious about this , ' " - C- says .
- C- describes another way of " de- educating " scammers : giving feedback on their fake documents in order to make them look less realistic .
-C - explains : " When the scammer sends you a fake passport that looks like it was made by a blind hamster with a piece of charcoal in ten seconds , you praise it and say it really helps you to build trust .
Then , hope he is encouraged by this to send it to real victims too , who on the other hand will hopefully recognize it's a fake . "
We 're going on a surfin ' safari
Every minute the scammer I 'm communicating with is spending on me is a minute he is not scamming a real potential victim .
On the more extreme end of the scale , the tales from baiters are both horrifying and hilarious , depending on where your sympathies lie ( and how much you enjoy tales of lengthy snipe hunts ) .
28 - year - old manny relayed a story wherein he and several other baiters talked a scammer into traveling from Port Harcourt , Nigeria to Darfur to pick up a nonexistent $ 500,000 .
The 3,000 - mile roundtrip got the scammer stranded for two weeks before he managed to make it home .
Craig , a professional airline pilot , said that he and three other baiters got a scammer to travel from Lagos , Nigeria to Paga , Ghana — a total of 3,800 miles .
blah had fun with a scammer and airport security in London , resulting in his being detained for several hours .
" He was waiting for me to arrive on a flight that I was n't actually on .
I told him to show up with a black backpack and hold it very very close to his chest ( that 's how I would know that it was him ) .
Airport security did n't find it amusing , apparently , and thought he was acting suspicious , " blah said .
" My plane fictitiously arrived after he had been detained and I ended up chewing the scammer out for being so inconsiderate as to get detained and leave me waiting for an hour until I finally just hailed a cab and went to my hotel .
When airport security finally released him , he went and waited in the lobby - bar of the hotel for four additional hours while I ' freshened - up ' in my room . "
Do ethics apply to this game ?
There are many other stories easily found online — ones that none of our baiters were willing to fess up to — about having scammers get tattoos saying ridiculous things , or sending them into truly dangerous regions of Africa that have almost gotten them killed .
The general consensus among the baiters we spoke to , however , was that they feel even the most dangerous of safaris is payback for all the scammers do .
" The scammer makes the decision to put themselves in harm 's way ; if something happens to them , so be it .
Most of them would have no problem with you dying if it meant that they would make a dollar , " said manny .
" One baiter 's character recently told the scammer that he had a choice between sending the scammer $ 5,000 or using the same money to pay for his baby daughter 's cancer treatment — I think you can guess which option the scammer chose . "
Craig agreed .
" Making a lad sweat it out in Niger , 100� heats , with the need to drink two gallons of water a day or die , is petty punishment for their crimes , " he said .
" A lad returning from a long journey , financially worse off , demoralized completely , may lose interest in scamming . "
That 's really the end goal — to keep the scammers ' attention directed away from real victims and hopefully frustrate them to the point of quitting .
" Every minute the scammer I 'm communicating with is spending on me is a minute he is not scamming a real potential victim , " manny told Ars .
Others agreed wholeheartedly .
" Whether he is wandering through the desert hundreds of miles from home , or making yet another fruitless trip to the Moneygram office , that 's all time he is not behind a computer scamming someone 's elderly parents . "
Many of the baiters also spend time working with other sites to warn victims and help educate people about 419 scams ( Paddy told me he spends a lot of time warning victims at scamwarners.com , for example ) .
" I love to hear is someone ripping up a fake check they just received from the scammer and / or telling me that we just saved them their life 's savings . "

Troops carry voting machines in Bihar , where the Maoists are also active
As the sun begins to set over the village of Chandi a group of dancers is entertaining the crowd gathered to hear from the local candidate of the Congress party .
This is grass roots politics , a long way from the centre of Indian political power .
But here too , it is all about the numbers .
" We think we will win 11 seats , " says Dhanendra Sahu , the Congress president in Chhattisgarh .
" The people believe in us . "
There is another kind of politics at work in this state , though .
Away from the headlines , a low intensity war is being waged across a vast swathe of territory in central and eastern India .
It has become known as the Red Corridor .
Elections may be in full swing , but there is also an army of Maoist rebels preaching revolution in this part of the country .
They do not believe in parliamentary democracy .
Anyone caught by the Maoists on election day with ink on their finger - as proof that they have voted - will , the rebels warn , have that finger cut off .
' Difficult fight '
Yes , Maoists - known locally as Naxalites - promising a dictatorship of the proletariat .
It may sound like a blast from the past , but in Chhattisgarh alone they have 10,000 armed cadres in vast sparsely populated forest regions .
Hundreds of people are killed in Maoist violence in India every year - at least 25 have been killed in the last few days .
There have been pitched battles between the Maoists and the security forces in Chhattisgarh , Orissa and Bihar .
The authorities admit that there is now a Maoist presence in nearly one third of all districts across the country .
One in 10 districts is seriously affected .
And the Naxalites have big plans .
" The Maoist projection is that they will be able to take over the Indian state by 2050 , " explains Ajai Sahni of the Institute for Conflict Management .
" So that is the kind of projection they are making - they are looking forward 40 years . "
The idea that they can pose a national challenge sounds far - fetched .
So is it just fantasy ?
" I would like to believe that if the Indian state wakes up and begins to address this issue properly it is really fantasy , " Ajai Sahni says .
" But if the Maoists are able to establish disruptive capacity as they are currently trying to do , if they 're able to do that across the country , the Indian state will be looking at a fight that is going to be very , very difficult . "
Police challenge Already there are plenty of victims .
At a small children 's home on the outskirts of Raipur , there are more than 20 orphans of the Maoist conflict .
Kishore came to the children 's home after his father was killed " I 'm here to take education , " Kishore says .
" There were too many problems in my village , they were killing people and my father died in the violence .
" So it 's good to be here for the future . "
At Chhattisgarh police headquarters , the focus is on the present threat .
The authorities here have been heavily criticised for sponsoring vigilante groups who oppose the Maoists .
But the police chief in charge of anti-Maoist operations , Pawan Deo , is unapologetic .
He says he knows he has to win over the people .
And force alone is not enough .
" Steps need to be taken .
I think the government is fully aware of that , and we are making strategies according to that , " he says .
" The biggest hindrance to our operations is the inaccessibility of the areas where the Maoists operate .
They destroy the roads .
They oppose development .
" They also have front organisations , " Mr Deo says , " which covertly and overtly support them .
So we are tackling them on that . "
' Basic needs '
But are they tackling the right people ?
Every week in Raipur a peaceful protest is held , calling for the release of a well - known local doctor , Binayak Sen .
He has been in custody for nearly two years , accused of collusion with the Maoists .
The medical journal The Lancet is among those who have campaigned for his release .
Activist Rajendra Sail says he can understand why the poor are angry His supporters , like Rajendra Sail of the People 's Union for Civil Liberties , say Dr Sen 's only crime is working for human rights , and understanding why the poor get so frustrated .
" We do n't see any wisdom in using violent means to achieve any ends , " Mr Sail insists , " and we are very strong on this .
" But people are not even receiving their basic human needs .
And that , coupled with the large scale exploitation of their mineral resources , of the forest and the water , leads people to resort to certain methods . "
In the city of Raipur you really would not know there was a war on in parts of this state .
Most of the violence is confined to remote rural areas .
But as the world 's biggest exercise in democracy gets under way it is worth noting that many of the issues fuelling the Maoist insurgency - poverty and inequality , lack of land and opportunity - are among the biggest challenges facing India in the 21st Century .

An operation to recover and identify the remains of about 400 British and Australian soldiers killed during a WWI battle in Northern France is to begin .
It follows the discovery of several unmarked mass graves in a field on the outskirts of the village of Fromelles .
The British and Australian authorities have published the names of the soldiers they expect to find .
They have asked relatives for DNA to help identify the soldiers , who will be re-buried in a new military cemetery .
The bloody battle fought on 19 July 1916 , at Fromelles , was a military disaster .
It was supposed to divert German resources away from the Battle raging on the Somme , 50 miles to the south , and to capture a local German stronghold .
But because of poor planning and execution , more than 5,500 Australian and at least 1,500 British troops were massacred as they attacked heavily fortified positions in broad daylight .
We can take these soldiers out of the ground and give them a decent burial - they will be the same as their mates
Caroline Barker , lead anthropologist
It was the first major action involving the Australians on the Western Front , and they suffered more casualties in a 24 - hour period than at any other time in their history , even more than at the Battle of Gallipoli a year earlier .
Today , it is a place of pilgrimage for Australians .
Although the German commander offered a truce so that the bodies of the fallen soldiers could be recovered immediately after the battle , inexplicably the Allied commanders refused .
The Germans , from the Bavarian regiment , hastily dug mass graves and buried the bodies near to the village where the assault had been launched .
Although hundreds of bodies were exhumed at the end of the war , none could be identified .

Advertisement Ironically , 93 years later , the man in charge of removing the remains is a German .
Roland Wessling is the project 's chief forensic archaeologist .
He and his team have to extract the remains meticulously to avoid damaging them .
The first layer of soil will be removed using a mechanical digger .
The next will be taken out using ordinary shovels and spades , but when they find the first signs of human remains , the laborious task of brushing away the dirt will begin .
" We are very aware of just how important the recovery of the bodies are to very many people , both in the UK and in Australia .
" It 's equally important to the people in this part of France .
" They live daily with this and are very passionate about this , " he said .
Bois de Faisan , or Pheasant Wood - as it is known in English - is on the edge of the tiny village of Fromelles , about 10 miles outside the northern French city of Lille .
Ordinarily there would not be much to see except for a church and a few houses .
But now the scene is very different .
Power cables hang above a hastily - built road , which leads to the site of the graves .
An inflatable awning has been erected to provide cover for the archaeologists .
Red and yellow flags mark the location of the graves in a field between the wood and the church .
After Mr Wessling and his team have removed the remains , they will be taken to a huge temporary mortuary where they will be cleaned , photographed and preserved .
In a corner of the structure is Caroline Barker , the project 's lead anthropologist .
She has worked previously in Sri Lanka and Bosnia , where she helped to identify the victims of war crimes .
She said her team would have a hard task ahead of them : " It is to ensure that we can take these soldiers out of the ground and give them a decent burial , which is something they are entitled to as fallen soldiers .
Anthropologist Caroline Barker has identified war crimes victims in Bosnia " And they will be the same as their mates .
That is what we are trying to achieve and I think that is unique . "
Both the British and Australian authorities have published lists of who they believe is buried in Pheasant Wood .
The final stage of the identification process involves DNA , and relatives of soldiers whose bodies were never recovered have given swabs .
Dr Peter Jones , the project advisor on DNA , will oversee the matching of samples .
" I think we 're going to find some interesting stories ... there are even some interesting ones appearing at the moment , in terms of relatives who are still alive .
People like sisters , and daughters . "
Across the road from Pheasant Wood , opposite the church , is where the remains will be interred once they have been identified .
It is there that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is building the first completely new World War One cemetery for almost 50 years .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
Their stories are a staple of conspiracy culture : broken men , suffering hallucinations and near - total amnesia , who say they are victims of secret government mind - control experiments .
Think Liev Schreiber in The Manchurian Candidate or Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory .
Journalists are a favorite target for the paranoid delusions of this population .
So is Gordon Erspamer — and the San Francisco lawyer ’s latest case is n’t helping him to fend off the tinfoil - hat crowd .
He has filed suit against the CIA and the US Army on behalf of the Vietnam Veterans of America and six former American soldiers who claim they are the real thing : survivors of classified government tests conducted at the Army ’s Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland between 1950 and 1975 .
“ I get a lot of calls , ” he says .
“ There are a lot of crazy people out there who think that somebody from Mars is controlling their behavior via radio waves . ”
But when it comes to Edgewood , “ I ’m finding that more and more of those stories are true ! ”
That government scientists conducted human experiments at Edgewood is not in question .
“ The program involved testing of nerve agents , nerve agent antidotes , psychochemicals , and irritants , ” according to a 1994 General Accounting Office ( now the Government Accountability Office ) report ( PDF ) .
At least 7,800 US servicemen served “ as laboratory rats or guinea pigs ” at Edgewood , alleges Erspamer ’s complaint , filed in January in a federal district court in California .
The Department of Veterans Affairs has reported that military scientists tested hundreds of chemical and biological substances on them , including VX , tabun , soman , sarin , cyanide , LSD , PCP , and World War I - era blister agents like phosgene and mustard .
The full scope of the tests , however , may never be known .
As a CIA official explained to the GAO , referring to the agency ’s infamous MKULTRA mind - control experiments , “ The names of those involved in the tests are not available because names were not recorded or the records were subsequently destroyed . ”
Besides , said the official , some of the tests involving LSD and other psychochemical drugs “ were administered to an undetermined number of people without their knowledge . ”
Erspamer ’s plaintiffs claim that , although they volunteered for the Edgewood program , they were never adequately informed of the potential risks and continue to suffer debilitating health effects as a result of the experiments .
They hope to force the CIA and the Army to admit wrongdoing , inform them of the specific substances they were exposed to , and provide access to subsidized health care to treat their Edgewood - related ailments .
Despite what they describe as decades of suffering resulting from their Edgewood experiences , the former soldiers are not seeking monetary damages ; a 1950 Supreme Court decision , the Feres case , precludes military personnel from suing the federal government for personal injuries sustained in the line of duty .
The CIA ’s decision to use military personnel as test subjects followed the court ’s decision and is an issue Erspamer plans to raise at trial .
“ Suddenly , they stopped using civilian subjects and said , ‘ Oh , we can get these military guys for free , ' ” he says .
“ The government could do whatever it wanted to them without liability .
We want to bring that to the attention of the public , because I do n’t think most people understand that . ”
( Asked about Erspamer ’s suit , CIA spokeswoman Marie Harf would say only that the agency ’s human testing program has “ been thoroughly investigated , and the CIA fully cooperated with each of the investigations . ” )
Erspamer ’s involvement in the case is deeply personal .
His father was a government scientist during Operation Crossroads , a series of nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in the summer of 1946 ; he was present aboard a research vessel for the “ Baker ” test , during which a 21 - kiloton thermonuclear bomb was detonated 90 feet below water .
The blast resulted in massive radioactive contamination .
Erspamer ’s father and the rest of the ship ’s crew , he says , all died in middle age from radiogenic diseases .
Erspamer makes his living in the field of energy litigation , but has twice before argued class action suits for veterans — one for soldiers who , like his father , were exposed to radiation during nuclear tests ( a case he ultimately lost in a 1992 appellate decision ) and more recently one on behalf of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans denied treatment for post - traumatic stress disorder .
The case is on appeal in California ’s 9th Circuit .
“ Nobody out there is doing these types of cases , ” he says .
“ It ’s really sad because the veterans are left holding the bag , and it ’s not a very pretty bag . ”
One of those vets is Frank Rochelle .
Unlike those of other test veterans , portions of his heavily redacted medical records have survived , providing a rare , if incomplete , account of his experiences .
In 1968 , while posted at Virginia ’s Fort Lee as a 20 - year - old Army draftee , he saw a notice calling for volunteers for the Edgewood program .
Among the promised incentives were relief from guard duty , the freedom to wear civilian clothes , three - day weekends , and , upon completion , a medal of commendation — all for participation in experiments that , according to the notice , would help the military test a new generation of equipment , clothing , and gas masks .
Upon his arrival at the testing facility in Maryland , he says he was asked to sign a series of documents , including a release form and a secrecy agreement .
The tests would be risk free , he says he was told , and any drugs given would not exceed normal dosage .
Over the next two months , however , he was subjected to three rounds of experiments that , Rochelle says , left him permanently damaged .
His medical records indicate that he was exposed to nonlethal incapacitating agents like DHMP and glycolate , both of which act as sedatives that produce hallucinations .
In the latter case , Rochelle says he was taken into a gas chamber and strapped to a chair by two men in white lab coats , who affixed a mask to his face and told him to breathe normally .
He quickly lost consciousness .
According to Erspamer ’s complaint , “ Over the next two to three days , Frank was hallucinating and high : he thought he was three feet tall , saw animals on the walls , thought he was being pursued by a 6 - foot - tall white rabbit , heard people calling his name , thought that all his freckles were bugs under his skin , and used a razor to try to cut these bugs out .
No one from the clinical staff intervened on his behalf … ”
Medical records indicate that Rochelle went through a third round of testing , but he has no memory of it .
For years he ’s been having nightmares about the Edgewood tests and now suffers from anxiety , memory loss , sleep apnea , tinnitus , and loss of vision , all of which he claims are direct results of the experiments .
Still , he did n’t inform his doctor of the tests until 2006 , believing that he was still bound by the oath of secrecy he swore in 1968 .
( The government finally released human test subjects to speak to their physicians about the tests in June 2006 , under the condition that they not “ discuss anything that relates to operational information that might reveal chemical or biological warfare vulnerabilities or capabilities . ” )
Rochelle ’s story is similar to those of Erspamer ’s other plaintiffs , all of whom claim to be suffering debilitating health effects stemming from the experiments .
Of course , substantiating these claims is a challenge , given that most of the medical records were destroyed upon completion of the program .
Rochelle ’s records remain intact , but for “ others we have less information , ” says Erspamer .
“ We spent a great deal of time on that topic , and we are confident that the plaintiffs are who they say they are , were where they said they were , and got what they said they got , ” in terms of exposure to experimental chemicals .
“ Who bears the burden on that issue when the defendants destroyed the evidence ? ” Erspamer asks .
“ They ’ve put all that stuff through the shredder . ”
Compensation for injuries sustained during human testing of chemical and biological agents is not unprecedented .
Last year , more than 350 servicemen who served as test subjects at Porton Down , a secret military research facility where the British government conducted its own series of mind - control experiments , were granted nearly $ 6 million in compensation in an out - of - court settlement with the UK ’s Ministry of Defence .
Likewise , in 2004 , the Canadian government began offering $ 18,000 payments to eligible veterans of experiments at its testing facilities .
Nevertheless , says Erspamer , “ No American soldiers have ever been compensated . ”
The CIA and the Army “ just hope they ’re all gonna die off , and they will unless somebody does something . ”
CHICAGO  Saving money never cost quite so much .
When the toilet in Carol Taddei ’s master bathroom began to break down a few months ago , she decided it would be cheaper to buy a new one than pay for repairs .
Ever frugal in this dismal economy , Ms. Taddei , a retired paralegal , then took her economizing a step further , figuring she could save even more by installing the new toilet herself .
Initially , things looked good with the flushing and the swishing .
That is , until the ceiling collapsed in the room below the new ( leaky ) toilet .
Rushing to get supplies for a repair , Ms. Taddei clipped a pole in her garage .
It ripped the bumper off her car , and later , several shelves holding flower pots and garden tools collapsed over her head .
“ It just kept getting worse , ” Ms. Taddei said , ruefully describing what came out to be a $ 3,000 , three - day renovation at her suburban Minneapolis home , finished by a professional from Mr. Handyman , a home repair service that takes emergency calls .
With the sour economy has come a class of ambitious do - it - yourselfers who are tackling things that , before the days of rampant penny - pinching , might have been left to paid professionals .
An unlucky few like Ms. Taddei have learned that being thrifty sometimes comes at a high price and can bring along with it a new scourge of the times : saver ’s remorse .

INTRODUCTION
The Secretary of State 's Office created Rule 9 as a means of ensuring that the parties would have access to the original ballot , rather than the duplicate , because the original ballot was the best evidence of the voter 's intent during the recount . '
Representatives of the Coleman for Senate campaign agreed to Rule 9 under the mistaken assumption that Minnesota precinct judges would precisely follow the requirements of Minn.
Stat. § 206.86 , subd .
5 , as well as training received by such judges from the Minnesota Secretary of State Election Division , and properly label all originals and duplicates .
Unfortunately , it is now clear that in several precincts throughout the state of Minnesota , including numerous precincts in Minneapolis , the election judges inadvertently failed to mark all of the duplicated ballots , thereby making it impossible to retrieve them and leading to the double - counting of ballots during the Canvassing Board 's recount .
...
ARGUMENT
I. MINNESOTA LAW SETS FORTH SPECIFIC PROCEDURES FOR THE DUPLICATION OF DAMAGED BALLOTS .
Minnesota law requires the accurate creation of duplicate ballots in circumstances in which the original ballot is unable to be read by the tabulation machines ( such as tom and damaged ballots and UOCAVA / overseas ballots ) .
Minnesota law also clearly requires that only the duplicate be counted , while preserving ( but not counting ) original ballots .
Minn .
Stat . § 206.86 , entitled " Counting Electronic Voting System Results , " provides the procedure for the election - night counting of votes where a precinct uses an electronic voting system .
...
II .
MINNESOTA LAW CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT DUPLICATE BALLOTS WERE MADE AND COUNTED BY VOTING MACHINES ON ELECTION NIGHT .
...
Additionally , the record in this matter contains the election day pre-registered voter sign - in rosters , same - day registration rosters and UOCAVA rosters , as well as machine tapes from election night , all of which evidence the number of persons actually voting on election night .
See Exhibits C56- 60 , C86-90 , C94-98 , C102- 105 , C110 - 113 , C117 - 120 , C138-141 , C146-149 , C153-156 and C160 - 163 .
The record in this matter also evidences the number of ballots actually counted during the recount , which numbers were certified by the Minnesota State Canvassing Board .
See Exhibit C603 ( introduced during the testimony of Minnesota Elections Director Gary Poser ) .
A comparison of these exhibits demonstrates that , in 10 Minneapolis precincts , the number of votes counted during the recount exceeded the number of persons actually casting ballots at those precincts on election night , as follows :
[ Note : The " VFA VOTERS PRESENT " column has been added , which uses data collated from the SOS website . ]
VOTERS RECOUNT [ VFA VOTERS ] PRECINCT PRESENT BALLOTS [ PRESENT ] Minneapolis W11 - P8 2857 2873 2851 Minneapolis W12-P8 2923 2936 2922 Minneapolis W10 - P2 2079 2087 2076 Minneapolis W11 - P7 1996 2004 1995 Minneapolis W7 - P7 1849 1865 1856 Minneapolis W9 - P2 1712 1718 1712 Minneapolis W10 - P4 1193 1197 1192 Minneapolis W2 - P5 2102 2104 2100 Minneapolis W8 - P10 2214 2217 2215 Minneapolis W13-P1 1916 1921 1921
Where there are more ballots counted in the recount than voters who cast ballots on election day , such excess ballots are illegal and , therefore , cannot be certified by this Court to constitute legally cast ballots .
See Johnson v. Tanka , 154 N.W.2d 185 , 187 ( Minn. 1967 ) ( noting that where there are more ballots than voters who voted on election day , the votes cast over the number of voters " cannot be said to be legal . " ) .
" The outcome of an election should rest upon ballots received according to law and should not be determined by illegal votes . "
Id .
III .
THE PROCESS UNDER RULE 9 FOR COUNTING ORIGINAL BALLOTS WHEN THE NUMBER OF ORIGINAL AND DUPLICATE BALLOTS DOES NOT MATCH DID NOT COMPLY WITH MINNESOTA LAW .
...
When the campaigns agreed to Rule 9 , they did so with the understanding that the original ballot would be the best evidence of intent of the voter under Minn .
Stat . § 204C.22 and the presumption that local election officials had created duplicate ballots and properly marked all duplicate and original ballots , as required by Minnesota law .
Neither their agreement nor Rule 9 can prevent this Court from applying Minnesota law in the face of clear evidence that Minnesota law was not uniformly followed in the correct marking of duplicate ballots .
First and foremost , it should be noted that Rule 9 , on its face , does not mandate that originals for which no marked duplicates were found during the recount should be counted and included in the recount totals ,
The language relates to " sorting " and not " counting . "
Thus , Rule 9 complements Minnesota law by enabling a comparison ( via " sorting " ) of the marked original ballots ( found in the folder containing originals from which duplicates were made ) to the corresponding marked and numbered duplicates .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above , Contestants respectfully request that the Court issue an order ( a ) declaring Rule 9 as applied during the recount in precincts in which the number of originals exceeded the number of marked duplicates to be invalid as a matter of law and ( b ) directing that pursuant to Minn .
Stat . § 206.86 , subd .
5 , all ballots in those precincts which were challenged for the lack of a corresponding duplicate shall not be counted in determining which party received the highest number of legally cast votes .
For the Minneapolis precincts at issue this simply requires that the double - counted votes be subtracted from the vote total .
For the remaining precincts at issue , an inspection should be ordered or the Court should revert to the election night vote totals .

Baxter working on vaccine to stop swine flu , though admitted sending live pandemic flu viruses to subcontractor
By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org 26 Apr 2009
The OMFG moment of the century : Illinois - based Baxter working on vaccine to ' stop ' swine flu outbreak in Mexico 25 Apr 2009 Specialty drug maker Baxter International Inc. will work with the World Health Organization to develop a vaccine that could stem [ foment ] an outbreak of a deadly swine flu strain in Mexico .
Baxter spokesman Christopher Bona said Saturday that the Deerfield , Ill . - based company has asked the WHO for a sample of the flu strain .
He says Baxter has patented technology that allows the company to develop vaccines in half the time it usually takes -- about 13 weeks instead of 26 .
[ Is Baxter International taking a page from the Blackwater playbook ?
Just as Blackwater / Xe keep on killing to justify their multi-billion dollar contracts to provide ' security ' in Iraq and Afghanistan , Baxter International is poised to make * billions * to vaccinate people against their pandemic . ]
Are you ready ?
Wait for it ...
Virus mix - up by lab could have resulted in pandemic [ Uh , it apparently f*cking * did . * ]
06 Mar 2009
It 's emerged that virulent H5N1 bird flu was sent out by accident from an Austrian lab [ the Austrian branch of US vaccine company , Baxter ] last year and given to ferrets in the Czech Republic before anyone realised .
As well as the risk of it escaping into the wild , the H5N1 got mixed with a human strain , which might have spawned a hybrid that could unleash a pandemic .
' This was infected with a bird flu virus . '
Viral Pandemic H5N1 flu threat : Illinois - based Baxter contaminates European labs by error 25 Feb 2009 According to the scientific network PROMED , Baxter International Inc. in Austria " unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in 3 neighboring countries , raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease " .
As PROMED reports , the contamination has been discovered when ferrets at a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with vaccine made from the samples early this month .
" The material came from Deerfield , Illinois - based Baxter , which reported the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health , Sigrid Rosenberger , a ministry spokeswoman , said today in a telephone interview " , the network - alert - system is quoting .
" This was infected with a bird flu virus , " Rosenberger said .
" There were some people from the company who handled it . "
' That mixing process , called reassortment , is one of two ways pandemic viruses are created . '
Baxter admits sending live avian flu viruses to subcontractor -- People familiar with biosecurity rules are dismayed by evidence that human H3N2 and avian H5N1 viruses somehow co-mingled [ ! ] in the Orth - Donau facility .
27 Feb 2009
The company that released contaminated flu virus material from a plant in Austria confirmed Friday that the experimental product contained live H5N1 avian flu viruses .
And an official of the World Health Organization 's European operation said the body is closely monitoring the investigation into the events that took place at Baxter International 's research facility in Orth - Donau , Austria .

HUDSON -- Greg McNeil competed with city , county and state officials for Ohio 's federal stimulus money and wound up winning $ 168,323 to silence train horns at a crossing near his home .
McNeil 's project , on behalf of his homeowners association , was one of only 149 chosen last week by the Ohio Department of Transportation from 2,222 eligible to receive $ 774 million in infrastructure money .
His is the only submission from a private citizen to receive ODOT 's nod .
" I tell you , we were ecstatic , " he said .
" This was just tremendous . "
Norfolk Southern owns the tracks that cross Twinsburg Road in Macedonia , where the number of trains has increased to 76 a day .
Nearby residents in Hudson , Macedonia and Northfield Center Township do n't mind the trains , just the horns .
McNeil , who owns a Web site design company , has lived in Hudson 's Ashbrooke East subdivision just west of the tracks for four years .
As vice president of his homeowners association , he volunteered in January of last year to find out how the crossing could become a quiet zone .
A 2005 federal rule sets standards for quiet zones , which can be designated by the Federal Railroad Administration if safety measures at railroad crossings are sufficiently upgraded .
Ohio's first quiet zone is in Moraine , near Dayton , where barriers placed in the center of the road keep cars from going around the traditional crossing gates .
Other zones will be established this spring at several rail crossings in Brook Park , which is using a combination of double gates and center road barriers .
Norfolk Southern did an engineering study of the Twinsburg Road crossing for $ 7,500 , with half the cost paid by Macedonia and the remainder split by Northfield Center Township and Hudson , McNeil said .
The engineering report last September recommended dividers in the center of the road and circuitry upgrades to lower the gates based on the speed of the train instead of when it reaches a certain point on the tracks .
The cost for those improvements was $ 168,323 .
McNeil appealed to public officials for state or federal help but struck out .
On March 3 , he talked to Heidi Swindell , government - affairs liaison for the Summit County engineer 's office , and she suggested he apply for stimulus money .
Only one problem the deadline was that day .
McNeil enlisted the help of his daughter Amy , a senior marketing major at Kent State University , and they submitted the online proposal 15 minutes before the deadline .
" I kind of looked at it as a ' Hail Mary ' pass , " he said .
The Ohio Rail Development Commission recommended grade - crossing safety projects to ODOT for stimulus funding , said spokesman Stu Nicholson .
" There was some pretty hefty competition , " he said .
" For a homeowners association to go through that process and win out is not a small victory .
It 's pretty significant . "
McNeil hopes the crossing project is finished by Labor Day .
Swindell , who said the engineer 's office will help in any way it can , was amazed that McNeil 's project was one of the six in Summit County to receive stimulus funds .
" I was so impressed at his tenacity , " she said .
" Here is a private citizen , instead of complaining about something wrong in his neighborhood , trying to find ways to fix it . "
ST . PAUL , Minn. , April 15 ( UPI ) --
A poll released Wednesday reveals Minnesotans , by and large , want Republican Norm Coleman to concede the state 's U.S. Senate race to Democrat Al Franken .
Public Policy
Polling said its survey indicated 63 percent say Coleman should call it a day rather than continue to fight in court , USA Today reported .
That percentage includes " almost all of Franken and ( independent candidate ) Dean Barkley 's supporters , as well as a third of respondents who voted for Coleman last fall , " the polling organization said .
Advertisement
Fifty - nine percent said Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican , should certify Franken the winner and he should be seated immediately .
A three - judge panel has voted that Franken won by 312 votes out of nearly 3 million cast .
Coleman has said he intends to ask the state Supreme Court to allow about 4,000 more absentee ballots to be counted .
He also has supporters who say he should take the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court , if necessary .
The latest reports Wednesday also reveal Coleman and Franken have each spent millions on the recount battle .
Politico reports Coleman has spent nearly $ 4 million on legal fees just since the start of the year .
He raised $ 2.3 million this quarter but now has less than $ 500,000 on hand , the Washington publication said .
Franken has about the same amount left after spending $ 3.5 million this year and raising $ 2.6 million this quarter .
A year ago , David Barstow reported in the NY Times reported on how the Pentagon was manipulating the news by planting retired generals into major networks as independent analysts , and that in many cases the networks themselves were complicit .
What made this even worse was that this story was completely suppressed by the networks in question , including ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC , CNN , and Fox .
What makes this news again is that Barstow just won a Pulitzer prize for investigative journalism for this story , and yet , when these same networks reported on the Pulitzer prizes , every single one of them failed to mention this particular one , even when they gave details about other prize winners .
Could it be because many of them continue to employ these fake “ independent analysts ” ?
So the bottom line is that the TV networks feed you propaganda direct from the Pentagon , without telling you that their “ independent analysts ” are n’t really independent ( not only do most of them work for the Pentagon , many also have ties to military contractors so they stand to benefit financially from the lies they are spreading ) .
Then , when this scandal is exposed , they completely suppress it ( to this day , the story was only mentioned by bloggers on the Internet ) .
Then , when the story wins a Pulitzer prize , the networks pretend like this particular winner did n’t exist .
The mainstream media must believe that if they do n’t report on a story , then it does n’t exist .
My question is , how far can they stick their heads into the ground .
CAMBRIDGE -
They have managed to get into one of the world 's most selective colleges .
Opportunity is knocking at their door .
But at some point in their life , though perhaps later than most , Harvard students will face the stinging slap the rest of the world feels regularly : rejection .
The dirty secret is out .
Harvard students fail sometimes .
They are denied jobs , fellowships , A's they think they deserve .
They are passed over for publication , graduate school , and research grants .
And when that finally happens , it hurts .
Big time .
To help students cope , Harvard 's Office of Career Services hosted a new seminar last week on handling rejection , a fear job - seekers are feeling acutely in the plummeting economy .
The advice from panelists could have come from a caring , patient parent .
No rejection is the end of the world , they said , even though it might feel that way at the time .
Participants , who wore snappy buttons with the word rejected stamped in red , also received a road map of sorts on handling failure , a pink booklet of rejection letters and personal stories from Harvard faculty , students , and staff members .
Among the tales of woe : the 2004 alumnus and aspiring actor rejected for a barista gig at a Los Angeles Starbucks for being overqualified and the medical school professor who was wait - listed at every medical school he applied to .
Senior Olga Tymejczyk arrived at the seminar early .
With just a month and a half until graduation , Tymejczyk has applied for 10 jobs , but has no offers .
" Rejection is inevitable sometimes , even if you go to Harvard , " said Tymejczyk , a Latin American studies major who wants to work in higher - education administration or healthcare research .
She has two more interviews this week , and she is hoping for the best but bracing for more bad news .
Panelist Pat Hernandez knows a thing or two about setbacks .
The 2004 Harvard graduate was rejected by all three graduate schools she applied to two years ago , after losing out on numerous consulting jobs .
" It 's something many people are ashamed or reluctant to talk about , " said Hernandez , who serves as a resident tutor for Harvard undergraduates .
" Those who deal with rejection more frequently take it in stride and bounce back better . "
Hernandez spent the last two years conducting academic research and applied to graduate schools again .
She plans to attend Harvard Business School in the fall for a doctorate in organizational behavior and management .
Another panelist , Harvard statistics professor Xiao - Li Meng , took a humorous approach on the sore subject .
His two - page take on rejection , printed in the pink booklet , starts with this theorem : " For any acceptance worth competing for , the probability of a randomly selected applicant being rejected is higher than the probability of being accepted . "
Hernandez and Meng said students should learn to see rejection as an opportunity to improve themselves , so that by the time they summon the courage to try again , they will be better candidates .
Or they can view failure as a blessing , like the would - be barista who reconsidered his goals and launched a tutoring company called , appropriately enough , Overqualified .
But how does one move forward , implored another graduate student facing rejection after rejection , when everyone else in the world thinks :
" Surely , you have a Harvard degree .
You 'll get a job . "
Abigail Lipson - director of the Bureau of Study Counsel , which cosponsored last week 's seminar - had some advice in the pink bulletin : " We learn to recognize our bad feelings as an indication that we care , we have high standards and high hopes , and we expect a lot of ourselves and of the world , rather than assuming that we are hopelessly untalented or unworthy . "
Hard as it is for some to believe , there are candidates more worthy than Harvard students , Professor Meng quipped , in language befitting his field .
" Statistically you are rejected , and probablistically it is fair . "

You may have seen a few months ago that mySociety led the campaign to stop the Freedom of Information Act being changed to conceal MPs expenses .
And we won , which was nice .
Given the wall - to - wall revelations about taxpayer funded moats and bathplugs , and the new wave of resignations and repayments , we want to exercise a little accountability by reminding readers of the arguments that were used to conceal this information twice in the last two years .
These helpful examples should assist mySociety ’s friends in keeping an eye out for similar dubious logic in the future .
First , in 2007 , a concealment bill was tabled by a backbencher , but which oddly made it all the way to the Lords before failing ( it would normally have been struck down by the government ) .
The argument used then was that private mail sent by constituents to MPs would end up in the hands of unscrupulous characters , even though there was already another law to prevent this , and even though hardly anyone appears to have complained to the Information Commissioner about what the proposing MP described as a ‘ vexed problem ‘ .
Then , back in January this year , a different and bold explanation was given : none .
Instead , a strange pretence was played out in Parliament , in which the fact that MPs were being given the opportunity to vote to overrule a court - mandated order to publish was simply not mentioned :
Watch the video of the Leader explaining what ’s going to be voted for – any idea why people might be laughing as she stands up ?
Can you spot where she explains why the court needs overruling ?
The only explanation I could find anywhere for this reversal of openness was an anonymous quote in the Guardian .
So here we are after both attempts to hide expenses were defeated , watching as the rules around expenses change substantially and as MPs reach deep into their own pockets : all things that would not have taken place if either of the above proposals had passed .
Simply the fact that the rules are changing and that the leaders of parties are apologising must make it clear that the excuses and non-excuses given above were , even if unintentionally , blocking better government .
Despite the obvious pain for MPs this week , and the fact that the whole act is doubtless being cursed across Westminster , we must shout from the hilltops that this week is a great success for the Freedom of Information Act , and a clear justification for why it is worth having on our books .
Bad policies that both wasted money and eroded public trust are being swept away , and it is entirely down to the Act and its supporters .
More Freedom of Information will mean more such improvements , and people of good will should support its defence and its extension .

Gates Says “ All Options Are On the Table ”
by Jason Ditz | Antiwar.com , May 22 , 2009
On NBC ’s Today Show this morning , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that President Obama has ordered him to update the plans for a US attack on Iran , plans which were last updating during the Bush Administration .
Gates says the plans are “ refreshed ” and insists that “ all options are on the table ” with respect to the potential attack .
It was only a month ago that Secretary Gates was warning vigorously against the potential attack , saying that it would create a “ disastrous backlash ” against the United States to hit Iran ’s civilian nuclear facilities .
The Obama Administration has insisted it is intending to pursue the matter diplomatically with Iran , but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said the administration does n’t expect diplomacy to work , and the effort seems to be primarily to rally international support for more measures against Iran .
The US has also been sending secret missions to Israel in recent days , reportedly to caution them against launching any surprise military attacks against Iran of their own .
It was unclear how successful the warnings were : Prime Minister Netanyahu said he remained confident that the US would respect Israel ’s right to attack Iran .
It is unclear whether Gates ’ revelation portends a serious potential for an imminent US attack on Iran , or whether the move is more international posturing .
Still , it seems unlikely the news will be greeted warmly in Iran , which is in the middle of an election campaign in which potential US talks are a major issue .

At Uricchio ’s Trattoria , a street café on 17th Street , the smell of sizzling garlic wafts into the air tinged lightly with the aroma of … exhaust .
And despite the perfect blue sky , the view of the mountains surrounding this Central Valley city is obscured by a ruddy haze .
As Lois and Jill Moreland sip coffee and spear salad greens , they comment on the placement of a national story on smog in the Bakersfield Californian newspaper .
“ It only made the cover of the B- section , ” says Lois .
Bakersfield has moved into first place as the city with the most fine particulate pollution , according to report released Wednesday by the American Lung Association , which annually ranks America ’s cities with the unhealthiest air .
Last year , the city was third behind Pittsburgh and Los Angeles .
For the third year in a row , Bakersfield ranks as the nation ’s second smoggiest city .
It comes in just behind Los Angeles in the cities most polluted by ozone , the gas that forms a major component of smog .
Local TV has already broadcast the story and national reporters have shown up , but the Moreland sisters seem unfazed .
“ Smog is a way of life here , ” says Jill .
It ’s been more than a decade since the first reports about the growing pollution threatening America ’s most diverse and productive farm counties here in the Central Valley .
The reasons for the pollution are manifold , including dust from tractors and mist from fertilizers and pesticides that grow half the nation ’s produce .
But the topography and meteorological conditions make matters worse – and make the problem hard to solve .
The city is boxed in on three sides by mountains .
Inversion layers – which act like a lid on the air , holding the pollution close to the ground – are present in both winter and summer , and there is little or no wind to take the pollution elsewhere .
Kern County , in which Bakersfield is situated , and also ranks as the worst county in average annual particulate pollution , has made some efforts to reduce the pollution .
According to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District , the county has reduced stationary sources of pollution by 80 percent since 1980 , through measures including regulations on oil processing and , in 2003 , restrictions on wood fires .
Farming regulations that reduced both the number of harvesting machines and the number of trips through the field have also helped .
But officials now say they need state and federal help to control the heavy - duty trucks that pass through on Interstate 5 and Highway 99 , and cut east to west hauling produce from farms to packaging facilities .
“ Unfortunately , all these big trucks fall outside our regulatory authority , ” says Seyed Sadredin , the district ’s executive director and air pollution control officer .
So far , pollution controls have cost county businesses about $ 40 billion , he says .
Two plans , one to reduce particulate matter by 2015 and another to reduce ozone by 2023 , will cost another $ 20 billion .
“ This is all very costly and in the current economic crisis is even more of a challenge , ” says Mr. Sadredin .
The cost of noncompliance with pollution standards may be more , he says .
Being out of compliance with federal Environment Protection Agency standards costs the county $ 2 billion in forfeited federal highway funding and puts a dent in its ability to attract more businesses .
Other intangible costs are just as important , notes Bonnie Holmes - Gen , senior policy director for the California chapter of American Lung Association ( ALA ) , pointing to the poor lung capacities of the young people who grow up in such an environment .
A California State University , Fullerton study estimated the economic cost of not meeting EPA air standards for the southern California region , which includes the Los Angeles area , at $ 6 billion per year in health - related costs and premature deaths .
( Editor 's note : The original version misidentified the university . )
“ Sure it costs money to clean up the air , but we are already paying costs with the health of young people , increased medication , and shortened lives , ” says Ms. Holmes - Gen .
The ALA is working with local governments and promoting partnerships between the county , state , and federal authorities .
“ The San Joaquin Air Pollution District has done much to lower the pollution in this area and should be applauded , ” says Holmes - Gen .
“ But there is a lot more they can do .
Their hands are not tied . ”
This year , 12 more California counties received failing grades than did last year , reflecting in part the tighter national ozone standards adopted in 2008 .
The ALA ’s State of the Air 2009 Report also found that 6 of 10 Americans live in areas where pollution levels endanger lives .
“ Despite America ’s growing ‘ green ’ movement , ” the report says , “ the air in many cities became dirtier since the last report . ”
“ IN Zimbabwe , the money is so worthless , notes are cheap alternative to paper – and , no , not even toilet paper .
The Zimbabwean wants you to “ Fight The Crime That Crippled a Country ” .
The call to arms is writ on bank notes … ”
Unusual outdoor campaign for The Zimbabwean , a newspaper ( a voice for the voiceless ) produced by a group of exiled Zimbabwean journalists .
The newspaper is sold in the UK , South Africa and Zimbabwe but when entering the latter is charged an import duty of 55 per cent , making it unaffordable to most of the people in Zimbabwe .
South - Africa based agency TBWAHuntLascaris created murals , billboards and flyers in Johannesburg using the Z$ 100 trillion dollar note .
Great idea because the money is worth less than paper after the total collapse of the Zimbabwean economy , due to the Mugabe regime .
“ This note can not buy anything , not even a loaf of bread and certainly not any advertising , but it can become the advertising , it can be a powerful reminder about Zimbabwe ’s plight and the need to hold someone accountable . ”

Sony has done everything possible to ensure the PSP remains pirate - free .
However , Square Enix , one of the biggest publishers on the PSP , fears piracy on the PSP .
Takeshi Arakawa , director of Dissidia : Final Fantasy , recently spoke about Square Enix ’s fears of rampant piracy on the PSP .
“ We are really worried about this issue [ piracy ] … extremely worried . ”
The issue of piracy is quite concerning on PS as well and our basic stance is that it ’s unfortunate , but what ’s been done has been done and we ca n’t do much about it .
We want to stick to a policy of making a game that the player would be proud of owning , so even if you play the pirated version , the game should be good enough to convince them that they should purchase the game .
So long as we manage to do that , the issue does n’t really exist . ”
“ Hmmmmmm , * laughs * .
The piracy has been quite bad in Japan as well , but we have enjoyed quite good sales wise for two reasons .
One , it came out in the Christmas season when people are more prepared to pay and we have lots of fans who have been playing the series for the last 20 years and they do n’t mind paying a bit of money to get Dissidia . “

Getting Mac OS
X up and running on a computer without an Apple label has always been a bit of a hassle .
You needed customised Mac OS X disks , updates would ruin all your hard work , and there was lots of fiddling with EFI and the likes .
Ever since the release of boot - 132 , this is no longer the case .
Read on for how setting up a “ Hack ” intosh really is as easy as 1 , 3 , 2 .
As easy as 1 , 3 , 2
The most well - known way of setting up a Hackintosh is to download a hacked Mac OS X Leopard image , burn it to a disk , and go from there .
This method , while easy , has several disadvantages .
First of all , if you ’re in the United States , or another country with DMCA - like laws , this hacking can actually be against the law , and as such , it might not be a wise thing to do .
Secondly , using such hacked Mac OS X images means that updates from Apple , such as the latest Leopard 10.5.7 update , will definitely ruin your system .
However , ever since September last year , we have a new method , using a small boot CD called boot - 132 .
If I understand it all correctly , it uses a modified Darwin kernel to bootstrap a regular , unaltered Mac OS X Leopard retail disc .
Since Darwin is open source , this is completely legal , and does n’t break the DMCA since you ’re not actually hacking any protection measures .
As soon as the regular retail disc is “ running ” , the installer pops up , allowing you to install Mac OS X as if you ’re using any regular Macintosh .
Once the installation is completed , you use the boot - 132 CD to boot into the newly installed Leopard , and from there you install a bootloader ( Chameleon ) which enables you to boot without the CD .
This method has several advantages .
I already named the DMCA advantage , but on top of that comes the fact that since you ’re using an unaltered copy of Leopard , updates from Apple will install a lot more smoothly than when using a modified installation .
Early on , this method was only viable when using hardware exactly the same as Apple uses , but soon after the boot - 132 CD could be modified to include drivers for machines with more diverging hardware .
Since writing drivers is not illegal , this also does n’t break the DMCA : no actual hacking of Apple code involved .
Using the boot - 132 method , I built myself a non-Apple Macintosh with a flick of the wrist .
There were some small bumps along the road , but nothing show - stopping : I ’m now enjoying a brand new Macintosh for less than 200 EUR .
This computer is n’t actually a hackintosh , since no Apple code was hacked to get it running .
It only runs Mac OS X ; I have n’t installed any other operating systems on it .
The hardware
The hardware used to build this Macintosh amounted to a total price of 199 EUR , ordered at my favourite Dutch online hardware retailer .
The core of the system is a Foxconn barebone machine , the Foxconn L10 - S3 , which uses a slightly modified Intel Atom 330 mini-ITX motherboard ( network and audio chip from Realtek ) .
Foxconn 45CSX mini-ITX motherboard
Intel Atom 330 processor ( dual- core , 2×1.6Ghz )
Intel 945GC+ICH7 chipset
Intel GMA950 graphics chip
Realtek ALC662 audio chip
Realtek RTL8100C ethernet chip
2GB of DDR2 RAM
160GB SATA hard drive
SATA DVD drive
This entire package cost 199.50 EUR here ( excl .
the DVD drive , I already owned that one ) , including shipping and 19 % VAT .
Note that you have to buy Mac OS X Leopard as well from retail !
Using the boot - 132 method , almost all of the hardware is supported .
What is not supported are no deal breakers : the line - in does n’t work ( a different driver might solve that ) , you have to turn HyperThreading off ( no support for HT on the Atom 330 in Mac OS X 10.5.7 ) , and sleep does n’t seem to work ( some BIOS fiddling might solve that , though ) .
For the rest , everything ’s supported .
The guide
After you ’ve ordered all the components from your favourite retailer , and assembled it , it ’s time to start the guide .
Let ’s take a look at the pre-requisists first :
The above hardware .
This guide only works for this machine .
Other machines require different guides .
A retail disc of Mac OS X Leopard ; I used a 10.5.6 disc .
We do n’t condone software piracy , so go out and buy one .
Apple deserves it for delivering a high - quality operating system .
The Intel D945GCLF2_ISO boot - 132 package .
This is a modified boot - 132 .iso for this specific motherboard .
The driver package for this motherboard .
Included in the above D945 package .
The Chameleon boot loader .
Also included in the D945 package .
Let ’s get started with actually installing Leopard .
Write the boot - 132 .iso found in the D945 package onto a CD or DVD .
Boot using this disc , and when you hit the prompt , press “ enter ” once , and stop there .
, and stop there .
At this point , remove the boot - 132 disc , and insert the Leopard retail disc .
Wait until the disc is spun up and the indicator light turns off .
. Perform the installation .
Use Disk Utility to partition the disc using the GUID scheme .
I dedicated the entire drive to Mac OS X .
When the machine reboots after the installation , replace the Leopard disc with the boot - 132 disc .
Press enter at the prompt again , but this time , enter the hexadecimal code for the drive you installed Mac OS X to .
This will most likely be 80 ( first HDD ) or 81 ( second HDD ) .
Leopard boots !
Now it ’s time for the post - installation tasks .
Upon reboot , install the Chameleon boot loader , supplied with the D945 package .
Install the driver package , also supplied with the D945 package .
Reboot , and note how you no longer need the boot - 132 disc .
Updating to Mac OS 10.5.7 is relatively easy , but there are two very important steps .
Install OSx86Tools , and use this tool to backup your extensions folder – just in case something goes wrong .
Be sure to backup to an external medium .
Run Software Update .
As a safety precaution , install every update except the Mac OS X 10.5.7 update .
This way , if anything goes wrong , you know it is not caused by the 10.5.7 update .
You ’ll have to reboot .
the Mac OS X 10.5.7 update .
This way , if anything goes wrong , you know it is caused by the 10.5.7 update .
You ’ll have to reboot .
Now it ’s time to install Mac OS X 10.5.7 , again using Software Update .
Reboot .
This step is important : go into the BIOS , and disable HyperThreading .
Mac OS X 10.5.7 will not boot with HyperThreading enabled , most likely because it does not support it for the Atom 330 .
. Mac OS X 10.5.7 will , most likely because it does not support it for the Atom 330 .
Re-install the diver package .
Using OSx86 Tools , there are some fun after - install things to do .
They are not required , but fun nonetheless .
Using OSx86 Tools , you can change the processor and memory strings in “ About This Mac ” to properly describe the hardware in your machine .
Since Leopard does n’t include strings for this hardware , you need to add them yourself .
This is skin - deep only ; System Profiler wo n’t take it into account .
The lack of these strings does not affect the utilisation of your hardware in any way , however .
Apple stickers
That ’s it !
My small and lovely little ( and cheap ! )
Atom 330 dual - core machine now runs Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.7 without breaking the DMCA or doing any difficult hacking .
Updates apply just fine , and software installs and runs without any problems as well .
Office 2008 ( update to SP1 went fine as well ) , iLife ’ 08 , Adium ; they all work without any issues .
The boot - 132 method is the holy grail of the OSx86 community .
Apple ca n’t do anything about this , short of introducing special DRM chips in their machines .
However , those will get cracked rather quickly , meaning it ’ll only be a waste of money .
The only possible problem here is the EULA , which forbids installing Mac OS X on hardware that is not “ Apple- labeled ” .
I solved that issue by placing an actual apple on top of my machine , and I ’ve got various Apple stickers here as well which could solve the problem in a more permanent fashion ( I ate the apple … ) .
Rests me to say that this InsanelyMac forum thread contains a list of modified boot - 132 discs and packages for all sorts of hardware .
Feel free to check if yours is included !
Losing your job raises the odds you 'll get sick , and not just to your stomach .
Facing a firing or layoff can increase the risk of developing a new health problem , such as hypertension , heart disease , heart attack , stroke or diabetes , a new study suggests .
In some cases , the odds of getting sick because of losing a job jump 50 to 80 percent .
The current economic downturn has left millions of Americans all too familiar with the impact of sudden unemployment .
Unemployment now sits at 8.9 percent nationally , and 5.7 million jobs have been lost since the beginning of the recession in December 2007 , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" In today 's economy , job loss can happen to anybody , " said Kate Strully , who conducted the new research as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society scholar at the Harvard School of Public Health .
" We need to be aware of the health consequences of losing our jobs and do what we can to alleviate the negative effects . "
Previous studies have found a link between job loss and poor health , with some indicating that workers with health problems are more likely to lose their jobs .
But by using data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics , a nationally representative survey from 1999 , 2001 and 2003 , Strully found that the reverse was also true : job loss could lead to certain health problems .
In particular , Strully found that " job churning , " defined as high rates of job loss but low unemployment , has negative health consequences for workers who were not already sick .
( Mergers , restructurings , and downsizings are all features of a churning job market . )
Strully found that for those who lost their job - white or blue collar - through no fault of their own ( for example , if their employer closed its doors ) the odds of reporting fair or poor health increased by 54 percent .
Among respondents with no pre-existing health conditions , it increased the odds of a new health condition by 83 percent .
Even when workers found another job , they had an increased risk of new stress - related health conditions , the study found .
The results were a little different for workers who were fired or laid off , and depended on their occupation :
While being fired , laid off or leaving a job voluntarily more than doubles the odds of a fair or poor health report among blue - collar workers , such job displacements have no significant association with the health reports of white - collar workers .
Researchers do n't know the reasons behind this difference .
Of course , not all health problems are necessarily likely to be triggered or exacerbated by the loss of a job .
Those that can be linked to the stress involved in the situation are most likely to be impacted , Strully said , including stroke , hypertension , heart disease , heart attack , arthritis , diabetes and emotional / psychiatric problems .
On this beautiful Mother 's Day an email from the HispanicLibertarians Yahoo Group landed in my inbox .
It was a post titled “ Troops and Law enforcement officers say not on my watch ! ” .
The entire post was this link , [ link edited for length ] , the Oath Keepers website .
At first glance I thought good for them this is a step in the right direction .
Unfortunately , further examination quickly revealed another side of this organization .
While they advocate liberty and respect for the Constitution they also support the US government 's imperial wars .
It is not possible to be pro war and empire , on the one hand , and pro liberty at the same time .
One must choose one or the other .
The pro war and pro empire side is revealed when one clicks on the links in the blog post , “ Shout Our Oaths In The Tyrant 's Face - Washington D.C. , June 13 , 2009 “ , a call to celebrate an alleged victory in Iraq .
The first link is to Gathering of Eagles .
On their page titled Our Mission point number 9 states , “ We will accept nothing less than total , unqualified victory in the current conflict .
Surrender is not an option , nor is defeat . ”
The freedom hating Neoconservatives could n't have said it better .
The truth is that ending an aggressive war overseas is n't surrender or defeat , it is good sense .
It is the only way to live in peace with the world .
( I will give them credit for one thing , point number 7 which reads , “ We vehemently oppose the notion that it is possible to ' support the troops but not the war . '
We are opposed to those groups who would claim support for the troops yet engage in behavior that is demeaning and abusive to the men and women who wear our nation 's uniform . ”
This is quite true .
It is the height of moral cowardice to proclaim support for the troops but oppose their mission .
Those who oppose the war should do so completely and openly . )
Oath Keepers is missing a key point .
The problem is n't that the military and police are being given the wrong orders , that 's merely the symptom .
The real problem is the fact that these organizations exist that allow such orders to be issued in the first place .
I make this point about police powers in , “ Drug Prohibition : Law Enforcement Is The Problem “ .
The answer is not to take this oath , the answer is to resign from government service .
I would remind readers that this would be emulating George Washington 's resignation from and disbanding of the Army after the fighting in the Revolutionary War ended .
He knew better than to have a standing army .
Let me conclude with some words of wisdom on the subject from the Founders :
It is certain , that all parts of Europe which are enslaved , have been enslaved by armies ; and it is absolutely impossible , that any nation which keeps them amongst themselves can long preserve their liberties ; nor can any nation perfectly lose their liberties who are without such guests :
And yet , though all men see this , and at times confess it , yet all have joined in their turns , to bring this heavy evil upon themselves and their country .
Cato's Letters , No. 95 : Further Reasonings against Standing Armies [ September 22 , 1722 ]
**************************
A standing military force , with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty .
The means of defense against foreign danger , have been always the instruments of tyranny at home .
Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war , whenever a revolt was apprehended .
Throughout all Europe , the armies kept up under the pretext of defending , have enslaved the people .
– James Madison
*************************
“ What , Sir , is the use of a militia ?
It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army , the bane of liberty ….
Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people , they always attempt to destroy the militia , in order to raise an army upon their ruins . ”
— Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts ,

“ I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies . ”
Thomas Jefferson
*****************************
If we admit this consolidated government , it will be because we like a great splendid one .
Some way or other we must be a great and mighty empire ; we must have an army , a navy , and a number of things :
When the American spirit was in its youth , the language of America was different : Liberty , Sir , was then the primary objectBut now , Sir , the American spirit , assisted by the ropes and chains of consolidation , is about to convert this country to a powerful and mighty empire .

Further details revealed on IDF operation in Sudan :
Naval commando forces of the Navy 's Shayetet 13 unit were involved in the January operation , which included an attack on an Iranian arms ship docking in Sudan , the Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported Wednesday , quoting an American source .
American television network CBS reported in late March that Israel Air Force planes had attacked in Sudan 17 trucks carrying weapons from Iran to the Gaza , leaving 39 people killed .
Opinion Mystery in Sudan Hagai Segal Hagai Segal wonders why people talk about Sudan bombing but not about Egyptian conduct Mystery in Sudan
reported that Israel had struck three times in the northeast African country in an attempt to thwart the smuggling of weapons to the Hamas organization in Gaza .
Sudanese officials said in response that the convoy of trucks attacked was transferring goods , not weapons , and that there was no proof that Israel was the one to strike on its territory .
Senior Hamas member Salah al - Bardawil said that the allegations that the convoy was transferring weapons to Gaza were " false claims aimed at permitting the strike in Sudan . "
Israel refused to comment on the publications , but former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said after the first reports about the strike emerged that " we are operating in any place where the terror infrastructures can be hit .
In close places , in distant places , we 're hitting them in a way which strengthens and reinforces the deterrence . "
The London - based Arabic - language al - Sharq al - Awsat newspaper reported about a week ago that an American source had telephoned a high - ranking Sudanese official before the strike and warned him that a third party was monitoring the smuggling of weapons from Sudan to Gaza and that the smuggling must stop immediately .
The paper reported that the strikes took place shortly after the warning , causing Sudanese officials to believe that the United States was behind them , although this was denied by Washington .

Following Bush lead , Obama moves to block challenge to wiretapping program John Byrne
Published : Monday April 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Wants case against NSA dismissed President Barack Obama invoked " state secrets " to prevent a court from reviewing the legality of the National Security Agency 's warantless wiretapping program , moving late Friday to have a lawsuit that challenged the program dismissed .
The move -- which holds that information surrounding the massive eavesdropping program should be kept from the public because of its sensitivity -- follows an earlier decision in March to block handover of documents relating to the Bush Administration 's decision to spy on a charity .
The arguments also mirror the Bush Administration 's efforts to dismiss an earlier suit against AT&T .
The Friday brief involves a lawsuit filed by the civil liberties group Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is suing the NSA for the wiretapping program .
The agency monitored the telephone calls and emails of thousands of people within the United States without a court 's approval in an effort to thwart terrorist attacks .
In attempting to block a San Fransisco court from reviewing documents relating to the NSA program , the Obama Administration is also protecting other individuals named as defendants in the suit : Vice President Dick Cheney , former Cheney chief of staff David Addington and former Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
The Friday brief responded to the government agencies being sued ; the individual defendants have asked for more time to prepare their response .
It also stands firmly behind the telecommunications giant AT&T .
AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein revealed that the company allowed the agency to install network monitoring hardware to spy on American citizens .
The Director of National Intelligence , the Justice Department says , " has set forth a more than reasonable basis to conclude that harm to national security would result from the disclosure of whether the NSA has worked with any telecommunications carrier . "
AT&T is specifically mentioned .
Public reports have fingered AT&T , Verizon , MCI and Sprint as participating in the government 's eavesdropping efforts .
Acting Assistant Attorney General Michael Hertz penned the brief on behalf of the Obama Justice Department .
" The grounds for this motion [ to dismiss ] are that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction with respect to plaintiffs ' statutory claims against the United States because Congress has not waived sovereign immunity , and summary judgment for the Government on all of plaintiffs ' remaining claims against all parties ... is required because information necessary to litigate plantiffs ' claims is property subject to and excluded from use in this case by the state secrets privilege and related statutory privileges , " Hertz and other trial attorneys for the Justice Department wrote .
The Justice Department also holds that the lawsuit can't proceed because of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
They assert that the US government has " sovereign immunity " against statutory claims that it illegally wiretapped or accessed communications data .
Congress expanded the wiretapping program in 2008 with passage of amendments to the Act , which gave telecom companies immunity for past and future participation in the program and expanded the legal use of warrantless wiretaps from 48 hours to seven days .
The revised Act also allowed the government to destroy records of previous taps .
Obama voted for the revised Act while a senator last year .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation fired off a scathing press release Monday .
" President Obama promised the American people a new era of transparency , accountability , and respect for civil liberties , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston in the release .
" But with the Obama Justice Department continuing the Bush administration 's cover -up of the National Security Agency 's dragnet surveillance of millions of Americans , and insisting that the much - publicized warrantless wiretapping program is still a ' secret ' that cannot be reviewed by the courts , it feels like deja vu all over again .

When is it Safe To Hire Someone With a Criminal Record ?
New Carnegie Mellon Study Provides Empirical Basis For Employers To Use in Assessment of Prior Criminal Records
PITTSBURGH — Carnegie Mellon University researchers have created a model for providing empirical evidence on when an ex-convict has been “ clean ” long enough to be considered “ redeemed ” for employment purposes .
The new study , which appears in the current issue of Criminology , estimates that after five years of staying clean an individual with a criminal record is of no greater risk of committing another crime than other individuals of the same age .
The research comes at a time when President Barack Obama ’s crime agenda includes breaking down employment barriers for people who have a prior criminal record , but who have stayed clean since their earlier offense .
“ In the past , employers had no way of knowing when it might be safe to look past a criminal record , ” said Alfred Blumstein , co-author of the study and the J. Erik Jonsson University Professor of Urban Systems and Operations Research at Carnegie Mellon ’s H. John Heinz III College .
“ Hiring an ex-offender was a totally arbitrary decision .
We believe our model can change that and help provide employers with data in making such decisions .
Or it can be used by state criminal - record repositories in deciding when a prior arrest is too ‘ stale ’ to warrant distributing . ”
Blumstein ’s co-author is Kiminori Nakamura , a Ph.D. student at the Heinz College .
The issue of employing ex-offenders has become more of a problem , as a vast majority of larger U.S. employers now perform criminal background checks , Blumstein said .
He noted that advances in information technology allow criminal records to be kept longer and to be distributed easily , and employers are concerned about liability risk if the former offender commits a new crime .
Blumstein said this makes it difficult for a large number of people who have committed crimes when they were much younger , but have stayed clean since then .
The study , funded by The National Institute of Justice , used criminal - history records of more than 88,000 first - time offenders in New York in 1980 .
Most committed new crimes within the first few years after their initial arrest , but only a small minority had a new arrest after staying clean for at least five years .
After determining whether the offenders had remained clean during the ensuing 25 years , the data on the 1980 offenders was compared against two comparison groups .
The study determined that after about five years those in the offender group were at or below the risk of arrest as people in the general population who were the same age .
A more demanding comparison is with people of the same age who had never been arrested .
Those with a prior record had to stay clean longer , but their risk could be close enough even to that low - risk group .
Future studies will address other states and sampling years to assess the consistency of results .
This effort is intended to develop standards for employers and record repositories to help reduce the handicaps imposed on those who had committed a crime when they were younger .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Thousands of buildings at U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan have such poorly installed wiring that American troops face life - threatening risks , a top inspector for the Army says .
These wires installed in Iraq are some of the most important to ensure safety .
They all need to be replaced .
" It was horrible -- some of the worst electrical work I 've ever seen , " said Jim Childs , a master electrician and the top civilian expert in an Army safety survey .
Childs told CNN that " with the buildings the way they are , we 're playing Russian roulette . "
Childs recently returned from Iraq , where he is taking part in a yearlong review aimed at correcting electrical hazards on U.S. bases .
He told CNN that thousands of buildings in Iraq and Afghanistan are so badly wired that troops are at serious risk of death or injury .
He said problems are " everywhere " in Iraq , where 18 U.S. troops have died by electrocution since 2003 .
All deaths occurred in different circumstances and different locations , but many happened on U.S. bases being managed by various military contractors .
The Army has reopened investigations in at least five cases , according to Pentagon sources .
Of the nearly 30,000 buildings the Army 's " Task Force Safe " has examined so far , Childs said more than half " failed miserably . "
And 8,527 had such serious problems that inspectors gave them a " flash " warning , meaning repairs had to be completed in four hours or the facility evacuated .
He said the majority of those buildings were wired by contractor KBR , based in Houston , Texas .
KBR has faced extensive criticism from Congress over its performance in the war zone .
KBR has defended its performance and argued it was not to blame for any fatalities .
Military electrocutions became a national issue about a year ago , after the January 2008 death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
A decorated member of the Army 's Green Berets , Maseth was electrocuted in his shower at a U.S. base in Baghdad that once served as one of Saddam Hussein 's palaces .
His death was blamed on improper grounding and dangerous wiring on his living quarters .
Soon after that , the Army asked Childs to help create " Task Force Safe , " a team of master electricians assigned to inspect Army posts for electrical dangers .
Childs said the " large majority " of the buildings the task force examined in Iraq had been wired by KBR , which he expected would follow American standards .
But the results , he said , were " just horrible . "
In one building , " I had them pull a switch out of the wall to look at a switch , and when they pulled it out of the wall , the wires fell out of it , " Childs said .
Thinking that was an exception , " We pulled the one next to it .
They fell off , " he said .
" It was just very , very poor quality work . "
Much of the work was done by crews from countries beyond Iraq , " with very little supervision by anybody . "
And many of the problems involved improperly grounded systems that allowed plumbing to conduct electricity , which he said could lead to electric shocks such as the one that killed Maseth .
Childs said service orders on at least two occasions warned of the hazard in Maseth 's quarters , and " two simple electrical 101s " should have been checked out by electricians .
" A competent electrical contractor and electrician would have gone to that job site and tried to discover why pipes could have been energized , " he said .
If they had been , " then Ryan Maseth would not have been electrocuted , in my opinion . "
Maseth 's family is suing KBR .
An Army investigator has recommended that his cause of death be changed to " negligent homicide , " accusing the company of failing to properly supervise or inspect its work .
The Army has yet to accept the recommendation .
KBR has repeatedly said it was not responsible for Maseth 's death or for any of the others and defended its work .
" KBR has worked diligently to address electrical issues when asked , " the company told CNN in a written statement .
" What is important to remember is the challenging environment in which these issues exist .
" The electrical standards in Iraq are nowhere near those of Western or U.S. standards .
Add to this the challenges that exist in a war zone .
We have been and remain committed to fully cooperating with the government on this issue . "
But Childs said the majority of buildings on U.S. bases were built and wired by KBR since the U.S. invasion .
" They installed the housing units , they installed the electrical , they installed the wiring .
They installed it all .
And it 's wrong , " he said .
" It 's all put in wrong . "
KBR was not alone , however .
He said the Army survey found problems with every contractor whose work it inspected .
Task Force
Safe has yet to inspect another 70,000 buildings in Iraq and has just begun its review of bases in Afghanistan , where contractors have raised similar concerns .
In written answers to questions from CNN , Pentagon spokesman Chris Isleib said , " We are correcting hazardous conditions every day . "
" This is a huge undertaking but absolutely necessary for the life , health and safety of our service members and civilians , " he said .
" When we find a defect , we put in an emergency work order and take action immediately to protect the people working or living in those facilities . "
But Childs told CNN he is surprised more Americans have not been hurt .
" All the potentials are there , " he said .
" It just has n't happened . "

5 non -“ Khan ” alternatives for the “ Star Trek ” sequel ( and 5 to avoid )
That J.J. Abrams ’ reboot of the “ Star Trek ” franchise did $ 76.5 million in its opening weekend should come as no surprise to anyone who ’s been reading the reviews of the film and seeing the near - universal praise it ’s been receiving .
Also no shock : a sequel is already in the works … though , quite frankly , it received the green light several weeks prior to the debut of “ Trek . ”
( That ’s how much confidence Paramount had in the film . )
It would be all too easy , however , to offer up a new “ Star Trek II ” and have the villain be the genetically engineered superman known as Khan Noonian Singh .
That , and it would also be tempting fate .
After all , Abrams just succeeded in the impossible by making a “ Trek ” film that pleased both the masses and the Trekkies .
Why alienate them so quickly by attempting to reconceive the most iconic baddie in all of Trek - dom ?
Instead , here are a few alternative ideas for the sequel that can be found within the original “ Star Trek ” television series , as well as a few non-Khan concepts to steer clear of .
1. Trelane ( “ The Squire of Gothos ” ) .
A brash and impetuous being in possession of incredible power … like , on the level where he can pop onto an uninhabitable planet and create not only a bubble of breathable atmosphere but his very own mansion .
So , y’know , he ’s basically a proto -Q for the original Enterprise crew .
After toying with Kirk and company and using them to play his own spin on “ The Most Dangerous Game , ” it ’s revealed that , amongst his race of beings , he ’s but a child , and his parents swing by to chastise their kid for acting out of turn .
This would actually be the perfect opportunity to tie in the original universe of “ Star Trek : The Next Generation , ” since it ’s long been suggested amongst the various aspects of “ Trek ” fiction – most notably in Peter David ’s novel , “ Q - Squared , ” that Trelane was actually a member of the Q Continuum .
Given how much fun John de Lancie always seemed to have when he was playing Q , it ’s hard to imagine that he would n’t want to join in the fun and play in Abrams ’ new universe , especially since the character ’s powers are so limitless that he could still be the same Q , thereby allowing him suggest that he ’s just checking out this new parallel universe while still making reference to Picard and company .
2. Harcourt Fenton Mudd ( “ Mudd ’s Women ” / “ I , Mudd ” ) .
He ’s one of the galaxy ’s most notorious con men and , over the years , has remained one of the most popular characters in the “ Trek ” universe , having popped up in two episodes of the original series , an animated - series episode ( “ Mudd ’s Passion ” ) , a novel ( “ Mudd in Your Eye ” ) , and countless “ Trek ” comic books .
( Best title : “ The Sky Above … The Mudd Below . ” )
Indeed , his reputation is such that , in Nintendo ’s “ Starfleet Academy ” video game , he ’s considered to be required study for the cadets .
Greg Grunberg has made it known that he’d be more than happy to tackle the role of Mudd , should the character make an appearance in a future sequel , and as fair as maintaining the inimitable Mudd look , he ’s even gone on record as saying , “ I would go with the big mustache and an earring .
Why not ? ”
The only caution to be exercised is that Mudd is , at heart , a humorous character , and it ’s always been a major tightrope walk to incorporate comedy into the “ Trek ” universe .
Still , Abrams did a bang - up job with the lighthearted moments in this first flick , so there ’s reason to be optimistic about Mudd making a successful appearance in a sequel .
3. Redjac ( “ Wolf in the Fold ” ) .
There are n’t many episodes of “ Trek ” that can match the legitimate terror inspired by this concept , which suggests that Jack the Ripper was actually less a person than an alien being known as Redjac which travels from planet to planet , possessing others and committing murder before moving onward to its next destination .
( The voice given to Redjac when it infiltrated the Enterprise ’s computer still freaks me out whenever I hear it . )
There have been sequels in the “ Trek ” comics , including one where it finds Picard ’s Enterprise and battles Data in the holodeck while he ’s in Sherlock Holmes mode , but it screams for a darker take .
4. The Tholians ( “ The Tholian Web ” ) / Kollos ( “ Is There No Truth In Beauty ? ” ) .
Even though he did n’t really have the opportunity to develop them , Abrams pointedly included some non-human crewmembers amongst the Starfleet cadets and the crews of the Enterprise and the Kelvin .
The Tholians , which are crystalline in nature and have two arms and six legs , have been explored a fair amount in “ Trek , ” with references or appearances in virtually all of the series , and their so - called “ Tholian Web , ” so there ’s a lot of stuff to mine there .
Kollos , however , is an ambassador from a race of telepathic , non-corporeal energy beings called the Medusans , which have an outward appearance so hideous it drives humanoids insane but possess technological knowledge that is vital to the Federation .
The Medusans are definitely a lesser “ Trek ” race , but it would be extremely interesting to see how the concept could be utilized .
5. Gary Mitchell ( “ Where No Man Has Gone Before ” ) .
There was no mention of the man who had been established years before as Kirk ’s best friend in the Academy , but “ Star Trek ” did manage to slip in an appearance by the planet where Gary Mitchell met his maker in the original series ( Delta Vega ) , so there ’s very much an opening to be had .
In the original series , the Enterprise attempted to cross through the so - called Galactic Barrier , an energy band which surrounds the Milky Way ( and a very cool idea , even if it is scientifically unlikely ) , but while they fail in their task , the experience causes Lt. Commander Mitchell to develop tremendous psionic abilities as well as some wicked cool glowing eyes :
Before we go , let ’s also just list off five possible sequel ideas that we ’re not quite ready for yet …
1. The Guardian of Forever ( “ The City on the Edge of Forever ” ) .
We ’ve just done time travel .
2. The Mirror Universe ( “ Mirror , Mirror ” ) .
As much as we ’d like to see Zachary Quinto in a beard , we ’ve just done parallel universes as well .
3. Evil Kirk ( “ The Enemy Within ” ) .
Right now , we really like Chris Pine .
Let ’s not put him in a position where he ’s tempted to “ pull a Shatner ” and overact .
4. Tribbles ( “ The Trouble with Tribbles ” ) .
They did an animated - series sequel , and “ Deep Space Nine ” paid the greatest possible tribute to the original episode with “ Trials and Tribble - ations , ” so let ’s just stick to the cameo appearances by the cooing furballs , shall we ?
5. Dr. Sevrin , Adam , and the gang ( “ The Way to Eden ” ) .
Anyone who thinks the idea of the singing space hippies would be awesome to revisit is a total Herbert .
Plus , the studio would try to update them into emo kids , and no one really wants to see Pete Wentz in a “ Star Trek ” movie , do they ?
