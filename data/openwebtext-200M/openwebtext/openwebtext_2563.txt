Harvard scientists have cleared a key hurdle in the creation of synthetic life , assembling a cell ’s critical protein - making machinery in an advance with both practical , industrial applications and that advances the basic understanding of life ’s workings .
George Church , a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School and member of Harvard ’s Origins of Life Initiative , reported the creation of billions of synthetic ribosomes that readily create a long , complex protein called firefly luciferase .
Church , speaking at a Harvard Alumni Association and Origins of Life Initiative event at the Science Center on Saturday afternoon ( March 7 ) , described the advance for the first time publicly as part of an afternoon symposium called “ The Future of Life . ”
“ We have not made artificial life , and that is not our primary goal , but this is a huge milestone in that direction , ” Church said in comments on the work before the event .
Ribosomes are bodies inside of each cell that take the instructions from DNA and use them to create the proteins encoded by specific genes .
Proteins are critical to forming the body ’s structure , including muscles , bones and tendons , and are also critical in its daily functioning , through enzymes , for example , which control metabolism .
“ The reason it is a step toward artificial life is that the key component of all living systems is the ribosome , which does protein synthesis .
It is the most conserved and one of the most complicated biological machines , ” Church said .

Using the bacteria E. coli , Church and Research Fellow Michael Jewett extracted the bacteria ’s natural ribosomes , broke them down into their constituent parts , removed the key ribosomal RNA and then synthesized the ribosomal RNA anew from molecules .
Though the advance may create excitement among researchers interested in life ’s basic functioning , Church said that the work ’s industrial applications were its driving force .
Industry today manufactures proteins on a large scale using natural ribosomes , which evolved over millions of years for natural , not industrial , reasons .
Church said that being able to create a ribosome means also being able to tweak it so it better fits industrial needs .
One possible use would be to create mirror - image proteins that would be less susceptible to breakdown by enzymes , making them longer - lived .
“ You really are in control .
It ’s like the hood is off and you can tinker directly , ” Church said .
The advance breaks a 40 - year period with little progress in artificial ribosome creation , Church said .
The last significant work in this area was done in 1968 , when researchers assembled an artificial ribosome , but in an unusual chemical environment rather than an environment in which protein synthesis normally occurs , as Church and Jewett did .

Church and Jewett expected creating the artificial ribosome and getting it to produce proteins would be the toughest steps in making an artificial cell .
They were amazed , Church said , when the task was accomplished in just a year .
The ultimate goal is to create an artificial genome of 151 genes that they believe are the minimum to create a functioning , self - replicating cell .
“ It could be that the hardest steps are still ahead of us , ” Church said .
Joining Church at Saturday ’s event were human genome pioneer and visiting scholar Craig Venter ; Jack Szostak , professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital ; George Whitesides , Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology ; and Andrew Knoll , Fisher Professor of Natural History and professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences .
Harvard Provost Steven E. Hyman introduced the event .
It was moderated by professor of astronomy and Origins of Life Director Dimitar Sasselov .
Szostak presented his recent research into the creation and propagation of synthetic cells , showing that membranes form from simple fat molecules spontaneously under certain conditions .
In addition to the membranes , he reviewed research into possible ways that basic genetic information may have originally been stored and conveyed in simple RNA - like molecules .
His work , he said , is exploring the properties of these RNA - like molecules , seeking variations that make them better early candidates to store and replicate genetic information than either DNA or RNA , which perform those functions in modern cells , but require complex molecular machinery to do so .
In his presentation , Venter described the search for genes around the world , saying that microbes have been found on earth that can withstand radiation levels far beyond that which would be lethal to humans , that can live in corrosive liquids that would eat away a human finger dipped in it , and in a wide array of other environments .
The growing library of genes from creatures of all kinds – totaling 50,000 gene families – has created a database from which industry can pick and choose genes for particular applications .
Using genetic engineering , synthetic genomes can be created to do such useful things as create clean - burning synthetic fuels , he said .
“ I think we ’re limited primarily by our own imagination , ” Venter said .
NBC Bay Area has learned that Johannes Mehserle has not yet been released from jail and must pay 10 percent of the $ 3 million bail amount in order to be released .
As of Sunday morning , he was still in custody at the Santa Rita Jail .
Protestors took to the streets in frustration over the decision .
Dozens of armed police officers and protesters clashed .
The incident has outraged residents and led to several protests .
Another rally took place on Friday .
People began showing up at the courthouse by mid-morning Friday .
By early afternoon , dozens of protesters had gathered .
They marched in the afternoon hours throughout downtown Oakland , shutting down the intersection at 14th and Broadway .
The protesters were peaceful .
Aerial video showed police using canisters of tear gas at one point during one demonstration .
At least 80 officers wearing riot gear were on the scene .
BART officials closed one of the stations due to one of the civil disturbances .
The BART station at 12th Street near the Oakland City Center was eventually reopened .
The transit officer who shot and killed an unarmed man may have also mistakenly pulled his service pistol instead of a stun gun , according to documents filed by his lawyer Friday that offer the first glimpse at his defense .
Attorney Michael Rains made the argument Friday in urging a judge to grant bail to 27 - year - old Mehserle .
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Morris Jacobson heard the motion in an afternoon hearing .
" He fired the taser , or so he thought , " said Rains .
" the taser he had been trained on three weeks earlier for six hours .
That was the taser he fired . "
Mehserle has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder in the death of 22 - year - old Oscar Grant , who was killed early New Year 's Day .
Cell phone videos of the incident , widely viewed on the Internet , show the officer standing over Grant as he was lying facedown on a train platform and firing one shot into the man 's back .
Grant died of the gunshot wound to his torso .
" ( Mehserle ) chose to use lethal force when it clearly was not called for , " said Jacobson .
But in a court filing Friday , Rains said witness accounts indicate that Mehserle meant to draw his Taser , but instead pulled his pistol .
The lawyer blamed inexperience by the young officer , who passed his Taser user certification test on Dec. 3 .
" The bulk of the discovery , including witness and officer statements , seem to indicate that this young officer , who carried a taser for only a few shifts prior to this event , may have mistakenly deployed his service pistol rather than his taser , thus negating any criminal intent , " Rains wrote .
The court documents contain statements from and reports by several officers who were on the platform with Mehserle at the time of the shooting .
The officers -- who had just pulled several men , including Grant , from a Bay Area Rapid Transit train after reports of fighting -- described the scene as chaotic and confusing .
According to a statement from Officer Tony Pirone , Mehserle told Grant to stop resisting and put his hands behind his back .
Then , according to Pirone 's statement , Mehserle said : " I 'm going to tase him , I 'm going to tase him .
I can't get his arms .
He wo n't give me his arms .
His hands are going for his waistband . "
Mehserle then told Pirone to move , before firing the shot .
Pirone said he did n't know if Grant was armed , but said Mehserle told him he had believed Grant may have been armed .
" Tony , I thought he was going for a gun , " Mehserle said , according to Pirone 's statement .
Tensions High in and out of Courtroom
Tensions were described as " high " in the courtroom and outside on Friday .
Family members of the man who died , Oscar Grant III , say they will be outraged if Mehserle is released .
Here is a portion of the statement that the family released :
" We have received may letters , cards , flowers and contributions to Oscar Grant 's daughter , Tatiana Grant .
There were many letters from a wonderful range of supporters who have asked , " Where and how to donate to Tatiana 's Trust Fund ? " .
Again we say thank you for all the support and contributions .
We believe Oscar Grant did not die in vain .
This is the beginning of a new day in our communities . "
The family asked that information regarding the trust fund be made public .
Here it is :
Tatiana Grant Trust Fund
Acct # 3879027641
Wells Fargo Bank , 950 Southland Dr. Hayward 94545
Security had been heightened around the courthouse .
Officials restricted access to the hearing to a handful of media and a few of Grant and Mehserle 's family and friends .
Only seven reporters were granted access to the courtroom .
On Thursday , BART officials announced the agency is turning over its internal affairs investigation of officers involved in the New Year 's Day fatal shooting of Oscar Grant III to an independent third party .
" It 's imperative that we determine whether the actions of those officers on the platform violated the policies and practices of the BART Police Department , " BART board member Carole Ward Allen , who chairs the new BART police review committee , said in a statement .
Ward Allen said the board hoped " an independent , outside investigation " would reassure the public " that we are transparent and accountable . "
The internal affairs investigation is separate from the criminal investigation being conducted by the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office on the former BART officer .
In addition to the third - party internal affairs investigation , BART officials said today they were also turning over a " top- to - bottom " review of BART police policies and procedures to third - party experts in the law enforcement field .
BART has not yet determined which groups will conduct those investigations , officials said .
" I met a guy on an online dating site and he is not who he said he is .
I 'm very glad I used BeenVerified to find this out .
Thank you so much . "

( CNN ) --
The Illinois state Senate on Monday began its impeachment trial against Gov. Rod Blagojevich without the governor present .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing .
Blagojevich said he expects lawmakers to vote to convict him .
He is facing federal corruption allegations , including trying to trade or sell the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president .
The second - term Democratic governor has denied wrongdoing .
Instead of attending the trial , Blagojevich hit the media circuit Monday .
He appeared on ABC's " Good Morning America " and " The View , " and was scheduled to give his first live prime - time interview Monday night on CNN's " Larry King Live . "
Speaking on " Good Morning America , " Blagojevich restated his complaints about what he called the " unconstitutional " impeachment trial , which he said " denies me the right to call witnesses to defend myself and prove my innocence . "
Watch Blagojevich say he 's done " nothing wrong " »
Blagojevich on ' King ' Gov. Rod Blagojevich joins Larry King for the hour and takes your calls .
Tonight , 9 ET on CNN see full schedule »
He said he is certain the Illinois Senate will vote to remove him from office and said he expects they will demand he step down " relatively soon . "
Earlier this month , the Illinois House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to impeach him .
Blagojevich has said the vote was politically motivated .
Under the Illinois Constitution , the House can vote to impeach an executive or judicial officer , but it is the Senate that conducts the trial .
A two - thirds majority vote in the Senate is required to convict an officer of an impeachable offense .
According to a federal complaint issued in December , Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris -- who also was arrested on federal corruption charges -- were " conspiring to obtain personal financial benefits " for the governor by leveraging his sole authority to appoint a U.S. senator to replace Obama .
" I 've got this thing and it's [ expletive ] golden , " Blagojevich allegedly said in one recorded phone conversation , referring to his authority to appoint , according to the complaint .
" I 'm just not giving it up for [ expletive ] nothing . "
When asked about those alleged quotes , Blagojevich told ABC that federal prosecutors " took snippets of conversations completely out of context . "
" When the whole story comes out , you 'll see that the effort was to work to have a senator who can best represent Illinois , " he said .
Blagojevich has said his rights are being violated because he cannot challenge assertions in the House impeachment report .
Watch Blagojevich demand a fair trial »
Blagojevich also is asking for a change in a Senate trial rule that he said is preventing him from calling witnesses such as Valerie Jarrett , a confidant of Obama's ; Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ; and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
Emanuel , claimed Blagojevich , agrees that he did not break any laws .
State Sen. Matt Murphy , part of the nine - member committee that put the Senate trial rules together , called Blagojevich 's complaints " the theater of the absurd . "
iReport.com :
Do you trust your political leaders ?
" What you 've seen here ... is a cynical effort on the part of this governor that 's perfectly consistent with his actions over the last six years , to try and further undermine the faith in this process that the people already have , " Murphy said .
He said the House prosecution team responsible for presenting the impeachment case to the Senate is operating under the same restrictions as Blagojevich with regard to calling witnesses .
Murphy said on " Good Morning America " that U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald has asked both sides to " defer to the criminal prosecution " of Blagojevich and " limit witnesses . "
He noted that the governor has every right to submit " positive statements that the governor says exonerate him " -- such as those from Jarrett , Jackson and Emanuel -- as evidence in the Senate trial .
" We have lowered the standard for the admission of evidence for the governor to bend over backward to make this fair , " Murphy said .
" The suggestion that this is somehow unfair to the governor is the most self - serving , ludicrous statement I have ever heard in my life .
It could n't be fairer for this guy . "
Blagojevich missed deadlines this month for answering the impeachment charge and for filing a motion to dismiss , a spokesman for Illinois Senate President John Cullerton has said .
All About Rod Blagojevich • Illinois
Apart from filling Sunday afternoons with the roar of engines and the squeal of tyres on Tarmac , what has Formula One ever done for us ?
If you 've never given the subject much thought , you could be forgiven for thinking that the answer is " not very much " .
After all , F1 is a rich man 's sport in which powerful teams focus on their own performance to the apparent exclusion of pretty much anything else .
But a new exhibition that opens today at London 's Science Museum sets out to demonstrate just how great – and varied – the benefits of motor - racing technology are .
Called Fast Forward : 20 ways F1 is changing our world , it shows , for example , how British soldiers are benefiting from the protective qualities of the light yet strong materials that were first developed for racing cars ; and how hospital patients and premature babies may stand a better chance of survival than they would have done a few years ago , thanks to the transfer of F1 know - how to the medical world .
Also , how borrowed motor - racing technology called " laso " makes it less likely your central - heating boiler will conk out next winter , and help anglers to catch more fish .
" Formula One engineering is a thriving activity in the UK , " explains the exhibition 's curator , Katie Maggs .
" I hope the exhibition provides a unique perspective , and will appeal to a wide range of visitors , including those who are n't necessarily interested in motor racing . "

While it's not surprising that advances made in Formula
One tend to filter down to the cars we drive every day , motor - racing technology has less obvious applications as well .
" A wide range of unrelated industries have been beneficiaries of F1 innovation , " says Ron Dennis , chairman of the McLaren Group .
Several industries exploit technical advances originally developed for space exploration , but so advanced are some of the innovations in motor racing that space scientists occasionally come knocking at the door of Formula One , looking for help as well .
The casing of the 2003 Beagle 2 Mars lander , for example , used a special lightweight plastic first used in F1 exhaust systems , adapted to protect the craft 's sensitive scientific instruments .
Modern cars use a monocoque , or single - piece bodyshell , a lighter , stiffer arrangement than the separate chassis and coachwork found on earlier vehicles .
In modern Formula One cars , the monocoque is made of carbon fibre , resulting in an exceptionally light and strong body .
Using the same principle , the Babypod II , a container used to transport babies requiring urgent medical treatment , which draws on Formula One cockpit design .
It is lighter and far more easily stowed in cars and helicopters than a conventional incubator .
" Almost everything needed for the baby 's survival is provided within the shell , " says Maggs .
A larger carbon - fibre monocoque - style structure , in this case designed to accommodate adults , is the Ovei Wellbeing Capsule , a diagnostics tool that captures data from the patient that is then transmitted to doctors and psychologists anywhere in the world for diagnosis .
The Ovei's designer , Lee McCormack , also called upon Formula
One engineers to help model the airflow through the capsule to cool the diagnostic equipment it contains .
Another F1 - inspired innovation is the lightweight Gen3 leg brace .
Designed by McLaren Applied Technologies , the arm of McLaren set up to exploit technical advances made in the team 's quest for success on the track , the Gen3 was commissioned by the US Marines .
It borrows principles used in hydraulic dampers and lightweight construction in Formula
One to minimise the impact of the repeated shocks to the legs suffered by Marines travelling in rigid inflatable boats in heavy seas .
As well as reducing the risk of injury , the Gen3 shows promise as an aid to the healing of civilian knees after surgery .
Formula
One is a leader in the use of telemetry – every aspect of a car 's performance is measured and recorded to provide the teams with the vast volumes of data they require to analyse and improve their cars ' performance .
The Factor 001 bicycle extends this approach to the world of cycling .
The heart rate of the rider and the speed of the wheels are recorded for analysis ; previously , it had only been possible to gather this sort of information in a static setting , but the Factor 001 allows it to be collected under real - world conditions on the road as part of the cyclist 's training regime .
Some of the exhibits at the Science Museum show might appear mundane , but they have the potential to make everyday life safer and simpler .
The Guardian wellington boot , for example , has an anti-slip sole that uses the rubber compounds and tread patterns used in Formula One tyres .
The Boiler Buddy is even less glamorous – if just as useful – than an F1 welly .
Magnetic filters used to remove tiny metal particles from engine and gearbox oil are adapted to combat the accumulation of sludge in domestic heating systems , which operate more reliably as a result .
" The Boiler Buddy shows that the applications of Formula One technology are n't all elitist – they can be applied to everyday situations , " explains Maggs .
Interior - design fans will appreciate the carbon - fibre dining table created by Terence Woodgate with the support of John Barnard , the engineer responsible for designing Formula One 's first carbon - fibre chassis for McLaren in 1981 .
Although the table is 4 m long , it is a mere 2 mm thick , a tribute to the exceptional strength of carbon - fibre .
But it 's not just specific materials or techniques that can profitably be borrowed from Formula One .
In the ruthless pursuit of success , racing teams endlessly redesign their processes and strip them back to the essentials .
Think how long it takes your local garage to fit a new tyre to your car .
Compare that with the 10 seconds or less it takes for a team to change four wheels and brim the tank during a pit stop .
Now imagine how procedures in business , government , or any other field could be transformed by applying the sort of intelligence , urgency and rigour that are the norm in motor racing .
Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children worked with experts from Formula
One in order to streamline the vital , complex process of transferring patients between the operating theatre and intensive care – and achieved a reduction in errors at the same time .
So , what has Formula One ever done for us ?
Quite a lot , as it turns out – and they 've finally decided to tell us about it .

Race for innovation : F1 's smart spin-offs
Trekinetic wheelchair
This revolutionary device incorporates a host of innovations , but the fundamental difference compared with orthodox designs lies in the use of a moulded carbon - fibre seat based on the monocoque bodyshells seen in Formula One .
All components are attached to this shell to produce a light , strong wheelchair that is particularly suited for use on rough surfaces .
Airflo low - friction fishing - line
The line has a ridged surface , giving it a star - shaped cross-section .
Tests showed that 12 was the optimum number of ridges , and the reduced contact area with the rod , compared with that of a normal fishing line , means that there is less friction , just as a grooved tyre enjoys less grip than a normal smooth ' slick ' racing tyre without a tread .
Formula
One rules required the use of grooved tyres until 2008 in order to hold down cornering speeds .
Wind - turbine blades
Nottingham University experts working on carbon - fibre wind - turbine blades are drawing on Formula One knowledge of rapid component manufacturing .
By , for example , improving the positioning of the fibres , it is possible to save time , materials and costs , and make the blades more readily available .
Guardian anti-slip wellington boot
This apparently ordinary - looking welly has a sole that benefits from Formula
One know - how about soft rubber compounds and treads .
The new design greatly reduces the risk of accidents for those who have to work in slippery conditions .
Fernox Cookson Boiler Buddy
It is difficult to imagine an application for Formula
One technology further removed from the glamour of the racetrack than this , but the Boiler Buddy promises to improve the efficiency of central - heating systems by preventing rust and sludge building up .
It uses magnetic filtration technology that was originally designed to remove tiny metal particles from Formula One engine and gearbox oil .
There is a big tug of war going on in the Republican camp .
The Democrats are known to always fight , that is what we do , but we welcome the argument that is why we are diverse under our big tent , but the Republicans are different .
This is a party that has been pretty much lock step with leadership , but not now .
The breaking of many independent thinking Republican governors from struggling states have made many come out in the open and buck the party line .
It is all about that stimulus money .
The Republican Party took a heavy hit the past two election cycles from the Midwest , Northeast and West .
The erosion was due much to the ideology that just is not working or the public is not listening right now .
Many people are tired of the labeling of liberal or conservative .
They want Washington to work and work for them .
The rebuffing of President Obama trying to reach across the line has a perception to the public .
Whether many Americans agree with Obama or not , they are viewing the Republican Party pretty harsh now and unwilling to work or even give President Obama a chance to fix some of the massive problems left on his desk by George W. Bush .
I do n't like all the aspects of the stimulus bill , I do n't like the idea of bailing out banks since these managers were the ones who made the atrocious decisions in putting them in the predicament they are in , I do n't like spending 10B plus in Iraq and building that nation up when we have deteriorated infrastructure all over this country ( Katrina , bridge in Minneapolis ) , I do n't like the idea of some aspects of the housing plan when many pay their mortgages and are responsible and may not get any help from the plan , I do n't like any of it .
I want to cut spending and if we spend do it smartly , but I know that tax cuts alone is not going to save this country .
It wo n't .
It is easy to just sit back and let the market correct itself , the ideology of many conservatives , but when you have bank after bank fail , Wall Street run amuck , home prices all over this country continue to plummet , 600 K job losses a week , the idea of doing nothing does not sit well with the average American who has lost almost all their money in their 401Ks and do n't know how they will send their child to college and their home price not worth the spit on the ground .
The Republicans can duke it out , but again it is looked on as a regional , southern party .
Their continuing to not come to the middle will continue to be their detriment .
The question is this though , are those constituents in these southern states going to sit by and take the heat and hit from the decisions that their governors will make by not taking some of the stimulus money ?
Especially to extend unemployment for constituents in their states ?
That is a wait and see issue .
The Republican governors ’ divide reflects their party ’s erosion to a mostly regional party that is based in the conservative South , after heavy election losses in the Northeast , Midwest and West .
And with the party leaderless after losing control of both the White House and Congress in the past two election cycles , the split is colored by early maneuvering for conservatives ’ support among potential aspirants for the party ’s 2012 presidential nomination .
Several governors , nearly all of them Southerners known to have national ambitions , have been withering in their criticism of Mr. Obama ’s stimulus plan , which received only 3 of 219 Republicans ’ votes in Congress .
The harshest critics include Mr. Sanford and Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , Haley Barbour of Mississippi , the national chairman of the party in the 1990s , Rick Perry of Texas , and Sarah Palin of Alaska , the party ’s 2008 vice - presidential nominee .
After initially saying they might reject any federal aid , several conservative governors said in interviews over the weekend that they were likely to reject only the money for expanded unemployment compensation because of federal strings that could require them to provide relief to part - time workers who lose jobs as well as to full - time workers .
Many other states already provide such aid .
“ Now is the time , and it ’s a great opportunity for Republican governors and other leaders to offer conservative - based solutions to the problems , ” Mr. Jindal said on “ Meet the Press ” on NBC .
He announced on Friday that he would reject the $ 100 million for unemployment compensation in the estimated $ 4 billion for Louisiana .

It was n’t the prayer as much as an Oklahoma City pastor ’s opening words that apparently troubled a fifth of the state House members .
The Rev. Scott Jones thanked his legislator , Rep . Al McAffrey , who asked him to pray to open Wednesday ’s House session and acknowledged several in the gallery – " dear friends , my wonderful parents , and my loving partner and fiance , Michael . ”
Jones is the pastor of the Cathedral of Hope — Oklahoma City .
When McAffrey , D - Oklahoma City , asked in the session ’s closing minutes that Jones ’ prayer be made part of the House journal , the chamber ’s official record , Rep. John Wright objected and called for a vote .
Kern among critics
With 16 members having already left , the House voted 64 - 20 to include Jones ’ prayer in the House journal .
Among those voting no was Rep. Sally Kern , R - Oklahoma City , who a year ago called homosexuality the biggest threat facing the United States .
" I ’m sure that because most of Scott ’s congregation are gay people and Scott is gay himself , I ’m sure that ’s the reason why there were negative votes on it , ” McCaffrey said .
Other than Jones introducing his male partner , McCaffrey said he could n’t ’ see how anyone could have a problem with his prayer .
" I do n’t know what was controversial over that . ”
Contacted later , Wright , R - Broken Arrow , said the practice of including a minister ’s prayer in the House journal usually is reserved for Thursdays , the last workday for legislators .
" It has not been the practice to put every day ’s prayer in the House journal , ” he said .
He conceded he did n’t concur with comments made by Jones , who except for his opening comments , gave a generic prayer to a " holy and everliving God ” and paraphrased the prophet Isaiah .
" I do n’t know if it ’s important to create an inflammatory issue out of something because that is not my intent , ” he said .
Move motivated by ‘ the faith ’
Wright said his motion was " not meant to be derogatory nor divisive nor in any way trying to cause diminishment of someone ’s sense of self - worth . ”
" My actions were motivated by the faith , so now if you want to take it and cause the public to be inflamed about it , well , that ’s at your feet , ” Wright said .
McAffrey , the Legislature ’s only openly gay member , said he ’s never heard a legislator object to a prayer being made part of the House journal during his three years there .
" I ’ve been around here long enough already that you just let things roll off your sleeve sometimes .
If they want to show that they are against prayer by a minister , that ’s their option . ”

According to a court document , an expert estimates that Microsoft earned more than $ 1.5 billion through the sales of PCs labeled as " Vista Capable " when they allowed some PC makers to label XP - running PCs as " Vista Capable " prior to the release of the Windows Vista operating system in early 2007 .
( Source : nwsource.com )
Last February we reported that a " Vista Capable " lawsuit was granted class - action status because some PCs labeled as " Vista Capable " were only capable of running the most basic version of the operating system .
( Source : infopackets.com )
Despite claims that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had no direct input into the Vista Capable scheme , he was ordered to testify in the case late last year .
Several Microsoft emails were presented to the court last November that suggested Microsoft had lowered the Vista Capable requirements at Intel 's request , noting that the decision to omit Intel 's 915 chipset could cost them billions of dollars .

Microsoft executives were split about the accuracy of its " Vista Capable " claims .
Needless to say , Windows Vista has created some embarrassing problems for Microsoft , including this ongoing lawsuit .

In recent days a video of a huge alligator going for a stroll on a Florida golf course has gone viral across the internet .
If you have n’t yet seen it , here is video of the massive beast below :
This is n’t the first time this same Gator has gone viral , it pretty much happens every time he ventures out onto the greens and someone captures a photo or video of him .
Admittedly , he does seem to be getting bigger every year though .
Here is a report from last year :
If a dinosaur could just roam out onto the fairway in your backswing , it seems like Golf may be more dangerous than most people ever thought .
If you ever lose your ball to a Gator , Chubbs Peterson from Happy Gilmore would urge you to just let it go .
If massive gators are in play , here are some other hazards you might look out for during your next round on the golf course …
1. Gophers
Gophers are vengeful creatures that do n’t like it when a golf course invades their marked territory .
They are prone to snatching up balls , creating hazards by burrowing throughout the course , and may invite unbalanced groundskeepers to use plastic explosives and destroy large parts of the grounds .
None of which will help anyone ’s golf game .
One known weakness that can be exploited is that gophers are susceptible to Kenny Loggins music , which requires them to break out in dance :
2. Hand Grenades
Back in 2009 a hand grenade was found on the Augusta Municipal Golf Course in Georgia .
So if sand traps , water hazards , and the rough are n’t enough for you , one has to all look out for possible explosives .
Specifically in this case World War I armaments .
We imagine an announcer ’s call would be something like this :
“ The 12th hole is a long Par 4 with a dogwood to the left and a difficult pin placement .
Most golfers use an iron off the tee to avoid the fairway bunkers and the grenades on the right .
The grenades typically have a kill zone of about five meters , and that ’s the area you do n’t want to be standing in when it goes off . ”
3. TV Towers
This obstacle is a little more unique .
You ’ll only encounter such a problem in your major tournaments , so amateurs probably do n’t have to worry too much .
But it ’s always best to be prepared .
If you come across such an obstacle , the proper shot is to bank it off the car , down the Subway banner , along the rails of the TV Tower , and out the pipe that ’s aimed directly at the hole .
I hope you ’ve been practicing your Putt Putt .
Remember , you have to play it as it lies , even if it ’s on Frankenstein ’s foot .
4. Bulldozers
Not the above ground kind , but the rarer below ground kind .
At the Canyon West Golf Course in Weatherford , Texas workers discovered a bulldozer buried underneath one of the fairways .
The bulldozer was apparently involved in a prolonged game of Hide and Seek with a tractor , although the tractor remains MIA .
Speaking for golfers , the last thing you need when you hit a chili dipper taking a large divot out of the ground is to strike a solid metal object with your club .
Although this opens the question , what else one may find buried underneath a golf course ?
Vehicles , Pirate Treasure , time capsules , Jimmy Hoffa ?
Maybe that divot is just the first step to uncovering some buried treasure .
Although not buried in the ground , this guy found a golf ball buried in a tree .
5. Lightning
It always seems to happen when you are having the round of your life .
The sky darkens , the wind picks up , and the thunder begins to roll across the golf course .
So the simple solution is to turn yourself into a human lightning rod with a big metal golf club , right ?
Famed golfer Lee Trevino was once struck by lightning on a golf course .
To others he offers this advice : “ If you ’re caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning , hold up a 1 - iron .
Not even God can hit a 1 - iron . ”
6. Port-o- John
Who does n’t love running to the toilet between golf shots ?
When you gotta go , you gotta go .
But the convenience comes at the cost of the portable toilets being littered throughout the course .
It not only provides yet another impediment in a successful golf game , it can also create a rancid smell .
Should you find yourself pinned behind one of these johnnies on the spot , Roy McAvoy would tell you to ricochet the ball off the shitter with a hooded seven iron .
If you become good at the shot , you can make money off your friends by making a few side bets .
Plus , it ’s a spectacular shot .
And if anyone ’s actually inside the portable toilet , it ’ll scare the shit out of them when the side gets whacked by a golf ball .
Literally .
Just imagine pelting balls at the spot pot when Tiger ’s inside .
It ’s irresistible fun , kind of like when you always aim at the ball collector on the driving range .
7. Lava
Lava is a common hazard in certain parts of the world , such as Hawaii .
If you come across some , hopefully it is in a cool , hardened state and not the liquid molten variety .
A piece of advice : if you ever shoot your ball into a river of molten lava , let it go , because , man , it ’s gone .
A bigger concern when dealing with lava is the possibility of an erupting volcano .
That lava has to come from somewhere , so there ’s bound to be a volcano near by .
In such an emergency , the proper course of action is a virgin sacrifice .
So it ’s a wise idea to keep one in your foursome .
8. Bears
Bears are a lot things : godless killing machines , picnic basket thieves , airplane pilots , honey fiends , etc … A word of warning for golfers , they ’ve also been known to hang out high above in trees , overlooking unsuspecting golfers on the greens .
Keep an eye out should you find yourself on a green near some high trees .
Also , some bears ditch the “ death from above ” angle and decide for the direct approach as seen in the picture to the right .
Although I ’ll have to admit that bears in trees works better for me .
That way you can shoot them with a tranquilizer , and gives me an excuse to pull out this old Internet favorite :
9. Birds
As scary as birds might be , remember that you have a weapon in your hands and can propel an object at high - speed at them if need be .
Here ’s an example :
10 . Hungry Hungry Hippos
Seriously , these guys will eat anything .
And they have a known affinity for eating balls .
Who knows what else they ’d chomp off given the chance ?
There have been no known reports of Hungry Hungry Hippos on a golf course , but the creatures love to hang out in water and that substance is prevalent on most courses .
Plus , with the plethora of balls , a golf course seems like a natural hideout .
So keep an eye out and think about investing in Hippo insurance .
Who knows when we ’ll read about the next Hippo attack ?
With insurance , you ’ll be prepared when the hungry ones decide to come for you .
And they will …
So you 've just bought your first bottle of Single Malt Scotch .
Now the last thing you should do is drown it with club soda or even worse , ice .
A wise person once said that the best way to enjoy whisky is the way you like it best .
But with single malts there are some rules of thumb which will heighten your enjoyment
The glass :
If all you have is a lowball glass that will work but a glass with a tapered top such a cognac snifter or wine glass will work much better .
This is because a tapered glass will concentrate the aromas of the whisky and the aroma is a big part of the experience .
You can even get special scotch tasting glasses but a snifter will do .
For your first dram of any whisky you have n't encountered before pour a small amount into your glass , hold the glass so the heat from your hand will warm the whisky and release the aromas , bring the glass up to your nose and take a whiff .
Note the different aromas .
Does it smell like citrus ?
Apples ?
Spice ?
Is it peaty ?
Woody ?
This is called nosing .
Now take a small sip .
Resist the urge to swallow immediately .
Instead roll the spirit around on your tounge and then swallow .
How did it feel in your mouth ?
Oily ?
Sweet ?
Dry ?
Note also the aftertaste , this is called the finish and may or may not be very different from the taste of the whisky .
Next add just a drop or two or spring water .
You may notice that doing this releases additional aromas that were not there before .
Keep repeating this process ( nose , taste , dilute ) and you will notice some aromas and tastes will appear while others will disappear .
After a while of diluting you may notice that only one flavor is now present .
This means the whisky 's flavor balance has broken up and you now know how much water it will take , this is why I said to only pour only a small amount for the first dram .
You should also now know just how much water ( if any , you may prefer it neat ) you like in this particular malt for when you have your next dram of this whisky .
You can now add a little more whisky to restore the balance .
Now there 's a reason I said to use spring water .
The only thing you should add to malt whisky is pure still spring water .
It has been suggested that the best water to use is the same water the distillery uses , but unless you live in Scotland this just is n't feasable .
Any good quality spring water will do .
Your tap water is probably chlorinated and this will adversly affect the taste of the whisky .
If you want a Scotch and Soda or Scotch and Water fine , use a blended scotch .
And never add ice to a single malt this is because the ice will cool the whisky and prevent the congeners ( which are responsible for the aroma and taste ) from being released .
I should also mention that it is probably a bad idea to get drunk off of single malt scotch .
First of all , as you get more inebriated your taste buds and sense of smell will get numb and you will not be able to enjoy it as much .
Secondly , single malts contain more congeners than most other spirits ; congeners are not only what give spirits their flavor , they also contribute to the phenomenon known as hangovers .
So you can have a dram or two to start off a night of drinking , but if you get sloshed off single malts you may end up with a wicked hangover .
You have been warned .
( Although in this case I 've been known to ignore my own advice ) .
One more thing : some people , unlikely as it sounds , do not like single malt whisky ( or scotch at all for that matter ) .
If you 've never tried scotch before then you should try a blend first to be sure that you like scotch .
Johnnie Walker Red Label is an inexpensive but good quality blend and is available in small enough sizes ( 50 ml and 200 ml ) so that if you do n't like it you wo n't have wasted too much money .
If you like scotch and want to try a single malt , I suggest that you try an inexpensive Speyside malt .
However some Speysides are notoriously bad ; avoid Glen Parker , Glenfiddich Special Reserve , and Drumguish .
Aberlour 10 year old and The Glenlivet 12 year old are both excellent choices for a first malt .
A Suffolk police investigation into the disappearance of fish worth thousands of pounds has been called off after a heron was found to be the culprit .
Suffolk Police were called in after 27 koi carp and seven large goldfish vanished from a Carlton Colville home .
Officers suspected a raid by thieves and issued a witness appeal which asked if locals saw " anything suspicious " or if they had been offered similar fish .
But the appeal was recalled soon after when they found the heron was to blame .
A further statement issued by police explained : " This incident is now being attributed to a large heron . "
A police spokesman said : " We take all incidents very seriously and we were worried that someone might have made off with fish worth thousands of pounds .
" Thankfully , on this occasion an arrest was n't necessary . "
CHICAGO – Astrobiologists have often pondered " life as we do not know it " in the context of extraterrestrial life , says Paul Davies , an internationally acclaimed theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Arizona State University .
" But , " he asks , " has there been a blind spot to the possibility of ' alien ' life on Earth ? "
Davies will challenge the orthodox view that there is only one form of life in a lecture titled " Shadow Life : Life As We Don't Yet Know It " on Feb. 15 at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
His presentation is part of the symposium " Weird Life . "
" Life as we know it appears to have had a single common ancestor , yet , could life on Earth have started many times ?
Might it exist on Earth today in extreme environments and remain undetected because our techniques are customized to the biochemistry of known life ? " asks Davies , who also is the director of the BEYOND Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science at Arizona State University in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .
In the lecture , Davies will present , challenge and extend some of the conclusions from a July 2007 report by the National Research Council .
That report looked at whether the search for life should include " weird life " – described by the Council as " life with an alternative biochemistry to that of life on Earth . "
" If a biochemically weird microorganism should be discovered , its status as evidence for a second genesis , as opposed to a new branch on our own tree of life , will depend on how fundamentally it differs from known life , " wrote Davies in the Nov. 19 , 2007 , issue of Scientific American .
Davies and other pioneers who speculate that life on Earth may have started many times are wondering " why we have overlooked this idea for so long ? "
The concept of a shadow biosphere , according to Davies , " is still just a theory .
If someone discovers shadow life or weird life it will be the biggest sensation in biology since Darwin .
We are simply saying , ' Why not let 's take a look for it ? '
It does n't cost much ( compared to looking for weird life on Mars , say ) , and , it might be right under our noses . "
Davies , whose research is steeped in the branches of physics that deal with quantum gravity – an attempt to reconcile theories of the very large and the very small – is a prolific author ( 27 books , both popular and specialty works ) and is a provocative speaker ( he delivered the 1995 Templeton Prize address after receiving the prestigious award for initiating " a new dialogue between science and religion that is having worldwide repercussions " ) .
Among his books are : " How to Build a Time Machine , " " The Origin of Life , " " The Big Questions , " " The Last Three Minutes , " " The Mind of God , " " The Cosmic Blueprint " and his most recent book " The Goldilocks Enigma :
Why is the universe just right for life ? " published in the United States under the title " Cosmic Jackpot . "
He is putting the finishing touches on " The Eerie Silence , " to be published in 2010 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the SETI Institute .
According to Davies , the book is " a comprehensive fresh look at the entire SETI enterprise . "

Deep in the deluge of knowledge that poured forth from science in the 20th century were found ironclad limits on what we can know .
Werner Heisenberg discovered that improved precision regarding , say , an object ’s position inevitably degraded the level of certainty of its momentum .
Kurt Gödel showed that within any formal mathematical system advanced enough to be useful , it is impossible to use the system to prove every true statement that it contains .
And Alan Turing demonstrated that one cannot , in general , determine if a computer algorithm is going to halt .
David H. Wolpert , a physics - trained computer scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center , has chimed in with his version of a knowledge limit .
Because of it , he concludes , the universe lies beyond the grasp of any intellect , no matter how powerful , that could exist within the universe .
Specifically , during the past two years , he has been refining a proof that no matter what laws of physics govern a universe , there are inevitably facts about the universe that its inhabitants cannot learn by experiment or predict with a computation .
Philippe M. Binder , a physicist at the University of Hawaii at Hilo , suggests that the theory implies researchers seeking unified laws cannot hope for anything better than a “ theory of almost everything . ”
Wolpert ’s work is an effort to create a formal rigorous description of processes such as measuring a quantity , observing a phenomenon , predicting a system ’s future state or remembering past information — a description that is general enough to be independent of the laws of physics .
He observes that all those processes share a common basic structure : something must be configured ( whether it be an experimental apparatus or a computer to run a simulation ) ; a question about the universe must be specified ; and an answer ( right or wrong ) must be supplied .
He models that general structure by defining a class of mathematical entities that he calls inference devices .
The inference devices act on a set of possible universes .
For instance , our universe , meaning the entire world line of our universe over all time and space , could be a member of the set of all possible such universes permitted by the same rules that govern ours .
Nothing needs to be specified about those rules in Wolpert ’s analysis .
All that matters is that the various possible inference devices supply answers to questions in each universe .
In a universe similar to ours , an inference device may involve a set of digital scales that you will stand on at noon tomorrow and the question relate to your mass at that time .
People may also be inference devices or parts of one .
Wolpert proves that in any such system of universes , quantities exist that cannot be ascertained by any inference device inside the system .
Thus , the “ demon ” hypothesized by Pierre - Simon Laplace in the early 1800s ( give the demon the exact positions and velocities of every particle in the universe , and it will compute the future state of the universe ) is stymied if the demon must be a part of the universe .
Researchers have proved results about the incomputability of specific physical systems before .
Wolpert points out that his result is far more general , in that it makes virtually no assumptions about the laws of physics and it requires no limits on the computational power of the inference device other than it must exist within the universe in question .
In addition , the result applies not only to predictions of a physical system ’s future state but also to observations of a present state and examining a record of a past state .
The theorem ’s proof , similar to the results of Gödel ’s incompleteness theorem and Turing ’s halting problem , relies on a variant of the liar ’s paradox — ask Laplace ’s demon to predict the following yes / no fact about the future state of the universe : “ Will the universe not be one in which your answer to this question is yes ? ”
For the demon , seeking a true yes / no answer is like trying to determine the truth of “ This statement is false . ”
Knowing the exact current state of the entire universe , knowing all the laws governing the universe and having unlimited computing power is no help to the demon in saying truthfully what its answer will be .
In a sense , however , the existence of such a paradox is not exactly earth - shattering .
As Scott Aaronson , a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , puts it : “ That your predictions about the universe are fundamentally constrained by you yourself being part of the universe you ’re predicting , always seemed pretty obvious to me — and I doubt Laplace himself would say otherwise if we could ask him . ”
Aaronson does allow , though , that it is “ often a useful exercise to spell out all the assumptions behind an idea , recast everything in formal notation and think through the implications in detail , ” as Wolpert has done .
After all , the devil , or demon , is in the details .

One of California ’s largest utility companies , Southern California Edison , says it ’s reached an agreement on “ the world ’s largest solar deal ” with Oakland - based solar thermal company BrightSource Energy .
The deal is for 1.3 GW across seven projects , the first of which will be built in Ivanpah , Calif .
That is quite a bit bigger than the already huge deal BrightSource has with northern California utility Pacific Gas & Electric to build a potential 900MW of power from five large solar thermal plants .
BrightSource is actually developing the plant in Ivanpah to accommodate 300 MW for its PG&E deal and another 100 MW for its SCE contract , says BrightSource ’sPG&E ’s Keely Wachs , senior director of corporate communications .
In total , BrightSource has 4.2 GW of solar sites under development , Wachs says .
Of course , developing 4.2 GW of solar power in the deserts of California takes massive funds — the five plants with PG&E will cost up to $ 3 billion .
The SCE deal could cost more than that .
Plus it is not a good time to be trying to raise financing for solar plants .
Reuters had reported that BrightSource had n’t secured financing for its first plant for the deal with PG&E and was waiting for funds from the stimulus package before starting construction .
The company has raised more than $ 160 million , including a massive $ 115 million Series C round announced in May .
Investors include Google.org , BP Alternative Energy , StatoilHydro Venture , Black River , VantagePoint Venture Partners , Morgan Stanley , DBL Investors , Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Chevron Technology Ventures .
However BrightSource ’s contract with SCE highlights the fact that this firm is still pulling in some big deals while others are pulling back due to the recession .
BrightSource uses a central power tower design , which includes an array of mirrors that reflect the sun ’s light onto a central receiver full of water , creating steam and powering a turbine .
Massive solar farms also take a long time to get regulatory approval .
BrightSource had been facing possible regulatory delays for its first projects and had been attending hearings on how to streamline the approval process .
The first plant in Ivanpah for SCE is n’t expected to be operating until early 2013 .
UK CCTV camera numbers are thought to be among the world 's highest British people have been " careless " with their civil liberties , but that is beginning to change , former shadow home affairs minister David Davis has said .
Speaking at the Convention on Modern Liberty on Saturday , Mr Davis said people were growing increasingly angry at government intrusion in their lives .
More than 1,000 people joined the event in London and at venues across the UK .
Other speakers included former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg and Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti .
Gatherings were also be held in Belfast , Bristol , Cambridge , Cardiff , Glasgow and Manchester to debate issues such as the " database state " , counter - terrorism laws and press freedom .
' Being alienated '
Mr Davis , who resigned from the Conservative front bench last year to fight a by - election on the issue of civil liberties , said the British public had been " casual " with their freedom and privacy in the past .
" They treat it carelessly , like a very old suit that they have had a very long time , [ but ] times are changing .
" Something is happening in the hearts and minds of our country . "
People feel the fear of terrorism is being used to take away a lot of rights
Helena Kennedy QC
Human rights lawyer and life peer Mr Davis said policies like ID cards and detention without trial for terror suspects were initially popular with the electorate , but were now drawing widespread opposition .
Others speaking at the convention agreed with him .
Human rights lawyer and life peer Helena Kennedy QC , said communities were " being alienated " by the increased use of anti-terror laws beyond their original remit .
" There is a general feeling that in creating a climate of fear people have been writing a blank cheque to government , " she said .
" People feel the fear of terrorism is being used to take away a lot of rights . "
She added that people were " fearful of the general business of collecting too much information about individuals " .
Also speaking to the London event was Mr Begg .
He was asked about fellow detainee Binyam Mohamed , who was released from Guantanamo and returned to Britain this week .
Mr Mohamed claims he was tortured while in US custody - and with UK knowledge - and Mr Begg said he was " eager to pursue justice " for his alleged treatment .
" He does not want to talk about the torture , which I understand because it was much worse for him than it was for the rest of us , " he said .
" But there is clearly a feeling in his mind that he has a duty to speak out for those that remain behind but also to expose the secret detention process . "
Mr Begg said it was " time to look right in our back yard " at Britain 's role in the alleged mistreatment of terror suspects .
We have to accept that society and life carries risk
Dominic Grieve
Shadow justice secretary ' Finite limits '
Shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve also spoke to the London audience , arguing that the government 's desire to control risk in society was " destroying our quality of life " .
" We have to accept that society and life carries risk and whilst it is the duty of the state to do its best to moderate and prevent what is wrong , nevertheless there are finite limits , " he said .
" We , as citizens , have to make this clear to government , we are prepared consciously as adults to accept some element of risk in order to be free . "
The government 's plans to extend the period terrorist suspects can be held before being charged led to a large Labour rebellion last year - and prompted Mr Davis 's resignation .
They were later shelved following a heavy defeat in the House of Lords .
Last week the Liberal Democrats unveiled their " Freedom Bill " and pledged a review of the use of CCTV cameras , the abolition of ID cards and control orders for terrorism suspects .
And earlier this month the Lords constitution committee warned that electronic surveillance and collection of personal data were " pervasive " in British society and threatened to undermine democracy .
Last year Gordon Brown defended the use of CCTV , ID cards and the DNA database in a speech on civil liberties - saying they helped ensure people 's right to live free from crime .

What is Vitamin B ?
( OrganicJar ) A new study conducted by the National Institutes of Health found taking B vitamins can prevent age - related macular degeneration , which is the leading cause of blindness in people 65 and older , with nearly 2 million Americans affected .
A seven year study involving more than 5,000 women ages 40 and older who took a combination of B vitamins ( B6 , folic acid and B12 ) found there was a reduced risk of macular degeneration by more than one - third .
Allen Taylor , director of the Laboratory for Nutrition and Vision Research at Tufts University in Boston , said the study was strong because patients were assigned at random and followed for a long time .
But because the findings were teased out of a larger experiment for heart disease , there was n't strict categorization of the type and severity of the eye disease .
There are actually eight vitamins that make up the vitamin B complex : B - 1 ( Thiamine ) , B - 2 ( Riboflavin ) , B - 3 ( Niacin ) , B - 4 ( Pantothenic acid ) , B - 6 ( Pyridoxine and Pyridoxamine ) , B - 7 ( Biotin ) , B - 9 ( Folic acid ) , B - 12 ( Cyanocobalamin ) Vitamin B can also help with : cardiovascular health , improve energy , boost metabolic function , prevent depression , promote skin and muscle tone , and boost the immune and nervous systems .
Foods that are high in vitamin B include : brewer 's yeast , bananas , potatoes , lentils , chili peppers , nuts , leafy vegetables , spinach , and meats including turkey , tuna , and liver .
When I 'm not able to eat the above foods , I personally take a food based complete B - Complex vitamin by Rainbow Light .
Would enjoy hearing what other vitamins / foods you eat to get your vitamin B’s .

American states spent about $ 52 billion on corrections last year , the vast majority of it on prisons , and that 's not smart , the Pew Center on the States said in a report released Monday .
As a cost saving measure in a time of fiscal crisis at the statehouses , states should instead emphasize spending on community corrections .
overcrowding at Mule Creek State Prison ( cdcr.ca.gov )
The study , 1 in 31 : The Long Reach of American Corrections , reported that one in every 31 Americans is in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
That 's more than 7 million people under state supervision , and that 's more than double the rate 25 years ago .
The report adds that the real figure may be closer to 8 million because the numbers do n't include people under state supervision in pre-trial diversion programs , such as drug courts .
The rates of correctional control vary by race and geography .
One in eleven black adults ( 9.2 % ) are enjoying the tender mercies of the state , compared to one in 27 Hispanics ( 3.7 % ) and one in 45 whites ( 2.2 % ) .
With one of every 13 adults behind bars or on probation or parole , Georgia has the highest percentage of its population under surveillance , followed by Idaho , Texas , Massachusetts , Ohio , and the District of Columbia .
" Violent and career criminals need to be locked up , and for a long time .
But our research shows that prisons are housing too many people who can be managed safely and held accountable in the community at far lower cost , " said Adam Gelb , director of the Center 's Public Safety Performance Project , which produced the report .
But while prisons account for about 90 % of the overall correction budget in the states , two - thirds of offenders are on probation or parole , not behind bars .
Pressures to cut community corrections spending in the current crisis are penny wise but pound foolish , said the report .
" New community supervision strategies and technologies need to be strengthened and expanded , not scaled back , " Gelb argued .
" Cutting them may appear to save a few dollars , but it does n't .
It will fuel the cycle of more crime , more victims , more arrests , more prosecutions , and still more imprisonment . "
The study recommended that states :
Sort offenders by risk to public safety to determine appropriate levels of supervision ;
Base intervention programs on sound research about what works to reduce recidivism ;
Harness advances in supervision technology such as electronic monitoring and rapid - result alcohol and drug tests ;
Impose swift and certain sanctions for offenders who break the rules of their release but who do not commit new crimes ; and
Create incentives for offenders and supervision agencies to succeed , and monitor their performance .
The report did not address the role of drug prohibition in swelling the nation 's prison population , nor did it question whether drug offenders should be arrested in the first place , let alone placed under state surveillance or imprisoned .
Researchers have found evidence suggesting that stars rich in carbon complex molecules may form at the center of our Milky Way galaxy - and it helps solve a mystery .
Namely , why have telescopes never detected carbon - rich stars at the center of our galaxy even though they have found these stars in other places ?
This discovery is also significant because it adds to our knowledge of how stars form heavy elements like oxygen , carbon and iron and and then blow them out across the universe , making it possible for life to develop .
The team of scientists analyzed the light emitted from 40 planetary nebulae – blobs of dust and gas surrounding stars -- using Spitzer 's infrared spectrograph .
They analyzed 26 nebulae toward the center of the Milky Way -- a region called the " Galactic Bulge " -- and 14 nebulae in other parts of the galaxy .
The scientists found a large amount of crystalline silicates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , two substances that indicate the presence of oxygen and carbon .
The " Cat ’s Eye " nebula , or NGC 6543 , is a well - studied example of a " planetary nebula . "
Such objects are the glowing remnants of dust and gas expelled from moderate - sized stars during their last stages of life .
Our own sun will generate such a nebula in about five billion years .
NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope has studied many such planetary nebulae in infrared light , including a variety of more distant ones , which have helped scientists identify a population of carbon - bearing stars near our galaxy 's center .
The infrared emission from the Cat's Eye is generated by a variety of elements and molecules .
The bright inner region of this nebula shows a complex structure reminiscent of a feline eye .
Outside this compact region lies a series of other structures representing material that was ejected slightly earlier in the central star 's life , when it was a giant star .
The image is a composite of data from Spitzer ’s infrared array camera .
Light with a wavelength of 3.6 microns is rendered as blue , 5.8 microns is displayed as green and 8.0 microns is represented in red .
The brightness of the central area has been greatly reduced to make it possible to maintain its visibility while enhancing the brightness of the much fainter outer features .
Overall colors have been enhanced to better show slight variations in hue .
Credit : NASA / JPLThis combination is unusual .
In the Milky Way , dust that combines both oxygen and carbon is rare and is usually only found surrounding a binary system of stars .
The research team , however , found that the presence of the carbon - oxygen dust in the Galactic Bulge seems to be suggestive of a recent change of chemistry experienced by the star .
" The dust surrounding the stars emits very strongly at infrared wavelengths , " says Pedro García - Lario , a research team member who is on the faculty of the European Space Astronomy Center , the European Space Agency 's center for space science .
He co-authored a paper on this subject in the February 2009 issue of the journal Astronomy &Astrophysics .
The scientists hypothesize that as the central star of a planetary nebula ages and dies , its heavier elements do not make their way to the star 's outer layers , as they do in other stars .
Only in the last moments of the central star 's life , when it expands and then violently expels almost all of its remaining outer gasses , does the carbon become detectable .
That 's when astronomers see it in the nebula surrounding the star .
" The carbon produced through these recurrent ' thermal pulses ' is very inefficiently dredged up to the surface of the star , contrary to what is observed in low - metallicity , galactic disk stars , " said García - Lario .
" It only becomes visible when the star is about to die .
" This study supports a hypothesis about why the carbon in some stars does not make its way to the stars ' surfaces .
Scientists believe that small stars -- those with masses up to one - and - a - half times that of our sun -- that contain lots of metal do not bring carbon to their surfaces as they age .
Stars in the Galactic Bulge tend to have more metals than other stars , so the Spitzer data support this commonly held hypothesis .
Before the Spitzer study , this hypothesis had never been supported by observation .
This aging and expelling process is typical of all stars .
As stars age and die , they burn progressively heavier and heavier elements , beginning with hydrogen and ending with iron .
Towards the end of their lives , some stars become what are called " red giants . "
These dying stars swell so large that if one of them were placed in our solar system , where the sun is now , its outermost border would touch Earth 's orbit .
As these stars pulsate – losing mass in the process – and then contract , they spew out almost all of their heavier elements .
These elements are the building blocks of all planets , including our own Earth ( as well as of human beings and any other life forms that may exist in the universe ) .

Prof. Marshall Grossman has come to expect complaints whenever he returns graded papers in his English classes at the University of Maryland .
“ Many students come in with the conviction that they ’ve worked hard and deserve a higher mark , ” Professor Grossman said .
“ Some assert that they have never gotten a grade as low as this before . ”
He attributes those complaints to his students ’ sense of entitlement .
“ I tell my classes that if they just do what they are supposed to do and meet the standard requirements , that they will earn a C , ” he said .
“ That is the default grade .
They see the default grade as an A . ”
A recent study by researchers at the University of California , Irvine , found that a third of students surveyed said that they expected B ’s just for attending lectures , and 40 percent said they deserved a B for completing the required reading .

Liberation theology is alive and well in Belem , Brazil .
Where ?
Did you say Davos , Switzerland , where 2,500 economic movers and shakers recently concluded their annual meeting of World Economic Forum at a cost of a quarter million dollars apiece ?
( Pricey vacation in these troubled times . )
No , I said Belem , Brazil , where the World Social Forum , the antidote to Davos , gathered over 100,000 social activists and academics for 1,500 workshops and presentations in late January .
Get out your map : Belem is in the north of Brazil , in the state of Para , part of the Amazon region which occupies a space four times the size of Germany , with Greece tossed in for good measure .
More than two thousand indigenous people came for the Forum , some travelling a week on the Amazon .
Apparently , CNN does not do mosquito nets or endangered rainforests , preferring the picturesque ski runs of Davos for winter holidays .
So , news on this remarkable gathering was scarce .
You read it first here .
Bodies Do n’t Lie
The religious action was at the World Forum on Theology and Liberation , an international group that provides “ an ecumenical space , dialogical and plural , embracing differences . ”
It convenes every two years just prior to the World Social Forum ( Porto Alegre , Brazil in 2005 ; Nairobi , Kenya in 2007 ) so that progressive religious people can contribute to the global conversation .
This year more than 600 theologians , religious activists , and colleagues from all over the world met to discuss “ Water , Earth , Theology for Another Possible World . ”
While we did not solve the major problems of ecocide , we did bring the wisdom of our respective traditions and the will of our theo - political constituencies to bear .
Most important , we learned a lot that graduate programs do not teach .
The theological meeting and the Social Forum were enlivened and enriched by the presence of indigenous people from dozens of countries .
Each day began with a ritual and plenary input .
Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff offered a new theological paradigm , given the ecological crisis made vivid in the ailing Amazon region .
Such grand plans are hard to imagine without leaving aside the particularities that shape real lives , but the effort is useful insofar as it demonstrates the enormity of the task and the paucity of current theological resources to do the job .
Womanist theologian Emilie Townes provided ethical and spiritual insights on the fate of the earth , citing Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans as a prototype of eco-disasters and the inadequate human responses to them .
South African theologian Steve DeGruchy made it all even more concrete in his theological discourse on human bodily wastes .
He argued that how communities dispose of their excrement demonstrates the widening gaps between rich ( with sewers ) and poor ( without ) , between those who are attended to and those who attend to others ’ most basic needs .
The audience got the point .
Eco-theological dimensions of embodiment were the third focal point .
Korean American theologian Chung Hyun Kyung called ecofeminist liberation theology , beginning with indigenous voices , a way to cooperate with divine creativity .
She urged a theological epistemology of speaking the unspeakable .
I was next .
Arguing that “ bodies do n’t lie , ” I urged liberationists to deal concretely with tough issues lest we fall into macro abstractions in our zeal for change .
I urged us to look where we do n’t want to look — at women making reproductive decisions , at queer people living under oppression , at people with disabilities whose needs ought to set the community standards .
Until and unless we tackle these matters of daily life that the Vatican and others would have us postpone , we will not be in any position to take on ecological and economic matters with any trustworthiness or integrity among ourselves , much less abroad .
Theology Happens
This was not an academic conference with a tidy program and neat results .
Like the World Social Forum , the real work of the meeting went on in workshops , over coffee , in strategy sessions and caucuses every rainy afternoon in a rather ad hoc way .
The unmet need for translation was sometimes a barrier , but in general people found one another and theologizing happened .
Most of us were housed in simple accommodations an hour ’s ride from the meeting venue , so we had plenty of time on buses and at meals to get acquainted .
By sheer chance , I had the privilege of living with the folks from Amerindia , “ a network of Catholics in the Americas with ecumenical spirit , open to interfaith dialogue and cooperation with other institutions . ”
These theologians , activists , pastoral and base community leaders from Peru , Argentina , Uruguay , Chile , Colombia , the Dominican Republic , and more were typical of the people who attended the theological event .
They stayed on for the Social Forum — better ambassadors from the world of religion than any Catholic Church officials I can imagine .
Such meetings always include exposure to the local reality — lest liberation theology be done in a vacuum .
This was no exception .
My group visited a family - run recycling project where printer cartridges are collected for reuse and old newspapers are turned into art supply paper by hand .
We went to the local garbage dump and met with people who make their living gathering the plastic , glass , and other recyclables to resell .
There we faced a conundrum of ecology and development : if we live with less and reuse more , how will these people now at the very margins live at all ?
It is like the sweatshop problem : if you work in a garbage dump you aspire to a job in a sweatshop the way privileged children hope to go to college .
What happens when the sweatshops close ?
No wonder we need divine inspiration to think about these matters .
Divine intervention might be more appropriate .
At least we have liberation theology .
It ’s no substitute , but at least it is something more than the fundamentalist Bible - thumping that is so common .
We finished up in a small community where women grow medicinal plants — ironic since the big pharmaceutical companies have all but ravaged the Amazon in their quest for plants that make medicines like Ben - Gay .
These women are learning and teaching their children how to cultivate plants that will soothe and heal .
I noted that their chapel was dedicated to Saint Ann , the mother of Mary , with plenty of statues of the Blessed Virgin and nary a sign of Jesus .
Maybe there is something to Chung Hyun Kyung ’s ideas about female imagery , ideas that stress their life - giving , not death - dealing , ways .
Nothing happens in Brazil without music , so there was plenty of that every day at the Forum .
Politicians are popular so we even had a few of those .
Amazon Senator Maria Silva , a collaborator with the late Chico Mendes ( murdered in 1988 by ranchers who opposed his efforts to organize rubber tappers ) , spoke convincingly of the need for sustainable development and the protection of a biodiverse Amazon .
She was the first rubber tapper elected to the Brazilian senate , and served as Minister for the Environment from 2003 - 2008 .
Hearing her touch on liberation theology provided a ray of hope that what we are about might just be useful .
She was a reminder of Sister Dorothy Stang , SND , an American - born nun who spent thirty years in Brazil until she was murdered in 2005 for her stalwart defense of poor people and their land .
Her image and spirit infused the gathering .
Theology Without a License
The final word came from the African feminist theologian Mercy Oduyoye , who summed up the event in a lyrical , literate , and liberating letter to her nine - year - old granddaughter that deserves wide dissemination .
In the letter she tells the child that we had come together to explore diversity and sustainability , migration , and climate change , all from fully embodied perspectives .
Those formerly on the margins must take center stage with women , indigenous people , and those with disabilities leading the way .
We do n’t need a license to do theology , she counsels the youngster , only courage .
The closing ceremony brought her words alive in chanting , drumming , and dancing led by indigenous people from around the world .
As we blessed the directions and bowed to the powers of creation , I was struck by how far liberation theology has come .
From its origins in Latin America in the 1970s to the global movement it is now , liberation theology has grown through a balkanized period when each region had its own agenda to the beginnings of a common agenda set by the needs of the world — not by the particularities of any faith tradition .
The predominantly Roman Catholic roots have spread to other Christian denominations , and even to Judaism and Islam .
Now we are coming to understand and appreciate the deep echoes in indigenous approaches that pre-date liberation theology by centuries .
It is a good thing we have such resources now , because the ecological crisis cannot be ignored .
From the failing “ lungs of the planet , ” as the Amazon region is known , it is clear that Earth is on life support .
Theology can offer one more way for people to connect , collaborate , and change .
It is not the final answer , but liberation theology presents as helpful a set of questions as have come out of the world ’s religions in some time .

The first casualty of the financial collapse has been the claim that “ there is no alternative ” to unrestricted free market capitalism .
The imperialist governments are bankrolling imperilled banks and industrial conglomerates with immense bailouts — an estimated $ 5.1 trillion in the US alone by November 2008 — while preparing “ stimulus ” packages aimed at restoring financial markets . [ 1 ]
The “ stimulus ” includes potentially useful projects along with many that are far more dubious .
But urgently needed social investment , such as housing or a national daycare program , receives scant consideration .
The spending is shaped to restore corporate profitability , not to sustain workers ’ livelihoods .
Thus , the US government ’s auto industry bailout is conditional on wages and working conditions in union - organised plants being cut to match non-union operations , and Canada ’s federal government has set similar conditions .
In Canada , mass layoffs are spreading through the economy but unemployment insurance provides benefits to only half the jobless .
The recent federal “ stimulus ” budget did nothing to change that
‘ Stimulus ’ serves profits , not human needs
Around the world , governments are spending hundreds of billions to protect profits but only pennies on reducing greenhouse - gas emissions .
No consideration is being given to the comprehensive structural changes required to counter global warming .
No action is proposed to deal with the Alberta Tar Sands operation , the world ’s most ecologically destructive project .
In the Global South , the capitalist crash has triggered what Adam Hanieh has termed a “ deadly mix of capital outflows , high inflation , and drops in export earnings . ” [ 2 ]
The weaker countries are paying by far the highest price for the breakdown in the capitalist heartlands .
As the crash deepens , the US government and its allies are extending their war drive against peoples of the Global South .
The Obama administration has promised a major escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
All of the imperialist countries , with Canada in the lead , gave full backing to the genocidal Israeli assault on Gaza .
As Hanieh notes , the crash presses capitalism toward a “ more hardened , authoritarian state , ” “ increasingly virulent racism , ” and “ more war and military repression . ”
Consistent with this pattern , the initial response in Canada to the crash by the Conservative Party government of Stephen Harper was to incite a wave of chauvinism against the Québécois people . [ 3 ]
Harper ’s unqualified support of the Israeli slaughter in Gaza mirrors his colonial agenda for the racially and nationally oppressed and impoverished Indigenous peoples within Canada ’s borders . [ 4 ]
Amid all the talk in Ottawa of economic stimulus , nothing has been heard about the urgent humanitarian effort needed to remedy calamitous social conditions in Indigenous communities , be it black mould infections in western housing , water poisoning in the east , or job and health care crises in the north .
Ottawa continues its long - standing policy of slow death or assimilation for its colonial subjects .
Anti-imperialist resistance
In the months since the economic crisis broke , the most effective resistance to capitalist attacks has come from anti-imperialist governments in Latin America and from the struggles of the Palestinian people .
The countries of the ALBA alliance in Latin America responded to the financial collapse with a plan for increased economic integration , including a regional currency .
[ 5 ]
Cuba , Venezuela , and Bolivia , the leading architects of ALBA , also stood out in their forthright condemnations and actions against the Israeli assault in Gaza .
Their leaders have proclaimed the truth that there is no solution to the problems of humankind short of the abolition of capitalism .
The slaughter in Gaza has created indescribable hardship and misery for the people there , but they are emerging from the wreckage unbowed .
The Palestinian people were supported by the largest international antiwar protests since the launch of the Iraq war six years ago .
These recent events confirm the judgment expressed by Socialist Voice in a statement by its editors in June 2007 : “ The dramatic advances of the Venezuelan revolution and … other insurgent peoples and governments resisting imperialism , are creating a historic opportunity to strengthen international anti-imperialist collabouration and rebuild the revolutionary socialist movement internationally . ” ( see “ Venezuela and the International Struggle for Socialism . ” )
The 2007 statement outlined the lessons of mass struggles in Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America for the world movement for socialism .
Labour shifts to the right
Canada ’s trade unions and the labour - aligned New Democratic Party ( NDP ) have reacted to the crisis by shifting to the right .
The NDP reached a temporary deal for a coalition government with the Liberal Party , one of the twin parties of capitalist rule in Canada for a century .
That deal has now collapsed , with the Liberals choosing instead an alliance with the Conservative government .
Yet a coalition with the Liberals still stands as the avowed goal of the NDP — what party leader Jack Layton , speaking on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) radio January 25 , called the “ bold plan that we need in this country . ”
As part of the original coalition deal , the NDP ceased public opposition to Canada ’s war in Afghanistan . [ 6 ]
It failed to counter Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s and Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff ’s support for the Israeli slaughter in Gaza .
The NDP leadership has yet to speak out on these critical issues . [ 7 ]
The Liberals are a tested instrument of big - business rule .
A succession of Liberal governments in the 1990s and 2000s waged deep - going assaults on living standards , social programs and democratic rights .
They took Canada into war in Afghanistan and maintained a close alliance with Israel .
Labour and its allies cannot mount effective opposition to capitalist assaults and imperialist oppression if they are shackled to such a party or to a government it would lead .
Support for the Liberals is sometimes justified on the grounds that they represent the “ lesser evil ” — that their policies , while bad , are not as harmful as those of the Conservatives .
That logic allows the capitalists to define the permissible options .
As the US socialist Peter Camejo once joked , “ if they want us to vote for Mussolini , they need only put him up against Hitler ” .
“ Lesser evilism ” blocks working people from setting their sights on a humane and just world and advancing an independent program to that end .
The challenge of the NDP
Programmatically , the NDP is a capitalist party .
The provincial governments it has formed have differed little from Liberal or Conservative governments .
The NDP leadership is loyal and devoted to Canada ’s colonialist - imperialist state .
But the NDP is also a political movement that was founded by the trade unions and left - wing activists .
It has never been considered as an acceptable choice for federal government by the Canadian ruling class .
The NDP ’s stated program , however inadequate , echoes that of the unions that form its main institutional support .
Its supporters share aspirations for a more just society .
If pressed to the limit , the coalition perspective will put in question the NDP ’s survival as an instrument , however weak , of labour political action .
The NDP ’s strategy of parliamentary action to humanise capitalism is a dead end for workers and oppressed peoples in Canada .
But the challenge before workers is to strengthen their capacity for political action , not to passively accept losing what now exists through subordination to the Liberals .
That would be yet another setback for a labour movement that is already in a defensive and historically weak position .
Socialists should therefore engage in the debate over the NDP ’s future , particularly in the unions .
We should press for the party to break from the Liberals and the capitalist class and to defend a workers ’ agenda .
Ending the long retreat
Through more than two decades of capitalist attacks , working people in Canada have been on the defensive .
Unions have lost members and strength , social programs have diminished , and repressive and racist policies have gained ground .
The challenge today is to wage effective , broad - based struggles for immediate gains that can help end the retreat and inspire working people with new hope and confidence .
This will be achieved not through deals with capitalist parties but through independent struggles that can shift the relationship of forces .
Such struggles can open the possibility of challenging capitalist rule and establishing a government of working people and the oppressed that can abolish capitalism .
There is no way to foresee what issues and struggles will spark such a movement .
However , we can already identify central themes of a socialist agenda in Canada as the capitalist crisis unfolds :
No government handouts to capitalist profiteers .
Governments should take control of imperilled enterprises as a basis for planned economic recovery and ecological protection .
The environmentally and socially destructive Alberta tar sands must be shut down , with full protection of displaced workers ’ livelihoods .
Protect the victims of capitalism ’s crisis through support to the unemployed , education and retraining opportunities for displaced workers , and improvements to other social programs .
Raise minimum wages and social assistance rates .
Focus government “ stimulus ” spending on education , health care , social services , social housing and ecology infrastructure .
Decent homes for all .
Draw the entire population into a democratically planned transition to an ecologically sound and sustainable economy .
Abolish restrictive anti-labour legislation and protect striking workers from replacement or dismissal .
Adopt new laws to assist workers in joining trade unions and achieving collective agreements .
Take action to assist victims of racial and national oppression .
Defend all victims of gender - based oppression .
End restrictions on immigration and grant full legal rights to all residents of Canada .
End violations of civil liberties and human rights enacted as part of a phoney “ war on terror . ”
Take emergency action to eliminate the calamitous social and economic conditions forced on Indigenous peoples by Canadian colonialism .
Unconditional support for Indigenous sovereignty and the fight for an end to Canadian colonialism .
( See Mike Krebs , For the Land , PDF ) Self - determination and sovereignty for Quebec .
Oppose Canadian imperialism .
End Canada ’s war in Afghanistan and its support to the Israeli - led genocide against the Palestinians .
For boycott , divestment and sanctions against the apartheid Israeli state .
Cancel the Third World debt , and cancel pro-imperialist trade treaties .
Make Canadian technological and resources available to help break the cycle of imperialist - imposed poverty .
Support freedom struggles around the world , including the initiatives of Cuba , Venezuela , Bolivia , and their partners in the ALBA alliance to build an alternative to neoliberal devastation .
Press labour and its allies , including the NDP , to break with the capitalist ruling class and enter onto a road of struggle for a workers ’ and farmers ’ government .
The road ahead
The goals outlined here are not unique to Socialist Voice — they are shared by others in Canada and abroad .
They grow out of the underlying need for revolutionary socialists to find each other , voice their views , collabourate and give life to their ideas through joint commitment to today ’s struggles .
Promoting this objective is the purpose of Socialist Voice .
In this way , we seek to advance the goal of creating an inclusive and effective organisation of struggle for revolutionary socialism .
We aim to join forces with the many activists in labour and anti-imperialist movements who seek an independent path of struggle by working people and the oppressed .
It is through such struggles that our proposals will be sounded , tested , and proven .

Mr Mills denies taking a bribe from Mr Berlusconi An Italian court has found British tax lawyer David Mills guilty of accepting a bribe of about £ 400,000 from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
Mills , the estranged husband of UK Olympics minister Tessa Jowell , was sentenced to four - and - a - half years in jail at a court in Milan .
Mills , 64 , was not in court and is expected to appeal .
Mr Berlusconi , who last year passed a law making himself immune from prosecution , has denied paying a bribe .
In a statement , Mills said he was " very disappointed " at the verdict .
" I am innocent , but this is a highly political case , " he said .
" The judges have not yet given their reasons for their decision , so I cannot say how they dealt with the prosecutor 's own admission that he had no proof .
" I am hopeful that the verdict and sentence will be set aside on appeal and am told that I will have excellent grounds . "
Although we are separated , I have never doubted his innocence
Olympics minister Tessa Jowell
Mr Mills ' estranged wife
A New Labour ' golden couple ' ' Terrible blow '
The court heard Mills had accepted the money in return for giving false testimony in two corruption trials involving the Italian prime minister .
Prosecutors say Mills then used the money to help pay off a joint mortgage he held with his wife .
Ms Jowell was cleared of any wrongdoing after an investigation by UK parliamentary officials .
Following the verdict , she said : " This is a terrible blow to David and , although we are separated , I have never doubted his innocence . "
Mills was one of Mr Berlusconi 's consultants on offshore tax havens .
The prosecution alleged the prime minister paid him for not revealing details of offshore companies during two previous trials in 1997 and 1998 , in which the lawyer gave evidence as an expert witness .
The charges stemmed from a letter which Mills sent to a British accountant in 2004 in which he said the £ 400,000 payment came from " Mr B " .
He wrote that he had not lied , but had " turned some very tricky corners , to put it mildly " and had " kept Mr B out of a great deal of trouble that I would have landed him in had I said all I knew " .
Mills initially admitted having received money from Mr Berlusconi " in recognition " of the evidence he gave , but later said the money had come from someone else .
Controversial law Mr Berlusconi has denied making any such payment to Mr Mills .
Mr Berlusconi introduced an immunity law soon after taking office in 2008
After being swept into power for a third time last April , Mr Berlusconi proposed a controversial law granting legal immunity to the four most senior office holders in Italy , which includes the post of prime minister .
The bill was passed by both houses of parliament , with supporters arguing that the amendment was needed to allow the top state officials to focus on doing their jobs without legal distraction .
When he leaves office , Mr Berlusconi may become subject to the charges again , as long as they have not expired under Italy 's statute of limitations .

Michael Phelps : Sacrificial Pawn For Greedy Pigs At The Top
So the U.S swim team has jumped on the conservative propaganda bandwagon and suspended Michael Phelps due to his pot smoking .
I ’m really curious as to why this is , considering marijuana can in no way be considered a sport performance enhancing drug .
Caffeine by all means is a lot more performance enhancing .
Hell , if you want to go even further , carbohydrates are a more performance enhancing substance than marijuana can ever be .
The swim team however decides to say screw common sense , reason , and the ever growing open public support for Phelps ( and therefore obviously marijuana itself ) in this case .
Why would the swim team care what substance someone puts in their body as long as it ’s not classified as performance enhancing ?
Why do n’t they also test for caffeine ?
If they want to be fair and non hypocritical idiots they should .
Why do n’t they test for alcohol or nicotine ?
Oh I see , they government says they ’re fine because even though they ’re umpteen times more damaging to your body and potentially people around you , they make money off the sale , and many folks in Washington are in bed with those execs of the legal drug industry .
As we all know , money in your pocket is more important than the life and well being of someone else .
You see , I feel that if a sports team is so concerned about someone using illegal drugs , should n’t they also be concerned about them using legal ones also that are proven to do bodily harm such as nicotine and alcohol .
Does that make sense or no ?
Look at it this way , as a team with vested interest in the health of its athletes ( or so they claim ) , that kind of action is something they should in fact do .
By their logic for this suspension , why should a coach spend time on training an athlete to be their very best if the trainee is n’t doing their best to keep up their end of the deal and keep themselves in top shape to get the most from the coach ’s training ?
Alcohol and tobacco products are a direct hindrance to that .
But of course you wo n’t ever see that happen , because most people in high ranks within organizations get there because of who they know and how much ass they ’ve kissed , not by how smart they are , so you ’ll probably never see that sort of common sense come from the top of any organization .
But what is important here is that I know and you know and I hope Phelps knows that there are smart people out there who can see past the smoke and mirrors .
It ’s not enough that we know however .
We need to start making some noise .
This suspension has nothing to do with the health or well being of Phelps or the time investment by his coaches , or to teach him a lesson about saying no to drugs or taking care of his health .
This has everything instead to do with assholes at the top of the swim team sacrificing the well being , image , and future of a very gifted human being all because they want to save their own face in the eyes of the all powerful conservative Amerika .
They ’re cowards , and I wo n’t go into more colorful detail about what else I think they are , I ’ll leave that to your imagination .
The bottom line is that there ’s no better time than today to start taking a final stand against the idiots in the U.S who continue to fight a senseless war against a harmless substance based on decades old , out of date research , and old wives tales based on absurd government propaganda .

An Enthusiast ’s Guide to Loud Train Horns
In all my years on the road , I have seen nothing that brightens children ’s faces and surprises the average driver than an extremely loud car train horn .
Even the loudest choo-choos can entertain and invoke nostalgia in the young and old alike .
If you are ready to make this your reality , then I have a few tips on what to consider before you ‘ pull the chord . ’
The Horns
Several companies manufacture some of the best car train horns on the market .
Hornblasters , Grand General , Wolo and 3 - Trumpet Train lead the market in affordability , accessibility and downright loudness .
The absolute loudest train horns you can buy are genuine train horns used on locomotives made by Nathan AirChime , Leslie , and formerly Wabco , Hancock and Prime .
Most horns can be bought easily online through the manufacturer or common online market places .
Installation is relatively easy , and it can add so much more to your average commute .
Anyone who knows a little about maintaining vehicles and following instructions on assembly can add the sweet sound of a locomotive to his or her repertoire .
Train horn kits are a fun option for modifying your vehicle .
It ’s a sound that commands attention .
You can install train horns almost anywhere on your vehicle where you have the space .
These kits can be installed pretty easily with some basic tools and a little knowledge of vehicle wiring .
You only need to drill holes for the mounting brackets to support the air tank and compressor , put the horn where you want it , and make some noise .
Here are three of the loudest horn kits you ’ll find .
1. Viking Horns V101C
The Viking Horns V101C is a train horn kit designed to fit any vehicle .
It has three , chrome plated trumpet horns that have the ability to reach 149 decibels .
This amazing strength of the sound is due to the 150 PSI heavy duty air compressor .
A 1.5 gallon air tank is also included .
This kit is easy to put together and can work in any vehicle from crossover to semi-truck .
Drivers looking for a little more kick or character to their vehicle do n’t have to look further .
The V101C train horn kit is one of the loudest in the business .
All of this performance is offered at a great price as well .
When purchasing the Viking Horns V101C kit , you receive all of the necessary components to complete their build .
You will be surprised at the strength of these three trumpet air horns .
After all , 149 decibels is nothing to scoff at .
It is recommended to install the air compressor below the chassis of the vehicle as the tank itself will make a considerable amount of noise when in use .
Some users have also had success installing the unit in the bed of their truck for extra space .
The trumpets are compact enough to fit on to the front of any vehicle .
2. Nathan AirChime K3LA Model 540
The AirChime K3LA really was designed for use on diesel trains back in the 1950s .
The kit version contains everything you ’ll need to install it on your truck , including a variety of fittings .
The horn is very solidly made from die cast aluminum over stainless steel parts .
At just over 18 pounds in weight , and about 18″ x16″x10 ″ dimensions , the horn will fit easily enough on most trucks while providing genuine train - sound blasts .
A Viair 400C compressor will provide you 150 PSI of force for powerful blasts of sound lasting up to 5 seconds in duration .
At 4 ″ x 9 ″ x 7 ″ and only 8 pounds , the compressor is fairly compact for what it can do ( 2.54 cubic feet per minute ) .
It will draw up to 26 amps on a 12 - volt battery .
The five gallon tank is also easy to manage at 20 ″ x9 ″ x7 ″ size , but has a solid weight of 20 pounds .
Altogether , this a ruggedly impressive system weighing about 50 pounds altogether .
Right out of the box you get that locomotive look and feel in a product that seems like it ’s meant to last a lifetime .
The kit also includes 17 feet of half - inch air line , solenoid electronic valve , a 110 / 150 PSI switch , the fittings kit , extra air filters , and detailed instructions for proper installation .
The Nathan company also provides excellent phone support if you need further help .
Though definitely on the heavy duty end , it ’s a very loud , durable piece of equipment that ’s made to last .
If you ’re willing to invest in quality , you wo n’t be disappointed .
3. Kleinn Air Horns HK9
Officially the “ Pro Blaster Triple Air Horn System ” , the kit includes a Demon 730 model air horn , compressor , and 5 gallon tank .
This system will also produce 150 PSI for some stunning sound levels of 150 decibels and even more .
All mounting equipment and hardware are in the box .
You can also purchase a Blast Master Valve Upgrade Kit separately to produce even more decibels of aggressive sound .
It comes with three separate trumpets of solid steel at 18 ″ , 14 ″ , and 10 ″ in length .
All are detachable for easy cleaning .
Product dimension are 23 ″ x 18 ″ x 21 ″ , making it on the large side , but a flat profile makes it easier to mount where you want it .
Some dealers will provide variations on the kit including different trumpet sizes and configurations .
The box includes the VX7004 high - performance air valve , brass fittings , complete wiring installation kit , and 12 feet of nylon air line .
The HK9 includes a standard 3/8 ″ valve and a coiled 35 foot hose with storage bag for inflating tires or powering other air tools .
It only comes in one finish , plain black , and it does contain lead in the wiring .
Neither of those is really a serious problem .
Installation is reasonably easy and the HK9 comes with a solid one - year warranty .
If you want a train horn on your truck or SUV that looks and sounds big and bad , Kleinn ’s HK9 is for you .
4. HornBlasters Conductor ’s Special 540
The 540 model from HornBlasters is priced a little lower - priced in part because it ’s made primarily from plastics and fiberglass .
It feels light at 13 ″ x 15 ″ x 16 ″ and a weight of only four pounds .
But it ’s more than loud enough .
It can be heard over a four mile range and in honk durations of up to 14 seconds .
It comes with a DOT - approved 5 gallon air tank .
It also comes with the Viair 400C compressor .
You can upgrade the system to a Viair 480C compressor and a 200 PSI valve for some incredible sound , but the Shocker ABS plastic horns may not be able to handle much of that .
The system is more than loud enough as it is , and the train horn sound it produces sounds very authentic .
HornBlasters maintains that the 540 is hand - tuned to match the legally required train signal .
They do sound great ; the plastic materials do n’t affect the quality of sound at all .
The kit includes a pressure switch so you can wire it straight into your steering wheel or existing horn wiring .
You can even add a switch to alternate between your stock horn and the blast of the train horn .
It also comes with a “ snorkel ” kit so you can move the air intake up to six feet away to avoid water or dust .
Two air lines are included , at 17 feet of 1/2 ″ hose for the compressor and 10 feet of 5 /16 ″ hose for air tools .
Brass fittings , wiring kit , mounting hardware , and instructions are included .
You can also go online and download additional PDF instruction manuals .
Earplugs are also included !
The Conductor ’s Special 540 does n’t seem to have the quality of construction some more expensive models do .
While the horn itself seems lightweight , the tank and Viair compressor are as good as any .
With plastic , on the other hand , you wo n’t have to worry about rust and corrosion as you would metal trumpets .
You ’ll find that for the price , the 540 is a very loud and satisfying toy .
That ’s the point , after all .
How Loud
However , before purchasing a loud train horn , understand that some restrictions exist as to how loud is legally too loud .
The code states in California , “ Every motor vehicle , when operated upon a highway , shall be equipped with a horn in good working order and capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of no less than 200 feet , but no horn shall emit an unreasonably loud or harsh sound . ”
The above - mentioned law leaves a lot of room for interpretation .
The average car horn emits about 110 decibels ( unit used to measure sound ) , so if you are in the market , be sure to check your state restrictions on dB level and codes before spending the cash .
Although most horns sound similar in nature , each have variations in distance level from the vehicle .
In the end , it could cost you more in tickets and fines then you were expecting , and the costs will soon outweigh the benefits .
Turn It Up
There are several ways to up the stakes of your current train horn in the comfort of your own parking space on a relatively low budget .
Your first and best bet is to buy a train horn that includes everything you need to install a louder horn in your car , truck , SUV or just about anything that has a 12 - volt power source .
They can cost anywhere from $ 100 to $ 500 , depending on the quality and reliability of the horn ’s components .
If you are ahead of the pack and own a train horn already but are not quite satisfied with its head - turn ability , the PSI ( pounds per square inch ) on your air compressor and the capacity of your air tank are what make the horn loud .
Creating more air pressure will make a horn louder , and this can best be achieved by purchasing and installing a larger , stronger air compressor .
Most horn kits include the air compressor but stand - alone compressors are also easily available for purchase .
In the end , for a relatively small price and effort , the sweet sound of a train is accessible to everyone .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to give voice to a nation 's horror after the fatal shootings of Wednesday , March 11 .
" It 's a day of sorrow for all of Germany , " Merkel told reporters in Berlin .
" It is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . "
At 9:30 a.m. local time , a 17 - year - old identified only as Tim K. entered the Albertville school in Winnenden -- a town of 27,600 , near Stuttgart in southwestern Germany -- and began shooting randomly .
Nine students , aged between15 and 16 , and three teachers died in this initial attack .
" I heard two shots and then a scream , " a 15 - year - old pupil inside the school told AP news agency .
" At first , I thought it was a joke , but then someone yelled : ' Run , run ! ' "
Police said that two emergency squads were immediately dispatched to the school , but that the gunman had already hijacked a car and fled to the town of Wendlingen -- around 40 kilometers away .
Police said the gunman shot dead three bystanders , before taking his own life .
Authorities corrected earlier reports saying the teenager was killed by police in a shoot - out .
Authorities estimated the total death toll to be at least 16 , although initial details about those injured were sketchy .
Winnenden is located in the state of Baden - Wuerttemberg in southwestern Germany
The gunman 's father was a member of a local rifle club , and police who searched the family home found one pistol along with some 100 bullets missing .
Wednesday 's shooting followed a rampage in the United States on Tuesday in which a gunman shot dead 11 people then killed himself in southern Alabama .
String of school shootings
The Winnenden incident is the latest in a string of school shootings in Germany in recent years .
In 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western German town of Emsdetten , wounding at least eleven people before committing suicide .
In April 2002 , a gunman killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself at a high school in the eastern city Erfurt in the worst such incident .
German politicians and community leaders were unanimous in condemning the latest shooting spree .
Ulrich Wilhelm , spokesman for the federal government in Berlin , told reporters that the Winnenden incident was " horrific " but that the police had done all they could .
Someone Else ’s England
You do n’t have to be a nationalist , or English , to accept the case for an English parliament .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 17th February 2009
One of the most striking features of the massive response to my article last week on Hazel Blears and the Labour Party was the number of Labour activists who wrote in to agree ( 1 ) .
If , as I suspect , their fury and dejection is representative , Labour will be eliminated at the next election .
Just three years ago , almost all the pundits agreed that the Tories were finished as an electoral force .
Suddenly , Labour looks like the force that might never recover .
Has any party in modern politics done more to squander the goodwill that swept it into power ?
But I noticed something else as well : something that was n’t there .
Every other issue I mentioned was picked over and debated .
One was not .
It concerns the most glaring democratic deficit over which this government has presided , yet almost everyone is too polite to mention it .
Three nations in the United Kingdom , as a result of one of this government ’s rare progressive policies , now possess a representative assembly .
The fourth and largest does not .
England , the great colonising nation , has become a colony .
It is governed by a Scotsman who uses foreign mercenaries – Scottish , Welsh and Irish MPs – to suppress parliamentary revolts over purely English affairs .
There is still no democratic forum in which English interests can be discussed only by English representatives .
The unfairness is staggering , the silence stranger still .
One of the peculiarities of UK politics is that issues which hardly anyone supports receive majority assent in parliament .
Under the current system , no popular support is required .
University top - up fees , for example , were rejected by the Scottish and Welsh assemblies , but Scottish and Welsh MPs were frogmarched through the lobbies to impose them on England ( the government won by five votes ) ( 2 ) .
Foundation hospitals were voted down in both Wales and Scotland , and foisted on the English by the representatives of those nations ( 3 ) .
Had Heathrow ’s third runway been debated only by English MPs , the proposal would have been resoundingly defeated ; it was approved by 19 votes , after 67 MPs from the other nations were induced to support the government ( 4 ) .
They can support such measures without any electoral risk , as their constituents are not directly affected .
Devolution , which has had such beneficial consequences here in Wales and across the other borders , has left the English high and dry .
So why does no one – with the honourable exception of a tiny band of thinkers like Paul Kingsnorth and Gareth Young ( 5,6,7 ) – who is even vaguely on the left want to discuss it ?
Perhaps it is because two quite different issues have been muddled up : democracy and nationalism .
English nationalism takes many forms , but the image which comes to most minds is of skinheads waving the flag of St George .
These are , or should be , separate concerns .
You do n’t have to be a nationalist , or English , to accept the case for an English parliament .
Last month I was fiercely attacked by the Campaign for an English Parliament ( CEP ) for writing that “ England means nothing to me ” ( 8 ) .
I meant two things .
First that I consider myself a global citizen – a member of the species – before I consider myself a national citizen .
I believe that everyone has an equal entitlement to the world ’s wealth and power .
I do n’t love England , but nor do I hate it .
I am indifferent .
Secondly , I do not know what England means .
The problem for those who wish to define this nation is that England has universalised itself .
English culture , thanks to English imperialism , has seeped into everyone ’s culture ; the English language has become everyone ’s language .
The acts of union , forged by a dominant England , have submerged English identity into a British or Unionist identity .
British imperialism , in turn , has destroyed the sense of a discrete and self - contained nation .
The values , language , governance and business structures , the global integration we imposed on other nations have come back to bite us .
The hero of the film Slumdog Millionaire , for example , works in a call centre in which cold - callers in Mumbai , tutored in British accents , politics , weather and geography , seek to persuade their British customers that they are phoning from just around the corner .
I happen to think that the transfer of jobs like this is a good thing , a restitution of employment once forcibly relocated from India to England , but I realise that most people here are appalled by the implications .
Whether you approve or not , you have to accept that Finland has no such issues , as no one else was forced to speak Finnish .
Those five words in December , claimed the CEP ’s head of media , Michael Knowles , were “ as good an illustration anyone can get of the prejudice England experiences from the UK Establishment . ”
It is because of the “ indifference and hostility ” of people like me that the English “ are so discriminated against ” ( 9 ) .
Knowles , in other words , confused a good case founded on democracy and human rights with patriotism , giving people of more cosmopolitan views every excuse they need to turn away .
To support an English parliament , you do n’t have to love England , you have only to love democracy .
Labour politicians use this excuse to sustain the government ’s inordinate executive power .
Instead of a parliament , England has been given nine regional assemblies .
Only one of them ( in London ) has been elected ; hardly anyone even knows that the others exist .
They represent the opposite of devolution : a transfer of power away from local authorities towards a higher level of government , over which the people have no direct control .
Next year they will be turned into Local Authority Leaders ’ Boards ( 10 ) , representing the final abandonment of the government ’s promise of regional referenda leading to elected assemblies ( 11 ) .
On Sunday David Cameron revealed his own plan : a great bog of fudge pudding which makes the parliamentary system even more complex and opaque than it is already .
“ For English - only legislation , we would have a sort of English grand committee , ” he told the Mail on Sunday .
In “ exceptional circumstances ” ( and what is n’t ? ) the committee can be overruled by the rest of the Commons ( 12 ) .
Today he writes in the Guardian of his plan for a “ radical decentralisation , to reach every corner of the country ” and turn Britain ’s “ pyramid of power on its head ” .
But there ’s not a word about an English parliament .
No one is suggesting we disband the government of the United Kingdom ( though I propose that it be moved close to the geographical centre of the UK – Liverpool , say , or Rhyl ) .
The Campaign for an English Parliament argues that it should retain control over matters such as the UK ’s constitution , foreign and defence policy , employment legislation and social security .
The remainder – some taxation , health , education , transport , local government , planning , the environment , police , courts , prisons and the rest – should be devolved to the four nations ( 13 ) .
England is no longer my home and not much of my business .
But I would be surprised if anyone across the border who has understood the implications is happy with the current deal .
The nation which claims to have brought democracy to the world is in dire need of it .

The political maneuvering between President Barack Obama and his top field commanders over withdrawal from Iraq has taken a sudden new turn with the leak by CENTCOM commander Gen.
David Petraeus  and a firm denial by a White House official  of an account of the Jan.
21 White House meeting suggesting that Obama had requested three different combat troop withdrawal plans with their respective associated risks , including one of 23 months .
The Petraeus account , reported by McClatchy newspapers Feb. 5 and then by the Associated Press the following day , appears to indicate that Obama is moving away from the 16 - month plan he had vowed during the campaign to implement if elected .
But on closer examination , it does n’t necessarily refer to any action by Obama or to anything that happened at the Jan. 21 meeting .
The real story of the leak by Petraeus is that the most powerful figure in the U.S. military has tried to shape the media coverage of Obama and combat troop withdrawal from Iraq to advance his policy agenda  and , very likely , his personal political interests as well .
This writer became aware of Petraeus ’ effort to influence the coverage of Obama ’s unfolding policy on troop withdrawal when a military source close to the general , who insisted on anonymity , offered the Petraeus account on Feb .
4 . The military officer was responding to the IPS story " Generals Seek to Reverse Obama Withdrawal Decision " published two days earlier .
The story reported that Obama had rejected Petraeus ’ argument against a 16 - month withdrawal option at the meeting and asked for a withdrawal plan within that timeframe , and that Petraeus had been unhappy with the outcome of the meeting .
It also reported that Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and retired Army general Jack Keane , a close ally of Petraeus , had both made public statements indicating a determination to get Obama to abandon the 16 - month plan .
The officer told IPS that , contrary to the story , Petraeus had been " very pleased " with the direction of the discussions .
He said that there had been no decision by Obama at the meeting and no indication that Obama had a preference for one option over another .
The military source provided the following carefully worded statement : " We were specifically asked to provide projections , assumptions , and risks for the accomplishment of objectives associated with 16- , 19 - , and 23 - month drawdown options . "
That was exactly the sentence published by McClatchy the following day , except that " specifically " was left out .
The source also said Petraeus , Odierno , and Ambassador Ryan Crocker had already reached a " unified assessment " on the three drawdown options and had forwarded them to the chain of command .
But a White House official told IPS Monday that the Petraeus account was untrue .
" The assessments of the three drawdown dates were not requested by the president , " said the official , who insisted on not being identified because he had not been authorized to comment on the matter .
" He never said , ‘ Give me three drawdown plans . ’ "
McClatchy ’s Nancy Youssef reported a similar account from aides to Obama .
" Obama told his advisers shortly after taking office that he remained committed to the 16 - month timeframe , " Youssef wrote , " but asked them to present him with the pros and cons of that and other options , without specifying dates . "
That suggests that the only specific plan for which Obama requested an assessment of risks was the 16 - month plan , but that he agreed to look at other plans as well .
The sentence given to this writer as well as to McClatchy bore one obvious clue that the request for the assessments of three drawdown plans did not come from Obama : the sentence used the passive voice .
It also failed to explicitly state that the request in question was made during the meeting with Obama .
Petraeus did not respond to a request through the intermediary to say who requested the studies and whether they had been proposed by the military commanders themselves .
McClatchy ’s Youssef also noted that it is " unclear who came up with the idea " of the 19 - and 23 - month withdrawal plans .
By implying that Obama had requested the three plans without saying so explicitly , the sentence leaked by Petraeus seems to have been calculated to create a misleading story .
One of Petraeus ’ objectives appears to have been to counter any perception that he is seeking to undermine Obama on Iraq policy .
Petraeus wishes to remain out of the spotlight in regard to any conflict regarding withdrawal over the Iraq issue .
" He has been very careful to keep a very low profile , " said the military officer close to Petraeus , " because this is a new administration . "
But the Petraeus leak also serves to promote the idea that Obama is moving away from his campaign pledge on a 16 - month combat troop withdrawal , which has already been the dominant theme in news media coverage of the issue .
That idea would also justify continued sniping by military officers at the Obama 16 - month plan as too risky .
In a new book , The Gamble , to be published today , Washington Post reporter Tom Ricks confirms an earlier report that in his initial encounter with Petraeus in Baghdad last July , Obama had made no effort to hide his sharp disagreement with the general ’s views .
Obama interrupted a lecture by Petraeus , according to Ricks , and made it clear that , as president , he would need to take a broader strategic view of the issue than that of the commander in Iraq .
Ricks , who interviewed Petraeus about the meeting , writes that Obama ’s remarks " likely insulted Petraeus , who justly prides himself on his ability to do just that . "
That strongly implies that Petraeus expressed some irritation at Obama over the incident to Ricks .
On top of the interest of Petraeus and other senior officers in keeping U.S. troops in Iraq for as long as possible , Petraeus has personal political interests at stake in the struggle over Iraq policy .
He has been widely regarded as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 .
Petraeus evidently believed the White House was promoting a story that made him look like the loser at the Jan. 21 meeting .
" I imagine the White House is not too happy that this information is out there , " said the military source , referring to the Petraeus account he had provided to IPS .
Obama is obviously treading warily in handling Petraeus .
His concern about Petraeus ’ political ambitions may have been a factor in the decision to bring four - star Marine Corps Gen.
James Jones in as his national security adviser .
" I ’ve been told by a couple of people that one of the reasons for Jones being chosen was to have him there as a four - star to counter Petraeus , " says one Congressional source .

Girl , 8 , with phobia of dentists refused to open her mouth after traumatic visit - and starved to death
Tragic : Sophie Waller died from from acute renal failure caused by starvation and dehydration
A girl of eight starved to death in her own bed after suffering a phobia of dentists so severe that she would not even open her mouth to eat , an inquest has heard .
Sophie Waller 's fear was so extreme that she was taken to hospital just to have a tooth removed .
The coroner was told that Sophie developed her phobia at the age of four when a dentist accidentally cut her tongue during a check up .
When she cracked her tooth on a boiled sweet four years later , she refused to visit a dentist and was referred her to hospital by the family 's GP after she refused to eat for three days .
Doctors at the Royal Cornwall Hospital decided to remove all her milk teeth in one go to avoid repeating the procedure - a decision her parents claim they did not consent to , and which made the situation even worse .
Afterwards ,
Sophie would not open her mouth and had to be fed through a tube .
She was later discharged , however , and yesterday her mother , Janet , 34 , said she had begged the hospital to have Sophie readmitted after she began to waste away at home .
Mrs Waller and her husband Richard , 35 , claim they contacted the hospital on several occasions but were refused permission to bring their daughter back in and instead referred to a child psychologist who told them ' not to worry ' .
But Sophie refused to talk or swallow food as her parents tried to feed her with fruit and drinks supplemented with vitamins .
She became so thin she could not walk on her own and was found dead in bed on December 2 , 2005 - two weeks after leaving the hospital .
She weighed less than four stone .
Pathologist Marianne Brundle found she died of acute kidney failure because of starvation and dehydration .
Her parents , of St Dennis , Cornwall , said that by removing all eight of her milk teeth the hospital had left their daughter traumatised and unable to eat .
Mrs Waller said : ' I signed a form to consent to have one tooth being removed , but not eight .
' The next thing I know she comes out of theatre and there was blood all round her mouth .
All her milk teeth had been taken out .
' She did n't like dentists already so she was very freaked out .
She had blood running all down her face .
The poor girl was devastated .
Janet Waller said her daughter was ' devastated ' when she discovered her teeth had been removed
' It was very scary for her .
She soon needed a feeding tube because she stopped eating and drinking .'
After leaving hospital Sophie 's parents say they tried to feed her watermelon and oranges but most of the food was spilled down her front as she would n't swallow .
Mrs Waller says they contacted the hospital with their concerns but were told not to bring her back and referred her to child psychologist Kerry Davison .
The couple claim say they rang her at least once a day but say she told them ' everything would be fine ' and not to worry as long as she was eating something .
Mr Waller said : ' It could have easily been avoided if we had just taken her into hospital instead of listening to that woman .
' If I had just said ' I am going to take her anyway ' we would not be sitting here now .
' I asked her to come round and see her but she kept saying there is nothing to worry about and I 'll come next week . '
Mrs Waller , a nursery teacher , said : ' I kissed her goodnight and told her I loved her as normal .
' In the morning I noticed that Sophie looked like she was asleep so went to make a cup of tea and I though I 'd wake up Sophie after .
' When I went up she was lying face up and I knew she was dead .
She looked cold .
I took her downstairs and Richard tried to perform CPR .'
Doctors found no food in her stomach or gut after she died even though she had previously been a ' tubby girl ' who loved to eat .
Mrs Waller said : ' Everyone has a phobia and Sophie 's was a dentist phobia and a phobia about her teeth .
' I wish now that Kerry Davidson had come out and looked at her or if the hospital let me return it would have saved her .
' She was a bubbly little girl who loved going to school who loved her food and would eat anything .
Her parents admit that after leaving hospital their daughter was not seen by any doctor .
Pathologist Marianne Brundle carried out a by post mortem and found she died of acute renal failure because of starvation and dehydration .
The inquest , in Truro , continues .
( CNN ) -- A South Carolina sheriff 's office is investigating whether Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps smoked marijuana on the University of South Carolina campus .
Michael Phelps is facing a criminal investigation into whether he smoked marijuana on a college campus .
Authorities will file criminal charges if the investigation determines that they are warranted , a spokesman said Tuesday .
" If someone breaks the law in Richland County , we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges , " Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement .
" The Richland County Sheriff 's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law .
If he did , he will be charged in the same manner as anyone else .
The sheriff has a responsibility to be fair , to enforce the law and to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity . "
Phelps admitted " regrettable behavior " on Sunday after a British newspaper published a photograph of him smoking through a bong .
The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina , in Richland County .
Both university police and Columbia , South Carolina , police have said they would not pursue charges , according to The State newspaper in Columbia .
It was unclear where the party took place , the paper said , or whether it was on the USC campus .
" I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment , " said Phelps , who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing , China , in a statement Sunday .

The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part , " Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions .
We are confident that , going forward , Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion . "
In 2004 , Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury , Maryland .
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation .
He also issued an apology after that incident .
Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who have signed on to " My Victory , " an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean .

SMOKING is worse for your health than poverty , research has found .
Rich smokers generally die earlier than poor non-smokers , according to a new study published in the British Medical Journal .
And women smokers die earlier than male non-smokers , cancelling out the usual life expectancy gap .
For 28 years experts from the University of Glasgow followed 15,000 middle - aged women and men from two industrial towns in west Scotland .
They found that social deprivation , being a smoker  or being a man  all harmed their chances of being alive at the end of the study .
Inlet - Outlet Lets You Give Back Energy to the Grid
February 4th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
It ’s hard not to continue coverage of the Greener Gadgets Design Competition with so many great entries .
The most recent gadget to catch my eye is the Inlet - Outlet , which grants easy access to good Samaritan - hood by letting you give power back to the grid .
The device ’s creators speculate that adapter kits could be sold to make common household appliances into inlet - ready devices .
For example , an inlet could be placed behind your refrigerator to capture excess heat and convert it into electricity .
The inlet could also work in commercial settings — a gym could pair each electrical bike with an inlet and become a mini- power plant .
If every household had an inlet and consumers were given some sort of incentive to use it , imagine how much extra energy could be generated .

The web has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to evolve and leave embedded franchises struggling or in the dirt .
Prodigy , AOL were early candidates .
Today Yahoo and Ebay are struggling , and I think Google is tipping down the same path .
This cycle of creative destruction — more recently framed as the innovators dilemma — is both fascinating and hugely dislocating for businesses .
To see this immense franchises melt before your very eyes — is hard to say the least .
I saw it up close at AOL .
I remember back in 2000 , just after the new organizational structure for AOL / Time Warner was announced there was a three day HBS training program for 80 or so of us at AOL .
I loath these HR programs — but this one was amazing .
I remember Kotter as great ( fascinating set of videos on leadership , wish I had them recorded ) , Colin Powell was amazing and then on the second morning Clay Christensen spoke to the group .
He is an imposing figure , tall as heck , and a great speaker — he walked through his theory of the innovators dilemma , illustrated it with supporting case studies and then asked us where disruption was going to come from for AOL ?
Barry Schuler — who was taking over from Pittman as CEO of AOL jumped to answer .
He explained that AOL was a disruptive company by its nature .
That AOL had disruption in its DNA and so AOL would continue to disrupt other businesses and as the disruptor its fate would be different .
It was an interesting argument — heart felt and in the early days of the Internet cycle it seemed credible .
The Internet leaders would have the creative DNA and organizational fortitude to withstand further cycles of disruption .
Christensen did n’t buy it .
He said time and time again disruptive business confuse adjacent innovation for disruptive innovation .
They think they are still disrupting when they are just innovating on the same theme that they began with .
As a consequence they miss the grass roots challenger — the real disruptor to their business .
The company who is disrupting their business does n’t look relevant to the billion dollar franchise , its often scrappy and unpolished , it looks like a sideline business , and often its business model is TBD .
With the AOL story now unraveled — I now see search as fragmenting and Twitter search doing to Google what broadband did to AOL .
Video First
Search is fragmenting into verticals .
In the past year two meaningful verticals have emerged — one is video — the other is real time search .
Let me play out what happened in video since its indicative of what is happening in the now web .
YouTube.com is now the second largest search site online —
YouTube generates domestically close to 3BN searches per month — it ’s a bigger search destination than Yahoo .
The Google team nailed this one .
Lucky or smart — they got it dead right .
When they bought YouTube the conventional thinking was they are moving into media .
In hindsight — it 's media but more importantly to Google — YouTube is search .
They figured out that video search was both hard and different and that owing the asset would give them both a media destination ( browse , watch , share ) and a search destination ( find , watch , share ) .
Video search is different because it alters the line or distinction between search , browse and navigation .
I remember when Jon Miller and I were in the meetings with Brin and Page back in November of 2006 , I tried to convince them that video was primarily a browse experience and that a partnership with AOL should include a video JV around YouTube .
Today this blurring of the line between searching , browsing and navigation is becoming more complex as distribution and access of YouTube grows outside of YouTube.com .
44 % of YouTube views happen in the embedded YouTube player ( ie off YouTube.com ) and late last year they added search into the embedded experience .
YouTube is clearly a very different search experience to Google.com .
A last point here before I move to real time search .
Look at the speed at which YouTube picked up market share .
YouTube searches grew 114 % year over year from Nov 2007 to Nov 2008 !?!
This is amazing — for years the web search shares numbers have inched up in Google favor — as AOL , Yahoo and others inch down , one percentage point here or there .
But this YouTube share shift blows away the more gradual shifts taking place in the established search market .
Video search now represents 26 % of Google ’s total search volume .
The rise of the Notificator
I started thinking about search on the now web in earnest last spring .
betaworks had invested in Summize and the first version of the product ( a blog sentiment engine ) was not taking off with users .
The team had created a tool to mine sentiments in real - time from the Twitter stream of data .
It was very interesting — a little grid that populated real time sentiments .
We worked with Jay , Abdur , Greg and Gerry Campbell to make the decision to shift the product focus to Twitter search .
The Summize Twitter search product was launched in mid April .
I remember the evening of the launch — the trending topic was IMAP — I thought “ that cant be right , why would IMAP be trending ” , I dug into the Tweets and saw that Gmail IMAP was having issues .
I sat there looking at the screen — thinking here was an issue ( Gmail IMAP is broken ) that had emerged out of the collective Twitter stream —
Something that an algorithmically based search engine , based on the relationships between links , where the provider is applying math to context less pages could never identify in real time .
A few weeks later I was on a call with Dave Winer and the Switchabit team — one member of the team ( Jay ) all of a sudden said there was an explosion outside .
He jumped off the conference call to figure out what had happened .
Dave asked the rest of us where Jay lived — within seconds he had Tweeted out “ Explosion in Falls Church , VA ? ”
Over the next hour and a half the Tweets flowed in and around the issue ( for details see & click on the picture above ) .
What emerged was a minor earthquake had taken place in Falls Church , Virginia .
All of this came out of a blend of Dave ’s tweet and a real time search platform .
The conversations took a while to zero in on the facts — it was messy and rough on the edges but it all happened hours before main stream news , the USGS or any “ official ” body picked it up the story .
Something new was emerging — was it search , news — or a blend of the two .
By the time Twitter acquired Summize in July of ‘08 it was clear that Now Web Search was an important new development .
Fast forward to today and take a simple example of how Twitter Search changes everything .
Imagine you are in line waiting for coffee and you hear people chattering about a plane landing on the Hudson .
You go back to your desk and search Google for plane on the Hudson — today — weeks after the event , Google is replete with results — but the DAY of the incident there was nothing on the topic to be found on Google .
Yet at http://search.twitter.com the conversations are right there in front of you .
The same holds for any topical issues — lipstick on pig ? — for real time questions , real time branding analysis , tracking a new product launch — on pretty much any subject if you want to know whats happening now , search.
twitter.com will come up with a superior result set .
How is real time search different ?
History isnt that relevant — relevancy is driven mostly by time .
One of the Twitter search engineers said to me a few months ago that his CS professor would n’t technically regard Twitter Search as search .
The primary axis for relevancy is time — this is very different to traditional search .
Next , similar to video search — real time search melds search , navigation and browsing .
Way back in early Twitter land there was a feature called Track .
It let you monitor or track — the use of a word on Twitter .
As Twitter scaled up Track did n’t and the feature was shut off .
Then came Summize with the capability to refresh results — to essentially watch the evolution of a search query .
Today I use a product called Tweetdeck ( note disclosure below ) — it offers a simple UX where you can monitor multiple searches — real time — in unison .
This reformulation of search as navigation is , I think , a step into a very new and different future .
Google.com has suddenly become the source for pages — not conversations , not the real time web .
What comes next ?
I think context is the next hurdle .
Social context and page based context .
Gerry Campbell talks about the importance of what happens before the query in a far more articulate way than I can and in general Abdur , Greg , EJ , Gerry , Jeff Jonas and others have thought a lot more about this than I have .
But the question of how much you can squeeze out of a context less pixel and how context can to be wrapped around data seems to be the beginning of the next chapter .
People have been talking about this for years – its not that this is new — its just that the implementation of Twitter and the timing seems to be right — context in Twitter search is social .
74 years later the Notificator is finally reaching scale .
A side bar thought : I do wonder whether Twitter ’s success is partially base on Google teaching us how to compose search strings ?
Google has trained us how to search against its index by composing concise , intent driven statements .
Twitter with its 140 character limit picked right up from the Google search string .
The question is different ( what are you doing ?
vs. what are you looking for ? ) but the compression of meaning required by Twitter is I think a behavior that Google helped engender .
Maybe , Google taught us how to Twitter .
On the subject of inheritance .
I also believe Facebook had to come before Twitter .
Facebook is the first US based social network — to achieve scale , that is based on real identity .
Geocities , Tripod , Myspace — you have to dig back into history to bbs’s to find social platforms where people used their real names , but none of these got to scale .
The Twitter experience is grounded in identity - you knowing who it was who posted what .
Facebook laid the ground work for that .
What would Google do ?
I love the fact that Twitter is letting its business plan emerge in a crowd sourced manner .
Search is clearly a very big piece of the puzzle — but what about the incumbents ?
What would Google do , to quote Jarvis ?
Let me play out some possible moves on the chess board .
As I see it Google faces a handful of challenges to launching a now web search offering .
First up — where do they launch it , Google.com or now .Google.com ?
Given that now web navigational experience is different to Google.com the answer would seem to be now.google.com .
Ok — so move number one — they need to launch a new search offering lets call it now.google.com .
Where does the data come from for now.google.com ?
The majority of the public real time data stream exists within Twitter so any http://now.google.com/
like product will affirm Twitter ’s dominance in this category and the importance of the Twitter data stream .
Back when this started Summize was branded “ Conversational Search ” not Twitter Search .
Yet we did some analysis early on and concluded that the key stream of real time data was within Twitter .
Ten months later Twitter is still the dominant , open , now web data stream .
See the Google trend data below - Twitter is lapping its competition , even the sub category “ Twitter Search ” is trending way beyond the other services .
( Note : I am using Google trends here because I think they provide the best proxy for inbound attention to the real time microbloggging networks .
Its a measure of who is looking for these services .
It would be preferable to measure actual traffic measured but Comscore , Hitwise , Compete , Alexa etc. all fail to account for API traffic — let alone the cross posting of data ( a significant portion of traffic to one service is actually cross postings from Twitter ) .
The data is messy here , and prone to misinterpretation , so much so that the images may seem blurry ) .
Also note the caveat re ; open .
Since most of the other scaled now web streams of data are closed / and or not searchable ( Facebook , email etc. ) .
Google is left with a set of conflicting choices .
And there is a huge business model question .
Does Ad Sense work well in the conversational sphere ?
My experience turning Fotolog into a business suggests that it would work but not as well as it does on Google.com .
The intent is different when someone posts on Twitter vs. searching on Google .
Yet , Twitter as a venture backed company has the resources to figure out exactly how to tune AdSense or any other advertising or payments platform to its stream of data .
Lastly , I would say that there is a human obstacle here .
As always the creative destruction is coming from the bottom up — its scrappy and and prone to been written off as NIH .
Twitter search today is crude — but so was Google.com once upon a not so long time ago .
Its hard to keep this perspective , especially given the pace that these platforms reach scale .
It would be fun to play out the chess moves in detail but I will leave that to another post .
I ’m running out of steam here .
AOL has taken a long time to die .
I thought the membership ( paid subscribers ) and audience would fall off faster than it has .
These shifts happen really fast but business models and organizations are slow to adapt .
Maybe its time for the Notificator to go public and let people vote with their dollars .
Google has built an incredible franchise — and a business model with phenomenal scale and operating leverage .
Yet once again the internet is proving that cycles turn — the platform is ripe for innovation and just when you think you know what is going on you get blindsided by the Notificator .
Note : Gerry Campbell wrote a piece yesterday about the evolution of search and ways to thread social inference into search .
Very much worth a read — the chart below , from Gerry ’s piece , is useful as a construct to outline the opportunity .

North Korea has said it will launch a satellite into orbit next month US Defence Secretary Robert Gates says North Korea is likely to launch a rocket soon , and Washington would not attempt to stop it .
North Korea has said it will launch a satellite into orbit next month .
South Korea , Japan and the US say the launch is cover for a test of the Taepodong - 2 ballistic missile .
Japan had said earlier it would deploy missile interceptors to destroy any parts of a North Korean rocket that might fall on its territory .
North Korea has said it would regard any rocket intercept as an act of war .
But Mr Gates said the US would not attempt to shoot it down .
' Aberrant missile ' " I would say we 're not prepared to do anything about it , " he told Fox News Sunday .
North Korea 's missile programme " If we had an aberrant missile , one that looked like it was headed for Hawaii , we might consider it , but I do n't think we have any plans to do anything like that at this point , " said Mr Gates .
The US had previously said the launch would violate UN Security Council resolutions , while Russia has said North Korea should " abstain " from testing any missiles .
North Korea says it intends to test - fire the rocket between the 4 and 8 April .
The trajectory issued by Pyongyang shows the rocket will pass over Japan , with the first booster stage landing in the sea to the west , the second in the Pacific Ocean to the east .
Japan 's interception is only likely to be activated if the launch does not go as planned and debris appears to be falling towards Japan .

I do n’t , as a rule , endorse legislation : being a libertarian and all , my faith in the ability of government action to have any beneficial effect is exactly nil .
However , in the case of the Executive Accountability Act of 2009 [ .pdf ] , I ’m making an exception .
This is because , unlike most if not all legislation that seeks to regulate or otherwise shape the behavior of ordinary people , the Executive Accountability
Act regulates the behavior of government officials , namely POTUS and his underlings  and exacts severe penalties in case of violation .
Rep. Walter B. Jones , Republican of North Carolina , has introduced a bill that makes it a federal crime for a U.S. president or " an officer or employee of the executive branch of the government " to " knowingly and willingly " mislead Congress and the American people to gain authorization for U.S. military action .
The five - year statute of limitations , moreover , does n’t begin to run until the president leaves office .
If only it could be made retroactive !
Its reach would go far beyond Bush and Cheney to cover many of the behind - the - scenes players who are eagerly awaiting their return to power .
After all , a case can be made that Bush did n’t " knowingly and willingly " falsify intelligence , he was hornswoggled by a bunch of too - clever - for - their - own - good neocons , who fed the White House Ahmed Chalabi ‘s elaborate fabrications and stifled dissent in the CIA and other intelligence - gathering agencies .
If the Jones bill becomes law , a member of the executive branch  up to and including POTUS  is liable to be locked up for a decade if he or she , in making the case for war ,
" ( 1 ) falsifies , conceals , or covers up by any trick , scheme , or device a material fact ; ( 2 ) makes any materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent statement or representation ; or ( 3 ) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent statement or entry . "
If anything describes the machinations of the War Party in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , then this is it .
They covered up the essential facts and wrote their own alternative narrative .
Not only that , but one of their number went so far as to openly disdain the " reality - based community , " i.e. , those poor schmucks still stuck in the mire of mere " empiricism , " unable to comprehend the " new reality "  which he and his confreres were making up as they went along .
False , fictitious , and fraudulent ?
That ’s what the Office of Special Plans  which cherry - picked factoids and dolled them up into pro-war talking points  was all about .
And speaking of " false writing " and phony documents , remember the Niger uranium forgeries ?
Those were such obvious fakes that anyone who cited them was , without a doubt , knowingly and willingly engaged in deception .
Yet the president mentioned them in a key speech justifying the Iraq war .
Even if he did n’t know he was repeating a lie , surely whoever inserted that into the speech did know .
The Executive Accountability
Act would punish such liars in the future  with jail time , as they deserve .
One could argue that it is already a federal crime for a government official to knowingly mislead Congress , but Jones ’ legislation would make it easier to prosecute  and it has the added advantage of specifically naming POTUS , which , in the age of the imperial presidency , is a definite necessity .
This will make Obama and his successors think twice before they stretch the truth when the question of war and peace is on the table .
Oh , I can just hear the Obamatons now : why , the president  our president  would never do such a thing !
Really ?
Well , then , consider this :
" Little more than a year after U.S. spy agencies concluded that Iran had halted work on a nuclear weapon , the Obama administration has made it clear that it believes there is no question that Tehran is seeking the bomb .
" In his news conference this week , President Obama went so far as to describe Iran ’s ‘ development of a nuclear weapon ’ before correcting himself to refer to its ‘ pursuit ’ of weapons capability .
" Obama ’s nominee to serve as CIA director , Leon E. Panetta , left little doubt about his view last week when he testified on Capitol Hill .
‘ From all the information I ’ve seen , ’ Panetta said , ‘ I think there is no question that they are seeking that capability . ’
" The language reflects the extent to which senior U.S. officials now discount a National Intelligence Estimate issued in November 2007 that was instrumental in derailing U.S. and European efforts to pressure Iran to shut down its nuclear program . "
How many times do we have to go through this ?
The CIA says one thing , the White House says another , and eventually the former must bend its knee to the latter .
We do n’t find out until it ’s too late that the intelligence professionals were right to begin with .
The Jones bill would end this cycle of deception and make our officials think twice before they cite dubious " intelligence " to justify a war .
“ We ’re saying , Mr. President , be sure , ” Jones said in an interview with Military.com .
“ Be sure that if you are going to ask us to commit our boys and girls to risk their lives , that all the facts are on the table .
Make sure there are no questions .
Mr. President , you better be sure . "
Amen , brother .
As the U.S. war machine revs up its motors for an escalation of the Afghan war and perhaps an incursion or two into Pakistan , while also setting its sights on Iran , the Executive Accountability
Act will put a real crimp in the usual barrage of war propaganda that invariably accompanies a major military action .
Since most of that propaganda originates from within the U.S. government , specifically the executive branch , the Jones bill will at least have the advantage of making these inveterate liars nervous  what with 10 years in the hoosegow hanging over their heads .
Oh , now , be realistic , Raimondo  that bill will never pass !
Well , now that I ’m talking to myself , perhaps you ’re right : I may be deluded .
Or maybe I ’m just undergoing a rare spasm of optimism , because I think it just could happen .
Hearings on the Jones bill , now before the Judiciary Committee , are scheduled for this spring and should prove interesting .
Contact your congressional representatives and let them know  politely and briefly  that you support the Executive Accountability Act ( HR 743 ) and hope that they will consider supporting it by becoming a co-sponsor .
Go here for congressional contact information .
The first hurdle , however , is getting this bill out of the House Judiciary Committee , where it is likely to die unless you act now .
Here is a list of committee members and their contact information .
Give them a ring .
If you live in their district , even better , but if not , just briefly explain your interest .
A letter , of course , is always most effective .
Hold them accountable ?
Yes we can !

When Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele guest - hosted William Bennett ’s nationally syndicated conservative talk radio show a few weeks back — in part , to diffuse the mounting tension between the Republican Party chief Steele and the de facto Republican Party chief , Rush Limbaugh — he gave a skewed interpretation of natural history and aligned himself with Limbaugh ’s position on global warming in one fell swoop :
“ We are cooling .
We are not warming .
The warming you see out there , the supposed warming , and I am using my finger quotation marks here , is part of the cooling process .
Greenland , which is now covered in ice , it was once called Greenland for a reason , right ?
Iceland , which is now green .
Oh I love this .
Like we know what this planet is all about .
How long have we been here ?
How long ?
No very long . ”
But Steele did n’t stop there .
He exhorted listeners to take sides in a debate that is “ leading to the ultimate political Armageddon between conservatism and liberalism . ”
Telling one caller :
“ And the idea that free enterprise , free markets , free people are going to battle an oppressive , repressive , domineering government .
I love that .
That ’s what we are lining up for you folks .
So you better get ready , strap it on , because it ’s coming .
And you better pick your sides , you better choose now . ”
Like others , I ’m not exactly sure how to respond to either of the above .
First off , Greenland does not take its name because of the islands ’ greener pastures , Greenland was actually named by the Viking , Erik the Red , to encourage people to settle there .
The case is similar for Iceland .
Icelandic oral tradition states that the name comes from the Norwegian Viking Flóki Vilgerðarson .
Flóki chose the uninviting name “ ice land ” for the view of a distant fjord full of sea-ice that he glimpsed from a tall mountain .
His choice was also influenced by the fact that he was not at first taken with the land , and he bad - mouthed the place after his return to Norway .
Second , while annual mean temperatures may have dipped in the last year or two , unless we ’ve miraculously reversed a 100 - year trend in the last two years , global temperatures are still climbing , and especially so in the Northern Hemisphere .
Finally , if Steele is trying to make amends for calling - out Rush Limbaugh as an entertainer by taking the right - wing talk show host ’s divisive and oppositional politics to the RNC ’s front office , he may have succeeded .

Microsoft has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against navigation device maker TomTom .
The suit alleges that several of TomTom 's products , including some that are Linux - based , infringe on a handful of Microsoft 's patents .
Several of the patents in question relate to car computing systems and navigation , but there are also two that cover Microsoft 's FAT32 filesystem .
If Microsoft begins to systematically enforce its FAT32 patents , it could have broad ramifications for the Linux platform and for mobile device makers .
The lawsuit , which was reported today at Todd Bishop 's Microsoft blog , is thought to be the first time that Microsoft has directly targeted Linux with patent litigation .
In an interview with Bishop , Microsoft deputy general counsel for intellectual property Horacio Gutierrez claims that this is not the beginning of a broader intellectual property campaign against Linux .
Gutierrez characterizes the lawsuit as a last resort option that Microsoft is pursuing after attempting to negotiate a private settlement with TomTom for over a year .
Two of the patents in question are # 5,579,517 and # 5,758,352 which cover techniques for implementing a " common name space for long and short filenames . "
The patents basically cover a backwards compatibility hack that Microsoft implemented in its filesystem to preserve compatibility with the filename munging scheme that was used in MS - DOS where filenames were limited to 11 characters in length .
The software methods described in the patent are used in modern variants of Microsoft 's FAT filesystem .
Microsoft 's FAT patents have been vigorously challenged in court , but were finally upheld in 2006 .
Eben Moglen — a Columbia University law professor and the chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center — once described the FAT patents as a " proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over the open source community " and warned that Microsoft could use them to do immense damage to the Linux platform .
Indeed , Microsoft 's filesystem format is used broadly on external storage devices such as camera memory cards .
TomTom publishes a list of GPL - licensed software that is used in the company 's products .
One of the items on that list is dosfstools , a package of tools that are used to perform various checking and repair operations on FAT filesystems .
It 's not clear yet if dosfstools itself is the source of the patent infringement , but it seems likely that FAT support in general is problematic .
The dosfstools package is also used on Amazon 's Kindle , Google 's Android platform , and Nokia 's Maemo platform .
If Microsoft attempts to broadly enforce this patent against Linux users and vendors , the Open Invention Network ( OIN ) might decide to invoke the so - called " nuclear option " and retaliate with its own massive arsenal of software patents .
The OIN , which was founded to assemble a defensive patent portfolio for protecting Linux and some open source technologies , includes patents on basic principles of computing including networking , e-business , and bytecode compilation .
Microsoft has previously made broad threats against the Linux kernel and the broader open source application ecosystem , alleging that the Linux desktop stack infringes on over 200 of the company 's patents .
These claims have never been substantiated and Microsoft has never disclosed specific details about which patents it believes have been infringed .
Other Microsoft patents that TomTom allegedly infringes inlcude # 6,704,032 , which covers " Methods and Arrangements for Interacting with Controllable Objects within a Graphical User Interface Environment Using Various Input Mechanisms " , and # 6,175,789 which covers methods for creating a " Vehicle Computer System with Open Platform Architecture . "
Microsoft is asking the court for an injunction against TomTom and treble damages for willful infringement .

Most people who do rotten
things have redeeming qualities if you look hard enough .
Then there are the really low and vile characters like Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) .
After tastelessly predicting Justice Ginsburg ’s death in 9 months over the weekend , he ’s now followed up with a sneering non-apology apology in which he pins the whole dust - up on her apparently being oversensitive .
Truly a rotten person .
No wonder his own party is trying to find someone to run against him .
“ I was standing right next to it , ” says Frank Robinson , founder of the world ’s leading helicopter company , describing a close call he had during a 1961 test of a gyroplane .
“ I had to grab hold of it and hang on and ride the damn thing down .
You do n’t want to be standing out there when it starts to jump around — it can jump on you .
And there ’s not a good way to get out of it .
Just cut everything , hang on and hope . ”
What Robinson wrestled with is ground resonance , a demon that has demolished helicopters and killed pilots , passengers , and bystanders .
The National Transportation Safety Board records 34 incidents in the United States since 1990 , but that does not include military helicopters or incidents that did not injure people or destroy the helicopter .
Not all types of helicopters are susceptible to ground resonance .
All those two - blade Robinsons are exempt because their “ teetering ” rotors are a single rigid structure , like a see-saw .
The only rotors that can produce ground resonance are those with three or more blades .
Multi - blade rotors have lead - lag hinges , which allow blades to speed up and slow down at different points as they circle the mast while the helicopter is moving forward .
The hinges keep the fluctuating lift and drag forces on each blade from inflicting excessive stresses on the rotor hub .
Snubbers and dampers limit the motions of the blades .
Because it is massive and spinning at a high speed , the rotor of a helicopter must be properly balanced .
If the lead - lag hinges allow the blades to depart from perfect symmetry , the rotor ’s center of gravity shifts slightly to one side of the mast , throwing the system out of balance .
Anything that ’s springy has a favorite frequency of vibration — its natural frequency — which is determined in part by its size and mass .
That ’s why tuning forks always produce a certain tone , and why boats of different sizes rock at different rates .
When two things with the same or similar natural frequencies are in contact , or sometimes even merely close to each another , and one of them begins to vibrate , it may “ excite ” the other to vibrate as well .
The ability of one vibrating object to create this sympathetic vibration in another is what enables the rotor blades to gain control of the entire helicopter .
The helicopter ’s airframe has its own natural frequency , which can be excited by an out - of - balance rotor .
Usually there is a triggering event : a bump or a landing or takeoff on sloping ground or with a little sideways or forward motion .
A jolt moves the mast while the blades , because of the freedom of motion allowed by their hinges , lag a little behind .
The rotor , now slightly out of balance , begins to wobble like a slowing top .
If the characteristic vibration frequency of the airframe is close enough to the rate of rotation of the rotor , it joins the dance , amplifying the rotor wobble .
The destruction is wrought by the considerable energy stored in the rotor blades .
The shaking rapidly grows in violence , exceeding the strength of the mast , transmission mounts , and landing gear .
The cyclic control in the cockpit flails about so violently that the pilot cannot hold it , the rotor blades strike the tail boom or the cockpit , parts begin falling off , and moments later the helicopter may be a heap of scrap .
If ground resonance begins , the pilot ’s best option is to get the helicopter into the air .
Once the tires or skids are no longer touching the ground , the vibration fades .
If the rotors do not have sufficient speed for flight — or if , as in Robinson ’s case , the aircraft is a gyroplane and can not hold itself aloft — the next best remedy is to eliminate lift by reducing blade pitch ; shut down the engine ; and hope for the best while waiting for the rotor to slow .
The wait - and - hope approach is only sometimes successful , so a better solution to ground resonance is to prevent it .
Helicopters with multiple - blade rotors have shock - absorbing landing gear with powerful dampers that allow it to soak up the energy that would otherwise set the helicopter shaking .
When ground resonance occurs in these craft , it is usually because tires or shock absorbers have been improperly serviced .
it says here your shit 's all retarded
Kyrgyzstan leaves US out in the cold
As the Kyrgyz parliament decides to close the only US military base in the country , Rupert Wingfield - Hayes considers the strategic and political impact of the announcement .
Kyrgyzstan covers an area of 199,900 sq km ( 77,182 sq miles ) " Kurdistan ? "
One of my friends asked , " why are you going to Kurdistan ? " " Not Kurdistan , " I said " Kyrgyzstan . "
He should perhaps be forgiven for confusing it with Central Asia .
Mongolia may have Gengis Khan to put it on the map .
Uzbekistan has the great Silk Road cities of Bokhara and Samarkand .
Kyrgyzstan has Manas .
Who ?
No , I had never heard of him either .
Manas , it turns out , is the hero of the greatest epic poem of Kyrgyz history .
He is a sort of King Arthur of the central Asian steppe , and a national hero in Kyrgyzstan .
Manas is also the name of an obscure American air force base .
Obscure , that is , until two weeks ago , when the president of Kyrgyzstan suddenly announced that he was kicking the Americans out .
Warm welcome
Hence the reason for my arrival there , resentful , grumpy and exhausted at five o'clock one recent morning .
Manas is the only American airbase in Central Asia
For some reason travel around former Soviet states always entails arriving at a grotty airport in the middle of the night .
As dawn broke , however , things started to look up .
To the south , the morning sun was now shining on the glorious snow covered peaks of the Heavenly Mountains .
At the high steel gates to the US airbase I was met by an extremely perky major who welcomed me with the promise of hot coffee .
Manas airbase is one of those peculiarly American creations .
Outside the fence it is Central Asia , inside it is the mid-west of the United States .
A land of large white pick - up trucks , stars and stripes and huge , very polite people who insist on calling you " Sir " .
Inside a high - tech briefing room the equally perky base commander , Colonel Bence , shook my hand enthusiastically .
" Welcome to Manas , " he beamed , " it 's really good to have you visit with us . "
Lifeline
In the next few minutes I learned all about " outreach programmes " building schools , helping Kyrgyz war veterans and about the hundreds of Kyrgyz who work on the base .
KC - 135 aircraft have been used by the US Air Force for more than 50 years Colonel Bence kept talking about " partnering with the local community " .
It was all relentlessly positive .
But the truth , I knew , is that the Americans are here for one reason only , and it was sitting outside in the shape of 12 large aircraft .
There is nothing very sexy about a KC - 135 .
It is a big drab grey airliner converted to be a flying petrol station .
But KC - 135s are hugely important to American and British squaddies on the front line in Afghanistan .
See map of existing and possible supply routes in the region Every time they get into a tight spot with the Taleban , they call in an air strike by fighter jets waiting in the sky above .
Those fighter jets can only remain airborne because of the KC - 135s flying out of Manas .
There is one circling high over Afghanistan 24 hours a day .
' Sold to Russia '
So now the Americans have a big problem .
Colonel Bence did not want to talk about it .
So instead I went to talk to Bakyt Beshimov .
There is little to show for the eight years America has spent here
Mr Beshimov is a small dapper man , with Mongolian features , a trim moustache and an eloquent command of the English language .
He is also the leader of the Kyrgyz opposition .
" Our president has sold our country to Russia for $ 2bn ( £ 1.4bn ) , " he says .
The decision to kick the Americans out of Manas came hours after Moscow gave Kyrgyzstan a $ 2bn loan .
In Mr Beshimov 's opinion it was no coincidence .
" This is another step in Vladimir Putin 's plan to re-establish Russian control over our country and the whole of central Asia , " he said .
" It is completely against our national interest to eject America from here . "
Long - term influence Mr Beshimov is one of the new breed of politicians in ex-Soviet states so beloved by Western politicians and Western reporters .
Kyrgyzstan has a population of 5.4 million
It is easy to make the mistake of believing that Mr Beshimov , who speaks English and is fluent in the language of liberal democracy , is the future .
But drive through the pot-holed streets of the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek and it feels very different , very Russian .
The architecture is late Soviet brutalist .
The street signs are all Cyrillic .
In the markets and cafes the conversations are all in Russian .
In contrast , there is little to show for the eight years America has spent here .
Inside the Manas airbase the buildings all look distinctly temporary .
For all their talk of " partnering " , the Americans have not even fixed the broken concrete runway .
They pay a paltry $ 60 m a year in rent .
And one day , when their war in Afghanistan is done , they will go home .
Unlike the Russians , who have already been here for well over 100 years .
EXISTING / POSSIBLE SUPPLY ROUTES TO TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN 1 .
Manas airbase : the only US base in Central Asia , a vital transit point for Nato and US operations .
Kyrgyz government wants it closed .
2. Karshi-Khanabad airbase : US forces were ordered out in 2005 .
Uzbekistan may agree to allow it to be used for non-military transports .
3. Bridge over Panj river : part - funded by the US , it was completed in 2007 .
May serve as another supply route into Afghanistan .
4. Khyber Pass : most supplies to US and Nato troops come through Pakistan .
Increasing number of attacks in the area mean the US army is looking for back - up routes .

Obama takes big lead in new Minn.
poll
A new Minneapolis Star Tribune poll shows Barack Obama opening an expansive lead in Minnesota , which appears to further shrink the electoral map of John McCain .
Some 55 percent of respondents said they support Obama , compared to 37 percent who back McCain .
The last Star Tribune Minnesota Poll , conducted in September , showed Obama and McCain deadlocked at 45 percent .

The 18 - point improvement comes as 58 percent of respondents said the Illinois senator would do a better job handling the economy while only 30 percent said the same of McCain .
The poll , conducted between September 30 and October 2 , is based on 1,084 interviews with likely voters .
While the Star Tribune attributed the surge in part to " an increase in the number of Minnesotans who call themselves Democrats , " Republicans questioned the results , and contended the most recent poll surveyed a disproportionately Democratic - leaning group of likely voters , and thus overstated support for Democratic candidates .
“ These numbers would be accurate if the Star Tribune had done this poll in New York — not in Minnesota , ” Glen Bolger , a pollster for Republican Sen. Norm Coleman said .
A portion of the Minnesota poll released yesterday showed a 13 - point jump in support for Democratic comedian - turned - politician Al Franken , who 's now taken his first clear lead , 43 percent to 34 percent , against Coleman .
Steven Schier , a political science professor at Carleton College in Minnesota , agreed that the poll seemed to oversample Minnesota Democrats .
“ I ca n’t believe that ’s real , ” Schier said , predicting that the race will likely end “ within five points either way . ”
Obama leads McCain in Minnesota by 5 percentage points in the latest RealClearPolitics polling average , which does not include the latest Star - Tribune survey .
The Minnesota poll comes on the heels of news Thursday that the McCain campaign is pulling staff and resources out of Michigan , a reflection of a shrinking electoral map for the GOP ticket .
On Friday , the Obama campaign announced it was expanding its operation in traditionally red Nebraska .
On a conference call Thursday , the McCain campaign mapped out its electoral strategy for the remaining thirty days , with a focus on several states where the RealClear polling averages show Obama in front : Colorado ( where Obama has a 4.4 - point lead ) , Wisconsin ( 5 ) , Pennsylvania ( 9.6 ) , New Hampshire ( 5.6 ) , New Mexico ( 7.8 ) , Nevada ( 1.8 ) — and Minnesota .
The Federal Government has suffered a whopping $ 115 billion fall in revenue due to the global recession , the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , announced today .
Speaking in Canberra after the full ministry was briefed on the state of the nation 's finances , Mr Rudd said the plunge had caused the budget to go into deficit .
He did not say how big the deficit was but promised the Government would release updated budget figures in the next few weeks and not wait until the May budget .
An airline loses your bag or cancels your flight because of a mechanical problem .
The next time you show up at the airport , an agent personally apologizes and offers a free pass to an airport lounge for your troubles .
Do n't laugh .
Someday it may happen at U.S. airlines .
Airlines are getting closer to rolling out new technology that tells airport ...
Some past stunts that are bizarre , weird or just plain daft .
In politics , there are no permanent alliances .
McCain - Palin ?
So 2008 .
On Meet the Press , David Gregory asked Senator John McCain if he 'd like to see Sarah Palin run for president .
McCain temporized .
" I 'd have to see , " he said when asked about the Alaska governor , and suggested he might support Louisiana Governor Bobby " Kenneth the Page " Jindal or Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty .

EU 's judicial cooperation agency Eurojust will take the lead in finding ways to help police and prosecutors across Europe to wiretap computer - to - computer phone conversations enabled by programs such as Skype .
" We will sit together with all member states to see how this can be done technically and legally , " Joannes Thuy , Eurojust spokesman told this website .
Mr
Thuy stressed that the wiretapping would not affect " normal users " , but would have to be carried out only as part of a criminal investigation .
Eurojust 's talks with prosecutors and police officials from member states , as well as legal experts would be led by Italian prosecutor Carmen Manfreda .
" There are 30 different legal systems all across the EU , so we expect the talks to take several months before first results are presented , " Mr Thuy added .
Skype , an Danish - Swedish business developed by Estonian programmers that was sold to E - Bay in 2005 and has over 350 million customers worldwide , is said to be un -spyable by intelligence services .
In its press release , Eurojust says that " Skype has so far refused to share its encryption system with national authorities . "
However , Skype claims that it has " extensively debriefed Eurojust on our law enforcement programme and capabilities . "
" Skype cooperates with law enforcement where legally and technically possible .
Skype remains interested in working with Eurojust despite the fact that they chose not to contact us before issuing this inaccurate report , " Brian O'Shaughnessy , head of corporate communications at Skype said in a statement .
The Italian anti-mafia prosecutors requested Eurojust to coordinate this initiative , pointing that criminals in Italy were increasingly making phone calls over the internet in order to avoid getting caught through mobile wiretapping .
Bavarian authorities allegedly also attempted to wiretap
Skype conversations and commissioned an IT firm to do this , but were not successful , according to documents obtained by Piraten Party , a movement promoting Internet freedom .
According to Eurojust , customs and tax police in Milan have overheard a suspected cocaine trafficker telling an accomplice to switch to Skype in order to get details of a 2 kg drug consignment .

" Founding Fathers "
Our founding fathers farmed hemp for its oils , fiber , its many medicinal uses and its pleasures as recorded in George Washington 's diary , August 7 , 1765 : " — began to separate the male from the female hemp at Do — rather too late . "
This is a practice related to drug potency and not fiber culture !
Thomas Jefferson , when an ambassador to France , smuggled the finest hemp seeds from Asia ( hemp 's origin ) to cultivate here in Virginia !
He also wrote about the advantages of hemp over tobacco , in use , labor and for the sake of the land .
Today the constitutional rights these men inscribed are trampled upon in the war against citizens engaged in this very activity !
In 1937 our government criminalized the entire hemp industry !
The lies they have manufactured about this plant will never justify the destruction this law has caused millions of innocent Americans through loss of property , family , employment and life in prison !
700,000 Americans are arrested every year for smoking marijuana
Marijuana is called a " deadly drug , " but there is not one documented case of death or disease from even the most chronic cannabis use !
The D.E.A.'s administrative law judge , Francis Young , stated " extensive research has proved that marijuana is the safest therapeutically active substance known to man , and is safer than most foods we consume . "
END 65 YEARS OF LIES & HYPOCRISY !!
END MARIJUANA PROHIBITION !!

Pinnacles of 19th Century Science February 12 , 2009
Utica , N.Y .
Richard Feynman famously presented his students with his unique ( and let 's admit it , hyperbolical ) view of history when he said
From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from , say , ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as [ James Clerk ]
Maxwell 's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics .
The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade .
( The Feynman Lectures on Physics , Volume II , 1 - 11 )
Others might acknowledge Maxwell 's work but argue that the most important scientific event in the 19th was instead the codification of the laws of thermodynamics .
Many people contributed to thermodynamics , including designers of steam engines , Sadi Carnot , James Joule , and Rudolf Clausius , but it was William Thomson ( later known as Lord Kelvin ) who first stated the first two laws of thermodynamics in the early 1850s , and who popularized the use of the word " energy " in its modern sense .
Thermodynamics and Maxwell 's equations help us understand how the universe works , but 19th - century science also brought about an increased understanding of the mechanism of living things , primarily through the discovery of the process of biological evolution by means of natural selection and sexual selection as described by Charles Darwin , whose 200th birthday we celebrate today .
To quote the famous title of Theodosius Dobzhansky 's 1973 essay , " Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution . "
Yet Darwin was clearly aware from the beginning of his researches that evolution had profound implications not just for biology in general , but for the origins of human beings .
Evolution answered millennia - old questions like " Where did we come from ? " with the revelation of a marvelous process involving the accumulation of small incremental changes tested for viability in the real world over millions of years , accepting what works , abandoning what 's harmful .
We are part of this process , so evolution also tells us much about ourselves .
Every other living thing is one of our distant cousins .
Instead of having " dominion " over all the earth , we are yet another creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
We came about through a blind , mechanistic , natural process , yet one that led to the development of minds capable of self reflection and wonderment , including the inquisitive , experimental , brilliant mind of Charles Darwin .
Evolution is a process more beautiful than any work of art , more awe - inspiring than any miracle , more meaningful than any theology .
On the road to ruin the US is traveling , one of the more significant milestones has to be the legal decision that corporations have the same legal protections as real people .
As Cecil Adams points out , the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment has been used more often to protect corporations than the former slaves for whom it was originally written .
Corporations have even claimed that they have the free - speech right to lie in their advertising .
Corporations may have been given all the rights of real people , but they conveniently do n’t have many of the limitations and restrictions .
After all , you ca n’t really throw a corporation in jail .
Which is too bad , particularly in the case of mercenary organization Blackwater .
Blackwater has a bloody history , with employees on trial on manslaughter and gun charges .
But when they lost their major contract protecting US diplomats in Iraq , how did they respond ?
By rebranding themselves .
Last month , the company changed their name to Xe ( which , as Blue Girl points out , is pronounced “ Zee ” — as in Nazi ) .
Yesterday , the founder announced he was stepping down ( although of course he did appoint the new president and new CEO ) .
What I find really sad about this is that even if Blackwater were unable to rebrand themselves , all the founder would really have to do is pull out all his money and let the corporation fail .
Then he could start a new corporation , with another new name and no bad reputation to live with .
After all , corporations can not only change their name , they can change their entire appearance , including their fingerprints .
LAGOS , Nigeria ( CNN ) --
At least 84 Nigerian children have died after ingesting teething medicine that contained a solvent typically found in antifreeze , the country 's health minister said Friday .
The My Pikin teething medicine has been reomved from shops in Nigeria .
Some 111 babies and children have been sickened since November by the tainted batch of My Pikin , which was found to contain diethylene glycol , which is used in some antifreeze and brake fluid .
Tests on the teething formula showed high concentrations of diethylene glycol , Health Minister Babtunde Osotimehin said in a statement released Friday .
Exposure to the solvent can damage the kidney , heart and nervous system , Osotimehin said , and it can be fatal .
The dead ranged from age 2 months to 7 years , he said .
" The death of any Nigerian child is a great loss to the nation , " he said .
Several officials with pharmaceutical company Barewa Pharmaceutical
Ltd have been charged with negligence .
And the Nigeria National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control , which is investigating the issue with the Ministry of Health , has shut the drug maker down .
Former officials of the company could not be reached for comment .
The food and drugs agency has said it believes the company thought it was buying propylene glycol , a normal ingredient in the teething medicine .
The government has asked that all My Pikin teething formula be returned ; however , it was not immediately clear if that had been done .
Symptoms of diethylene glycol exposure include : abdominal pain ; nausea or vomiting ; dizziness ; drowsiness ; confusion ; and decreased or lack of production of urine .

Jessica Simpson Melts Down At Rascal Flatts Concert ( Video )
opened for Rascal Flatts at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids Michigan last night , February 5 .
The singer , who has been experiencing a bad patch with the press , told the crowd of 15,000 that she was very nervous and said that her voice was feeling very weak .
Then she proceeded to have a very bad night on stage .
Simpson , lost her place on several songs , forgot the lyrics to Come On Over and had the band start over on Pray Out Loud .
On the verge of tears , she apologized to the audience before singing the last song of the 38 minute set , Do You Know .
She said that she was having a " bad week " and felt like walking off the stage .
After the song she thanked her backup band for " having my back " , and then left the stage while wiping away tears .
One concert - goer called in to a local Grand Rapids radio station after the concert and reported that Simpson 's behavior was very odd .
According to the caller , Simpson stopped singing completely several times and seemed to be mumbling , " sorry I can't do it " , while shaking her head .
This morning , Simpson 's rep Cindi Berger addressed the issue by saying , " Jessica had an off night .
She 's a perfectionist and wanted to start some of the songs over .
She always wants to give her best performance to her fans . "
The singer suffered a heap of harsh ' weight gain ' press after some unflattering photos hit the internet last week .

Family of Irving ' Bud ' Feldkamp , Owner of the Nation 's Largest Privately Owned Abortion Chain , Dies in Montana Plane Crash
Contact : Gingi Edmonds , www.gingiedmonds.com, 559-772-7911
MEDIA ADVISORY , Mar. 24 / Christian Newswire / --
Some of you may have seen the major news story of the private plane that crashed into a Montana cemetery , killing 7 children and 7 adults .
But what the news sources fail to mention is that the Catholic Holy Cross Cemetery owned by Resurrection Cemetery Association in Butte - contains a memorial for local residents to pray the rosary , at the ' Tomb of the Unborn ' .
This memorial , located a short distance west of the church , was erected as a dedication to all babies who have died because of abortion .
What else is the mainstream news not telling you ?
The family who died in the crash near the location of the abortion victim 's memorial , is the family of Irving ' Bud ' Feldkamp , owner of the largest for - profit abortion chain in the nation .
Family Planning Associates was purchased four years ago by Irving Moore " Bud " Feldkamp III , owner of Allcare and Hospitality Dental Associates and CEO of Glen Helen Raceway Park in San Bernardino .
The 17 California Family Planning clinics perform more abortions in the state than any other abortion provider - Planned Parenthood included - and they perform abortions through the first five months of pregnancy .
Although Feldkamp is not an abortionist , he reaps profits of blood money from the tens of thousands of babies that are killed through abortions performed every year at the clinics he owns .
His business in the abortion industry was what enabled him to afford the private plane that was carrying his family to their week - long vacation at The Yellowstone Club , a millionaires - only ski resort .
The plane went down on Sunday , killing two of Feldkamp 's daughters , two sons - in - law and five grandchildren along with the pilot and four family friends .
The plane , a single - engine turboprop flown by Bud Summerfield of Highland , crashed into the Catholic cemetery and burst into flames , only 500 ft. from its landing destination .
All aboard were killed .
The cause of the crash is a mystery .
The pilot , who was a former military flier who logged over 2,000 miles , gave no indication to air traffic controllers that the aircraft was experiencing difficulty when he asked to divert to an airport in Butte .
Witnesses report that the plane suddenly nosedived toward the ground with no apparent signs of a struggle .
There was neither a cockpit voice recorder nor a flight data recorder onboard , and no radar clues into the planes final moments because the Butte airport is not equipped with a radar facility .
Some speculate that the crash was due to ice on the wings , but this particular plane model has been tested for icy weather and experts have stated that ice being the cause is unlikely .
In my time working for Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust , I helped organize and conduct a weekly campaign where youth activists stood outside of Feldkamp 's mini-mansion in Redlands holding fetal development signs and raising community awareness regarding Feldkamp 's dealings in child murder for profit .
Every Thursday afternoon we called upon Bud and his wife Pam to repent , seek God 's blessing and separate themselves from the practice of child killing .
We warned him , for his children 's sake , to wash his hands of the innocent blood he assisted in spilling because , as Scripture warns , if " you did not hate bloodshed , bloodshed will pursue you " .
( Ezekiel 35:6 )
A news source states that Bud Feldkamp visited the site of the crash with his wife and their two surviving children on Monday .
As they stood near the twisted and charred debris talking with investigators , light snow fell on the tarps that covered the remains of their children .
I do n't want to turn this tragic event into some creepy spiritual ' I told you so ' moment , but I think of the time spent outside of Feldkamp 's - Pam Feldkamp laughing at the fetal development signs , Bud Feldkamp trying not to make eye contact as he got into his car with a small child in tow - and I think of the haunting words , ' Think of your children . '
I wonder if those words were haunting Feldkamp as well as he stood in the snow among the remains of loved ones , just feet from the ' Tomb of the Unborn ' ?
I only hope and pray that in the face of this tragedy , Feldkamp recognizes his need for repentance and reformation .
I pray that God will use this unfortunate catastrophe to soften the hearts of Bud and Pam and that they will draw close to the Lord and wash their hands of the blood of thousands of innocent children , each as precious and irreplaceable as their own .

An international team of astrophysicists has discovered a new planet five times the size of Earth , the smallest extrasolar planet unearthed to date outside of our solar system .
Using a network of telescopes scattered across the globe , the group discovered the extrasolar planet is more Earth - like than any other planet found so far .
It circles its parent star every 10 years .
The discovery opens a new chapter in the search for planets that support life .
" That fact that we stumbled on one means there are thousands of them out there , " said Kem Cook , an astronomer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who is also a member of PLANET , Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork , a part of the group that made the discovery .
" It 's got a solid core .
Its mass is low enough that it could n't hold itself together if it were just gas . "
The new planet and its red dwarf parent star lies in the constellation Sagittarius , not far from the central bulge of our galaxy .
To date , more than 200 planets within the Milky Way have been found .
However , the majority of them are gas giants , close to the size of Jupiter or Saturn that orbit their parent star at distances much less than the distance from Earth to the sun .
The new planet , made of rock and ice , orbits at three times the distance from Earth to the sun .
The team used a technique called microlensing , an idea that Albert Einstein came up with in 1936 .
By observing a particular star ( A ) on the sky , imagine another star ( B ) in the line of sight toward A .
He showed that when A , B and the observer are exactly aligned , a ring - like image will be formed .
Star B acts as a gravitational lens by bending the light of star A toward the observer .
From there , objects , such as planets or white dwarfs , around A temporarily brighten star B .
In this case , star A causes a characteristic brightening in star B that lasts about a month .
Any planets orbiting star A can produce an additional signal , lasting days for giant planets down to hours for Earth - mass planets .
The planet is not directly ' seen , ' or even the star that it 's orbiting , but its presence can be deduced from the effect of its gravity .
In the case of the newly found planet , the extra brightening lasted about 12 hours .
" There 's a deviation of light when a planet is in the way , " Cook said .
" In this instance , there was a half - day brightening that was indicative of a planet . "
The new planet - deemed OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 290 Lb - orbits a red dwarf five times less massive than the sun .
Its cool parent star and large orbit implies that the surface temperature is close to 428 degrees Fahrenheit below zero , much too cold for liquid water .
Astronomers predict that its rocky surface is probably deeply buried beneath frozen oceans .
" There must be lots of these out there , " Cook said .
" The microlensing technique is not going to find nearby planets .
We 're not going to discover planets to which NASA can fly .
Microlensing can tell us how common planets are in distant parts of the galaxy and probe details of planetary formation that other techniques cannot . "
The discovery is the joint effort of three independent microlensing campaigns : PLANET / RoboNet , OGLE ( Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ) , and MOA ( Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics ) , involving a total of 73 collaborators affiliated with 32 institutions in 12 countries - France , the United Kingdom , Poland , Denmark , Germany , Austria , Chile , Australia , New Zealand , United States , South Africa and Japan .
In most cases , new planets have been found using a technique called the Doppler shift , in which the wavelength of light emitted by a moving object is shifted due to its motion .
Radiation is red shifted when an object is moving away from us and blue shifted when the object is moving toward us .
Astronomers use Doppler shifts to calculate precisely how fast stars and other astronomical objects move toward or away from Earth .
As a giant planet orbits a star , it tugs it back and forth , producing a very small ( meters per second ) Doppler shift .
However , using the Doppler shift method , most planets found have been giant gas planets .
Microlensing is more sensitive to planets that orbit their star at distances that are in the range of the Earth sun separation .
OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390Lb is only the third extra-solar planet discovered so far from microlensing searches .
The new planet and its red dwarf parent star lies in the constellation Sagittarius , not far from the central bulge of our galaxy .
The research appears in the Jan. 26 edition of the journal Nature .

At first , Johntell Franklin just wanted to watch his friends play basketball .
" I wanted to go and support my team , " said Franklin , an 18 - year - old senior at Milwaukee Madison High School .
" I 'm a captain .
I set an example . "
As it turned out , Franklin wound up teaching everyone in the Madison gymnasium a lesson - about friendship , about the value of sports , about themselves .
A somber cloud hung over the Knights as they played DeKalb , Ill. , High School on Saturday , Feb .
7 . News spread quickly that Franklin 's mother , Carlitha , had died earlier that day after a five - year battle with cervical cancer .
She was 39 .
Madison coach Aaron Womack Jr. was in Madison 's laundry room , washing the Knights ' uniforms from the previous night 's game , when he got the news .
" I did n't have my cell phone with me back there , so by the time I heard , the junior varsity game had already started , " Womack said .
" I headed straight to the hospital .
Johntell , understandably , he was despondent . "
Carlitha Franklin had been in remission recently .
But Womack said she had begun to hemorrhage on Saturday morning - while Johntell was at Wauwatosa East High School , taking his college entrance ACT exam .
By late Saturday afternoon , the decision had been made to turn off the life - support system .
At the hospital , Womack asked Franklin if he should call off that evening 's game .
" He said , ' No , tell the guys to go out and do their best , ' " the coach said .
" I told him we would , and I went back to school . "
So Womack gasped with surprise when he saw Franklin walk into the gym early during the second quarter .
" A few seconds after I spotted Johntell , all the people in the stands did , too .
They surrounded him .
The players , his friends in the stands , the cheerleaders , " Womack said .
" They were showing me that they were supporting me , comforting me , " Franklin said .
" Yeah , on a hard day , that 's a nice feeling to have . "
Then came another surprise : Franklin did n't just want to watch .
He wanted to play .
" I'm a competitor .
I ca n't just sit there and watch , " he said .
Womack sent Franklin , a 6 - foot - 2 forward , to suit up .
He returned to the cheers of the crowd - including the coaches and players from DeKalb , whose amazing display of fellowship and sportsmanship had just begun .
" I was late getting back from the hospital , and they could have called us on that , " Womack said .
" But they were great about it . "
" We were sympathetic to the circumstances and the events , " said DeKalb coach Dave Rohlman .
" We even told Coach Womack that it'd be OK to call off the game , but he said we had driven 2 1 / 2 hours to get here and the kids wanted to play .
So we said , ' Spend some time with your team and come out when you 're ready . ' "
Since some of Franklin 's teammates had joined him at the hospital , Womack entered only eight names into Madison 's official scorebook .
The game began almost two hours behind schedule .
But Franklin 's desire to play created another problem :
The referees were required to call a technical foul against Womack for failing to list Franklin in the scorebook .
" I told the referees I knew there would be a technical , " Womack said .
" I put Johntell in after DeKalb called a timeout ( midway through the second quarter ) , and the next thing I heard was DeKalb 's coaches complaining that they did n't want a technical . "
" We argued , but the referees said those were the rules , even if there were extenuating circumstances , " Rohlman said .
The discussion lasted more than seven minutes .
Eventually , Rohlman devised a solution :
His team had to shoot two technical free throws . . . but did n't have to make them .
" I gathered my kids and said , ' Who wants to take these free throws ? '
Darius McNeal ( a 5 - 11 senior point guard ) put up his hand .
I said , ' You realize you 're going to miss , right ? '
He nodded his head . "
During technical free throws , no other players are allowed around the free - throw lane .
So Womack gathered Madison 's players around his bench , on the other end of the court , and was trying to reel in their emotions when he saw something odd out of the corner of his eye :
Instead of swishing through the basket , the ball rolled slowly across the end line .
" I turned around and saw the ref pick up the ball and hand it back to the player , " Womack said , " and then he did the same thing again . "
" Darius set up for a regular free throw , but he only shot it two or three feet in front of him , " Rohlman said .
" It bounced once or twice and just rolled past the basket . "
" I did it for the guy who lost his mom , " McNeal said .
" It was the right thing to do . "
After the second shot , everyone in the gym - including all the Madison players - stood and applauded the gesture of sportsmanship .
" Any one of my teammates would have done the same thing , and I think anyone on the Madison team would have done the same for us , " McNeal said .
Madison broke open a close game after the timeout and went on to win , 62 - 47 .
Franklin finished with 10 points , matching his season average .
" Just being in the game was a good feeling , " Franklin said .
" I knew my Mom would have wanted me to play .
She was always proud of me playing basketball . "
A friendly rivalry
This was the third straight year that DeKalb and Madison have played a non-conference game , and as in the other visits , both teams gathered for dinner afterward .
" We set it up so that there were four kids to a pizza , two Madison kids and two DeKalb kids , " Womack said .
Franklin stayed for only a minute and did n't have a chance to thank McNeal for his gesture .
" It 's OK , " McNeal said .
" I just would have told him I was sorry for his loss . "
Womack was so moved by the events of the day that he wrote a letter to the DeKalb Daily Chronicle , praising the Barbs ' coaching staff and players .
" That letter became a big deal in DeKalb , " said Rohlman , whose team is 14 - 10 with three regular - season games remaining .
" We got lots of positive calls and e-mails because of it .
Even though we lost the game , it was a true - life lesson , and it's not one our kids are going to forget anytime soon . "
Carlitha Franklin's funeral on Friday was attended by dozens of Johntell 's Madison friends , teammates , coaches and administrators . . . plus the cheerleading squad , in full uniform .
" Even the cooks from the lunchroom came , " said Womack , whose team is 6 - 10 overall but upset Milwaukee King , 46 - 43 , on Jan. 27 .
" You never know how much you 're loved until a tragedy happens .
It was amazing .
It shows what a good kid Johntell is . "
" I 'm all right now .
It helps to have so many people behind me , " Franklin said .
" This will be my first week back in practice , and we have a big game ( tonight ) against ( Milwaukee ) Hamilton that I 'm looking forward to . "
An all - City Conference linebacker , Franklin has drawn some interest from Division I and II programs , most notably Ball State .
" That 's what I want to do next .
I really want to play college football , " he said .
" I want to keep competing . "

By watching this short video , you will be able to prove to yourself that the Bible is repulsive .
The Bible is so repulsive that it has no place in a modern , civilized society .
Example 1
The vast majority of Americans believe that God exists , that Jesus is his son , and that God himself gave us the Bible and the Ten Commandments .
In fact , Supreme court Justice Antonin Scalia has said that " Ninety - nine percent of Americans believe in the ten commandments . "
He has also said , " What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God . "
If 99 % of Americans believe in the ten commandments , how can the Bible be repulsive ?
Let 's take the fourth commandment as an example .
It says : Remember the sabbath day , and keep it holy .
For six days you shall labour and do all your work .
But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God ; you shall not do any work �you , your son or your daughter , your male or female slave , your livestock , or the alien resident in your towns .
[ Exodus 20 : 8 - 9 ]
This , supposedly , is the word of God , the almighty ruler of the universe .
Now think about this .
Wal - mart is open on the Sabbath .
And so is Target .
Best buy is open on the Sabbath .
And so is Circuit City .
Home Depot is open on the Sabbath .
And so is Lowes .
In fact , millions of businesses in America have employees working on the Sabbath .
Even Christian Family Bookstores has employees working on the Sabbath .
What should we do with all of these people who are breaking the fourth commandment ?
In the Bible 's book of exodus - the same book that contains the ten commandments � the Bible tells us what to do with everyone who breaks the fourth commandment .
Exodus 31 verse 15 tells us exactly what to do :
For six days , work is to be done , but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest , holy to the LORD .
Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death .
That 's right .
The Bible commands the death penalty for anyone who works on the Sabbath , and we should obey .
Right ?
This means we have to kill tens of millions of Americans .
Should we line these tens of millions of Americans up and shoot them ?
Should we put them in giant gas chambers ?
I think we can all agree that the thought of killing millions of innocent Americans is repulsive .
A book this repulsive has no place in our society .
And make no mistake about it - the bible really means what it says .
It fully intends to be repulsive .
In Isaiah 40 verse 8 the Bible says :
The grass withers , the flower fades ; but the word of our God will stand for ever .
[ Isaiah 40 verse 8 ]
The Bible says the same thing in 1 Peter 1 verses 24 and 25 .
And in Psalm 19:7 the Bible says :
The law of the Lord is perfect .
Since the laws of the Bible are perfect , they should never change .
And then there is this .
In Matthew 5 verse 20 Jesus says : For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law , you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven .
- Matthew 5:20 According to Jesus , we must follow the laws of the Bible .
Do you believe that we should kill millions of innocent people because they work on the Sabbath ?
If not , do you want a book this repulsive to be quoted in public ?
Read to children ?
Used in our courts of law ?
Example 2 The Bible wants us to kill most people in America .
For example , the first commandment says , " Thou shalt have no other Gods before me . "
What are we supposed to do with everyone who does n't believe in God ?
We are supposed to Kill them .
Deuteronomy chapter 17 says that we are supposed to stone non-believers to death .
If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the LORD gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God in violation of his covenant , and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods , bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars of the sky �
Take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death .
�
Deut 17:2 - 7 In 2 Chronicles 15:12 - 13 : They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and soul ; and everyone who would not seek the Lord , the God of Israel , was to be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
- 2 Chron 15:12 -13 Deuteronomy 13:13 - 19 : Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods .
In such cases �you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants , as well as all the livestock .
Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it .
Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.
Deuteronomy 13:7 - 12 :
If your own full brother , or your son or daughter , or your beloved wife , or you intimate friend , entices you secretly to serve other gods � do not yield to him or listen to him , nor look with pity upon him , to spare or shield him , but kill him .
- Deut 13:7 - 12
What if you take the name of the lord in vain ?
Leviticus chapter 24 verse 16 says :
Anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death .
The entire assembly must stone him .
� Lev 24:16
The Bible is quite clear .
We must kill everyone who does not believe in God .
There are approximately 30 million people in America who do not believe in any God .
There are tens of million more who believe in gods other than the God of the Bible .
The Bible commands that we kill them all .
And keep in mind that the word of the Lord lasts forever , and the law of the lord is perfect .
Think of this as a Christian Jihad .
The idea of killing tens of millions of people because they don�t believe in God is repulsive .
Example 3
If you curse your father and mother you are to be killed :
All who curse their father or mother must be put to death .
- Leviticus 20:9 Example 4
If you commit adultery you are to be killed :
If a man commits adultery with another man 's wife - with the wife of his neighbor - both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death .
- Leviticus 20:10 Example 5
If you happen to be homosexual you are to be killed .
If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable .
They must be put to death .
- Leviticus 20:13
So let �s review : God commands us to kill : Everyone who works on the Sabbath
veryone who does not believe in God
Anyone who curses father or mother
Everyone who commits adultery
Everyone who happens to be Homosexual According to the Bible , we need to kill tens of millions of innocent Americans .
The idea of killing this many innocent people is repulsive .
The idea that people would walk around carrying a book that demands the death of tens of millions of innocent people is repulsive .
Example 6 Here�s another example of the Bible�s idiocy .
Rebellious teenagers should all be killed as well .
Here 's what the Bible says in Deuteronomy chapter 21 :
If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother , who does not heed them when they discipline him , then his father and his mother shall ... say to the elders of his town , � This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious .
He will not obey us .
He is a glutton and a drunkard . �
Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death .
- Deut 21
Think about how many American teenagers need to die .
Example 7
In Matthew 18 verses 7 through 9 , Jesus speaks :
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away .
It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire .
And if your eye causes you to sin , gouge it out and throw it away .
It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell .
- Matthew 18:7-9
This verse is repulsive on three levels :
It is repulsive because Jesus is such an idiot here .
He is completely wrong .
It is repulsive because it demands that people maim themselves .
It is repulsive because the entire concept of �hell � is repulsive .
Jesus is an idiot .
Cutting off your hand or gouging out an eye accomplishes nothing .
If you are having a problem with unproductive behaviors , what you need to do is talk with a counselor or see a therapist .
Self - amputation is absurd and repulsive .
Jesus dispenses advice that is completely useless , and recklessly dangerous as well .
Example 8
The Bible�s absolute sexism is well known , and it is repulsive .
Here are two examples : Women should remain silent in the churches .
They are not allowed to speak , but must be in submission , as the Law says .
If they want to inquire about something , they should ask their own husbands at home ; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church .
- 1 Corinthians 14 And : Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness .
I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men ; she is to keep silent .
- 1 Tim 2
We can find dozens of verses that are just as sexist .
The Bible�s sexism is both ridiculous and repulsive .
Example 9
The Bible fully supports slavery .
In fact , the Bible has been used in many cases , including the American civil war , as an authoritative justification of slavery .
Here are three examples .
Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves .
You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country , and they will become your property .
You can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life .
- Leviticus 25:44
Also :
If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result , he must be punished , but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two , since the slave is his property .
- Exodus Chapter 21:20 Also :
Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect ; they are not to be refractory , nor to pilfer , but to show entire and true fidelity .
- Titus 2:9
You can see that , according to the Bible : Buying and selling slaves is fine .
Beating slaves is fine .
Slaves are to show entire and true fidelity .
If you are an intelligent person , you know that he entire idea of slavery is repulsive .
Example 10 The Bible is riddled with repulsion .
Take , for example , this verse :
Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword .
Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes .
- Isaiah 13
Or this : Samaria shall bear her guilt , because she has rebelled against her God ; they shall fall by the sword , their little ones shall be dashed in pieces , and their pregnant women ripped open .
- Hosea 13
Or this :
Now therefore , kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him .
But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
- Numbers 31
You get the picture .
The Bible is repulsive .
You have seen ten graphic examples of repulsion in this short video .
You can find hundreds of verses like these throughout the old and new testaments .
You find Racism , sexism and bigotry gallore .
The deaths millions of innocents are chronicled in page after page of this appalling book .
There is no question that this book is repulsive .
It has no place in a modern , civilized nation .
We currently use the Bible throughout American society .
We do that , in large part , because most Americans have never read the bible and have no idea how disgusting it is .
We read from this book at weddings and funerals .
We force people to put their hands on this book in court .
We find copies of the Bible in nearly every hotel room in America .
The Bible demands that we kill everyone who works on the Sabbath .
The Bible commands us to kill teenagers who drink too much .
The Bible empowers us to enslave people of other nations .
The Bible commands that we oppress women and kill people who happen to be homosexual .
A book this repulsive has no place in our society .
It is time for the intelligent , thoughtful people of this nation to acknowledge this simple fact and act on it .

Psychological Study Reveals That Red Enhances Men's Attraction to Women
A groundbreaking study by two University of Rochester psychologists to be published online Oct. 28 by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology adds color�literally and figuratively �to the age - old question of what attracts men to women .
Through five psychological experiments , Andrew Elliot , professor of psychology , and Daniela Niesta , post - doctoral researcher , demonstrate that the color red makes men feel more amorous toward women .
And men are unaware of the role the color plays in their attraction .
The research provides the first empirical support for society 's enduring love affair with red .
From the red ochre used in ancient rituals to today 's red - light districts and red hearts on Valentine 's Day , the rosy hue has been tied to carnal passions and romantic love across cultures and millennia .
But this study , said Elliot , is the only work to scientifically document the effects of color on behavior in the context of relationships .
" It 's only recently that psychologists and researchers in other disciplines have been looking closely and systematically at the relationship between color and behavior .
Much is known about color physics and color physiology , but very little about color psychology , " said Elliot .
" It 's fascinating to find that something as ubiquitous as color can be having an effect on our behavior without our awareness . "
Although this aphrodisiacal effect of red may be a product of societal conditioning alone , the authors argue that men's response to red more likely stems from deeper biological roots .
Research has shown that nonhuman male primates are particularly attracted to females displaying red .
Female baboons and chimpanzees , for example , redden conspicuously when nearing ovulation , sending a clear sexual signal designed to attract males .
" Our research demonstrates a parallel in the way that human and nonhuman male primates respond to red , " concluded the authors .
" In doing so , our findings confirm what many women have long suspected and claimed � that men act like animals in the sexual realm .
As much as men might like to think that they respond to women in a thoughtful , sophisticated manner , it appears that at least to some degree , their preferences and predilections are , in a word , primitive . "
To quantify the red effect , the study looked at men's responses to photographs of women under a variety of color presentations .
In one experiment , test subjects looked at a woman 's photo framed by a border of either red or white and answered a series of questions , such as : " How pretty do you think this person is ? "
Other experiments contrasted red with gray , green , or blue .
When using chromatic colors like green and blue , the colors were precisely equated in saturation and brightness levels , explained Niesta .
" That way the test results could not be attributed to differences other than hue . "
In the final study , the shirt of the woman in the photograph , instead of the background , was digitally colored red or blue .
In this experiment , men were queried not only about their attraction to the woman , but their intentions regarding dating .
One question asked : " Imagine that you are going on a date with this person and have $ 100 in your wallet .
How much money would you be willing to spend on your date ? "
Under all of the conditions , the women shown framed by or wearing red were rated significantly more attractive and sexually desirable by men than the exact same women shown with other colors .
When wearing red , the woman was also more likely to score an invitation to the prom and to be treated to a more expensive outing .
The red effect extends only to males and only to perceptions of attractiveness .
Red did not increase attractiveness ratings for females rating other females and red did not change how men rated the women in the photographs in terms of likability , intelligence or kindness .
Although red enhances positive feelings in this study , earlier research suggests the meaning of a color depends on its context .
For example , Elliot and others have shown that seeing red in competition situations , such as written examinations or sporting events , leads to worse performance .
The current findings have clear implications for the dating game , the fashion industry , product design and marketing .

Women say S.A. mall cops arrested them for kissing
SAN ANTONIO — Jessica Garcia intends to prove in court that security officers at Rolling Oaks Mall unfairly targeted her and her girlfriend when they were arrested in December on trespassing and other charges .
Garcia said the officers — a Bexar County sheriff 's deputy and an employee from a private security company — began harassing them Dec. 26 because her girlfriend gave her a kiss on the cheek while sitting inside the mall on a bench .
Mall officials said the women , both 22 , were acting inappropriately and were told to leave because they were not complying with the shopping center 's code of conduct .
Danielle Pardue , the mall 's marketing director , denies the women 's claims of discrimination and said security officers would evict anyone found kissing in the mall , regardless of sexual orientation .
“ If our security officer feels that is disruptive to our shoppers and our business , then they have that authority to make that determination , ” she said .
“ It 's their responsibility to make sure our shopping place is an enjoyable shopping place for everyone to be . ”
Pardue also stressed that contrary to what the women claim , they were n't arrested because they were kissing , but because they re-entered the mall after being told to leave .
But Garcia feels otherwise .
She was scheduled to appear in court today , but her lawyer had to postpone the date for later this month .
Garcia said the officers intentionally harassed the couple , accusing them of kissing and having “ swapped spit . ”
Civil rights advocates expressed dismay over the mall 's policy against public displays of affection , such as kissing , and question the wide discretion officers have to enforce it .
“ What if they 're holding hands , is that going to be enough ? ” asked Patrick Filyk , president of the San Antonio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ Seems like a real slippery slope for management . ”
J. Lynne Armstrong , co-chairwoman of the Stonewall Democrats of San Antonio and a clinical counselor , said such a policy raises troubling questions .
“ It 's surprising to me that that would be a policy anywhere , because how can you enforce that , No. 1 ? ” Armstrong asked .
“ Or , how can you dictate how people choose to be expressive with one another ?
Makes you wonder , does n't it ? ”
Armstrong said her organization provides sensitivity training to the San Antonio Police Department regarding same - sex issues , and she offered to provide the same training to the mall 's security officers .
Garcia said that after her girlfriend gave her a kiss on the cheek , the officers approached them and warned them to stop .
“ He said , ‘ This is a family mall , y'all can't do this , ' ” she said .
“ We said , ‘ Do what ? '
He said , ‘ Y'all kissed , and if y'all do it again I 'm going to write you a citation or I 'm going to kick y'all out . ' ”
Garcia said she and her girlfriend were bothered by the officer 's comments and told him they were n't kissing .
Pardue initially said it was the kissing that gained the officers ' attention , but she later clarified that the officers approached the women to tell them to sit properly on the bench .
She said one of the women was sitting on the other 's lap — a claim Garcia disputes .
Garcia said her girlfriend had the lower portion of her leg around hers , from the knee down .
She said neither was sitting on top of the other .
“ They ( the officers ) passed people who were kissing and they did n't tell them anything , but they came to us , ” Garcia said .
“ We did n't even kiss .
All she did is she kissed me on my cheek .
There 's no other way to explain it .
They discriminated against us . ”
Both Garcia and Pardue agree the incident escalated after that .
Pardue said the women complied briefly with the officer 's request , but once the officers began walking away , they continued to engage in an “ activity that was not appropriate for the public . ”
She said that at that point , the officers told the women to leave .
Garcia said she and her girlfriend walked out of the mall , but re-entered through another entrance in order to take a shortcut to their car , which was parked on the other side .
Pardue said that when security found the women back inside the mall , they were confronted about trespassing , and that 's when the women became disruptive and physical with the officers .
Garcia said she attempted to tell the officers she was merely trying to get to her car , but the officers kept harassing her and her girlfriend and the situation deteriorated .
In the end , she was charged with trespassing , resisting arrest and assault on a peace officer , while her girlfriend was charged with trespassing .
Pardue said the mall 's code of conduct is posted at all its entrances , stating disruptive or disorderly conduct is n't tolerated .
It says nothing about kissing , however .
Simon Property Group operates both Rolling Oaks Mall and Ingram Mall in San Antonio .
“ Our mall is a commercial venue that provides a shopping experience with respect to all races , religions and orientations , ” Pardue said .
“ We would have enforced the same policies had it been a heterosexual couple . ”
Garcia said her girlfriend has suffered both physically and emotionally because of the arrest .
“ This has never happened to us , ” she said .
“ We have n't been to the mall since then . ”
Today , Take
Two have done some talking , some of it was interesting like their release schedule , but most of it was financial stuff in their first quarter ’09 report .
However out of the financials came the news that sales of GTA IV were approximately split 50/50 across platforms .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
Takes Two ’s Chief Financial Officer Elaine Goldstein , was asked “ can you give us an idea as to this 13 million GTA 4 units , how many of those are Xbox 360 platform ? ” she replied “ It ’s approximately 50/50 ”
If this is correct I find it quite surprising because ( due to the year head - start ) there is reportedly 6 - 8 million more 360 ’s out in the wild than there are PS3’s .
It may be even more surprising as Microsoft famously paid a small fortune for timed exclusive DLC for the title .
Via SeekingAlpha .
August 15 , 2005 , began as a day of infamy .
It ushered in a great tribulation for the Jewish state , but one forced upon it by its very own Prime Minister , Ariel Sharon .
It began one day after the annual commemoration of the saddest day in the Jewish calendar , Tisha B ' Av , the ninth day of the Hebrew month of Av when , according to tradition , both Temples in Jerusalem were destroyed ; the first one by the Babylonians in 586 BC and the second by the Romans in 70 AD .
On that August day , the Jews of Gaza began to be driven from their homes by Israeli soldiers and police acting on the orders of their Prime Minister .
The tragedy ended one week later , known now by its euphemism -- disengagement .
Its self - imposed execution ushered in a needless catastrophe for Israel and eventually led to the occupation of Gaza by Hamas through an election engineered by Condoleezza Rice .
Hamas thus came to power using a democratic tool and subsequently destroyed its rival , Fatah , in a bloody massacre ; the same Hamas , which proclaims its Constitution is the Koran and implacably calls for the destruction of Israel .
Israel woke up to relentless daily barrages of sometimes scores of missiles deliberately aimed at its civilian populations in villages and towns .
The little town of Sderot , in particular , became Israel 's Stalingrad .
Finally , after years of astonishing forbearance and thousands of incoming rockets from Gaza , Israel struck back against a cruel Islamic enemy , which gloried in using its own civilians as human shields .
In the years during this Palestinian Arab aggression there were hardly any street protests anywhere .
The 2009 Gaza War , however , allowed pent up hatred of the Jewish state to be used as an excuse for vicious anti-Israel and anti-Jewish demonstrations exploding throughout Europe and the world .
The snake pit for much of this venom originates now on College campuses .
After enduring hundreds of years of Christian and Moslem discrimination in exile , Jews felt that with the re-birth of their ancestral homeland , Jewish communities would no longer face the horrors of being dragged from their homes .
Ariel Sharon dealt a blow of seismic proportions to that belief .
His rationale was that by disengaging from the Palestinians in Gaza it would grant Israel peace from Arab terror and end the genocidal ambitions of Palestinian Arabs .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Instead , Sharon and his deputy , Ehud Olmert , created a roadmap leading to yet more worldwide pressure .
U.S. Ambassador George Mitchell is planning to remain in Jerusalem to do one thing only .
By entrapping Netanyahu and Israeli leaders , in order to coerce Israel into giving away its ancestral and biblical lands in Judea and Samaria ( the West Bank ) , he works to create for the first time in history an independent Arab state called Palestine .
Jews will not be permitted to remain in their Judean and Samarian ( West Bank ) homes and will be expelled .
Arabs may live in Israel but Jews are forbidden to live in Palestinian Arab territories .
They are to be victims of ethnic cleansing .
Apartheid !
Arab style .
Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , with her so - called dream team , is preparing to do the same as Ambassador Mitchell .
Meanwhile , President Obama is reaching out to the terrorist enabling states of Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran .
He is promising nearly one billion dollars to the Palestinian Authority - three hundred million for Gaza - U.S. taxpayer money that will inevitably all end up in the coffers of Hamas .
And at the Sharm el Sheikh donor conference , 70 countries will reportedly pledge 2.8 billion dollars to Gaza reconstruction even as Hamas missiles continue their renewed daily barrage on Sderot using fresh Iranian missiles supplied through Egypt .
Palestinian Arabs will never accept the existence of a Jewish state on any of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea .
Nor are they willing to abandon their belief , indoctrinated for decades , that all of Israel is " occupied territory . "
Simply put , if Israel shrinks to one downtown square in Tel Aviv the Palestinian Arabs will still not be satisfied .
Imagine the unthinkable , that Israel ceases to exist ; a desire that galvanizes Jew bashers everywhere into orgasmic delight .
Or imagine that Israeli leaders continue to engage in further disengagements under the rubric of land for peace ; a recipe for slow but certain Israeli extinction .
So what would a world without Israel be like ?
For starters , the only true functioning democracy in the region will have vanished .
Since there will still be autocratic Arab dictators , kings , emirs and sheikhs , corruption , over - population , and socio- economic dislocation , the unelected Arab despots will have to find a new scapegoat towards whom to deflect their population 's endemic anger and despair .
Palestine , the fraudulent state that Israel haters finally foisted upon the world , will remain as underdeveloped as most other Arab states despite enormous donor sums forever falling like manna into a black hole .
Saddled with the highest birthrate in the world , most Palestinian Arabs will remain unemployed because of the inability of their terrorist government to create viable institutions and infrastructures and because there will no longer be an Israel for the Palestinian Arabs to work in .
Both Jordan and Egypt will be terrified of the fatal exposure on their borders of this new Iranian and Al Qaida backed Palestinian base for worldwide terror .
Not a prospect the U.S. should be happy about either .
Syria will still menace and subvert the once predominately Christian state of Lebanon and still make territorial demands upon Jordan and Palestine , which it always considered historically part of southern Syria .
Those Arab states without oil will still envy those Arab states awash with the commodity , and water , always in short supply in the Middle East , will become the most precious liquid to wage war over .
The intra-Islamic animosity between the Sunnis and the Shia will not abate but become ever more violent in civil wars , especially after the U.S. finally withdraws all its forces from Iraq , now slated by Obama for 2011 .
No doubt Al Qaeda and Iran will have taken note and are plotting accordingly .
Egypt will still be discriminating against its Christian Coptic minority despite endless denials .
Christians will continue to endure persecution in an increasingly Arab and Moslem dominated world from Africa to Indonesia .
Hindus will still be victims of Moslem terror and the Kashmir issue will remain a flashpoint between Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan -- both nuclear powers .
Buddhists in Thailand will still be battling Moslem insurgents in the south of that country as will the Christians in the south of the Philippines .
Cairo , the capital of the largest and most powerful Arab state , will continue vying with Damascus and Riyadh for leadership of the Arab world 's own version of the 19th century 's Great Game .
And all the while the menace of non-Arab Iran will loom over them all .
The ever suffering Kurds , who truly deserve an independent state of their own , will still be pressing Iraq , Turkey , Syria , and Iran for such a state and those countries will still be violently denying them their national aspirations .
Iran 's mullahs will still be hell - bent on developing even more Islamic nuclear bombs .
Such weapons atop ever more powerful ICBMs and perhaps now located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean will inevitably threaten the West -- and Israel will not be there to be blamed .
Al - Qaeda , even without Osama bin Laden , will still receive enormous funds from Islamic and Arab states and continue its campaign against the " infidels . "
Even without the excuse of U.S. troops any longer in Iraq , the Islamists will target Europe and America with suicide killers , just as they perpetrated their grisly work among hapless Israeli civilians .
All this will be the reality in a world that can no longer have Israel to blame for its ills .
The world hated the stateless Jews and now it hates the State of the Jews .
But Israel may yet survive and find leaders who present a strong , resolute defiance to the world 's siren calls for it to commit national suicide , all for the sake of an illusory peace .
From Madrid to Oslo to Camp David great demands were made upon Israel to take risks for peace , the majority of which Israel met .
Far lesser demands were made upon the Palestinian Arabs , which they have hardly ever met .
President Obama , nevertheless , plans on perpetuating the discredited two - state solution and will press Israel to give away its biblical heartland to create the 23rd Arab state .
That is the goal of Hillary Clinton and her so - called dream team .
But dreams often become nightmares .
President Reagan at first believed the received wisdom that all problems in the Middle East stemmed from the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
It was Israel 's Menachem Begin who disabused him of that fallacy and educated him on biblical and post biblical Jewish history in its ancestral homeland .
Prime Minister Begin and President Reagan , though from very different backgrounds , were both conservatives .
Binyamin Netanyahu is a fiscal conservative while President Obama is anything but , and the President 's foreign policy as it relates to the Israel - Arab conflict is jarringly in opposition to that of Netanyahu and Israel 's conservative parties .
Netanyahu may yet educate the new American President to the ties that bind Israel to its land and to the immense dangers to all from Iran .
Perhaps he will be the man to save both Israel and the United States from irreparable harm .
If not , all the democracies of the world will stumble before Iran 's ascendant theocracy and Israel will not be there for them to blame .
The Myth of the Clinton Surplus October 31st , 2007
The government can have a surplus even if it has trillions in debt , but it cannot have a surplus if that debt increased every year .
This article is about surplus / deficit , not the debt .
However , it analyzes the debt to prove there was n't a surplus under Clinton .
For those that want a more detailed explanation of why a claimed $ 236 billion surplus resulted in the national debt increasing by $ 18 billion , please read this follow - up article .
Time and time again , anyone reading the mainstream news or reading articles on the Internet will read the claim that President Clinton not only balanced the budget , but had a surplus .
This is then used as an argument to further highlight the fiscal irresponsibility of the federal government under the Bush administration .
The claim is generally made that Clinton had a surplus of $ 69 billion in FY1998 , $ 123 billion in FY1999 and $ 230 billion in FY2000 not the sum of the alleged surpluses of the three years in question ( $ 69B + $ 123B + $ 230B = $ 422B , not $ 360B ) .
While not defending the increase of the federal debt under President Bush , it 's curious to see Clinton 's record promoted as having generated a surplus .
It never happened .
There was never a surplus and the facts support that position .
In fact , far from a $ 360 billion reduction in the national debt in FY1998 - FY2000 , there was an increase of $ 281 billion .
Verifying this is as simple as accessing the
Fiscal
Year Year
Ending National Debt Deficit FY1993
09/30/1993 $ 4.411488 trillion FY1994 09/30/1994 $ 4.692749 trillion $ 281.26 billion FY1995
09/29/1995 $ 4.973982 trillion $ 281.23 billion FY1996
09/30/1996 $ 5.224810 trillion $ 250.83 billion FY1997
09/30/1997 $ 5.413146 trillion $ 188.34 billion FY1998
09/30/1998 $ 5.526193 trillion $ 113.05 billion FY1999
09/30/1999 $ 5.656270 trillion $ 130.08 billion FY2000 09/29/2000 $ 5.674178 trillion $ 17.91 billion FY2001 09/28/2001 $ 5.807463 trillion $ 133.29 billion
As can clearly be seen , in no year did the national debt go down , nor did Clinton leave President Bush with a surplus that Bush subsequently turned into a deficit .
Yes , the deficit was almost eliminated in FY2000 ( ending in September 2000 with a deficit of " only " $ 17.9 billion ) , but it never reached zero -- let alone a positive surplus number .
And Clinton 's last budget proposal for FY2001 , which ended in September 2001 , generated a $ 133.29 billion deficit .
The growing deficits started in the year of the last Clinton budget , not in the first year of the Bush administration .
Keep in mind that President Bush took office in January 2001 and his first budget took effect October 1 , 2001 for the year ending September 30 , 2002 ( FY2002 ) .
So the $ 133.29 billion deficit in the year ending September 2001 was Clinton's .
Granted , Bush supported a tax refund where taxpayers received checks in 2001 .
However , the total amount refunded to taxpayers was only $ 38 billion
Clinton clearly did not achieve a surplus and he did n't leave President Bush with a surplus .
So why do they say he had a surplus ?
As is usually the case in claims such as this , it has to do with Washington doublespeak and political smoke and mirrors .
Understanding what happened requires understanding two concepts of what makes up the national debt .
The national debt is made up of public debt and intragovernmental holdings .
The public debt is debt held by the public , normally including things such as treasury bills , savings bonds , and other instruments the public can purchase from the government .
Intragovernmental holdings , on the other hand , is when the government borrows money from itself - - mostly borrowing money from social security .
Looking at the makeup of the national debt and the claimed surpluses for the last 4 Clinton fiscal years , we have the following table :
Fiscal

Notice that while the public debt went down in each of those four years , the intragovernmental holdings went up each year by a far greater amount -- and , in turn , the total national debt ( which is public debt + intragovernmental holdings ) went up .
Therein lies the discrepancy .
When it is claimed that Clinton paid down the national debt , that is patently false -- as can be seen , the national debt went up every single year .
What Clinton did do was pay down the public debt -- notice that the claimed surplus is relatively close to the decrease in the public debt for those years .
But he paid down the public debt by borrowing far more money in the form of intragovernmental holdings ( mostly Social Security ) .
Update 3/31/2009 :
The following quote from an article at CBS confirms my explanation of the Myth of the Clinton Surplus , and the entire article essentially substantiates what I wrote .
" Over the past 25 years , the government has gotten used to the fact that Social Security is providing free money to make the rest of the deficit look smaller , " said Andrew Biggs , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute .
Interestingly , this most likely was not even a conscious decision by Clinton .
The Social Security Administration is legally required to take all its surpluses and buy U.S. Government securities , and the U.S. Government readily sells those securities -- which automatically and immediately becomes intragovernmental holdings .
The economy was doing well due to the dot - com bubble and people were earning a lot of money and paying a lot into Social Security .
Since Social Security had more money coming in than it had to pay in benefits to retired persons , all that extra money was immediately used to buy U.S. Government securities .
The government was still running deficits , but since there was so much money coming from excess Social Security contributions there was no need to borrow more money directly from the public .
As such , the public debt went down while intragovernmental holdings continued to skyrocket .
The net effect was that the national debt most definitely did not get paid down because we did not have a surplus .
The government just covered its deficit by borrowing money from Social Security rather than the public .
Consider the following quotes ( and accompanying links ) that demonstrate how people have known this for years :
In the late 1990s , the government was running what it -- and a largely unquestioning Washington press corps -- called budget " surpluses . "
But the national debt still increased in every single one of those years because the government was borrowing money to create the " surpluses . "
So the table itself , according to the figures issued yesterday , showed the Federal Government ran a surplus .
Absolutely false .
This reporter ought to do his work .
This crowd never has asked for or kept up with or checked the facts .
Eric Planin -- all he has to do is not spread rumors or get into the political message .
Both Democrats and Republicans are all running this year and next and saying surplus , surplus .
Look what we have done .
It is false .
The actual figures show that from the beginning of the fiscal year until now we had to borrow $ 127,800,000,000 .
- Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings , October 28 , 1999 Video : CSPAN
An overall " downsizing " of government and a virtual end to the arms race have contributed to the surplus , but the vast majority is coming from excess Social Security taxes being paid by the workforce in an attempt to keep Social Security benefit checks coming once the " baby - boomers " start to retire .
Of the $ 142 billion surplus projected by the end of 2000 , $ 137 billion will come from excess Social Security taxes .
When these unified budget numbers are separated into Social Security and non-Social Security components , however , it becomes evident that all of the projected surplus throughout this period is attributable to Social Security .
The remainder of the budget will remain in deficit throughout the next decade .
Despite a revenue shortfall , full benefits are expected to be paid out between 2017 and 2041 .
The system will draw on its trust fund , a collection of special - issue bonds from the government , which borrowed prodigiously from the program 's surplus over the years .
But since the country is already running a deficit , the government will have to borrow more money to pay back its debt to Social Security .
That 's a little like giving with one hand and taking away with the other .
The surplus deception is clearly discernible in the statistics of national debt .
While the spenders are boasting about surpluses , the national debt is rising year after year .
In 1998 , the first year of the legerdemain surplus , it rose from $ 5.413 trillion to $ 5.526 trillion , due to a deficit of $ 112.9 billion ...
The federal government spends Social Security money and other trust funds which constitute obligations to present and future recipients .
It consumes them and thereby incurs obligations as binding as those to the owners of savings bonds .
Yet , the Treasury treats them as revenue and hails them for generating surpluses .
If a private banker were to treat trust fund deposits as income and profit , he would face criminal charges .
Are intragovernmental holdings really debt ?
Yes , intragovernmental debt is every bit as real as the public debt .
It 's not " a wash " simply because the government owes the money to " itself . "
As I explained in a public debt under Clinton .
Update 3/31/2009 : The Social Security " surplus " -- which has been borrowed by the Federal Government every year , including under Clinton to generate the " surplus " -- is now expected to evaporate within a year ( 2009 or 2010 ) rather than the 2017 mentioned above .
The following quote also provides additional evidence that the " surplus " was indeed borrowed from Social Security " for decades . "
With unemployment rising , the payroll tax revenue that finances Social Security benefits for nearly 51 million retirees and other recipients is falling , according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office .
As a result , the trust fund 's annual surplus is forecast to all but vanish next year -- nearly a decade ahead of schedule -- and deprive the government of billions of dollars it had been counting on to help balance the nation 's books ....
The Treasury Department has for decades borrowed money from the Social Security trust fund to finance government operations .
If it is no longer able to do so , it could be forced to borrow an additional $ 700 billion over the next decade from China , Japan and other investors .
And at some point , perhaps as early as 2017 , according to the CBO , the Treasury would have to start repaying the billions it has borrowed from the trust fund over the past 25 years , driving the nation further into debt or forcing Congress to raise taxes .
The Federal Government cannot just wave a magic wand and somehow " write off " the intragovernmental debt .
Essentially , citizens invested money in Social Security and Social Security invested that money in the Federal Government .
Now Social Security effectively owes you money ( in the form of future retirement benefits ) and wo n't be able to pay you that money if the Federal Government just cancels the intragovernmental debt .
The only way the Federal Government can " write off " intragovernmental debt is if it simultaneously eliminates the Social Security system .
That might very well be a
In short , if the government does n't pay back intragovernmental holdings , other government agencies ( like Social Security ) will fail .
Since allowing Social Security to fail is not a politically viable option , the debt represented by intragovernmental holdings is just as real as the public debt .
It ca n't just be eliminated by some fancy accounting trick or political maneuvering .
If it were possible , believe me , politicians would have done it already and taken credit for reducing the national debt by trillions of dollars .
Trust Funds = Intragovernmental Debt
Social Security is n't the only trust fund in the federal budget .
There are a number of others including the civil service retirement fund , federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund , unemployment trust fund , military retirement trust fund , etc .
All of these trust funds , like Social Security , invest their surpluses in U.S. government bonds and increase intragovernmental debt .
And like Social Security , their surpluses really should n't count toward a " surplus " because the excess money they contribute to federal coffers actually has to be borrowed by the government from the trust funds .
When the government declared a $ 236 billion surplus in fiscal year 2000 , it literally borrowed $ 248 billion from trust funds and considered that borrowed money " income " which it counted towards a " surplus . "
For a more detailed explanation of how the government borrowed from trust funds and used the borrowed money to count towards an alleged surplus , please read
The reality of the national debt
The only debt that matters is the total national debt .
You can have a surplus and a debt at the same time , but you can't have a surplus if the amount of debt is going up each year .
And the national debt went up every single year under Clinton .
Had Clinton really had a surplus the national debt would have gone down .
It did n't go down precisely because Clinton had a deficit every single year .
The U.S. Treasury 's historical record of the national debt verifies this .
A balanced budget or a budget surplus is a great thing , but it 's only relevant if the budget surplus turns into a real surplus at the end of the fiscal year .
In Clinton 's case , it never did .
COMMON RESPONSES TO THIS ARTICLE
Since this article has become a popular reference for people debunking the myth of the Clinton surplus , I have seen a number of responses made by those that cannot seem to accept the fact that there was never a surplus .
Some of those responses are listed here and I explain why the responses are invalid .
Adjusting the National Debt for Inflation or as % of GDP
A common tactic used by those that cling to the myth of the Clinton surplus seems to be showing a bar graph of the total national debt adjusted for inflation , or depicted as a percentage of GDP .
When you adjust for inflation or show the debt as a percentage of GDP , it looks like the national debt went down for a year or two under Clinton .
However , that does not mean Clinton had a surplus , it simply means inflation was increasing faster than the national debt or the economy was expanding faster than the national debt .
That does not change the fact that Clinton never had a surplus .
Explained another way , adjusting the national debt for inflation is valid for comparing the debt load of the federal government but it has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the federal government had a surplus a given year .
If you spend more than you take in in a given year , you have a deficit even if your relative debt load went down because of inflation .
Explained numerically , let 's say you owe $ 50,000 , earn $ 30,000 , and spend $ 31,000 ( debt load=50,000/30,000=167 % ) -- that leaves you with a deficit of $ 1000 so that the following year you owe $ 51,000 .
The next year inflation is 5 % so you now earn $ 31,500 and spend $ 32,550 with a deficit of $ 1,050 .
$ 31,500 in earnings with a $ 51,000 debt is a 162 % debt load -- so your relative debt load went down thanks entirely to inflation but you still had a deficit of $ 1,050 that year and your debt continued to grow .
It would n't be accurate to claim that you had a surplus because your debt load went down even though you spent more than you earned .
That 's what people are saying when they try to adjust the national debt for inflation to claim a surplus .
The bottom line is that the national debt going down as adjusted for inflation or as a percentage of GDP is a valid metric for evaluating the debt load of the government but it says nothing about whether or not there was a surplus .
If the total national debt went up , there was a deficit .
Those that think a decrease in the debt load of the federal government as a percentage of GDP or adjusted for inflation is equivalent to a same - year surplus do n't understand the definitions and purposes of each of these terms .
Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) vs. These " Partisan " Numbers
Another common response to the above explanation of the myth of the Clinton surplus is that the budget surpluses are based on the numbers produced by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) .
Indeed if you access the CBO 's " historic budget data " document , on the fist page you will see that 1998 shows a surplus of $ 69 billion , 1999 shows $ 126 billion , 2000 shows $ 236 billion -- the same surpluses claimed by Clinton and CNN in the article mentioned at the top of this page .
However , further analysis of the document should make it very clear that important information is missing from the CBO document -- specifically focusing on the last two columns of the table on page 1 .
If you take the $ 3,772.3 billion debt held by the public at the end of 1997 and subtract the " total " $ 69.3 billion surplus stated for 1998 , you would expect to see the debt go down by 69.3 billion to $ 3,703 billion .
Instead , the debt indicated for 1998 is $ 3,721.1 billion -- suggesting a surplus of only $ 51.2 billion .
This alone should tell you that the CBO numbers are n't telling the whole story because they do n't add up -- and the story they are n't telling is intragovernmental holdings .
The reality is that the federal government and politicians use a form of accounting that would get most accountants thrown in jail .
As USA Today wrote in 2007 , special rules used by the federal government allowed it to report a $ 248 billion deficit in 2006 rather than $ 1.3 trillion if it had used corporate - style accounting .
While the CBO may be non-partisan , that does not mean the CBO is non-political nor that their numbers are honest or transparent .
Update 4/26/2009 : Please read this note where President Obama , too , is trying to get certain government expenditures not " counted " in the official CBO deficit even though they 'll cost billions of dollars and increase the national debt .
As this paragraph has explained , CBO numbers are not to be trusted as an accurate reflection of reality .
The fact remains that the total national debt , as explained above , is the only real measure of what we owe .
We can discuss the meaning of the different columns of the CBO documents and what they do and do n't include , and we can argue about the accounting tricks that the federal government uses for political reasons .
But the fact remains that the Bureau of the Public Debt is responsible for the daily reporting of the total national debt .
Regardless of how politicians play with the budget numbers , the current national debt reported by the Bureau of the Public Debt is what we owe .
If , at the end of each year , we owe more than we did the previous year , politicians can call it a surplus until the cows come home -- but the fact remains that we owed more money than we did the previous year .
Playing accounting and political games to call it a " surplus " does n't change the fact that we 're even more in debt than we were the year before .
During the Clinton years , the total national debt increased every year .
Only in Washington D.C. would that somehow be considered a " surplus . "
There was a Surplus Not Counting Interest and " Off - Budget " Items
It is sometimes claimed that there was a surplus but the national debt did n't go down because of interest payments on the existing debt , or because of " off - budget " items .
Anyone that makes this claim is just buying into twisted Washington accounting games that are convenient for their argument .
The reality is that " off - budget " items and interest payments on the debt are real government expenditures just like any other .
Off - budget items are declared as such by the stroke of a pen specifically for political reasons but it does not change the fact that they are part of government expenses .
To demonstrate the fallacy of this argument , consider this :
We have a budget surplus right now , too , if we declare the department of Health and Human Services to be " off - budget . "
After all , Congress and the president can do that with the stroke of a pen .
Presto , we now have a surplus !
Of course , we would n't really have a surplus .
And neither did Clinton .
It 's just a matter of saying that some expenses do n't " count " even though they do .
There Was a Surplus But It Was n't Used to Pay Down The Debt
Some people claim that there was a surplus but it was n't used to pay down the debt .
They claim that one issue is whether or not you have a surplus and another issue is what you do with it ; hence they also claim that you can have a surplus and not have the national debt go down .
However , this is not true .
If there was a surplus and it was n't used to pay down the debt , then that means it was spent -- which means even if there could have been a surplus , it evaporated the moment it was spent .
During the Clinton years , not only was it spent -- the government borrowed even more !
Every year !
It 's like earning $ 30 k in a year and only having $ 29 k in expenses -- so you have a $ 1000 surplus .
To celebrate , you then go out and spend $ 2000 on a new LCD TV .
All the sudden you earned $ 30 k and spent $ 31 k and what originally looked like a $ 1000 surplus is now a $ 1000 deficit and you 're even further in debt .
You almost had your financial house in order but then you went out and spent the " extra " money rather than saving it or paying off some of your existing debt .
In short , if the government had a surplus and spent it on anything other than paying down the national debt , there was no longer a surplus the moment the money was spent on something else .
Comparing National Debt on January 1st
Some have responded by saying that Clinton had a surplus and paid down the debt because , when they compare the national debt from one January 1st to the next , the debt does show a decrease .
This may be an honest mistake , but the government 's fiscal year is from October 1st through September 30th .
All government and budgetary activities are based on that fiscal year so it is necessary to do debt comparisons using that same fiscal year .
As a result , all comparisons should be made either on September 30th or October 1st ... not January 1st .
FactCheck.org Says Clinton Had a Surplus
FactCheck.org repeats and uses the same government numbers that this article illustrates to be misleading .

Some people have claimed that the link I provided ( http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np) is an illegitimate or fraudulent site that provides false numbers .

I am providing a direct link to the U.S. Treasury , Bureau of the Public Debt , National Debt to the Penny website .
This is the official website that the U.S. government provides which allows the public to track the debt .
Time and time again , anyone reading the mainstream news or reading articles on the Internet will read the claim that President Clinton not only balanced the budget , but had a surplus .
This is then used as an argument to further highlight the fiscal irresponsibility of the federal government under the Bush administration .
The claim is generally made that Clinton had a surplus of $ 69 billion in FY1998 , $ 123 billion in FY1999 and $ 230 billion in FY2000 .
In that same link , Clinton claimed that the national debt had been reduced by $ 360 billion in the last three years , presumably FY1998 , FY1999 , and FY2000 -- though , interestingly , $ 360 billion isthe sum of the alleged surpluses of the three years in question ( $ 69B + $ 123B + $ 230B = $ 422B , not $ 360B ) .
While not defending the increase of the federal debt under President Bush , it 's curious to see Clinton 's record promoted as having generated a surplus .
Verifying this is as simple as accessing the U.S. Treasury ( see note about this link below ) website where the national debt is updated daily and a history of the debt since January 1993 can be obtained .
Considering the government 's fiscal year ends on the last day of September each year , and considering Clinton 's budget proposal in 1993 took effect in October 1993 and concluded September 1994 ( FY1994 ) , here 's the national debt at the end of each year of Clinton Budgets :
As can clearly be seen , in no year did the national debt go down , nor did Clinton leave President Bush with a surplus that Bush subsequently turned into a deficit .
Yes , the deficit waseliminated in FY2000 ( ending in September 2000 with a deficit of " only " $ 17.9 billion ) , but it never reached zero -- let alone a positive surplus number .
And Clinton 's last budget proposal for FY2001 , which ended in September 2001 , generated a $ 133.29 billion deficit .
The growing deficits started in the year of the last Clinton budget , not in the first year of the Bush administration .
Keep in mind that President Bush took office in January 2001 and his first budget took effect October 1 , 2001 for the year ending September 30 , 2002 ( FY2002 ) .
So the $ 133.29 billion deficit in the year ending September 2001 Clinton's .
Granted , Bush supported a tax refund where taxpayers received checks in 2001 .
However , the total amount refunded to taxpayers was only $ 38 billion .
So even if we assume that $ 38 billion of the FY2001 deficit was due to Bush 's tax refunds which were not part of Clinton 's last budget , that still means that Clinton 's last budget produced a deficit of 133.29 - 38 = $ 95.29 billion .
Clinton clearly did not achieve a surplus and he did n't leave President Bush with a surplus .
As is usually the case in claims such as this , it has to do with Washington doublespeak and political smoke and mirrors .
Understanding what happened requires understanding two concepts of what makes up the national debt .
The national debt is made up of public debt and intragovernmental holdings .
The public debt is debt held by the public , normally including things such as treasury bills , savings bonds , and other instruments the public can purchase from the government .
Intragovernmental holdings , on the other hand , is when the government borrows money from itself - - mostly borrowing money from social security .
Looking at the makeup of the national debt and the claimed surpluses for the last 4 Clinton fiscal years , we have the following table : Notice that while thedebt went down in each of those four years , thewent up each year by a far greater amount -- and , in turn , the totaldebt ( which is public debt + intragovernmental holdings ) went up .
Therein lies the discrepancy .
When it is claimed that Clinton paid down the national debt , that is patently false -- as can be seen , the national debt went up every single year .
What Clintondo was pay down thedebt -- notice that the claimed surplus is relatively close to the decrease in the public debt for those years .
But he paid down the public debt by borrowing farmoney in the form of intragovernmental holdings ( mostly Social Security ) .
Interestingly , this most likely was not even a conscious decision by Clinton .
The Social Security Administration is legally required to take all its surpluses and buy U.S. Government securities , and the U.S. Government readily sells those securities -- which automatically and immediately becomes intragovernmental holdings .
The economy was doing well due to the dot - com bubble and people were earning a lot of money and paying a lot into Social Security .
Since Social Security had more money coming in than it had to pay in benefits to retired persons , all that extra money was immediately used to buy U.S. Government securities .
The government was still running deficits , but since there was so much money coming from excess Social Security contributions there was no need to borrow more money directly from the public .
As such , thedebt went down while intragovernmental holdings continued to skyrocket .
The net effect was that the national debt most definitely didget paid down because we didhave a surplus .
The government just covered its deficit by borrowing money from Social Security rather than the public .
Consider the following quotes ( and accompanying links ) that demonstrate how people have known this for years :
Yes , intragovernmental debt is every bit as real as the public debt .
It 's not " a wash " simply because the government owes the money to " itself .
"
As I explained in a previous article , Social Security is legally required to use all its surpluses to buy U.S. Government securities .
From Social Security 's standpoint , it has a multi-trillion dollar reserve in the form of U.S. Government securities .
When the Social Security system starts to falter due to insufficient contributions to pay for all the benefits of retiring baby - boomers , probably around 2017 , it will start cashing those securities and will expect the U.S. Government to pay it back , with interest .
The problem is , the government does n't have the money .
The money has already been spent -- in part , effectively , to pay down thedebt under Clinton .
The Federal Governmentjust wave a magic wand and somehow " write off " the intragovernmental debt .
Essentially , citizens invested money in Social Security and Social Security invested that money in the Federal Government .
Now Social Security effectively owes you money ( in the form of future retirement benefits ) andbe able to pay you that money if the Federal Government just cancels the intragovernmental debt .
The only way the Federal Government can " write off " intragovernmental debt is if it simultaneously eliminates the Social Security system .
That might very well be a good idea , but it is n't likely .
And Social Security will start running out of money in about 2017 if the Federal Government does n't honor those intragovernmental holdings as real debt .
In short , if the government does n't pay back intragovernmental holdings , other government agencies ( like Social Security ) will fail .
Since allowing Social Security to fail is not a politically viable option , the debt represented by intragovernmental holdings is just as real as the public debt .
It ca n't just be eliminated by some fancy accounting trick or political maneuvering .
If it were possible , believe me , politicians would have done it already and taken credit for reducing the national debt by trillions of dollars .
Social Security is n't the only trust fund in the federal budget .
There are a number of others including the civil service retirement fund , federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund , unemployment trust fund , military retirement trust fund , etc .
All of these trust funds , like Social Security , invest their surpluses in U.S. government bonds and increase intragovernmental debt .
And like Social Security , their surpluses really should n't count toward a " surplus " because the excess money they contribute to federal coffers actually has to beby the government from the trust funds .
When the government declared a $ 236 billion surplus in fiscal year 2000 , it literally borrowed $ 248 billion from trust funds and considered that borrowed money " income " which it counted towards a " surplus .
" For a more detailed explanation of how the government borrowed from trust funds and used the borrowed money to count towards an alleged surplus , please read this follow - up article which goes into more detail on the subject of government accounting .
The only debt that matters is the totaldebt .
You can have a surplus and a debt at the same time , but youhave a surplus if the amount of debt is going up each year .
And the national debt wentevery single year under Clinton .
Had Clinton really had a surplus thedebt would have gone down .
It did n't go down precisely because Clinton had a deficit every single year .
The U.S. Treasury 's historical record of the national debt verifies this .
A balanced budget or a budget surplus is a great thing , but it 's only relevant if the budget surplus turns into asurplus at the end of the fiscal year .
In Clinton 's case , it never did .
The assertion that my article points people to a fraudulent website is incorrect .
I am providing a direct link to the U.S. Treasury , Bureau of the Public Debt , National Debt to the Penny website .
This is the official website that the U.S. government provides which allows the public to track the debt .

Yojiro Takita 's internationally acclaimed Departures has become a global phenomenon since its success at this years Academy Awards , when it won the Best Foreign Language Film .
Departures tells the story of Daigo Kobayashi ( Masahiro Matoki ) , a devoted cellist in an orchestra that has just been dissolved who now finds himself without a job .
Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work and start over .
He answers a classified ad entitled " Departures " thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a " Nokanshi " or " encoffineer , " a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life .
While his wife and others despise the job , Daigo takes a certain pride in his work and begins to perfect the art of " Nokanshi , " acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life and death , between the departed and the family of the departed .
The film follows his profound and sometimes comical journey with death as he uncovers the wonder , joy and meaning of life and living .
What happened
Banking behemoth Citigroup agreed to sell a 51 percent stake of its profitable Smith Barney brokerage unit to Morgan Stanley .
The deal , which will net Citi $ 2.7 billion in cash , is widely expected to be a first step by Citi CEO Vikram Pandit to unravel the “ financial supermarket ” stitched together by predecessor Sandy Weill .
( AP in Yahoo ! Finance )
What the commentators said
The “ well - deserved break - up ” of Citigroup is an about - face for Pandit , said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial .
But he could no longer indulge “ Citi ’s old ambitions ” of one - stop banking after it took “ $ 45 billion in taxpayer cash and secured a $ 249 billion taxpayer guarantee for lousy assets . ”
Now it ’s a matter of public policy , not just business , to make sure Citigroup is cut down to a manageable size , so it will never again be “ too big too fail . ”
It could still fail , as Citi ’s two recent government bailouts were just “ a bucket to bail out a sinking ship , ” said Michael Shulman in BloggingStocks .
The “ leaks and holes are still there ” — Citi still has “ dodgy assets ” on and off its highly leveraged balance sheets — and the company badly needs capital that only taxpayers will provide .
So what went wrong at Citigroup ?
said Justin Fox in Time online .
“ It ’s possible that this was all just a case of mismanagement , ” since the European - style universal banking model it emulated “ does n’t invariably bring disaster . ”
But it could also be that investment banking and commercial banking “ simply do n’t mix ” well in the same firm .
Citi’s “ financial supermarket ” strategy might have worked if its executives had understood the point of a supermarket , said Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal .
A financial supermarket should focus on retail customers , bringing together all “ the products and services a consumer would need to manage his financial life . ”
Citigroup lost sight of the consumer , and it took a federal intervention to point it back on track .
A Virginia jury on Wednesday convicted Ryan Frederick ( see his MySpace page here )
of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a police officer during a no - knock drug raid .
Prosecutors asked for and the jury recommended a 10 - year prison sentence for the 28 - year - old resident of Chesapeake .
The trial judge will make a final determination in a May hearing .
The jury did not convict Frederick of capital murder as prosecutors had sought .
Nor was he found guilty of marijuana production -- the police raid was in search of an alleged grow -- but only of possession of a small amount of pot .
On January 17 , 2008 , local police executing a search warrant based on the word of questionable snitch -- who admitted burglarizing Frederick 's home days earlier -- began breaking down Frederick 's door .
Saying he thought he was under assault from violent unknown intruders , he picked up his rifle and fired a shot through the door , killing Officer Jarrod Shivers , whose job it was to break down doors during raids .
As Frederick put it himself in a jailhouse interview shortly after the incident :
Frederick said he was sleeping in a back bedroom because his job as a soft drink merchandiser required him to get up early .
His dogs , Dora and Bud , were in the house .
He woke up because his dogs " were barking like crazy .
They 're going like really crazy , so I grab my gun .
As I 'm walking through the hall , someone comes busting through my door . "
Intruders were pushing through the bottom panels of the four - panel door , he said .
The lighting in the house was dim .
Frederick said he did n't hear anyone say " police " or see identification .
" I was like , ' Oh , God , if I do n't shoot , then he 's going to kill me ' ... I think I shot twice .
I can't remember .
It happened so fast .
All I know is the gun jammed . "
Frederick said he then went back to the bedroom to get a telephone .
When he realized police were outside , he walked out of the house and surrendered .
In tears at times , Frederick said he does n't grow or sell marijuana .
He had a smoking bong and a small bag of marijuana , he said .
The raid and its unfortunate outcome for all involved added to rising concerns among civil libertarians and drug reform advocates about the apparently routine resort to SWAT - style tactics employed against small - scale drug offenders and , all too often , completely innocent parties .
The particulars in this case also raise serious questions about the quality of justice in that particular part of Virginia .
For a closer look , try Radley Balko 's detailed coverage for Reason magazine 's Hit & Run blog here .
The case is n't over yet .
Frederick 's attorney said an appeal was definite .
Newswise —
A new study uncovers 11 gene variants associated with three blood lipids measured to determine cardiovascular disease risk : low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and triglycerides .
The discovery opens up new opportunities for nutrigenomics researchers looking for links between diet and genetics that will optimize health and lower chronic disease risk .
" Practically all genes related to lipid levels in the bloodstream respond to changes in the diet , " says Jose M. Ordovas , PhD , one of five senior authors of the study and director of the Nutrition and Genomics Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University ( USDA HNRCA ) .
" With this new knowledge , we are closer to identifying precise dietary recommendations for people at risk for cardiovascular disease .
For instance , carriers of a certain variant gene could reduce their risk of disease with a low - cholesterol diet , carriers of another variant gene may benefit from the Mediterranean diet , while a high - fiber diet may be the healthiest option for carriers of yet another variant gene . "
In addition to the 11 new genes , the authors ' findings strengthen the association of 19 previously identified genes with LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides .
Ordovas collaborated with 60 authors , led by corresponding author Sekar Kathiresan , MD , of Massachusetts General Hospital , for the study published December 7 online in Nature Genetics December 7 .
The study is a meta- analysis of over 20,000 subjects in genome - wide association studies of humans in the United States and Europe with The Framingham Heart Study accounting for the largest number of samples .
" Having identified a total of 30 gene variants is a landmark in lipid research , " says Ordovas , also a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition and Science Policy at Tufts and Tufts University School of Medicine " It suggests people can have multiple variant genes contributing to dyslipidemia , a combination of spiked LDL and triglyceride levels and extremely low HDL - cholesterol signaling cardiovascular disease risk .
" It is possible there are even more variant genes contributing to dyslipidemia , but even larger studies and more complete genomic characterization based on sequencing are necessary to provide a more complete picture , including interactions with dietary components " Ordovas adds .
Ordovas received funding from the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute and the USDA Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) .

It turns out that Michael Steele — elected the first African - American chair of the Republican National Committee earlier this afternoon — has a situational opinion of Barack Obama and what his accomplishments mean for race in America .
How else to explain the fact that when Steele talks about Obama , his thoughts change depending on his audience ?
Here ’s Steele fielding a question about Obama from Tavis Smiley at the Black State of the Union conference , held in New Orleans in February 2008 .
Steele is speaking to a predominantly black audience .
Video to your right .
I ’m very proud to see Barack Obama do what Barack Obama has done and is doing .
I am philosophically polar opposites with the man .
But it does n’t change the fact that we are from the same community .
And it does n’t diminish nor weaken my pride in what he ’s done .
I would hope that all of us would be just as proud of an African - American Republican achieving such success .
Now here is Steele discussing Obama with NewsBusters.org , a conservative online news outlet , at the Republican National Convention .
Video to your right , again .
Q : I wanted to get your take on the media coverage of Obama …
MS : It ’s been a joke , quite frankly .
To put it bluntly .
There ’s been no coverage .
There ’s been coronation , there ’s been facilitation of his agenda … .
Q : What do you think is causing it ?
What ’s the real culprit for the disparity [ between Obama ’s coverage and McCain’s ] ?
MS : I think some of it has to do with a level of white liberal guilt .
Q : So you think this is a race issue ?
MS : For some folks it is , yeah …
Politically , I think some people [ in the media ] are so anti-Republican — I just look at how they chewed up Hillary to get to Barack .
What they were trying to figure out , who ’s the best player to go up against the Republican establishment and who could trump certain things we’d be able to talk about that maybe Hillary could n’t , and certainly , the race issue would be one of those landmines the [ Republican ]
Party would have to deal with … .
If the shoe were on the other foot , they would be scrutinizing the heck out of a black Republican or a Hispanic Republican … .
If he wins , he ’s a media creation , he ’s a brand .
America does n’t need a president who ’s a brand .
America needs a president who can lead .
Dismissing Obama as a “ media creation ” is a rather dramatic swing from “ I ’m very proud to see Barack Obama do what Barack Obama has done . ”
The Republican Party and its leaders certainly need to learn how to talk about the progress of minorities in America better than they currently do .
One might have thought that the GOP ’s new leader would be able to teach them .
But it looks like he has problems of his own .

That is a boon for people like Jennifer C. Graham , a single mother who was laid off in December with just five weeks of severance pay .
Ms. Graham , who was a senior associate at a Manhattan interior design firm , immediately signed up for Cobra to make sure that she and her twin girls were covered .
But the $ 966 monthly payments ate up more than half of her $ 1,600 - a- month unemployment benefit .
“ It ’s completely ridiculous , ” she said .
“ How can people get back on their feet ? ”
With the stimulus relief , her payments will soon fall to a more affordable level : $ 338 a month .
Ms. Graham , who has an M.B.A. , says she hopes to have a new job before the nine - month subsidy ends .
Another change under the stimulus package is that if you qualify for the subsidized Cobra benefit , you can also switch into a lower - cost health plan , like an health maintenance organization , if your former employer offers one , even if you were signed up for a more expensive plan while you were working .
For fuller details on the new Cobra provisions , see this Congressional Web page : http://edlabor.house.gov/blog/2009/02/health-coverage-for-the-unempl.shtml
If you , or someone in your family , has a pre-existing condition ... You can use Cobra to your advantage , even if you do n’t qualify for the new subsidy .
Let ’s say you have diabetes , but the rest of your family is healthy .
Insurers will charge your family more than the average rate , because you are considered a high risk .
In this case , you could stay on Cobra at an individual rate , and buy private insurance for the rest of the family .
Look for policies at a large insurance broker site like eHealthInsurance.com , which offers more than 10,000 plans .
Put in your sex , ZIP code and date of birth and the site will tell you which plans are available in your area .
Many of them have been reviewed by customers , and you can apply online .
If you have children ...
Explore keeping yourself and your spouse on Cobra , or buying private insurance , and enrolling your children in the federally financed CHIP program , suggests Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA , a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization .

" Crop Scientists Say Biotechnology Seed Companies Are Thwarting Research . "
New York Times ( 19 February ) .
" Biotechnology companies are keeping university scientists from fully researching the effectiveness and environmental impact of the industry 's genetically modified crops , according to an unusual complaint issued by a group of those scientists .
" No truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions , " the scientists wrote in a statement submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency .
The E.P.A. is seeking public comments for scientific meetings it will hold next week on biotech crops . "
" The researchers , 26 corn-insect specialists , withheld their names because they feared being cut off from research by the companies .
But several of them agreed in interviews to have their names used .
The problem , the scientists say , is that farmers and other buyers of genetically engineered seeds have to sign an agreement meant to ensure that growers honor company patent rights and environmental regulations .
But the agreements also prohibit growing the crops for research purposes .
So while university scientists can freely buy pesticides or conventional seeds for their research , they cannot do that with genetically engineered seeds .
Instead , they must seek permission from the seed companies .
And sometimes that permission is denied or the company insists on reviewing any findings before they can be published , they say .
Such agreements have long been a problem , the scientists said , but they are going public now because frustration has been building .
" If a company can control the research that appears in the public domain , they can reduce the potential negatives that can come out of any research , " said Ken Ostlie , an entomologist at the University of Minnesota , who was one of the scientists who had signed the statement . "
" The companies " have the potential to launder the data , the information that is submitted to E.P.A. , " said Elson J. Shields , a professor of entomology at Cornell . "
" The growers ' agreement from Syngenta not only prohibits research in general but specifically says a seed buyer cannot compare Syngenta 's product with any rival crop .
Dr. Ostlie , at the University of Minnesota , said he had permission from three companies in 2007 to compare how well their insect - resistant corn varieties fared against the rootworms found in his state .
But in 2008 , Syngenta , one of the three companies , withdrew its permission and the study had to stop .
" The company just decided it was not in its best interest to let it continue , " Dr. Ostlie said . "
" Mark A. Boetel , associate professor of entomology at North Dakota State University , said that before genetically engineered sugar beet seeds were sold to farmers for the first time last year , he wanted to test how the crop would react to an insecticide treatment .
But the university could not come to an agreement with the companies responsible , Monsanto and Syngenta , over publishing and intellectual property rights .
Chris DiFonzo , an entomologist at Michigan State University , said that when she conducted surveys of insects , she avoided fields with transgenic crops because her presence would put the farmer in violation of the grower 's agreement . "
" Dr. Shields of Cornell said financing for agricultural research had gradually shifted from the public sector to the private sector .

Reiterating her call for more air traffic controllers , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) on Monday warned President - elect Barack Obama ’s nominee for Transportation secretary that chronic staff shortages at Los Angeles International Airport and the main radar facility that guides aircraft between airports pose an “ alarming risk ” to aviation safety in Southern California .
In a two - page letter to Rep. Ray LaHood ( R - Ill . ) , Feinstein recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration take immediate steps to hire more controllers at LAX and the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control in San Diego .
“ For years , the controller staffing situation has only become more severe , ” Feinstein wrote .
“ Retirements have outpaced projections , training goals have not been met , trainees have dropped out of the program at alarming rates and the supply of available military - trained controllers has dried up , ” she said .

The senator ’s letter informed LaHood that the U.S. Department of Transportation , at her request , began an audit in June to evaluate air traffic control staffing and its effect on safety at LAX as well as the Southern California and Northern California radar control facilities .
The inspector general ’s report is expected to be released in the months ahead .
FAA officials said the LAX control tower and the Southern California radar control facility are staffed within the authorized ranges and that the agency is continually hiring new air traffic controllers to replace those who are retiring .
According to the FAA , controller errors are down this year at LAX compared with 2007 , though the level is higher than several years ago .

Although FAA officials continue to assert that the system is safe , Feinstein said that all parties , including the FAA , have acknowledged that high turnover rates are straining the region ’s air traffic control system .
Feinstein cited the staffing levels at the Southern California radar control facility , which have fallen from 236 fully certified controllers in April 2004 to 162 in October , the lowest level in the facility ’s recent history .
The installation , which has a staff of 220 , is responsible for guiding aircraft to six commercial airports and several dozen general aviation airports .
Its authorized staffing level is 194 to 237 controllers , including trainees .
LAX , one of the busiest airports in the nation , has 44 air traffic controllers , a number within the authorized staffing range of 39 to 47 .
Thirty - six are fully certified for the airport .
Five are partially certified controllers and three are trainees with no certifications yet .
Feinstein noted that the number of trainees at the South California radar control facility has reached almost 29 % of the total staff .
Experts , she said , believe that the FAA ’s apprentice - based program breaks down when more than 20 % of the controllers are still in training .

Next year , Feinstein added , the facility could have up to 100 trainees .
“ I appreciate the senator ’s efforts to keep pressure on the FAA to do something , ” said Mel Davis , a representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn . and a controller at the Southern California radar control facility .
“ If you look at the results , the FAA ’s actions have not been effective .
In the past few months , we have seen 40 people come and go . ”
In her letter , Feinstein suggested to LaHood that training be revamped to handle a large influx of recruits and that incentives be created to retain veteran controllers and attract qualified people from other parts of the country .
Air traffic controllers say , for example , that the high cost of living in Southern California hampers recruiting efforts here .

Once upon a time , bicarb soda ( Sodium Bicarbonate , Bi-Carb Soda , baking soda ) in our household would be used for baking exclusively .
Then , I started to use it instead of commercial cleaning products .
Then , as a good natural tooth cleaning powder .
And so on .
There is a long list of all the different ways I use it now .
And still use it for baking as well .
I love that stuff .
Recently I found out a new use for the bicarb soda : as a natural body deodorant !
Becoming aware of aluminum and other chemicals in the commercial deodorants and antiperspirants years ago , I ’ve switched to natural and organic ones .
However , the price tag and the plastic packaging got me into searching for a simple natural deodorant recipe .
I ’ve found several , but too complicated to make .
Then I came across a great post about using baking powder as a natural deodorant .
I gave it a go , and it worked well for me .
Baking soda deodorant
Put some baking soda in a container and using a brush or a powder puff apply on clean , dry skin .
If you find pure bicarb soda irritating , after shaving for example , mix in some corn starch ( so far , I ’ve been using pure bicarb ) .
Infusing it with essential oils makes a nice , lightly scented powder .
Pure lavender essential oil is mild and safe to use on your skin .
Add 2 - 3 drops to a quarter cup of bicarb , shake well to distribute and let stand few days before using .
Apply as necessary .
I have a new batch of bicarb soda being infused with vanilla bean , the same way I make my own vanilla sugar .
It smells really nice so far ; I hope it will retain that heavenly vanilla scent I ’m addicted to after applying it !
Since using bicarb powder soda as a deodorant , I have n’t looked back .
And the benefits :
It works even in hot weather
It ’s natural
Inexpensive
Readily available
Waste reduction / less packaging .
Do you have a favourite natural deodorant or recipe for one ?
Please leave your comment below .
Updates :
Vanilla scented bicarb has a lovely scent !
My husband switched to bicarb too and finds it really effective .
The outgoing chairman of the Democratic National Committee fought to expand his party ’s reach to the red states that Barack Obama won .
His pioneering Internet fundraisers became Obama ’s pioneering Internet fundraisers .
He refused to budge on Florida and Michigan .
So why is Howard Dean out in the cold ?
Washington Post via Political Wire :
Dean was widely disparaged within the party for his “ 50 - state strategy ” — a plan to put DNC - paid staffers on the ground in every state to ensure the party fielded a competitive slate of candidates .
Yet , the 2006 and 2008 elections seemed to justify Dean ’s decision as Democrats won in such states as North Carolina , Virginia , Alabama , Kansas and Idaho — places that , as recently as a few elections ago , were considered impenetrable .
[ …]
A source familiar with Dean ’s 2004 presidential campaign and his DNC chairmanship argued not only that the former governor ’s presidential bid lay the technological foundation for Obama ’s successes but also that the chairman ’s unbending enforcement of the primary rules — stripping Florida and Michigan of their delegates and their meaningfulness — played a large role in Obama ’s victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton .
“ I guess it proves that no good deed goes unpunished , ” the source said .

Another year , another form of phishing .
This one , I have to admit , is pretty good in terms of potentially fooling a user .
Unlike most phishing attack vectors , it does n't rely on the victim being ignorant and / or moronic .
The new technique has been dubbed " in-session " phishing and it stays out of your e-mail altogether .
Security researchers with Trusteer have published a report ( PDF ) on this new type of phishing along with a suitably vague description of how the attack works .
As its name implies , in - session phishing requires that the victim first log into a secure website ; Trusteer uses an online bank site as one example of a tasty target .
Here 's how the attack works :
A user legitimately logs into his bank , authenticates , and then does whatever he logged in to do .
Once finished , he opens another browser tab ( or browser window ) and leaves the bank website open .
Shortly thereafter , he encounters a website that has been injected with the malicious code in question .
Once run , the malware creates a pop-up , supposedly from the bank or secure site that 's still open in another tab or window .
The " authentic " pop-up prompts the user to enter his login credentials again in order to resume the session .
Trusteer notes that the attack could be used to present different types of lures including online surveys or mini- flash games ( punch the Yeti , enter your personal data , and win a free Llama ! ) .
In order for the attack to function , Trusteer states that two conditions must be met .
First , a website must be compromised and infected — the higher traffic the better , obviously .
Secondly , the downloaded malware must be able to identify whether or not the unknowing carrier is logged into a relevant website .
Trusteer does not state how long the window of opportunity is open for this particular attack to execute , but does note that the malware infection is temporary .
Trusteer explains how the bug works .
It is present in the JavaScript engine used by popular browsers like IE , Firefox , and Safari , as well as Chrome , and allows a site to determine whether a user is also logged into another site .
The source of the vulnerability is a specific JavaScript function .
When this function is called it leaves a temporary footprint on the computer and any other website can identify this footprint .
Websites that use this function in a certain way are traceable .
Many websites , including financial institutions , online retailers , social networking websites , gaming , and gambling websites use this function and can be traced .
The researchers recommend that users and companies deploy appropriate web security tools ( which the company happens to sell ) , immediately log out of any secure sites once you 've finished your tasks ( good advice ) , and to be extremely wary of pop-ups that randomly drop in if you have n't clicked anything .
The JavaScript vulnerability that Trusteer has discovered obviously needs patching , but in - session phishing does n't appear to be a major threat .
In order to function successfully , the malware requires that a user have simultaneous browser windows open to both a login / secure site and an infected site , and that the secure site is on the malware 's pregenerated list of targets .
There are some rather simple ways for banks and other targeted institutions to fight back ; options include rapid disconnects if a user becomes idle and prominent notifications of the company 's login policy .
Many companies ( Blizzard and AOL come to mind ) prominently and repeatedly inform customers that neither the company nor its representatives will ever , ever , ask a user to disclose their password .
A similar warning against in - session phishing might state that the company will never ask users to log in via a pop - up or any third - party service .
Between currently available solutions and inevitable patches , I think in - session phishing is going to find its nets mostly empty .

Whether flu , allergies or a common cold has left you with a scratchy throat and a cough , a mixture of honey and lemon makes a good homemade cough remedy .
Honey has been proven as effective as dextromethorphan , a cough - suppressant ingredient found in many commercial cough syrups .
Though honey by itself is a wonderful cough suppressant , lemon with tea or hot water is also effective and can be soothing to the throat .
Tip
When you consume honey , the fluid of the tea or water helps thin your mucus , which allows your body to flush it out more easily .
Additionally , lemon adds a much - needed dose of vitamin C that helps the body bolster its immune system .
Drink the tea or water during the day to stay hydrated and help thin the mucus .
Stick to the syrup at night for the most - effective cough suppressant .
How to Make Cough Medicine
Preparing a honey - lemon cough suppressant mixture is quite simple .
Most of the ingredients are widely available and cheap ; in fact , you may already have them in your pantry .

Carl Sagan was an Avid Pot Smoker
When you 're talking about scientists who achieved rock - star status in the second half of the twentieth century , the late astronomer and biologist Carl Sagan is right up there with Stephen Hawking .
His Cosmos ( 1980 ) is one of the most popular science books ever written , planting itself on the New York Times bestseller list for 70 weeks and staying perpetually in print ever since .
It was a companion for the PBS television series of the same name , which t along with numerous Tonight Show appearance t introduced Sagan and his emphatically stated phrase " billions and billions " into pop culture .
His sole novel , Contact , was turned into a love - it - or - hate - it movie starring Jodie Foster as an erstwhile scientist searching for extraterrestrial life , with Matthew McConaughey as a New Age flake who , inevitably , makes his own form of contact with her .
Besides his pop-culture credentials , Sagan was pals with numerous legendary Nobel Prizewinners while still in college , picked up a Pulitzer Prize for his book Dragons of Eden , and consulted for NASA , MIT , Cornell and RAND .
He designed the human race 's postcards to any aliens that might be out there t the plaque onboard the Pioneer space probes and the record on the Voyager probes .
So it might come as a bit of a surprise that Sagan was an avid smoker of marijuana .
Some might even call him a pothead .
In his definitive biography of the celebrity scientist , Keay Davidson reveals that Sagan started smoking regularly in the 1960s and that Dragons of Eden -- which won the Pulitzer -- " was obviously written under the inspiration of marijuana . "
Davidson says of Sagan :
He believed the drug enhanced his creativity and insights .
His closest friend of three decades , Harvard psychiatry professor Dr. Lester Grinspoon , a leading advocate of the decriminalization of marijuana , recalls an incident in the 1980s when one of his California admirers mailed him , unsolicited , some unusually high - quality pot .
Grinspoon shared the joints with Sagan and his wife , Anne Druyan .
Afterward , Sagan said , " Lester , I know you 've only got one left , but could I have it ?
I 've got serious work to do tomorrow and I could really use it . "
Perhaps letting Sagan bogart the pot was Grinspoon 's way of returning a favor , since Sagan had contributed an essay to Marihuana Revisited , Grinspoon 's classic 1971 book on the benefits and low risks of reefer .
For almost three decades , the author of this ode to Mary Jane was anonymous , but in 1999 Grinspoon revealed that " Mr. X " was Sagan .
In the essay , Sagan wrote that weed increased his appreciation of art , music , food , sex , and childhood memories , and gave him insights into scientific and social matters :
I can remember one occasion , taking a shower with my wife while high , in which I had an idea on the origins and invalidities of racism in terms of Gaussian distribution curves .
It was a point obvious [ sic ] in a way , but rarely talked about .
I drew curves in soap on the shower wall , and went to write the idea down .
One idea led to another , and at the end of about an hour of extremely hard work I had found I had written eleven short essays on a wide range of social , political , philosophical , and human biological topics ... .
I have used them in university commencement addresses , public lectures , and in my books .
The staunchly atheistic / humanistic Sagan comes perilously close to mysticism in some passages :
BOSTON - ( March 3 , 2009 )
In an epidemiological study of men and post - menopausal women primarily over 60 years of age , regular moderate alcohol intake was associated with greater bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
Researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging ( USDA HNRCA ) at Tufts University found associations were strongest for beer and wine and , importantly , BMD was significantly lower in men drinking more than two servings of liquor per day .
The results suggest that regular moderate consumption of beer or wine may have protective effects on bone , but that heavy drinking may contribute to bone loss .
" Previous research suggests that moderate alcohol consumption in older men and post - menopausal women may protect against BMD loss , a major risk factor for osteoporosis , " said Katherine L. Tucker , PhD , corresponding author and director of the Dietary Assessment and Epidemiology Research Program at the USDA HNRCA .
The 2005 Dietary Guidelines issued by the federal government defines moderate alcohol consumption as one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men .
" Our study also looks at the possible effects of the three alcohol classes , beer , wine and liquor on BMD , " Tucker continued .
" We saw stronger associations between higher BMD and beer drinkers , who were mostly men , and wine drinkers , who were mostly women , compared to liquor drinkers . "
The results were published online February 25 by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
Tucker , who is also a professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts , and colleagues analyzed BMD measurements taken at three hip sites and the lumbar spine in 1,182 men , 1,289 post - menopausal women , and 248 pre-menopausal women whose parents or in - laws participated in the original Framingham Heart Study .
There was not enough data to determine the effects of more than two servings of alcohol per day in post - menopausal women or the effects of daily alcohol consumption on BMD in pre-menopausal women .
Participants self - reported their alcohol intake on dietary questionnaires .
One serving of beer equaled a glass , bottle or can ( 356 mL ) , one serving of wine equaled a 4 - oz.
glass ( 118 mL ) , and one serving of liquor equaled one mixed drink or shot ( 42 mL ) .
After adjusting for several other factors that may have accounted for the higher BMD , such as silicon intake , calcium intake and smoking history , the authors still saw an association between higher BMD and moderate alcohol consumption .
One of the strongest associations was seen in men who reported consuming one or two servings of total alcohol ( a combination of beer , wine and liquor ) or one or two servings of beer per day .
Hip BMD in this group was significantly greater compared to non-drinkers .
In contrast , the authors observed significantly lower BMD at the hip and spine in men who consumed more than two servings of liquor per day compared to men who consumed one or two servings of liquor per day .
" There is a body of research showing alcoholism is devastating to bones , " Tucker said .
" It 's a major risk factor for osteoporosis .
No one should depend solely on alcohol to maintain bone health . "
The authors hypothesize that the silicon found in beer is contributing to the higher BMD scores in the men who reported consuming one or two servings of total alcohol or beer per day , citing previous studies finding silicon has greater bioavailability as a liquid .
It is less clear why liquor and wine might protect BMD .
" We cannot say definitively what component of these alcoholic drinks might be beneficial to bone health because our findings are from an observational study , as opposed to a clinical trial , " Tucker said .
" Future studies might dig deeper into patterns of alcohol consumption , as we relied on a self - reported dietary questionnaire .
Another component of data worthy of exploration is whether the antioxidants found in wine , such as revesterol or polyphenols , have a protective effect on bone in addition to other health benefits . "

Octomom is used to having multiple people inside of her at once -- and now one porn company is willing to shell out big bucks to harness that skill on film .
Major porn distributor Vivid Entertainment has just fired off a letter to Nadya Suleman , offering her 1 million bucks to star in a skin flick of her own .
Vivid is willing to go one step further , by telling us they 'll give her family full medical and dental insurance if she becomes a " contract girl " ... meaning she 'll have to do multiple videos .
What do men want ?
Biology ’s simple answer is that men want to survive to pass on their genes .
But when you throw this goal into a complex society of competing men , discerning women and morality , biology gets confused .
For better or for worse , behavioral economics has the answers .
Basically , behavioral economics considers animal mating as a free market , heavily influenced by supply and demand .
For example , because the nature of pregnancy , birth and nursing means that female mammals must invest more time and energy in reproduction than males , a male mammal ’s reproductive potential is bound by the number of mates he can find , while a female mammal ’s reproductive success is bound by the time / energy it takes to successfully raise her children .
( In exceptional societies like that of the red - necked phalarope in which males raise the offspring the reverse is true — females compete for males and guard them jealously . )
If ye olde supply and demand were the end of the story , it would lead to ever - philandering human males fighting for access to women , who would have as many children as they could feed .
In fact , this model describes chimpanzees and bonobos , our closest relatives , pretty well ( and is why male primates are larger than their female counterparts ) .
And historically , the availability of resources did , in fact , influence whether human societies were monogamous , polygamous or polyamorous .
First , in cultures that evolved in resource - rich areas , females did n’t need male help to raise their children and thus gave little preference to males who would stick around to share the burden ( these males , unfettered by paternal investment , quickly went in search of additional mates , but supply and demand meant they needed to fight for them ) ; second , in resource - poor environments , women needed the contribution of hunting men and it was all a dude could do to put enough meat on the table to feed a single family , thus monogamy and paternal investment .
And finally , in societies where men had access to resources while women did not , polygamy developed — women needed ( or were forced to need ) male resources in order to raise their children , and certain men could supply these in enough quantity to support many women .
Now , hypothetically , imagine the ideal reproductive circumstances for women : male competition and paternal investment amid ample resources .
Hmmm , this sounds vaguely familiar .
Wait a minute !
This is modern society , in which men spend resources parenting when they could be off further procreating .
In short , men have been biologically bamboozled .
But how ?
The first step is regulation of the free market .
Morality performs the role of the SEC , dictating that men enter monogamous relationships despite hampering their reproductive potential .
( How this morality developed is up for debate . )
At least society increases paternal certainty — — if men are to subjugate their reproductive potential to the dictates of morality , then at least they can be certain the children in whom they are over - investing are their own .
( When men distrust the assurances of society , it leads to sexual jealousy and mate guarding . )
But morality can’t explain it all : with a surplus of resources and the socially dictated potential for only one mate , men should n’t need to butt heads , lock antlers , build bowers or otherwise compete for female attention .
What then of football ?
And of Gold ’s Gym and singles bars and law school ?
It turns out that female homo sapiens sapiens are tricky and have developed the behavioral ability to combat ecology and morality .
Specifically , women have become picky and wary of casual sex that could cause pregnancy .
Thus women hold their reproductive cards tightly , and will show their hands only to men of their choosing , forcing men to compete even for the opportunity to mate with just one woman .
Women maximize their reproductive potential by wisely choosing men who demonstrate the potential for paternal investment .
But women do n’t have it as easy as they might , either .
According to the rules of good old Darwinian free market ecology , women should be able to sit back ( with their legs tightly crossed and / or their birth control firmly in place ) and wait for suitors to come suiting .
But while the ecological math of monogamy means that women may have only one suitor , women continue to compete for the most suitable suitor .
This is n’t always pretty .
But unlike men who prefer whacking each other with sticks , the major model of the modern major female reproductive competition is to exclude competing women from social groups that ensure successful mating .
This , in a nutshell , is why middle school sucks .
This model of human mating assumes an equal number of men and women .
But what if this were n’t the case ?
We see in periods of male scarcity , as during the Vietnam War , that when men are scarce and thus in higher demand they tend to influence the reproductive mores of society towards a higher degree of sexual liberalism , thus increasing male reproductive potential , and thus Woodstock and free love .
Apologies to Cupid , but humans remain mired in a wild , wild world , in which our reproductive success determines many of our actions .

Perhaps because they are embracing the spirit of granting special privileges to individuals who do certain , otherwise prohibited things for religious reasons ( see : Free - exercise clause ) , or perhaps because they are just trying to avoid a backlash from the Christian Right ( more likely ) , the NFL has declared that end zone dances during the Super Bowl that involve going down on one ’s knees are prohibited .
Unless , of course , you ’re “ praising the Lord ” :
The whole issue is , you ca n’t go to the ground on your knees or with your hand or anything .
There ’s only one time that you ’re going to be allowed to go on your knee after you score like this , and that ’s when you want to praise the Lord .
If you do that , then I ’m going to allow that , because I do not want to be struck by lightning , I promise you that .
We will allow that .
Stephen Dubner over at Freakonomics points out that this may be ripe for an attack from the American Humanist Association .
Would they be right to combat it ?
Even if they would be “ right ” , would it be a strategically wise decision ?
The destruction by Central Intelligence Agency officials of videotapes showing the interrogation of suspected terrorists is the subject of “ an ongoing criminal investigation ” that is expected to conclude in the near future , according to a prosecution official .
“ Investigators are now in the process of scheduling interviews with the remaining witnesses to be interviewed in this investigation , ” wrote John H. Durham , Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , in an affidavit ( pdf ) late last month .
“ Based on the investigative accomplishments to date , we anticipate that by mid-February 2009 , and no later than February 28 , 2009 , we will have completed the interviews . ”
His remarks came in the course of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the James Madison Project for documents pertaining to the CIA videotape destruction .
The government asked for a stay of the FOIA proceedings until witness interviews are completed .
At a hearing on January 6 , the request for a stay until February 28 , 2009 was granted by the court , said attorney Mark S. Zaid , director of the James Madison Project .
Key details of the pending criminal investigation have been redacted from Mr. Durham ’s affidavit , including the number of witnesses interviewed and the volume of documents examined to date .
But the affidavit does provide a sense of the level of activity involved , indicating that “ a considerable portion of the work to be done in connection with the investigation has already been completed . ”
Mr. Durham noted that “ in many instances , ” delays have resulted from witness requests for legal representation and the need to get witness attorneys cleared .
In some cases , the government officials involved have retired and have been “ read out ” of the highly compartmented intelligence programs in question , and it has taken additional time to have their credentials reinstated , he said .
A copy of the December 31 , 2008 CIA motion for a stay , with Mr. Durham ’s affidavit , is here .
The destruction of CIA interrogation videotapes , which occurred in 2005 , was reported in the New York Times on December 7 , 2007 .
( CNN ) -- Luis Caplan served the poor of the South Bronx for decades out of a small medical office .
His leg was amputated after a bout with cancer in 1990 , yet he continued to work for another five years .
Luis Caplan , 71 , asks of the stimulus package : " What happens to the real middle class ? "
Now , his savings have nearly been wiped out because of the economic crisis .
At the age of 71 , he faces losing his apartment if things do n't change soon .
The government bailed out the big institutions , but " what happens to the little people ? " he asks .
" What happens to the real middle class ?
What happens to me ? " he says , choking back tears .
" It 's awful .
It 's really awful . "
With Congress working to pass the $ 800 billion stimulus bill , millions of Americans -- especially those with homes they 're trying to sell or about to be foreclosed on -- are asking the same thing :
What 's in it for me ?
Caplan says most of his equity is tied up in his 800 - square - foot apartment that he purchased in 1985 .
He wants to sell it to move to Seattle , Washington , to be near his daughter , who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis .
But his place has sat on the market for three months without an offer .
Located in a tony neighborhood in Manhattan 's Upper East Side , apartments used to sell in a matter of weeks .
Caplan has dropped $ 50,000 from the original asking price of $ 625,000 and may have to drop the price again .
He says he can barely afford maintenance fees and other monthly costs associated with his place .
He hopes to make enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage he took out to supplement his Social Security payments .
" I do n't know how much more I can go through like this , " he says , sobbing even more .
" I 'm going crazy with this . "
His son , Danny Caplan , says , " He 's collateral damage .
He has equity and could sell it and walk away and have enough to live comfortably .
But [ he can 't ] because of the economic situation . "
America 's housing crisis has become a key issue for Washington policymakers .
Millions of Americans are in foreclosure or facing foreclosure ; others are out of work trying to sell their homes in a down economy .
And there are elderly people , such as Caplan , who want to sell immediately to help stabilize their finances .
Send us your thoughts on the stimulus plan
President Obama on Tuesday told people at a town hall meeting in Fort Myers , Florida , that he plans to announce in coming weeks " what our overall housing strategy is going to be . "
Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner made the rounds in Washington on Tuesday to push the stimulus bill , including the need to jump - start America 's housing market .
See stimulus bill provisions »
" Homeowners around the country are seeing the value of their homes fall because of forces they did not create and cannot control , " he said .
" This crisis in housing has had devastating consequences , and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage . "
At one Senate hearing , Sen. Jack Reed , D - Rhode Island , said " decisive action " is needed to address the housing crisis .
" I think the message should come through clear from all of us , you have to move aggressively , clearly , and to start working , " Reed said .
" I agree with you , " Geithner responded .
" Our objective is , and our hope is , that our program meets that test . "
The stimulus bill does sweeten the pot for potential homebuyers , which supporters say could help spur the economy .
Critics charge that letting housing prices stabilize on their own is healthy for the economy .
The Senate 's version of the bill offers a $ 15,000 tax credit to anyone who purchases a home in the next year , more than double the tax credit offered by the House .
Dwight Jaffee , a professor of real estate and finance at the University of California - Berkeley , says the housing market is the " perfect instrument in leading the economy out of recession because housing is such a big - ticket item . "
" We will not turnaround this economy until we start to turn around housing .
I hope people in Washington are hearing it , " he says .
In the case of Luis Caplan , Jaffee says , " What it means to him , if they did carry out this program , then the government would be stimulating the demand -- the buyers -- for his apartment to sell it at a fuller price and much sooner . "
Caplan says that would be a good thing .
He needs all the help he can get .
Born in Argentina , Caplan came to the United States as a legal immigrant in 1964 to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor .
He eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen and opened his medical office to help treat the Spanish - speaking poor of the South Bronx .
He believed his calling was to help " the poorest of the poor " get decent medical treatment , rather than pursue the more high - paying lifestyle of other doctors .
Most of his patients were on Medicaid , so he got paid at a rate much less than other doctors .
He beams with pride at the lives he saved .
" I caught cancers very early , " he said .
" I 'm not the savior of humanity .
... I just did what I could to help poor people . "
In June 1990 at the age of 53 , Caplan started having pain in his left leg .
It turned out to be a malignant tumor and his leg was amputated .
Yet his passion and commitment to helping others kept him going .
Even after losing his leg , he went back to work for another five years .
When he retired , he got another shocker : Social Security initially rejected him -- a man without a leg -- for disability .
He says he scraped and saved money along the way , " a very small amount that has practically disappeared . "
He now scoots around his apartment in his wheelchair hoping for better days .
As far as he 's concerned , the big Wall Street institutions can " burn in hell . "
" I do n't have a Rolls - Royce .
I do n't have a Cadillac , " he says .
" The government ... is n't trying to help everybody : People like me that went through this , people who did something good for the community , people who did n't buy an expensive painting for their office . "
Caplan pauses .
" This is what I 'm left with : an apartment that can hardly sell . "
His son is proud of his father 's accomplishments , yet he 's frustrated that his dad is in such a financial pinch during a time that 's supposed to be the Golden Years of his life .
" He bought the American dream and paid for the American dream , " says Danny Caplan .

El ministro fue tajante .
Y es el titular de un ministerio de relevancia : Justicia y Seguridad , nada menos .
Después de que el presidente de la DAIA ( Delegación de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas ) denunciara una campaña antisemita , " la más grande registrada en el país desde el retorno a la democracia " a raíz de la brutal invasión israelí sobre Gaza , Aníbal Fernández le salió al cruce : " no existe un brote antisemita y Argentina no es un país antisemita " .
Claro y contundente .
Desde luego la Argentina no es Alemania ni Austria , naciones que durante el siglo pasado practicaron políticas de exterminio hacia los judíos .
Tampoco es Rusia , ni Polonia , donde los pogroms conformaron rituales de periódico salvajismo durante centurias .
Pero la Argentina tuvo un gobierno filonazi , surgido del golpe de 1930 , a cargo del general Uriburu , apadrinado filosóficamente por uno de nuestros mayores intelectuales , Leopoldo Lugones .
Y en 1943 otro golpe de Estado de militares nacionalistas llevó al país a mantener una inaudita neutralidad en la Segunda Guerra Mundial , de gélida indiferencia ante los crímenes del nazismo .
En ese régimen de facto - cuyo último vicepresidente fue Juan Perón - se destacaron figuras descaradamente filonazis .
Terminada la contienda global , la Argentina fue refugio de algunos de los peores genocidas que fueron secuaces de Hitler .
Josef Menguele , el médico que hacía experimentos sin nombre ni medida en los campos de concentración , consiguió protección en el país .
Y Klaus Barbie , conocido como " El carnicero de Lyon " por las monstruosidades que ejerció en esa ciudad francesa , también .
Idéntica suerte corrió Ante Pavelic - ex dictador croata , despiadado peón de Hitler - , que gozó de una desembozada protección oficial .
Adolf Eichmann , el " administrador de los campos de exterminio nazis , vivió tranquilamente en San Fernando hasta que un comando israelí en 1960 - violando la soberanía argentina - lo secuestró , para trasladarlo , juzgarlo y ajusticiarlo en Jerusalén .
Y Eric Priebke -el oficial de las SS autor de la masacre de las Fosas Ardeatinas , la peor perpetrada en Roma durante la ocupación nazi , que dejó 335 muertos - fue durante 40 años un respetado vecino de San Carlos de Bariloche .
La lista no se agota en estos nombres y es posible imaginar que muchos responsables de horrores que la conciencia se resiste a concebir gozaron o gozan aún de una vejez serena y próspera en estas tierras .
Mucho más cerca en el tiempo , en los centros de tortura y desaparición de personas de la última dictadura militar , los prisioneros de origen judío sufrían - según numerosos testimonios - un trato muy especial : el peor .
Y en 1992 y 1994 los atentados terroristas mayores de la historia argentina hicieron blanco en dos instituciones judías : la Embajada de Israel - 22 muertos - y la sede de la AMIA - 85 muertos - .
Ya no quedan detenidos por ninguna de las dos barbaries .
Los que estaban involucrados fueron absueltos por increíbles vicios procesales .
Y los funcionarios extranjeros sospechados de organizar la última masacre no se han presentado a declarar , como lo exige la Justicia argentina por decisión del gobierno de Irán , país con el que la Argentina , no obstante , mantiene relaciones diplomáticas .
El obispo lefebvrista Richard Williamson , que fue readmitido en la Iglesia por el actual Papa luego de haber sido excomulgado por Juan Pablo II , vive hace años en La Reja , provincia de Buenos Aires .
Hace pocas semanas , declaró que no hubo cámaras de gas en la Alemania nazi y que los judíos exterminados no fueron 6 millones - como dicta la historia- sino unos 300 mil .
Por la reciente invasión israelí a Gaza hubo marchas decididamente antisemitas en la Capital Federal , que incluyeron pintadas con cruces svásticas y amenazas de nuevos atentados .
La titular del Instituto Nacional contra la Xenofobia , la Discriminación y el Racismo dijo que ocurrieron porque " Israel violó las reglas del derecho internacional y se le vino el mundo en contra . "
Interesante explicación de María Luisa Lubertino , responsable de que esos actos no se produzcan o sean debidamente castigados .
Por todo esto tiene razón el ministro de Justicia y Seguridad en poner énfasis : como salta a la vista , la Argentina no es un país antisemita .
As he 's done for the last decade , Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs took home his customary US $ 1 annual salary in 2008 , but the economic meltdown and Apple 's falling stock price whacked half a billion dollars off the value of his personal holdings in the company .
Apple said in a regulatory filing that Jobs , 53 , who holds 5.5 million shares of Apple 's stock , has n't sold any of the shares since rejoining the company in 1997 .
That means what he lacks in annual compensation is made up for in the enormous amount of stock he already holds - a horde that took a beating in 2008 amid fears about the Mac and iPhone maker 's vulnerability to the US recession .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Apple shares have lost more than half their value since the end of 2007 , when they were trading at nearly $ 200 and Jobs ' holdings were worth more than $ 1 billion .
The stock finished Wednesday 's trading session down $ 2.01 , 2 per cent , at $ 91.01 , meaning Jobs ' stake is worth around $ 500 million .
A big hit by any measure , the decline still barely dents Jobs ' massive fortune , estimated by Forbes magazine earlier this year at $ 5.7 billion and ranking him 61st on the publication 's list of the richest Americans .
Most of Jobs ' wealth comes not from Apple but from the 138 million shares he owns of The Walt Disney Co. , a 7.3 per cent stake that makes him Disney 's largest individual shareholder .
Jobs scored the Disney stake through a brilliant deal in which he sold Pixar Animation Studios , a company he bought from director George Lucas for $ 10 million in 1986 , to Disney in a multibillion - dollar stock trade 20 years later .
Jobs '
Disney holdings are now worth $ 3.2 billion , more than $ 1 billion less than the stock was worth last year .
Jobs has a similar relationship with Disney , where he serves on the board , as he does with Apple when it comes to pay .
He does n't take a salary for his work as a Disney director .
Apple 's annual proxy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that its strategy is remarkably egalitarian when it comes to the CEO 's compensation .
The company does n't reimburse Jobs for the perks that top executives usually get like home security systems or a chauffeur , but it did reward him in a big way in 1999 after he engineered an impressive turnaround at the company : Jobs ' bonus that year was a $ 90 million Gulfstream V jet , whose operation Apple still helps pay for .
Apple said in the filing that it reimbursed Jobs for $ 871,000 in expenses in 2008 for his use of the private plane on company business .
In 2007 , those costs were $ 776,000 , and in 2006 , it was $ 202,000 .
Jobs ' compensation has n't been without controversy , however .
The company was embroiled in a scandal two years ago over its mishandling of stock option awards , some of which went to Jobs .
At the height of the corporate " backdating " scandals that emerged in 2006 , federal investigators began looking at Apple over possible criminal violations in the way the company handled its options , including an award of 7.5 million options given to Jobs in 2001 .
Jobs never cashed out the options ; they were cancelled two years later while they were " underwater , " or worthless , along with other outstanding options .
Instead he was given millions of shares of restricted stock that make up nearly all of his current holdings .
Prosecutors closed the criminal investigation last year without filing charges , though two former executives - former General Counsel Nancy Heinen and former Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson - were charged by the SEC over the so - called " backdating , " or manipulating stock awards so they look like they were issued earlier than they were .
Apple eventually took an $ 84 million charge after it acknowledged it had backdated 6,428 grants between 1997 and 2002 .
Jobs was in the news for another reason this week when he revealed before the Macworld trade show that a hormone imbalance has caused the weight loss that made him look gaunt at recent events .
Jobs said he wanted to squash rumours that he is gravely ill .
Apple said that its annual meeting is scheduled for Feb. 25 at the company 's Cupertino headquarters .
Magnetar observed during outburst thanks to rapid response of INTEGRAL
27 January 2009
1E1547.0-5408 is one of only 9 confirmed Anomalous X -ray Pulsars ( AXP ) - isolated , young neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic fields ( 1014G - 1015G ) .
Together with Soft Gamma Repeaters they make up a class of celestial object known as magnetars .
1E 1547.0-5408 was first detected by the Einstein X - ray observatory .
Subsequent observations by a series of X - ray observatories ( ASCA , Chandra , XMM - Newton and Swift ) have shown it to display the typical characteristics of an AXP .
It has exhibited a small number of outbursts over the past few years but at weaker levels than those observed in the past few days .
Magnetar active state triggers alerts on several satellites , including INTEGRAL
The first sign that this magnetar had entered a new active burst state came early on Thursday 22 January when the Swift Burst Alert Telescope ( GCN 8833 ) and the Fermi Gamma - Ray Burst Monitor ( GCN 8835 ) recorded a number of hard X - ray triggers which were identified as originating from the direction of 1E 1547.0 - 5408 .
Volker Beckmann and the team at the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre ( ISDC ) , monitoring the real - time data from the almost omni-directional SPI anti-coincidence system ( ACS ) , which operates as a burst trigger on INTEGRAL , also noticed a significant increase in triggers : almost 200 on 22 January compared to a typical rate of a few per day .
The bursts were among the brightest ever recorded by the ACS in the 6 years since INTEGRAL was launched and varied in length from 50 ms to 8 seconds .
The ACS has a lower energy threshold of 50 - 150 keV ( depending on the individual detector ) and an upper threshold of about 100 MeV .
Although the ACS cannot localise the position of a burst source the temporal coincidence of some of the bursts with those identified by Swift and Fermi confirmed the source of the burst emission to be 1E 1547.0 - 5408 ( GCN 8837 ) .
Exceptional activity results in public Target of Opportunity
Recognising that this was a rare opportunity to observe close to , and possibly during , an outburst state , Beckmann and other scientists submitted Target of Opportunity requests for immediate observations of this object to the INTEGRAL Science Operations Team .
These were received on 22 and 23 January .
After careful consideration the ToO was granted by the INTEGRAL Project Scientist , Christoph Winkler , and a 100,000 second observation planned and executed .
This ToO began at 15:30:59 on 24 January and continued until the end of the visibility window at 22:14:36 on 25 January .
Given the interest expressed by the scientific community in these observations the Project Scientist declared the ToO to be public and all scientific data recorded during this ToO has now been made publicly available from the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre at Geneva .
( See the link to ToO data for 1E 1547.0 - 5408 on the right - hand menu . )
Early results : magnetar still active , spectrum measured
A preliminary examination of the data indicates that the magnetar was still in an active phase during the ToO and that it was detected by all X - ray instruments on - board the satellite .
Apart from bursts , which occurred during the observation and were again seen by several satellites , it was also possible to determine the X - ray spectrum of this AXP .
The spectrum extends up to energies of at least 150 keV and has the signature of processes usually associated with emission of a jet or other non-thermal processes , rather than showing a " hot spot " on the neutron star ’s surface ( ATEL 1908 ) .
A simultaneous observation of lower energy X - rays by the Swift satellite indicates that the X - ray emission is travelling towards us through dusty regions of our Galaxy causing ring - like halos in the X - ray images ( GCN 8848 ) .
This allows scientists now not only to study the neutron star itself , but also the interstellar medium of the Milky Way .
Further observations of 1E 1547.0 - 5408 with INTEGRAL are planned for later this week as part of an additional dedicated observation .

A group of churches in Oxford is hosting a conference to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of scientist Charles Darwin .
The event also commemorates the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal book the Origin of Species , on the theory of evolution .
Organiser the Reverend Tim Stead said it wanted to explore the relationship between science and religion .
He said evolution was one of the " most influential scientific ideas ever " .
The conference is aimed at " exploring Darwin 's contribution to our world view " .
Mr Stead said : " It impacts on our entire understanding of the world .
" One of our aims in holding this conference is to go some way towards redressing the impression that some of the general public have that Christians are anti-science and anti-Darwin . "
Mr Stead said many Christians wanted to celebrate Darwin 's huge contribution to their world view .
" This is a chance to set the record straight and to explore how it is possible for faith to sit alongside Darwin 's views , " he said .
" Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection is one of the most influential scientific ideas ever conceived . "
TORONTO : A Canadian , who is on trial in Winnipeg city for killing another Canadian five years ago , has revealed he once plotted his own death at the hands of an Indian man .
He says he agreed to be killed and cannibalised by the Indian man in Vancouver where he once worked as a chef .
But this could n’t happen as the Indian man left for India .
Thirty - nine - year - old Sydney Teerhuis faces second - degree murder charge for stabbing Robin Greene 68 times , having sex with his victim before and after the crime and cutting his body into eight parts on the night of July 1 , 2003 .
At his on - going trial for killing Greene , the jury this week learnt that Teerhuis allegedly agreed to be murdered and cannibalised by the Indian man in 2001 .
For this purpose , he claims , he and the Indian man purchased a big pressure cooker , sleeping pills and even selected a specific date to cannibalise him .
` `I told him ( the Indian man ) the only way I ’d do it is if he kept all my bones in a trunk under his bed , ’’ he said .
RAMALLAH , West Bank ( Reuters ) - U.S. envoy George Mitchell said on Thursday opening the Gaza Strip to commercial goods would help to choke off the smuggling that Israel fears could replenish Hamas ’s weapons stocks .
But he said the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas must help to supervise the crossings , a demand that has been a major sticking point in Egyptian - brokered negotiations with the Gaza Strip ’s Hamas rulers for a long - term ceasefire .
“ To be successful in preventing the illicit traffic of arms into Gaza , there must be a mechanism to allow the flow of legal goods , and that should be with the participation of the Palestinian Authority , ” Mitchell said after meeting Abbas .
Abbas ’s Western - backed Palestinian Authority holds sway only in the West Bank after Hamas wrested control of the Gaza Strip from his Fatah movement in fighting in 2007 .
Rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli air strikes over the past two days have threatened to undermine Mitchell ’s efforts to consolidate a fragile truce between Israel and Hamas that went into effect on January 18 , ending 22 days of fighting .
Militants launched one rocket from Gaza into Israel late on Wednesday , the first since the January 18 ceasefire , and another on Thursday .
No one was hurt .
Israeli aircraft then struck in the southern Gaza Strip , attacking a metal workshop that the military called a weapons factory , causing no casualties ; and a motorcycle , wounding two militants and 10 youths passing by , medical workers said .
While Israel said ending rocket fire at its towns was the main aim of its assault on Gaza , Hamas insists there can be no lasting truce until Israel ends a near - total blockade of goods traffic into Gaza , tightened when Hamas came to power .
U.S. President Barack Obama dispatched Mitchell on his week - long mission in an early signal of the new administration ’s commitment to promote Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
Speaking on Al Aqsa TV , Ismail Haniyeh , Hamas ’s leader in the Gaza Strip , cited Obama ’s campaign pledge to bring change after the Bush presidency .
“ We are hopeful that there will be a full review by the president and his administration regarding the Middle East and specifically the Palestinian case , ” Haniyeh said .
But with the February 10 election approaching , Israeli leaders have been talking tough on security , a main voter concern .
They have pledged a strong response to a blast that killed an Israeli soldier on the Gaza border on Tuesday and to the rockets .
Palestinian militants said the rockets were payback for Israel ’s killing of three Palestinians since the truce began .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Some 1,300 Palestinians , including at least 700 civilians , were killed during Israel ’s Gaza offensive , according to the Hamas - run Health Ministry in the territory .
Israel put its losses at 10 soldiers and three civilians .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a candidate for prime minister , said the government will not restrain itself even if militants fire only a few rockets .
“ Our strategic objective is to restore calm to the south , but if they ( Hamas ) do not understand this through one operation , there will be more .
And if they do not understand this through military operations , we will complete our objective by bringing about their downfall , ” Livni said .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu , who tops opinion polls ahead of the election , saw more violence ahead .
“ It ’s clear Hamas is rearming .
Of course it ’s attacking us .
Of course it ’s trying us , ” Netanyahu told Israel Radio .
“ The next government will have no choice but to finish the work and remove the Iranian terror base for good . ”
Israel has secured U.S. and European pledges to help to prevent Hamas , which it says receives weapons from Iran , from rearming through tunnels under the Gaza - Egypt border and by sea .
Egypt has also limited movement through its Rafah crossing with the Gaza Strip .
But the tunnels have been the only way for Gazans to get the commercial goods that Israel keeps out , and they have begun to rebuild the ones that Israeli bombs destroyed .
Haniyeh said a ceasefire deal “ must guarantee the lifting of the siege . ”
Under a 2005 agreement brokered by the United States , the Palestinian Authority was to help to oversee border crossings .
The deal gives Hamas no role .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Mitchell on Wednesday that Israel would not reopen any Gaza crossings , except for aid shipments , until an Israeli soldier captured in 2006 was freed , an Israeli official said .
The United Nations on Thursday launched an appeal for $ 613 million for emergency humanitarian aid and rebuilding in Gaza .
We know that Destructoid 's audience is n't just game players .
There 's game makers in the bunch , as well as people who aspire to be .
They 'll be pleased to know that the ESA Foundation has now doubled the number of scholarships available to up - and - coming game designers .
They now have $ 90,000 set aside , and plan to double the awards from 15 to 30 , making scholarships to women and minorities who want to get into game development .
Now in its third year , the ESA Foundation ’s Scholarship Program will help high - school and college students who plan to get into fields supporting video game development , including graphic design , computer science , animation or programming , digital entertainment or software engineering .
If you 're one of those , you can apply online for your scholarship for the 2009 - 10 school year until May 15th .
And if you 're making a big - budget game , please let me do the soundtrack !

I think the reaction to this is overblown .
First of all , Obama did n't write the stimulus package .
Could it be the cartoonist is suggesting that the package is so stupid , an ape could have written it ?
Are we now to endure four years of hyper - PC because we have a black president ?
And coming out of the mouth of Sharpton , one of the biggest opportunists , we all need to lighten up and take a deep breath .
And yes , I did vote for him .

People are going apeshit [ not a pun ] over the economic meltdown and the more jobs lost and the more bank failures and scary omens , the worse it will get .
People are leaping on little threads of misunderstood information and making wild and terrorizing theories out of them , like savages juicing up for war .
Sometimes it 's the exact same bit of misunderstood information causing equal amounts of wildness on every side .
Rep Kanjorski recently let slip some vague accounting of the run on the money markets last September 18th .
Because of his imprecision people on the left thought it happened on September 11th and were calling it a new financial 9/11 ; people from Planet Paranoia were saying it was the Mossad pulling off another false flag ; people on the right were saying George Soros wanted to make sure Obama won , so he did it .
It freaked me out .
So I googled my brains out to find out exactly what happened , including enduring the hours of the House Finance Subcommittee hearing where Bernanke and Paulson showed up to explain why they wanted $ 750 billion right away .
The money markets had become even more fragile when Lehman Brothers tanked the week before .
It was barely holding .
Bernanke and Paulson were n't getting any sleep from sitting on the markets , but on the 18th they stopped paying a dollar for every dollar invested .
So the fund managers started moving out of the money market and into treasuries for safety , even though that made the return go down to a fraction of 1 % .
The only way Bernanke and Paulson could stop the run out of the money markets was to make emergency guarantees to the fund managers trying to get out .
They had to keep this up through the next day , Friday , September 19th .
It was the modern equivalent of the bank run in ' 29 , but they put the brakes on before it could constitute an immediate and total crash of global finance .
It was n't a new 9/11 .
The Mossad did n't do it .
George Soros did n't do it .
It was the natural consequence of ASSHOLES playing games --- musical chairs --- with CDOs all that time .
Everybody knew about it .
Everybody knew it was coming .
The financial press and most of the political press had been talking about it for a long time , and what the heck was going to happen when China got hip to all that bad paper they were buying that we were calling AAA rated .
So then it happens and people go apeshit , go feral , savage ....
Their fear makes them revert to their very ugliest selves .
That 's part of why all this secrecy and criminality is SO very , very bad .
It frightens people .
Turns them into terrified animals .
They need to see the bad guys getting thrown in the slammer .
They need the truth .
They need the fucking MSM to do its job .
They need the fucking government to do its job .
This is end of the world kind of urgent and everyone has been under too much stress for far too long .
If I were going to run a post on this cartoon , I 'd title it something more along the lines of Rupert Murdoch Should Be Shot For Running This Cartoon , but I 'm told that 's not very journalistic ....
Anyway , my point is :
We can expect the savagery to get worse , and the failure of the Democratic Party to bring us relief in the form of prosecutions for the war crimes and financial crimes and insults to the Constitution is definitely part of the engine of this mounting savagery .
It is the job of the new administration and congress to deal with this stuff and all anyone sees is them pumping more billions into bad banks and bad companies and borrowing at levels we all know cause runaway inflation .
I 'm not saying it 's Obama 's fault some pig drew this and an even bigger pig printed it , but it is now his responsibility to deal with the mounting terror from the last eight years .
His party made up their minds not to do jack until they had the White House and their majorities ... against all decency and humanity .
NOW what is their excuse ?
They have none .
And there 's only so long people can swallow mounting hysteria from this many insults to their sensibilities .
If we do n't get some ADULTS working on it , any day now this is going to turn into the set for Road Warrior .

I was listening to Malloy this evening , he was referencing testimony given by former Adm .
Blair , now the ( what ?
Director of Nat. Security ? )
Blair was saying that the economic crisis could very well turn into large pockets of organized civil unrest that would require a military presence to suppress ...
Malloy goes on to read an article by Chris Hedges that speculates all sorts of people outside the scope of anything " organized " in terms of a resistance movement , people like us who are clearly " disgruntled " and speaking out will likely be the targets of such military supression .
This is what " they " are preparing for .
And to think it could potentially be averted , at least in terms of governmental confidence , if the Democrats would just sack up and put the people in jail who need to be put in jail .
Then again , as many have mentioned here , there are likely a good number of Democrats in that prosecutable group .

It makes me want to puke that so many of them far prefer aiming their " active denial " rays on crowds of ripped - off citizens than to lose their partisan head trips and FUNCTION ... no matter what country we 're talking .
If they do n't pull it together soon , the people will do it for them the good old - fashioned way .
And , yes , I truly believe that putting people in jail for all this stuff , doing that " looking back " Obama is so loath to engage in , would do the very most to avert chaos in the streets , everywhere , of any other thing he could do .
It would chasten the guys who want to run with the criminals .
It would be a huge relief for the scared witless average person , and it would give people " hope " , give back the vital energy needed to meet this crisis and get through it without forfeiting more liberty or our civilization .
It HAS to get done .
Right away .
People should be swinging from Obama 's earlobes , tap dancing on his forehead , until he takes this on and sees it through .
Throwing rhetoric and billions at it will not work .

" What Now Toons " response to the " New York Post 's Racist Cartoon ! "
The New York Posts cartoon ?!!
What can I say , this is a despicable cartoon , for all too many reasons .
For years the racists have referred to African Americans as monkeys , this is a throwback to those terrible Jim Crow times .
Then you have the issue of domestic terrorism , because that is what this cartoon implies , shooting a beloved president , this cartoon is just irresponsible on so many levels .
The cartoonist has crossed the line of bad taste and fans the flames of political threats .
I 'm a political cartoonist from the left side of the fence , and it would NEVER cross my mind to draw a cartoon of this nature about Bush , I never did , check out my toons to see

The function of modern government is to take from the poor and give to the rich ... look at the evidence ... do n't listen to their words .
How many small companies received a bailout of taxpayers money = 0 ... corporate socialism ... kinda like the old Soviet Union do n't yea thunk ?

This cartoon should never have made it past intelligent editors .
It should n't have made it past a stupid editor .
The cartoon even under the most generous reading of its intent , is n't funny or ironic .
It is bad on every level ; racist , violent , and unclear in its intent in any other way you could try to interpret it .
Sadly , the not so subliminal message is VERY CLEAR .

Matt # 2 : i concur .
when we " over " react we help that pendulum to keep swinging , & by being too pc , we swing it again by pretending these feelings do n't exist .
yes , we need 2 know racism so that we might not participate .
you know how every racist joke starts , don'tcha ?

Nonsense .
There is nothing racist whatever about this cartoon .
The story of the chimp that went savage in Stamford , CT probably did n't get much play in the West Coast , but it is all over the news here .
A woman 's 200 lb. pet chimp savagely attacked a 55 yr old friend .
The police arrived , it attacked them , and they shot it dead .
The righteous indignation crowd , including Sharpton , who are so quick to take offense , need to lighten up .
I dislike the cartoon because it is tasteless ( not racist ) .
This is a tragedy for the woman who owned the chimp as well as the person attacked .
Moreover , I do n't like its politics -- the Stimulus Act looks promising to me .
Finally , and worst of all , it is not funny .

Any cartoon that need to be explained is exactly what the first impression is - wrong .
It 's racist and only those over 40 yrs old know it .
Younger than that ???
maybe not .
But for us older Americans , we know exactly what it is .
Racist and threatening against our President .
Not even 30 days into his presidency and a cartoonist is drawing him shot by cops and dead .
Unfrigginbelievable .

A lot of talk in these comments
The question is :
What can be done to the NY Post so they think a whole lot harder before printing this kind of cartoon ?
Murdoch is about power and money .
Is he bothered by people complaining about his paper here ?
If no ... then what can people do ?

Greg I 'm writing to him now to tell him I will be his conscience for a mere million dollars a month .
If he follows my advice , he will die beloved of the multitudes and be with the buddhas of the ten directions in eternity .
If not , people will be a lot happier because of my philanthropy anyway .
Short of that , obviously , the only thing that would work is highly illegal , and very seriously not done .

Let me see if I can paraphrase this right -
" Due to our advertizers forcing us to respond to a mountain of undue critcism , we apologize to certain people who incorrectly misinterpreted wednesday 's page six cartoon , and were subsequently offended by their misinterpretation of the image .
We really can't see how anyone could possibly think that a chimpanzee could be construed as a caricature of a black man , but , since that seems to be the case , there you have it .
However , this sentiment does not apply to anyone who disagrees with our editorial point of view , because we really do n't care what you think , and are more than happy to offend your delicate liberal sensibilities at any time .
So to those of you who fall into the latter category , to be clear , we are NOT apologizing to you in any way , shape , or form .
Now please go f*ck yourselves . "

Murdoch is the one who should be fired .
He 's the one who encourages all this feral shit that passes for journalism and commentary .
Either make him pay me that million bucks a month to turn his ass around , or rise up and take him down .

I do n't know Feasic ; I do know grok , though .
Too much brainwashing going on for most people to be able to grok what it 's about .
As I 've been saying , we gotta do some heavy deprogramming , of the kind the Brad Blog has been doing consistently .
Look at the opposition the Brad Blog gets from the so - called left !
They are fighting tooth and nail to keep their brainwashed views .
But we have to keep putting the facts , the facts out there all the time in a way that people can understand .
We need to deconstruct the bullshit , all the time .
If we can wake people up , then the Rupert Murdochs will have less power .
Thank Goddess for the internet .

Shrinking HTML5
orderedlist.com starting to publish articles on how to use structural tags and the new doctype in existing browsers and following ( and following up on ) “ html5 ” and “ html 5 ” on Twitter almost becoming a full - time job are indicators HTML5 is getting more stable .
The issues graph suggests the same .
As you may recall , the plan of the editor is to get to Last Call by the end of this year .
As a result , Ian has been focusing on addressing the remaining feedback and splitting out parts of the HTML5 draft .
Not alone actually , Adam ( security fame , Google Chrome ) is helping with splitting out content sniffing and Dan ( former HTML WG co-chair ) intends to work on splitting out the URL section .
All in all , that removes content sniffing rules , URL handling , and Web Sockets from the HTML5 draft .
( For what it ’s worth , XMLHttpRequest was at some point part of HTML5 as well . )
This is probably a good thing as they are quite orthogonal from HTML5 itself , e.g. the XMLHttpRequest specification currently references HTML5 URL handling as they are in fact the same .
Ian made a list of other sections that could be taken out , though it is unclear at this point how much of that will happen .
I ’m curious to see what will happen when some of these drafts hit the IETF ( e.g. URL handling and content sniffing ) as I assume they are quite controversial .
Running code is there , but rough consensus remains to be seen .

休日にまとまった時間があるときなどにスキーツアーに出かける際に、その出発地が東京という方は少なくありません。数多く提供されている東京発のスキーツアーにはどのような種類のツアーがあるのか、どんな楽しみ方があるのかなどについては勿論のこと、選ぶ時にはどういった条件で選べばベストのかなどについてを以下で詳しく説明していきます。
⇒卒業旅行にオススメ！レンタル一式付きスキーツアーがあるスキー場6選！
手軽に出かけられる格安ツアーも多い
東京発のスキーツアーでは、格安価格で行くことが出来るツアーも少なくありません。こうしたツアーの場合にはリフト料金から交通費に至るまで全て込みの値段で提供されていますから、自分であれこれ手配するよりも料金が安くなります。
出来る限りお金をかけないでスキーツアーに出かけたいと考えているのならば、まず格安ツアーをチョイスすることにして、お手頃価格でウインタースポーツを満喫してみるのも悪くはないでしょう。
日帰りのスキーツアーの場合で気軽に楽しむ
休日にまとまった休みをとることができない方の場合には、日帰りのスキーツアーを選ぶのもベストです。東京の各エリアから出発が設定されており、集合場所に時間までに集まってバスで出かけるツアーから、新幹線や鉄道などを使ってダイレクトにゲレンデまで直行して楽しむツアーなどもあります。
新幹線の場合には多少料金が高くなりますが、時間をかけずに目的地まで行くことができますので、出来る限り早く出かけてみたいという方にはベストです。指定席やグリーン席にアップグレードできるプランなどもありますから、着席して行き帰りの列車に乗車したいという方の場合には、グレードアップするのも良いでしょう。
有名なリゾート地に行けるツアーも多くあり、本格的な雪質の中で滑りたい方でも安心して使えます。また、格安に行くことが出来るバスツアーの場合には、前日の深夜に出かけるか早朝に出発することで、ゲレンデでのひとときをより長く過ごすこともできますので、滞在時間をできるだけ多く取りたい場合にも、バスツアーは便利です。
行き帰りのバス代とリフト券の料金はツアープランの中に組み込まれていますので、格安で手軽に行きたい方の場合にはバスツアーを選ぶのも悪くは無いでしょう。このように、日帰りのツアーはバスツアーから新幹線ツアーまで選択肢は豊富です。
温泉宿に滞在しながらのスキーツアー
全国各地にあるスキー場の中には、温泉宿がその周辺に有るというケースも少なくありません。スキーに出かける際に、温泉も楽しみながらスキーも一緒に楽しみたい方は、温泉宿に滞在しながら楽しめるプランを選ぶのもベストです。
グレードのさまざまな温泉宿があり、老舗高級旅館は勿論のこと、泊まりやすいリーズナブルな旅館に至るまで、選択肢は豊富です。温泉宿の場合には、スキー場で一日中滑っていて疲れた体を癒やすことも可能ですので、レジャーとリラクゼーションを両立させられます。
温泉宿では豪華な料理を振る舞われる場合も多く、料理に舌鼓を打ちながらスキーツアーをより楽しいものにしていくことが可能です。
もちろん東京を出発地にする場合にも、温泉宿に泊まりながら出かけられるプランは少なくありません。例えば、全国各地にあるスキーリゾート地の中でその付近に温泉地がある場合には、温泉宿とリフト代に交通費が含まれたスキーツアーをチョイスするのも良いでしょう。
本格的なスキーリゾートならばどんなレベルでも楽しめる
東京発で行くことができるスキー場の中には、日本国内は勿論のこと全国から人気を集めているスキー場も少なくありません。そうしたスキーリゾートの場合には、滞在していても飽きることがなく、広大なゲレンデの中でどんどんレベルアップをはかっていくことが可能でしょう。
なぜなら、斜度が緩やかで広い初心者コースから、そこそこの斜度がありスピードを出して滑ることが可能な急斜面に、深雪やコブなどがある中上級者向けのコースに至るまで、さまざまなレベルに合わせたゲレンデが用意されていることが少なくないからです。
さらに、広大なスキーリゾートではリフトも高速リフトが完備されていたり、山頂までダイレクトに行くことができるゴンドラを完備していたりすることが多いですから、滑るときにもストレスを感じることなくゲレンデ間の移動を行えます。
また、短いコースだけでは満足できない方や、変化に富んだ斜面が良いという方にもスキーリゾートなら心ゆくまでスキーツアーを楽しめるでしょう。
荷物を持っていくのが面倒な時には
スキーツアーに出かけるに当たって、スキー用具一式を持っていくことが面倒なことも少なくありません。そのような時にはスキー場でレンタルができるプランを選ぶのも良いですし、手持ちのスキー用具を滞在先のゲレンデ、あるいはホテルまで宅配便などで送るのも良いでしょう。
往復の宅配料金などが含まれたプランも、東京発のスキーツアーにはありますので、移動の際に荷物を持っていくのが面倒な場合には、こうしたプランを活用することでより快適にスキーツアーを楽しむことができます。
予約を入れる際にはできるだけ早めに
スキーシーズンの中でもハイシーズンと春スキーのシーズンがあります。ハイシーズンの場合には気温が低くて雪質も良好というゲレンデが多いですから、その分ホテルなどの予約が取りにくかったり、バスツアーなどの場合にもすぐに満席になってしまったりすることがあります。
ですから、ハイシーズンに東京発のスキーツアーに出かけようと考えるのならば、旅程が決まった段階でなるべく早めにおさえておくことにしましょう。早めに予約を入れることで、希望通りの日程に行くことが可能になります。
また、春スキーシーズンの場合には格安料金でいけることが多いですが、学生の長期休暇などと重なることもあり、この場合も早めに予約しておくのがおすすめです。特に東京発のツアー場合には予約する人も多いですから、ハイシーズンでも春スキーシーズンでも、どちらの場合でも出来る限り早めにツアー予約を済ませましょう。
足を伸ばして海外へ行くのも楽しい
スキーが出来るのは日本国内だけではありません。北米やヨーロッパなど良好な雪質のゲレンデというのは世界中に存在しています。予算に余裕がある方は思い切って海外に出かけてみるのも良いでしょう。日本とはまた違ったスケールのゲレンデも多く、自由にスキーツアーを楽しむことが可能です。
東京から出発できる海外のスキーツアーというのは多く、現地で異文化を体感しながらウインタースポーツにも熱中できますので、海外のスキーに興味がある方は是非、東京発の海外スキーツアーに出かけてエンジョイしましょう。

Trackbacks 2008 Year - End Report on the Federal Judiciary : I suspect many are tired of hearing it , and I know I am tired of saying it , but I must make this plea again — Congress must provide judicial compensation that keeps pace with inflation .
. . .
Last year , Congress fell just short of enacting legislation , reported out of both House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary , that would have restored cost - of - living salary adjustments that judges have been denied in past years .
One year later , Congress has still failed to complete action on that crucial remedial legislation , despite strong bipartisan support and an aggregate cost that is miniscule in relation to the national budget and the importance of the Judiciary 's role .
To make a bad situation worse , Congress failed , once again , to provide federal judges an annual cost - of - living increase this year , even though it provided one to every other federal employee , including every Member of Congress .
Congress 's inaction this year vividly illustrates why judges ' salaries have declined in real terms over the past twenty years .
Given the Judiciary 's small cost , and its absolutely critical role in protecting the Constitution and rights we enjoy , I must renew the Judiciary 's modest petition : Simply provide cost - of - living increases that have been unfairly denied !
We have done our part — it is long past time for Congress to do its .
Thanks to Howard Bashman for the link .
Happy New Year , everyone ( which I mean in an entirely inoffensive way ) .

From the Chief Justice 's report : Thanks to Howard Bashman for the link .
Happy New Year , everyone ( which I mean in an entirely inoffensive way ) .
There 's a moment in NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun Huang 's recent interview with Charlie Rose , where the graphics exec holds up a card - sized Ion board and , after pointing out for his interviewer which of the board 's two chips is Intel 's Atom and which is NVIDIA 's 9400 M , he says , " This is where the computer industry is going . "
Unfortunately for NVIDIA , he 's exactly right , and in two respects : 1 ) smaller and cheaper have replaced same - sized and faster in the hearts and wallets of the world 's chip customers , and 2 ) a CPU plus a GPU is still the future of computing .
I say " unfortunately , " because number one means painfully shrinking profit margins on all categories of semiconductors , and number two means that Intel is still the guy in charge of doling out seats on the last lifeboat left ( i.e. the netbook ) after the PC industry hit an iceberg in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
And so it is that NVIDIA , which just announced that it saw an astounding and sudden 43 percent quarter - over - quarter drop in revenues in the fourth quarter of last year , is left to make the case that Atom and the 9400 M belong together , like Leo and Kate , in the smaller / cheaper semi market that will be all that 's left when the PC market as we knew it for 25 years has finally slipped beneath the waves .
By implication , this means that NVIDIA and Intel belong together , which is why the GPU maker has to walk a very fine line in its efforts to ensure that it is n't locked out of the mobile future and forced to wait for the high - margin , performance - oriented core of its present business to recover .
But the present economic troubles have forced Jen - Hsun 's company into a critical juncture , where there is no margin for error and the consequences of failure are enormous .
A world of hurt
Jen -Hsun told Charlie Rose that , " 20 percent , maybe 30 percent , of our business goes toward hardcore gamers . "
My own suspicion is that the number is even higher .
NVIDIA 's most expensive , highest - margin parts are its high - end discrete GPUs and the supercomputing - oriented Tesla line that 's derived from those GPUs ; the latter just started shipping for revenues last year , and is a miniscule part of NVIDIA 's bottom line .
The medium - term prognosis for both of these segments is grim if the still - accelerating downturn continues , and it will continue .
But even within the mobile space , which fared less poorly than the desktop space , there was nowhere for NVIDIA to hide in the fourth quarter .
The company 's revenues were down 60 percent year - over - year in the fourth quarter of 2008 , and every segment of the company 's business saw red .
Here 's the breakdown given by NVIDIA CFO Marvin Burkett on the earnings call yesterday :
The weakness in demand for the fourth quarter was across the board .
Compared to Q3 the GPU business was down 47 % ; the Professional Services business was down 44 % ; and the NCP business was down 51 % .
There were no safe havens .
Within the GPU business desktop was down 34 % as we believe we regained some market share particularly in the high end , but the overall high end market was very soft .
Notebook was down 63 % , reflecting the buying trend toward low end systems with integrated graphics .
Memory was down to $ 7.2 million for the quarter from $ 22.3 million the prior quarter .
All of this was in the environment of the channel depleting inventory .
Burkett is describing a world of hurt in which buyers in all segments fled the one factor that is at the core of NVIDIA 's entire business case : performance .
This situation makes NVIDIA 's attempts to get the 9400M +
Atom combination off the ground all the more critical to the company 's future .
But Intel could be making things difficult .
Pay to play ?
Burkett is describing a world of hurt in which buyers in all segments fled the one factor that is at the core of NVIDIA 's entire business case : performance .
This situation makes NVIDIA 's attempts to get the 9400M +
Atom combination off the ground all the more critical to the company 's future .
But Intel could be making things difficult .
There have been rumors for a while now that Intel is somehow working against the Ion platform , rumors that Intel vehemently and officially denies .
The company has thrown up no roadblocks , it claims , to the use of Atom with the 9400 M , and anyone is free to buy an Atom processor on the open market and pair it with anything they like .
I 'm certain that Intel is telling the truth here , but I 've been following the company for a decade and I know that it has more than one way to lock out a competitor .
During the height of the Intel vs. AMD wars , when AMD 's K7 and K8 were successfully stealing Intel 's server and desktop marketshare , Dell 's outright refusal to consider AMD processors in any part of its lineup was a very obvious red flag that something was up .
And what was up was an open secret in the industry :
Dell got major rebates from Intel on its processor purchases , nominally in exchange for its marketing partnership with Intel , but there were also allegations that Dell 's keeping AMD out of its computers was also part of the package .
In other words , Dell allegedly bought Intel processors and chipsets exclusively , and in return got part of its money back through Intel 's marketing development fund .
It 's entirely conceivable that some sort of MDF - based rebate arrangement is at the heart of the Ion issue .
Intel tells me that Atom is not part of the " Intel Inside " marketing program , so the exact rebate mechanism would have to be different than it was in the Dell case , but there could still be something there that makes it effectively more expensive to just use Atom alone , without the accompanying chipset .
I must caveat all of the above with the following : the Intel - Dell arrangement that I described has never officially been confirmed that I know of .
It was always more of an " open secret " sort of thing , so it is technically just a rumor ; this means that my take on the Ion situation is speculation based on rumor .
So , caveat lector .

Yet another one for the government ’s ‘ helping ourselves to your liberties ’ file :
The British Journal of Photography reports that from February 16 , the thrill that is photographing coppers acting like arses will be taken from us by new laws ‘ that allow for the arrest – and imprisonment – of anyone who takes pictures of officers ‘ likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism ’.’
The BJP continues :
‘ A person found guilty of this offence could be liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years , and to a fine .
‘ The law is expected to increase the anti terrorism powers used today by police officers to stop photographers , including press photographers , from taking pictures in public places .
‘’ Who is to say that police officers wo n’t abuse these powers , ’ asks freelance photographer Justin Tallis .
Tallis , a London based photographer , was covering the anti-BBC protest on Saturday 24 January when he was approached by a police officer .
‘ Tallis had just taken a picture of the officer , who then asked to see the picture .
The photographer refused , arguing that , as a press photographer , he had a right to take pictures of police officers .
‘ According to Tallis , the officer then tried to take the camera away .
Before giving up , the officer said that Tallis ’ should n’t have taken that photo , you were intimidating me ’ . ”
Pity that photos of police intimidating the rest of us will be erased from history in advance by these laws – that , you can be sure , is the point of this little initiative .
Slipped into law as an unassuming adjunct to last year ’s counter terrorism act amend to the terrorism act , these laws could see photographers banged up for ten years for catching a copper in an act that ought to get the copper a lot longer than that .
Rodney King , anyone ?
How about the great war photos of Larry Burrows – one of a number of extraordinary and extraordinarily brave artists who helped change the American course in Vietnam with pictures that showed Americans at less than their best ?
( Members of the armed forces will also be out of bounds after 16 Feb ) .
And okay , we may not all be Burrows – but there could well be one out there who is stopped before even starting .
Who knows what we ’ll miss ?
We only know what we ’ve been able get thus far .
I work with an NUJ phtographer who has taken a great many photos of police – partly for the thrill , sure , but partly because the police are impossible to leave out of the photos that we take at the events we attend these days .
They turn up , at least in their hundreds and often in their thousands , to every protest , march , and political action that takes place in these fair isles .
Their numbers are often out of proportion – I ’ve thought on more than one occasion that there ’ve been more coppers present than protestors – and they ’re greatly oppressive because of it .
That in itself ought to be recorded by photographers , as they record this point in our history : we live in an age of terrific state paranoia , and we ’re surrounded by cops as a result .
That ’s the main reason why there are thousands of coppers in our photos , anyway .
We rarely look for them – we ’ve hardly ever gone out with the cameras with the sole intention of photographing the police .
They look for us .
They ’re always there .
On the few occasions that we have looked for the police , they have done their best to stop us taking their pictures .
Not that long ago , we were in Shoreditch on a weekend , and saw a bunch of coppers gathered around a black guy on the side of the street .
His Mercedes was parked just in front of us , and the cops were in a circle around him on the footpath .
They saw us with the camera .
One of them sprinted over and demanded to see the pictures we ’d taken .
‘ You have to think about that guy ’s dignity , ’ he told us , indicating the black guy in the middle of the group of coppers .
‘ It ’s not fair for his dignity to take photos of him . ’
I wanted to ask why – if they were so concerned about the guy ’s dignity – they were making such a public display of their frisking of him , but decided against it .
The cop was threatening , and we knew that he ’d try and confiscate the camera if we pushed it .
Anyway – I have hundreds of photos of policemen and women on my site .
Here are just a few .
Their pictures are all over the header on my website as well , as they have been for more than two years .
I can hardly photoshop the buggers out now .
We ’ve even got a photo of coppers taking a photo of my photographer photographing coppers .
Wonder if that ’ll count ?

Also , the BJP reports that protests will take place tomorrow .
Mark Thomas will attend .
A 16 - year - old student went to a job interview instead of the hospital after he and a schoolmate were stabbed yesterday .
Staff at the King West Vets veterinary clinic said the Central Commerce Collegiate student showed up on time for his 1 p.m. co-op placement interview .
But when employees noticed blood on his leg , they called police .
" He did really well on the interview and we were very proud of him for sticking to the appointment , " said veterinarian Kent Ackerman .
He would n't say if the student will get the job .
The teen , the second 16 - year - old to be stabbed in the Crawford and College Sts. area yesterday , was taken to hospital with minor injuries .
Undermining women ’s reproductive rights and access to health care has been a pervasive theme of the outgoing administration .
On his first full day in office , President Bush imposed the “ global gag rule , ” which prohibits taxpayer dollars from going to international family - planning groups that perform abortions using their own funds or that advocate for safe abortion laws .
So it was unsurprising , but still dismaying , that the secretary of health and human services , Michael Leavitt , chose to extend that dismal record at the last minute with yet another awful regulation .
A parting gift to the far right , the new regulation aims to hinder women ’s access to abortion , contraceptives and the information necessary to make decisions about their own health .
What makes it worse is that the policy is wrapped up in a phony claim to safeguard religious freedom .
The law has long allowed doctors and nurses to refuse to participate in an abortion .
Mr. Leavitt ’s changes elevate the so - called right to refuse beyond reason to an increased number of medical institutions and a broad range of health care workers and services  including abortion referrals , unbiased counseling and provision of emergency contraception , even to rape victims .
The impact will be hardest on poor women who rely on public programs for their health care .
In July , Barack Obama , still a senator at the time , signed a letter to Mr. Leavitt , along with some of his colleagues , urging Mr. Leavitt to scrap an earlier draft of the regulation .
It cited a number of problems that were perpetuated in the final version .
' We Are not the Bad Guys ' Switzerland To Loosen Bank Secrecy
The Swiss are being asked to give up their principle of banking secrecy as the United States , Britain , Germany and others campaign for the elimination of tax havens .
The country is now asking itself how the change could affect the standard of living .
The once admired company known as AIG has become a black hole -- losing more than $ 100 billion in 2008 , vaporizing $ 150 + billion of taxpayer bailout money , and now threatening to suck in all the wealth in the western world .
( Okay , we exaggerate : A reader assures us that the loss on AIG credit default swaps can't exceed $ 440 billion .
Of course , now all of AIG 's other assets are plummeting in value , too , and it has a $ 1 trillion of them ) .
Even now , AIG and the government are in talks to fork over more taxpayer cash and ease the burden of AIG 's bailout interest payments ( Surprise !
All those priceless divisions that AIG promised to sell last fall to pay off the debts can't be sold ) .
One planned solution is for AIG to sign over to the taxpayer stakes in the plummeting Asian subsidiaries that AIG can't sell .
The Treasury will no doubt accept AIG 's argument that these assets are worth the same as they were in 2007 ( preposterous ) , and , thus , the AIG bailout cost will soar well over $ 200 billion .
Worse , the government will then own and operate Asian insurance subsidiaries that it can't sell , either .
Sickening .
But here 's worse news : AIG is only the beginning .
Until we bite the bullet and do what we should have done in the beginning -- make shareholders and bondholders of insolvent companies pay for their own stupid mistakes - - our running bailout tab ( and ownership of the economy ) will continue to soar .
Citigroup .
Bank of America .
Any number of smaller insurance companies , banks , car companies , pension funds .
They all need saving .
They will all create " systemic " problems if they are n't saved .
And they will all manage to persuade us , in the heat and fear of the moment , that if they can just have another , say , $ 30 billion , they 'll quickly return to profitability and make us money ( it 's an investment , after all .
Not a bailout ) .
The more money we put in , the less willing we will be to stop putting money in , because the systemic risk will remain and we 'll have that much more to lose .
Well , enough .
AIG has $ 225 billion of long - term debt ( as of Sept 30 ) .
Let 's start by converting 80 % of that to equity .
Then we can change the terms of all the CDS and other contracts that AIG has to come up with collateral for ( this would happen in bankruptcy , anyway ) .
That should buy us some time .
And while we 're waiting to see what else we need to do with AIG , we can do the same at Bank of America and Citigroup : Convert all the preferred stock and some of the debt to equity , improving those banks ' ever - deteriorating capital ratios .
Will this have a devastating impact on everyone who owns all that debt ?
Well , they 'll certainly say so .
No one likes having something they thought was backed by the full faith and credit of the US government actually turn out to be what it said it was : a risky investment .
But they 'll get over it .
They always do .
And they might even be more careful next time ( welcome to the real world ) .
Will such moves end civilization as we know it ?
Always a possibility .
But here 's the good news :
If civilization as we know it ends , it will take AIG down , too .
ESPN 's Franklin McNeil reported on MMA Live 's weigh - in special that Wanderlei Silva will finally take the plunge down to middleweight .
Silva made the decision after going 1 - 3 in his last four fights at 205 .
The move makes a lot of sense .

On Jan. 26 in Copenhagen , I had the privilege to present to former Danish intelligence officer , Frank Grevil , the annual Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence .
The late Sam Adams was a CIA analyst colleague who challenged the " fixing " of intelligence during the Vietnam War .
Thirty - five years later , as we again watched the corruption of intelligence amid the drumbeat for war on Iraq , a small group of Sam 's former colleagues formed Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence .
Our purpose was not only to honor Sam 's memory ; it was also to show future generations of intelligence officers that it is possible — actually , it is morally required — to expose the lies that facilitate war .
In 2002 - 2003 , our profession of intelligence analysis was systematically corrupted in order to deceive Congress out of its Constitutional prerogative to authorize war .
This also happened elsewhere in the " coalition of the willing " — in London , Canberra , and Copenhagen .
Sadly , out of the hundreds of " coalition " intelligence officers aware that war was being " justified " on false pretenses , only two — Elizabeth Gun in the U.K. and Frank Grevil in Denmark — provided documentary evidence exposing the mandacity of their governments .
Both were brought to trial for exposing secrets .
The British government quickly realized that proceeding against Katharine Gun was not worth the inevitable embarrassment .
In Copenhagen , vindictive officials with guilty consciences sent Grevil to jail .
There is no need to rehabilitate Frank Grevil .
There is a need to honor him .
And so , with heartwarming help from that segment of the Danish populace who care about speaking truth to power , we gave Grevil the Sam Adams Award .
Katharine
Gun read the citation and presented the actual award , while I chaired the ceremony .
In an attempt to do the occasion justice , I prepared the remarks set forth below , from which I drew in an attempt to provide background .
As you will see , I found the whole subject so dim and dismal that I thought I would start with a light - hearted approach — however incongruous .
My remarks follow :
Thank you , one and all , for coming this evening at such short notice and in such encouraging numbers .
Our first order of business is the presenting of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence ( SAAII ) award to former Danish intelligence officer , Maj. Frank Grevil .
You each have a handout [ available on request ] explaining who former CIA analyst Sam Adams was , and why we , his former colleagues , created this movement in his memory .
Representing the Sam Adams Associates , I have the privilege , together with former British Intelligence officer Katharine Gun , who received the award in 2004 , to honor Frank Grevil with the sixth annual Sam Adams Award .
We are grateful to the Danish newspaper Politiken for making the hall available and for publishing notice of this event .
Following the award ceremony proper , Politiken journalist Claus Blok Thomsen will moderate the Politiken - sponsored part of the evening .
That will include , we expect , a free and lively discussion with Q&A , after brief presentations by Katharine , Frank , and me .
But first let me say a word regarding why I feel truly honored to present this award to Maj.
Frank Grevil .
Hans Christian Andersen and Shakespeare
Whenever I come to Denmark , ringing in my ears are the wonderful stories with which your Hans Christian Andersen gifted the world .
Not to mention the words that The Bard put in the mouths of his vivid characters in Hamlet , set in Denmark .
First , Hans Christian Andersen ( we shall get to Shakespeare later ) :
Most of you will remember the story about the king 's " Magic Suit of Clothes . "
The American actor Danny Kaye immortalized that story on film .
As a boy , I memorized much of his musical rendition of those tales and I now sing them to our grandchildren .
What follows is a kind of allegory with , I think , some teaching points .
Once upon a time , in a land far away …no , not far away , but here , in this land , Denmark … there was a king , who was simply insane about new clothes , because he thought they would enhance the distinguished image he craved .
Well , one day swindlers came to see the king — there is an unconfirmed report that they came from the American embassy .
In any case , they came to persuade the king to buy a suit made out of whole cloth — a suit they said was a " magic suit . "
Now , in truth , as they held up the supposed raiment , there was nothing there at all .
But the swindlers were very clever .
They told the king — or was it the prime minister ?— that this was a magic suit and only a wise man would recognize this .
To a fool the suit would be invisible .

Seishu Hanaoka is the name of the first surgeon in the world to have placed his patients under a general anesthetic for major surgery , more than 40 years before the first European medics were able to do so and claim all the credits for their achievement .
Dated October 13th , 1804 , the surgery saw 60 - year - old Kan Aiya rendered unconscious via the use of a brewed mixture of natural plants .
The surgeon then went on to perform a breast cancer operation , completely removing the woman 's tumor .
At the same time , in Europe , which had the most advanced background of surgical knowledge in the world and whose surgeons were able to perform even the most delicate procedures , doctors still had to tie down their patients and put gags in their mouths so that their screams would n't make them lose their focus .
That is to say , the only anesthetics known at the time were massive amounts of alcohol or opium .
However , these substances only numbed the pain .
English writer Fanny Burney said , “ When the dreadful steel was plunged into my breast (...)
I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision .
I almost marvel that it rings not in my ears still , so excruciating was the agony . ”
This is a paragraph from a letter she sent her sister , in which she detailed the surgery that had been performed on her for breast cancer , while she was still fully conscious .
At the time she underwent the procedure , in 1811 , neither her , nor the team performing the operation had any idea that a technique to numb the pain completely had already been devised in Japan .
The first anesthesiologist in the world required more than 20 years to perfect his herbal mix , which he abundantly tested on cats and dogs .
The problems seemed insurmountable at the time .
Too low dosages , and the animals would still feel pain .
Too high , and they suffered massive brain damage or died swiftly .
Hanaoka needed a lot of courage to perform his first operation on a human , but he apparently pulled it off without the patient feeling the smallest of pains .
After that one operation , the great surgeon reportedly successfully completed an additional 150 , which meant that he gained country - wide fame .
Until the end of his life , he had numerous students and became famous for the fact that he could perform surgical procedures other doctors deemed impossible .
But , by the time Japan re-opened its gates to strangers in 1853 , the Western world had no interest in his discovery , as medics there had already discovered ether .
Recently , reviewing lobbying disclosure reports , the Washington Times discovered “ that 18 of the top 20 recipients of federal bailout money spent a combined $ 12.2 million lobbying the White House , the Treasury Department , Congress , and federal agencies during the last quarter of 2008 . ”
Citibank alone , according to the New York Times , fielded “ an army of Washington lobbyists , ” plunking down $ 1.77 million in lobbying fees just in the fourth quarter of last year .
And it is n’t only sinking financial institutions begging for federal dollars that have bolstered their Washington lobbying corps .
So have the biggest U.S. armaments companies  “ drastically , ” according to reporter August Cole of the Wall Street Journal .
In 2008 , he found , Northrop Grumman almost doubled its lobbying budget to $ 20.6 million ( from $ 10.9 million the previous year ) ;
Boeing upped its budget from $ 10.6 million to $ 16.6 million in the same period ; and Lockheed - Martin , the company that received the most contracts from the Pentagon last year , hiked its lobbying efforts by a whopping 54 percent in 2008 .
If you want to get a taste of what that means , then click here to view an ad for that company ’s potentially embattled boondoggle , the F - 22 , the most expensive jet fighter ever built .
What you ’ll discover is not just that it will “ protect ” 300 million people  that ’s you , if you live in the USA  but that it will also employ 95,000 of us .
In other words , the ad ’s threatening message implies , if the Obama administration cuts this program in bad times , it will throw another 95,000 Americans out on the street .
Now that ’s effective lobbying for you , especially when you consider , as Chalmers Johnson does below , that for any imaginable war the U.S. might fight in the coming decades , the F - 22 will be a thoroughly useless plane .
We do n’t usually think of the Pentagon as a jobs - and - careers scam operation , a kind of Mega - Madoff Ponzi scheme that goes BOOM ! , though it is clearly designed for the well - being of defense contractors , military officers , and congressional representatives ; nor do we usually consider the “ defense ” budget as a giant make - work jobs racket , as arms experts Bill Hartung and Christopher Preble recently suggested , but it ’s never too late .
Chalmers Johnson , author of the already - classic Blowback Trilogy , including most recently Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , makes vividly clear just how little the Pentagon is organized to consider the actual defense needs of the United States .
In many ways , it remains a deadly organization of boys with toys that now poses a distinct economic danger to the rest of us .

The Looming Crisis at the Pentagon
How taxpayers finance fantasy wars
by Chalmers Johnson
Like much of the rest of the world , Americans know that the U.S. automotive industry is in the grips of what may be a fatal decline .
Unless it receives emergency financing and undergoes significant reform , it is undoubtedly headed for the graveyard in which many American industries are already buried , including those that made televisions and other consumer electronics , many types of scientific and medical equipment , machine tools , textiles , and much earth - moving equipment  and that ’s to name only the most obvious candidates .
They all lost their competitiveness to newly emerging economies that were able to outpace them in innovative design , price , quality , service , and fuel economy , among other things .
A similar , if far less well known , crisis exists when it comes to the military - industrial complex .
That crisis has its roots in the corrupt and deceitful practices that have long characterized the high command of the armed forces , civilian executives of the armaments industries , and congressional opportunists and criminals looking for pork - barrel projects , defense installations for their districts , or even bribes for votes .
Given our economic crisis , the estimated trillion dollars we spend each year on the military and its weaponry is simply unsustainable .
Even if present fiscal constraints no longer existed , we would still have misspent too much of our tax revenues on too few , overly expensive , overly complex weapons systems that leave us ill - prepared to defend the country in a real military emergency .
We face a double crisis at the Pentagon : we can no longer afford the pretense of being the Earth ’s sole superpower , and we cannot afford to perpetuate a system in which the military - industrial complex makes its fortune off inferior , poorly designed weapons .
Double Crisis at the Pentagon
This self - destructive system of bloated budgets and purchases of the wrong weapons has persisted for so long thanks to the aura of invincibility surrounding the armed forces and a mistaken belief that jobs in the arms industry are as valuable to the economy as jobs in the civilian sector .
Recently , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen began to advocate nothing less than protecting the Pentagon budget by pegging defense spending to a fixed percentage of gross domestic product ( GDP , the total value of goods and services produced by the economy ) .
This would , of course , mean simply throwing out serious strategic analysis of what is actually needed for national defense .
Mullen wants , instead , to raise the annual defense budget in the worst of times to at least 4 percent of GDP .
Such a policy is clearly designed to deceive the public about ludicrously wasteful spending on weapons systems which has gone on for decades .
It is hard to imagine any sector of the American economy more driven by ideology , delusion , and propaganda than the armed services .
Many people believe that our military is the largest , best equipped , and most invincible among the world ’s armed forces .
None of these things is true , but our military is , without a doubt , the most expensive to maintain .
Each year , we Americans account for nearly half of all global military spending , an amount larger than the next 45 nations together spend on their militaries annually .
Equally striking , the military seems increasingly ill - adapted to the types of wars that Pentagon strategists agree the United States is most likely to fight in the future , and is , in fact , already fighting in Afghanistan  insurgencies led by non-state actors .
While the Department of Defense produces weaponry meant for such wars , it is also squandering staggering levels of defense appropriations on aircraft , ships , and futuristic weapons systems that fascinate generals and admirals , and are beloved by military contractors mainly because their complexity runs up their cost to astronomical levels .
That most of these will actually prove irrelevant to the world in which we live matters not a whit to their makers or purchasers .
Thought of another way , the stressed out American taxpayer , already supporting two disastrous wars and the weapons systems that go with them , is also paying good money for weapons that are meant for fantasy wars , for wars that will only be fought in the battlescapes and war - gaming imaginations of Defense Department “ planners . ”
The Air Force and the Army are still planning as if , in the reasonably near future , they were going to fight an old - fashioned war of attrition against the Soviet Union , which disappeared in 1991 ; while the Navy , with its 11 large aircraft - carrier battle groups , is , as William S. Lind has written , “ still structured to fight the Imperial Japanese Navy . ”
Lind , a prominent theorist of so - called fourth - generation warfare ( insurgencies carried out by groups such as al - Qaeda ) , argues that “ the Navy ’s aircraft - carrier battle groups have cruised on mindlessly for more than half a century , waiting for those Japanese carriers to turn up .
They are still cruising today , into , if not beyond , irrelevance .
Submarines are today ’s and tomorrow ’s capital ships ; the ships that most directly determine control of blue waters . ”
In December 2008 , Franklin “ Chuck ” Spinney , a former high - ranking civilian in the Pentagon ’s Office of Systems Analysis ( set up in 1961 to make independent evaluations of Pentagon policy ) and a charter member of the “ Fighter Mafia ” of the 1980s and 1990s , wrote , “ As has been documented for at least 20 years , patterns of repetitive habitual behavior in the Pentagon have created a self - destructive decision - making process .
This process has produced a death spiral . ”
As a result , concluded Spinney , inadequate amounts of wildly overpriced equipment are purchased , “ new weapons [ that ] do not replace old ones on a one for one basis . ”
There is also “ continual pressure to reduce combat readiness , ” a “ corrupt accounting system ” that “ makes it impossible to sort out the priorities , ” and a readiness to believe that old solutions will work for the current crisis .
Failed Reform Efforts
There ’s no great mystery about the causes of the deep dysfunction that has long characterized the Pentagon ’s weapons procurement system .
In 2006 , Thomas Christie , former head of Operational Test and Evaluation , the most senior official at the Department of Defense for testing weapons and a Pentagon veteran of half a century , detailed more than 35 years of efforts to reform the weapons acquisition system .
These included the 1971 Fitzhugh ( or Blue Ribbon ) Commission , the 1977 Steadman Review , the 1981 Carlucci Acquisition Initiatives , the 1986 Packard Commission , the 1986 Goldwater - Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act , the 1989 Defense Management Review , the 1990 “ Streamlining Review ” of the Defense Science Board , the 1993-1994 report of the Acquisition Streamlining Task Force and of the Defense Science Board , the late 1990s Total System Performance Responsibility initiative of the Air Force , and the Capabilities - Based Acquisition approach of the Missile Defense Agency of the first years of this century .
Christie concluded : “ After all these years of repeated reform efforts , major defense programs are taking 20 to 30 years to deliver less capability than planned , very often at two to three times the costs and schedules planned . ”
He also added the following observations :
“ Launching into major developments without understanding key technical issues is the root cause of major cost and schedule problems .
Costs , schedules , and technical risks are often grossly understated at the outset .
There are more acquisition programs being pursued than DoD [ the Department of Defense ] can possibly afford in the long term
“ By the time these problems are acknowledged , the political penalties incurred in enforcing any major restructuring of a program , much less its cancellation , are too painful to bear .
Unless someone is willing to stand up and point out that the emperor has no clothes , the U.S. military will continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars and critical years while acquiring equipment that falls short of meeting the needs of troops in the field . ”
The inevitable day of reckoning , long predicted by Pentagon critics , has , I believe , finally arrived .
Our problems are those of a very rich country which has become accustomed over the years to defense budgets that are actually jobs programs and also a major source of pork for the use of politicians in their reelection campaigns .
Given the present major recession , whose depths remain unknown , the United States has better things to spend its money on than Nimitz - class aircraft carriers at a price of $ 6.2 billion each ( the cost of the USS George H. W. Bush , launched in January 2009 , our 10th such ship ) or aircraft that can cruise at a speed of Mach 2 ( 1,352 miles per hour ) .
However , do n’t wait for the Pentagon to sort out such matters .
If it has proven one thing over the last decades , it ’s that it is thoroughly incapable of reforming itself .
According to Christie , “ Over the past 20 or so years , the DoD and its components have deliberately and systematically decimated their in - house technical capabilities to the point where there is little , if any , competence or initiative left in the various organizations tasked with planning and executing its budget and acquisition programs . ”
Gunning for the Air Force
President Obama has almost certainly retained Robert M. Gates as secretary of defense in part to give himself some bipartisan cover as he tries to come to grips with the bloated defense budget .
Gates is also sympathetic to the desire of a few reformers in the Pentagon to dump the Lockheed - Martin F - 22 “ Raptor ” supersonic stealth fighter , a plane designed to meet the Soviet Union ’s last proposed , but never built , interceptor .
The Air Force ’s old guard and its allies in Congress are already fighting back aggressively .
In June 2008 , Gates fired Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. T. Michael Moseley .
Though he was undoubtedly responding to their fervent support for the F - 22 , his cover explanation was their visible failure to adequately supervise the accounting and control of nuclear weapons .
In 2006 , the Air Force had managed to ship to Taiwan four high - tech nose cone fuses for Minutemen ICBM warheads instead of promised helicopter batteries , an error that went blissfully undetected until March 2008 .
Then , in August 2007 , a B - 52 bomber carrying six armed nuclear cruise missiles flew across much of the country from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
This was in direct violation of standing orders against such flights over the United States .
As Julian Barnes and Peter Spiegel of the Los Angeles Times noted in June 2008 , “ Tensions between the Air Force and Gates have been growing for months , ” mainly over Gates ’ frustration about the F - 22 and his inability to get the Air Force to deploy more pilotless aircraft to the various war zones .
They were certainly not improved when Wynne , a former senior vice president of General Dynamics , went out of his way to cross Gates , arguing publicly that “ any president would be damn happy to have more F - 22s around if we had to get into a fight with China . ”
It catches something of the power of the military - industrial complex that , despite his clear desire on the subject , Gates has not yet found the nerve  or the political backing  to pull the plug on the F - 22 ; nor has he even dared to bring up the subject of canceling its more expensive and technically complicated successor , the F - 35 “ Joint Strike Fighter . ”
More than 20 years ago , Chuck Spinney wrote a classic account of the now - routine bureaucratic scams practiced within the Pentagon to ensure that Congress will appropriate funds for dishonestly advertised and promoted weapons systems and then prevent their cancellation when the fraud comes to light .
In a paper he entitled “ Defense Power Games , ” of which his superiors deeply disapproved , Spinney outlined two crucial Pentagon gambits meant to lock in such weaponry : “ front - loading ” and “ political engineering . ”
It should be understood at the outset that all actors involved , including the military officers in charge of projects , the members of Congress who use defense appropriations to buy votes within their districts , and the contractors who live off the ensuing lucrative contracts , utilize these two scams .
It is also important to understand that neither front - loading nor political engineering is an innocent or morally neutral maneuver .
They both involve criminal intent to turn on the spigot of taxpayer money and then to jam it so that it can not be turned off .
They are de rigueur practices of our military - industrial complex .
Front - loading is the practice of appropriating funds for a new weapons project based solely on assurances by its official sponsors about what it can do .
This happens long before a prototype has been built or tested , and it invariably involves the quoting of unrealistically low unit costs for a sizable order .
Assurances are always given that the system ’s technical requirements will be simple or have already been met .
Low - balling future costs , an intrinsic aspect of front - loading , is an old Defense Department trick , a governmental version of bait - and - switch .
( What is introduced as a great bargain regularly turns out to be a grossly expensive lemon . )
Political engineering is the strategy of awarding contracts in as many different congressional districts as possible .
By making voters and congressional incumbents dependent on military money , the Pentagon ’s political engineers put pressure on them to continue supporting front - loaded programs even after their true costs become apparent .
Front-loading and political engineering generate several typical features in the weapons that the Pentagon then buys for its arsenal .
These continually prove unnecessarily expensive , are prone to break down easily , and are often unworkably complex .
They tend to come with inadequate supplies of spare parts and ammunition , since there is not enough money to buy the numbers that are needed .
They also force the services to repair older weapons and keep them in service much longer than is normal or wise .
( For example , the B - 52 bomber , which went into service in 1955 , is still on active duty . )
Even though extended training would seem to be a necessary corollary of the complexity of such weapons systems , the excessive cost actually leads to reductions in training time for pilots and others .
In the long run , it is because of such expedients and short - term fixes that American casualties may increase and , sooner or later , battles or wars may be lost .
For example , Northrop - Grumman ’s much touted B - 2 stealth bomber has proven to be almost totally worthless .
It is too delicate to deploy to harsh climates without special hangars first being built to protect it at ridiculous expense ; it cannot fulfill any combat missions that older designs were not fully adequate to perform ; and  at a total cost of $ 44.75 billion for only 21 bombers  it wastes resources needed for real combat situations .
Instead , in military terms , the most unexpectedly successful post - Vietnam aircraft has been the Fairchild A - 10 , unflatteringly nicknamed the “ Warthog . ”
It is the only close - support aircraft ever developed by the U.S. Air Force .
Its task is to loiter over battlefields and assist ground forces in disposing of obstinate or formidable targets , which is not something that fits comfortably with the Air Force ’s hotshot self - image .
Some 715 A - 10s were produced , and they served with great effectiveness in the first Persian Gulf War .
All 715 cumulatively cost less than three B - 2 bombers .
The A - 10 is now out of production because the Air Force establishment favors extremely fast aircraft that fly in straight lines at high altitudes rather than aircraft that are useful in battle .
In the Afghan war , the Air Force has regularly inflicted heavy casualties on innocent civilians at least in part because it tries to attack ground targets from the air with inappropriately high - performance equipment .
Using the F - 22 to Fight the F - 16
The military - industrial complex is today so confident of its skills in gaming the system that it does not hesitate to publicize how many workers in a particular district will lose their jobs if a particular project is canceled .
Threats are also made  and put into effect  to withhold political contributions from uncooperative congressional representatives .
As Spinney recalls , “ In July 1989 , when some members of Congress began to build a coalition aimed at canceling the B - 2 , Northrop Corporation , the B - 2 ’s prime contractor , retaliated by releasing data which had previously been classified showing that tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in profits were at risk in 46 states and 383 congressional districts . ”
The B - 2 was not canceled .
Southern California ’s biggest private employers are Boeing Corporation and Northrop - Grumman .
They are said to employ more than 58,000 workers in well - paying jobs , a major political obstacle to rationalizing defense expenditures even as recession is making such steps all but unavoidable .
Both front - loading and political engineering are alive and well in 2009 .
They are , in fact , now at the center of fierce controversies surrounding the extreme age of the present fleet of Air Force fighter aircraft , most of which date from the 1980s .
Meanwhile the costs of the two most likely successors to the workhorse F - 16  the F - 22 Raptor and the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter  have run up so high that the government cannot afford to purchase significant numbers of either or them .
The F - 16 made its first flight in December 1976 , and a total of 4,400 have been built .
They have been sold , or given away , all over the world .
Planning for the F - 22 began in 1986 , when the Cold War was still alive ( even if on life support ) , and the Air Force was trumpeting its fears that the other superpower , the USSR , was planning a new , ultra - fast , highly maneuverable fighter .
By the time the prototype F - 22 had its roll - out on May 11 , 1997 , the Cold War was nearly a decade in its grave , and it was perfectly apparent that the Soviet aircraft it was intended to match would never be built .
Lockheed Martin , the F - 22 ’s prime contractor , naturally argued that we needed it anyway and made plans to sell some 438 airplanes for a total tab of $ 70 billion .
By mid-2008 , only 183 F - 22s were on order , 122 of which had been delivered .
The numbers had been reduced due to cost overruns .
The Air Force still wants to buy an additional 198 planes , but Secretary Gates and his leading assistants have balked .
No wonder .
According to arms experts Bill Hartung and Christopher Preble , at more than $ 350 million each , the F - 22 is “ the most expensive fighter plane ever built . ”
The F - 22 has several strikingly expensive characteristics which actually limit its usefulness .
It is allegedly a stealth fighter  that is , an airplane with a shape that reduces its visibility on radar  but there is no such thing as an airplane completely invisible to all radar .
In any case , once it turns on its own fire - control radar , which it must do in combat , it becomes fully visible to an enemy .
The F - 22 is able to maneuver at very high altitudes , but this is of limited value since there are no other airplanes in service anywhere that can engage in combat at such heights .
It can cruise at twice the speed of sound in level flight without the use of its afterburners ( which consume fuel at an accelerated rate ) , but there are no potential adversaries for which these capabilities are relevant .
The plane is obviously blindingly irrelevant to “ fourth - generation wars ” like that with the Taliban in Afghanistan  the sorts of conflicts for which American strategists inside the Pentagon and out believe the United States should be preparing .
Actually , the U.S. ought not to be engaged in fourth - generation wars at all , whatever planes are in its fleet .
Outside powers normally find such wars unwinnable , as the history of Afghanistan , that “ graveyard of empires ” going back to Alexander the Great , illustrates so well .
Unfortunately , President Obama ’s approach to the Bush administration ’s Afghan War remains deeply flawed and will only entrap us in another quagmire , whatever planes we put in the skies over that country .
Nonetheless , the F - 22 is still being promoted as the plane to buy almost entirely through front - loading and political engineering .
Some apologists for the Air Force also claim that we need the F - 22 to face the F - 16 .
Their argument goes this way :
We have sold so many F - 16s to allies and Third World customers that , if we ever had to fight one of them , that country might prevail using our own equipment against us .
Some foreign air forces like Israel ’s are fully equipped with F - 16s and their pilots actually receive more training and monthly practice hours than ours do .
This , however , seems a trivial reason for funding more F - 22s .
We should instead simply not get involved in wars with former allies we have armed , although this is why Congress prohibited Lockheed from selling the F - 22 abroad .
Some Pentagon critics contend that the Air Force and prime contractors lobby for arms sales abroad because they artificially generate a demand for new weapons at home that are “ better ” than the ones we ’ve sold elsewhere .
Thanks to political engineering , the F - 22 has parts suppliers in 44 states , and some 25,000 people have well - paying jobs building it .
Lockheed Martin and some in the Defense Department have therefore proposed that , if the F - 22 is canceled , it should be replaced by the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , also built by Lockheed Martin .
Most serious observers believe that this would only make a bad situation worse .
So far the F - 35 shows every sign of being , in Chuck Spinney ’s words , “ a far more costly and more troubled turkey ” than the F - 22 , “ even though it has a distinction that even the F - 22 cannot claim , namely it is tailored to meet the same threat that ceased to exist at least three years before the F - 35 R&D [ research and development ] program began in 1994 . ”
The F - 35 is considerably more complex than the F - 22 , meaning that it will undoubtedly be even more expensive to repair and will break down even more easily .
Its cost per plane is guaranteed to continue to spiral upward .
The design of the F - 22 involves 4 million lines of computer code ; the F - 35 , 19 million lines .
The Pentagon sold the F - 35 to Congress in 1998 with the promise of a unit cost of $ 184 million per aircraft .
By 2008 , that had risen to $ 355 million per aircraft and the plane was already two years behind schedule .
According to Pierre M. Sprey , one of the original sponsors of the F - 16 , and Winslow T . Wheeler , a 31 - year veteran staff official on Senate defense committees , the F - 35 is overweight , underpowered , and “ less maneuverable than the appallingly vulnerable F - 105 ‘ lead sled ’ that got wiped out over North Vietnam in the Indochina War . ”
Its makers claim that it will be a bomber as well as a fighter , but it will have a payload of only two 2,000 - pound bombs , far less than American fighters of the Vietnam era .
Although the Air Force praises its stealth features , it will lose these as soon as it mounts bombs under its wings , which will alter its shape most un -stealthily .
It is a non-starter for close - air - support missions because it is too fast for a pilot to be able to spot tactical targets .
It is too delicate and potentially flammable to be able to withstand ground fire .
If built , it will end up as the most expensive defense contract in history without offering a serious replacement for any of the fighters or fighter - bombers currently in service .
The Fighter Mafia
Every branch of the American armed forces suffers from similar “ defense power games . ”
For example , the new Virginia - class fast - attack submarines are expensive and not needed .
As the New York Times wrote editorially , “ The program is little more than a public works project to keep the Newport News , Va. , and Groton , Conn. , naval shipyards in business . ”
I have , however , concentrated on the Air Force because the collapse of internal controls over acquisitions is most obvious , as well as farthest advanced , there  and because the Air Force has a history of conflict over going along with politically easy decisions that was recently hailed by Secretary of Defense Gates as deserving of emulation by the other services .
The pointed attack Gates launched on bureaucratism was , paradoxically , one of the few optimistic developments in Pentagon politics in recent times .
On April 21 , 2008 , the secretary of defense caused a storm of controversy by giving a speech to the officers of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base , Alabama .
In it , he singled out for praise and emulation an Air Force officer who had inspired many of that service ’s innovators over the past couple of generations , while being truly despised by an establishment and an old guard who viewed him as an open threat to careerism .
Col. John Boyd ( 1927-1997 ) was a significant military strategist , an exceptionally talented fighter pilot in both the Korean and Vietnamese war eras , and for six years the chief instructor at the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas .
“ Forty - Second Boyd ” became a legend in the Air Force because of his standing claim that he could defeat any pilot , foreign or domestic , in simulated air - to - air combat within 40 seconds , a bet he never lost even though he was continuously challenged .
Last April , Gates said , in part :
“ As this new era continues to unfold before us , the challenge I pose to you today is to become a forward - thinking officer who helps the Air Force adapt to a constantly changing strategic environment characterized by persistent conflict .
“ Let me illustrate by using a historical exemplar : the late Air Force Colonel John Boyd .
As a 30 - year - old captain , he rewrote the manual for air - to - air combat .
Boyd and the reformers he inspired would later go on to design and advocate for the F - 16 and the A - 10 .
After retiring , he would develop the principals of maneuver warfare that were credited by a former Marine Corps commandant [ General Charles C. Krulak ] and a secretary of defense [ Dick Cheney ] for the lightning victory of the first Gulf War .
“ In accomplishing all these things , Boyd  a brilliant , eccentric , and stubborn character  had to overcome a large measure of bureaucratic resistance and institutional hostility .
He had some advice that he used to pass on to his colleagues and subordinates that is worth sharing with you .
Boyd would say , and I quote : ‘ One day you will take a fork in the road , and you ’re going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go .
If you go one way , you can be somebody .
You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends .
But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and get good assignments .
Or you can go the other way and you can do something  something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself .
If you decide to do something , you may not get promoted and get good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors .
But you wo n’t have to compromise yourself .
To be somebody or to do something .
In life there is often a roll call .
That ’s when you have to make a decision .
To be or to do . ’
We must heed John Boyd ’s advice by asking if the ways we do business make sense . ”
Boyd ’s many accomplishments are documented in Robert Coram ’s excellent biography , Boyd : The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War .
They need not be retold here .
It was , however , the spirit of Boyd and “ the reformers he inspired , ” a group within Air Force headquarters who came to be called the “ Fighter Mafia , ” that launched the defense reform movement of the 1980s and 1990s .
Their objectives were to stop the acquisition of unnecessarily complex and expensive weapons , cause the Air Force to take seriously the idea of a fourth generation of warfare , end its reliance on a strategy of attrition , and expose to criticism an officer ’s corps focused on careerist standards .
Unless Secretary Gates succeeds in reviving it , their lingering influence in the Pentagon is just about exhausted today .
We await the leadership of the Obama administration to see which way the Air Force and the rest of the American defense establishment evolves .
Despite Gates ’ praise of Boyd , one should not underestimate the formidable obstacles to Pentagon reform .
Over a quarter - century ago , back in 1982 , journalist James Fallows outlined the most serious structural obstacle to any genuine reform in his National Book Award - winning study , National Defense .
The book was so influential that at least one commentator includes Fallows as a non-Pentagon member of Boyd ’s “ Fighter Mafia . ”
As Fallows then observed ( pp. 64-65 ) :
“ The culture of procurement teaches officers that there are two paths to personal survival .
One is to bring home the bacon for the service as the manager of a program that gets its full funding .
‘ Procurement management is more and more the surest path to advancement ’ within the military , says John Morse , who retired as a Navy captain after 28 years in the service .
“ The other path that procurement opens leads outside the military , toward the contracting firms .
To know even a handful of professional soldiers above the age of 40 and the rank of major is to keep hearing , in the usual catalogue of life changes , that many have resigned from the service and gone to the contractors : to Martin Marietta , Northrop , Lockheed , to the scores of consulting firms and middlemen , whose offices fill the skyscrapers of Rosslyn , Virginia , across the river from the capital .
In 1959 , Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois reported that 768 retired senior officers ( generals , admirals , colonels , and Navy captains ) worked for defense contractors .
Ten years later Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin said that the number had increased to 2,072 . ”
Almost 30 years after those words were written , the situation has grown far worse .
Until we decide ( or are forced ) to dismantle our empire , sell off most of our 761 military bases ( according to official statistics for fiscal year 2008 ) in other people ’s countries , and bring our military expenditures into line with those of the rest of the world , we are destined to go bankrupt in the name of national defense .
As of this moment , we are well on our way , which is why the Obama administration will face such critical  and difficult  decisions when it comes to the Pentagon budget .

More a ramshackle collection of setpieces and ideas than a fully formed movie , Big Man Japan is alternatively funny , touching , and baffling .
Though not an unqualified success , it 's hard to hate something so gleefully bizarre .
Advertisement
Made in 2007 , Big Man Japan screened yesterday at Comic Con.
Ostensibly a TV documentary , the film follows a few weeks in the life of the title character , the sixth in a long line of Japanese superheroes who defend their country from monsters by zapping themselves with electricity and becoming a hundred feet tall .
His predecessors were national heroes , but the current Big Man ( played by writer / director Hitoshi Matsumoto ) is generally either ignored or reviled by the public .
His TV show , long ago a staple of primetime , is now on at 2:40 in the morning , and even the weather gets better ratings , forcing him to tattoo advertisements on his body .
A loser , albeit a loveable one , he spends most of his time drinking , looking after both his senile grandfather and a stray cat , and making fleeting attempts to reconnect with his estranged wife and eight - year - old daughter .
At times , the movie almost feels like The Wrestler with Japanese superheroes , and there 's some genuine pathos in the character 's fumbling efforts to do the right thing , even when he clearly has no natural aptitude for the job .
As much as he might fundamentally be a good guy , he still manages to accidentally kill both a child and an old man while in his giant form .
The film brilliantly acknowledges the kind of public uproar this would cause , as the initially silly CGI deaths turn into the focus of mass outrage .

Big Man Japan makes good use of the mockumentary format .
The unseen interviewer very much becomes a character in his own right , forcing characters to redo scenes so he can get better shots and goading the Big Man into fighting a clearly superior foe .
Only the monster fight scenes drop this approach , and even they become increasingly ridiculous .
The CGI is intentionally bad , providing a 21st century echo to the fifties monster movies it emulates .
As much as all of these ideas are intriguing ( and I have n't even mentioned the giant fart monster sex or all the stuff with the nipples ) , they never quite add up to a cohesive whole .
The movie tackles about twenty different themes , including family traditions , the role of the camera , the fickle public , and the perils of corporatism .
A lot is said about all of them , but none of them are ever quite developed completely .
The stark shifts in tone between the documentary and monster movie segments prove a little too jarring , as each served to hurt the suspension of disbelief I had built up for the other .
The movie 's ending is unspeakably absurd , and it's hard to see how exactly it fits in with anything else the movie is trying to say .
It might make more sense if I knew more about the complexities of Japanese pop culture , but I found the ending deeply unsatisfying .
Ultimately , however , both the movie 's successes ( which are many ) and failures ( which are few ) come from the same place : Hitoshi Matsumoto 's dizzying willingness to take risks .
This is not a film that is ever guilty of underreaching , and it is easy to forgive the misfires of a film so ludicrously ambitious .
Big Man Japan is not perfect , but it's hard to imagine a film more delightful in its weirdness .
“ At the moment there is a readiness to believe the worst , ” said Simon Williams , HSBC bank ’s chief economist in Dubai .
“ And the limits on data make it difficult to counter the rumors . ”
Some things are clear : real estate prices , which rose dramatically during Dubai ’s six - year boom , have dropped 30 percent or more over the past two or three months in some parts of the city .
Last week , Moody ’s Investor ’s Service announced that it might downgrade its ratings on six of Dubai ’s most prominent state - owned companies , citing a deterioration in the economic outlook .
So many used luxury cars are for sale , they are sometimes sold for 40 percent less than the asking price two months ago , car dealers say .
Dubai ’s roads , usually thick with traffic at this time of year , are now mostly clear .
Some analysts say the crisis is likely to have long - lasting effects on the seven - member emirates federation , where Dubai has long played rebellious younger brother to oil - rich and more conservative Abu Dhabi .
Dubai officials , swallowing their pride , have made clear that they would be open to a bailout , but so far Abu Dhabi has offered assistance only to its own banks .

“ Why is Abu Dhabi allowing its neighbor to have its international reputation trashed , when it could bail out Dubai ’s banks and restore confidence ? ” said Christopher M. Davidson , who predicted the current crisis in “ Dubai : The Vulnerability of Success , ” a book published last year .
“ Perhaps the plan is to centralize the U.A.E. ” under Abu Dhabi ’s control , he mused , in a move that would sharply curtail Dubai ’s independence and perhaps change its signature freewheeling style .
For many foreigners , Dubai had seemed at first to be a refuge , relatively insulated from the panic that began hitting the rest of the world last autumn .
The Persian Gulf is cushioned by vast oil and gas wealth , and some who lost jobs in New York and London began applying here .
But Dubai , unlike Abu Dhabi or nearby Qatar and Saudi Arabia , does not have its own oil , and had built its reputation on real estate , finance and tourism .
Now , many expatriates here talk about Dubai as though it were a con game all along .
Lurid rumors spread quickly : the Palm Jumeira , an artificial island that is one of this city ’s trademark developments , is said to be sinking , and when you turn the faucets in the hotels built atop it , only cockroaches come out .
Three police officers have been suspended over racist and sexist comments on their Facebook pages , according to an official in a suburban New York town .
The Harrison town attorney said the Board of Commissioners announced Thursday that Police Chief David Hall had suspended the officers with pay while officials investigate .
Town attorney Bob Palladino said the police chief had placed the three on modified duty earlier Thursday .
One detective reportedly made watermelon and fried chicken jokes about President Barack Obama on the social networking site .
The detective and others reportedly ridiculed the Mayor Joan Walsh with sexual comments .
Calls to Walsh were referred to Palladino .
Walsh told The Journal News , “ I am appalled with their juvenile behavior . ”
A long - awaited plan in the state Legislature to solve a record budget deficit was thwarted for a second night Sunday as legislative leaders and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger anxiously searched to find one more Republican senator to support the budget vote .
Schwarzenegger and the Legislature struggled for more than three months to find a compromise to close the $ 40 billion deficit .
After finally reaching a breakthrough in talks last week , they entered the weekend confident that the Legislature would approve the budget bills that the governor was supposed to sign by today .
But their confidence - and prospects for a budget - unraveled Saturday when it was apparent that Senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill could deliver just one - his own - of three GOP votes needed in the upper house to clear the two - thirds majority required for passage .
Sen . Roy Ashburn , R - Bakersfield , abstained , but is expected to be a second Republican vote in support of the package .
Without a spending plan , California may rapidly reach what Schwarzenegger calls " financial Armageddon " - the state runs out of cash this month , infrastructure projects come to a halt , and the state 's credit rating takes a further pounding .
On Sunday night , after marathon sessions that lasted more than 24 hours , both houses of the Legislature adjourned and said they would return Monday morning to continue pursuing the vote .
Leading up to this weekend 's votes , Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders were careful not to say that there had been a budget compromise because they wanted to prevent lobbyists from pressuring lawmakers prior to any vote .
But by Sunday , as exasperation grew , some lawmakers admitted a spending plan was in place and that votes had been secured - or so they thought .
Beyond frustration
" I was frustrated last night , " Assembly Speaker Karen Bass , D - Baldwin Vista ( Los Angeles County ) , said Sunday .
" I 'm past that point today .
" There is no reason for this budget not to be done except for the fact that a couple of individuals have elevated their individual political careers above the state of California , " she said .
" They are willing to let the state of California go off a cliff because they are concerned about their next primary . "
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , agreed .
" I do n't understand why in the eyes of some who are holding this up , how they do n't see the precarious plight California faces without this budget , " he said .
Senate Republicans even drew criticism from their GOP counterparts in the Assembly .
Assemblyman Anthony Adams , R- Hesperia ( San Bernardino County ) , said he was angry at his GOP colleagues in the Senate , calling them " recalcitrant . "
Adams said he plans to be one of three Republican votes in the Assembly to approve the budget that includes nearly $ 16 billion in cuts , $ 11 billion in borrowing from Wall Street , and more than $ 14 billion in tax increases , which will likely be politically hazardous for any GOP lawmaker .
Teamwork needed
" I believe the incredible amount of spending cuts and reform package that 's in this plan justifies raising temporary taxes , " he said .
" But if we do , we have to do this as a team . "
If the plan passes , Californians will pay more in vehicle license fees , a 1 - cent - on - the- dollar sales tax increase and a tax increase of 12 cents per gallon at the fuel pump .
Cogdill avoided questions from reporters both Saturday and Sunday .
But his spokeswoman , Sabrina Lockhart , said her boss never guaranteed votes .
" His mission was to negotiate the best package possible and present it to his caucus and he did exactly that , " she said .
Fissures in the Senate Republican caucus between moderate members and the more conservative camp that Cogdill is a part of seemed to deepen over the weekend .
" Clearly , Assembly Republicans are in a different sort of caucus than Senate Republicans , " Sen .
Ashburn said .
" I 've always said I want to keep an open mind . "
Cogdill 's leadership
If Cogdill 's leadership appeared compromised , he challenged his own party to find better .
After enduring criticism in a caucus meeting Sunday , the Modesto lawmaker offered to step down as leader if someone else would prefer to take his place .
No one volunteered , a legislative source said .
But the larger , lingering question at the state Capitol is whether legislative leaders or Schwarzenegger can find a third Republican senator to approve the budget package .
Aaron McLear , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger , said the governor remains " resolute " in working with legislative leaders to cajole another member to approve the budget .
One target is Sen. Abel Maldonado , R - Santa Maria ( Santa Barbara County ) , another moderate Republican .
Maldonado told reporters Sunday that he hesitates to vote for new taxes .
But he implied he may be open to changing his vote to " yes . "
" I 'm still working with the governor 's office to see what we can come up with , " he said .
" We 're still negotiating .
We 've got to keep working and see what we come up with . "

While observing a known asteroid on January 31 , 2009 , astronomer Robert Holmes from the Astronomical Research Institute near Charleston , Illinois found another high speed object moving nearby through the same field of view .
The object has now been confirmed to be a previously undiscovered Potentially Hazardous Asteroid ( PHA ) , with several possible Earth impact risks after 2042 .
This relatively small near - Earth asteroid , named 2009 BD81 , will make its closest approach to Earth in 2009 on February 27 , passing a comfortable 7 million kilometers away .
In 2042 , current projections have it passing within 5.5 Earth radii , ( approximately 31,800 km or 19,800 miles ) with an even closer approach in 2044 2046 .
Data from the NASA / JPL Risk web page show 2009 BD81 to be fairly small , with a diameter of 0.314 km ( about 1000 ft . )
Holmes , one of the world ’s most prolific near Earth object ( NEO ) observers , said currently , the chance of this asteroid hitting Earth in 33 years or so is quite small ; the odds are about 1 in 2 million , but follow - up observations are needed to provide precise calculations of the asteroid ’s potential future orbital path .
Holmes operates his one - man observatory at ARI , as part of NASA ’s Near Earth Observation program and the Killer Asteroid Project .
He also produces images for educational and public outreach programs like the International Astronomical Search Collaboration ( IASC ) , which is operated by Patrick Miller at Hardin - Simmons University in Texas , which gives students and teachers the opportunity to make observations and discoveries .
In just the past couple of years , Holmes has found 250 asteroids , 6 supernovae , and one comet ( C/2008 N1 ( Holmes ) .
However , he said he would trade all of them for this single important NEO discovery .
“ I was doing a follow up observation of asteroid 2008 EV5 , ” Holmes told Universe Today , “ and there was another object moving right next to it , so it was a pretty easy observation , actually .
But you just have to be in the right place at the right time .
If I had looked a few hours later , it would have moved away and I would n’t have seen it . ”
A few hours later , teacher S. Kirby , from Ranger High School in Texas , who was taking part in a training class on how to use the data that Holmes collects for making observations used Holmes ’ data measuring 2008 EV5 and also found the new object .
Shortly after that , a student K. Dankov from the Bulgarian Academy of Science , Bulgaria who is part of ARO education and public outreach also noticed the new asteroid .
Holmes listed both observers as co-discovers as well as another astronomer who made confirmation follow - up observations of what is now 2009 BD81 .
Holmes is a tireless observer .
Last year alone he made 10,252 follow - up observations on previously discovered NEO ’s , more than 2000 more than the second ranked observatory , according to the NEO Dynamics website , based in Pisa , Italy .
Holmes has two telescopes , a 24 - inch and 32 - inch .
He works night - after - night to provide real - time images for the IASC program , uploading his images constantly during the night to an FTP site , so students and teachers can access the data and make their own analysis and observations from them .
IASC is a network of observatories from 13 countries all around the world .
Holmes is proud of the work he does for education , and proud of the students and teachers who participate .
“ They do a great job , ” he said .
“ A lot of the teachers are doing this entirely on their own , taking it upon themselves to create a hands - on research class in their schools . ”
Holmes said recently , two students that have been involved with IASC in high school decided to enter the astrophysics program in college .
“ I feel like we are making a difference in science and education , ” he said , “ and it is exciting to feel like you ’re making a contribution , not just following up NEO ’s but in people ’s lives . ”
Holmes also owns some of the faintest observations of anyone in the world .
“ My telescopes wo n’t go to 24th magnitude , ” Holmes said , “ but I ’ve got several 23rd magnitudes . ”
“ Getting faint observations is one of the things NASA wants to achieve , so that ’s one of the things I worked diligently on , ” Holmes continued .
The statistics on the site bear that out clearly , which shows graphs and comparisons of various observatories .
To what does Holmes attribute his success ?
“ It ’s obviously not the huge number nights we have in Illinois to work , ” Holmes said .
The East - Central region of Illinois is known for its cloudy winter weather , when we often have our poorest astronomical “ seeing . ”
“ However , I work every single night if it ’s clear , even if it ’s a full moon , ” he said .
“ Most observatories typically shut down three days on either side of a full moon .
But I keep working right on through .
I found that with the telescopes I work with , I ’ve been able to get to the 22nd magnitude even on a full moon night .
Last year , I got about 187 nights of observing , which is the same number as the big observatories in the Southwest , when you take off the number of cloudy nights the 6 nights a month they do n’t ’ work around full moons .
Sometimes you just have to work harder , and work when others are n’t to be able to catch up .
That ’s how we are able to do it , by working every single chance we have . ”
He works alone at the observatory , running the pair of telescopes , and doing programming on the fly .
“ I refresh the confirmation page of new discoveries every hour so I can chase down any new discovery anyone has found , ” he said .
“ If I just pre-programmed everything I would n’t have a fraction of the observations I have each year .
I ’d miss way too many because some of the objects are moving so fast . ”
Holmes said some objects are moving 5,000 arc - seconds an hour on objects that are really close to Earth .
“ I ’ve seen them go a full hour of right ascension per day and that ’s pretty quick .
They can go across the sky in four or five days , ” said Holmes .
“ And there have been some that have gone from virtually 50 degrees north to 50 degrees south in one night .
That ’s was a screaming fast object , and you ca n’t preprogram for something like that , you actually have to be running the telescope manually . ”
2009 BD81 is listed as a “ risk ” object on the NASA / JPL website .
This is the 1,015th PHA discovered to date .
“ It ranks high as a NEO in general , ” said Holmes , “ although not in a super - high category as far as the Torino scale , ” which categorizes the impact hazard of NEOs .
“ At this point it ’s considered a virtual impactor and that is typically is as high of a rating that you get at this point . ”
“ Because it is a virtual impactor , it will remain on that webpage and ask for observations every single night until it is removed as a virtual impactor or becomes too faint to see , ” said Holmes .
“ In the past year , we ’ve removed 23 virtual hazardous objects , which means there have been enough observations that the orbit of that object is no longer considered a threat to our planet . ”
Because of the small number of observations of of 2009 BD81 , the current chance of it hitting Earth is small .
“ The odds are really small right now , ” said Holmes , “ however , the smaller your orbital arc is the wider the path is at that point is of potential impact .
The longer the arc gets , the narrower the cone of opportunity of impact becomes , and once that cone is no longer pointing at earth in the future , it is removed as a possible impactor . ”
Holmes said the excitement of this discovery has been exhilarating .
“ It ’s been a lot of fun .
The energy level gets pretty high when you have something like this show up , ” he said .
“ It ’s pretty rare , and this is the first time I ’ve ever had a NEO discovery .
I ’ve had several hundred asteroids , and just since the beginning of the school year we have had about 40 asteroids that students and teachers have discovered in the program .
So having this as a NEO is kind of a nice thing . ”
Holmes said he ’ll track 2009 BD81 as long as he possibly can .
More information on 2009 BD81 .
Holmes previously was a commercial photographer who had over 4,500 photographs published worldwide in over 50 countries .
“ At first astronomy was just a hobby in the evening , ” said Holmes .
“ I worked with schools , who used the data and made some discoveries of supernovae and asteroids .
It came to a point where it was really hard to work all day as a photographer and work all night in astronomy getting data for students . ”
So , he chose astronomy over photography .
Holmes now works under a grant from NASA to use astrometry to follow - up new asteroid discoveries for the large sky surveys and help students look for new asteroid discoveries for educational outreach programs .
One would assume that as a former commercial photographer , Holmes would attempt to capture the beauty of the night sky in photographs , but that ’s not the case .
“ The only thing I ’m really interesting in is the scientific and educational aspect of astronomy , ” said Holmes .
“ I ’ve never taken a single color , pretty picture of the sky in the half a million images I ’ve taken of the sky .
It ’s always been for research or education . ”
Holmes is considered a professional astronomer by the Minor Planet Center and International Astronomical Union because he is funded by NASA , so that means he was n’t eligible to receive the Edgar Wilson award when he found a comet last year .
Because of Holmes outstanding astronomical work , he is also an adjunct faculty member in the physics department at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston , Illinois .
Next time you have a rough day at the office , Burger King hopes you ’ll cozy up to one of its new Whopper Bars set to open around America .
Just do n’t stay for too many rounds , or you might regret it the next day .
The Whopper Bar : All Beef
To be clear , the Whopper Bar wo n’t actually be serving alcohol — but it will be serving plenty of beef .
The Burger King venture will offer Whoppers , Double Whoppers , and Steakhouse XT burgers , along with new Bourbon Whoppers , Three - Cheese Steakhouse XT burgers , and Pepper Bacon Steakhouse XT burgers .
Each will come with options for 22 different toppings .
Among the choices : guacamole , smoked bacon , or steak sauce .
A “ Contemporary ” Edge
The first Whopper Bar opens today at the Universal CityWalk in Orlando .
Its look is totally different from the typical BK , as seen in the photo above :
The bar boasts an open kitchen , a bar - like countertop , and a whole new color scheme .
Employees will also wear different uniforms , matching the red , black , and gray restaurant design .
Burger King hopes the updated take will give its brand a new “ contemporary ” edge , representatives say .
Whopper Bar Plans
Burger King is planning six more Whopper Bars around the globe by the end of 2009 , with the next set to open in Munich over the summer .
Los Angeles , New York and Singapore will soon see locations as well .
Eventually , the company says it could open as many as 500 of the units around the world in everywhere from stadiums to casinos and cruise ships .
Husband Battering
The first reaction upon hearing about the topic of battered men , for many people , is that of incredulity .
Battered husbands are a topic for jokes ( such as the cartoon image of a woman chasing her husband with a rolling - pin ) .
One researcher noted that wives were the perpetrators in 73 % of the depictions of domestic violence in newspaper comics ( Saenger 1963 ) .
Battered husbands have historically been either ignored or subjected to ridicule and abuse .
In 18th - century France , a battered husband " was made to wear an outlandish outfit and ride backwards around the village on a donkey " ( Steinmetz & Lucca 1988 ) .
Even those of us who like to consider ourselves liberated and open - minded often have a difficult time even imagining that husband battering could take place .
Although feminism has opened many of our eyes about the existence of domestic violence , and newspaper reports often include incidents of abuse of wives , the abuse of husbands is a rarely discussed phenomenon .
One reason researchers and others had not chosen to investigate husband battering is because it was thought to be a fairly rare occurrence .
Police reports seemed to bear this out ( Steinmetz 1977 ) , with in some cases a ratio of 12 to 14.5 female victims to every one male victim .
But another reason is that because women were seen as weaker and more helpless than men due to sex roles , and men on the other hand were seen as more sturdy and self - reliant , the study of abused husbands seemed relatively unimportant .
In 1974 , a study was done which compared male and female domestic violence .
In that study , it was found that 47 % of husbands had used physical violence on their wives , and 33 % of wives had used violence on their husbands ( Gelles 1974 ) .
Half of the respondents in this study were selected from either cases of domestic violence reported to the police , or those identified by the social service agency .
Also in 1974 , a study was released showing that the number of murders of women by men ( 17.5 % of total homicides ) was about the same as the number of murders of men by women ( 16.4 % of total homicides ) .
This study ( Curtis 1974 ) , however , showed that men were three times as likely to assault women as vice - versa .
These statistics came from police records .
[ The murder statistic was no big news , by the way .
In 1958 , an investigation of spousal homicide between 1948 and 1952 found that 7.8 % of murder victims were husbands murdered by wives , and 8 % were wives murdered by husbands ( Wolfgang 1958 ) .
More recently , in a study of spousal homicide in the period from 1976 to 1985 , it was found that there was an overall ratio of 1.3:1.0 of murdered wives to murdered husbands , and that " Black husbands were at greater risk of spouse homicide victimization than Black wives or White spouses of either sex " ( Mercy & Saltzman 1989 ) ]
The subject of husband - battering had finally been addressed , but not to the great satisfaction of anyone .
Although it had finally been shown that there was violence being perpetrated both by wives and husbands , there was no information about relative frequency or severity , or who initiated the abuse and who was acting in self defense .
Furthermore , some researchers became concerned that the use of police or social services references in choosing subjects to study might be biasing the results .
In short , they recognized that battered husbands might be nearly invisible next to their female counterparts .
In 1976 , for instance , in a critique of the Curtis report ( which found women less likely to assault , but as likely to murder , as men ) , Wilt & Bannon wrote that " nonfatal violence committed by women against men is less likely to be reported to the police than is violence by men against women ; thus , women assaulters who come to the attention of the police are likely to be those who have produced a fatal result . "
In 1977 , Suzanne Steinmetz released results from several studies showing that the percentage of wives who have used physical violence is higher than the percentage of husbands , and that the wives ' average violence score tended to be higher , although men were somewhat more likely to cause greater injury .
She also found that women were as likely as men to initiate physical violence , and that they had similar motives for their violent acts ( Steinmetz 1977 - 78 ) .
Steinmetz concluded that " the most unreported crime is not wife beating -- it's husband beating " ( Langley & Levy 1977 ) .
In 1979 , a telephone survey was conducted in which subjects were asked about their experiences of domestic violence ( Nisonoff & Bitman 1979 ) .
15.5 % of the men and 11.3 % of the women reported having hit their spouse ; 18.6 % of the men and 12.7 % of the women reported having been hit by their spouse .
In 1980 , a team of researchers , including Steinmetz , attempted to address some concerns about the earlier surveys ( Straus , Gelles & Steinmetz , 1980 ) .
They created a nationally representative study of family violence and found that the total violence scores seemed to be about even between husbands and wives , and that wives tended to be more abusive in almost all categories except pushing and shoving .
Straus & Gelles did a followup survey in 1985 , comparing their data to a 1975 survey ( Straus & Gelles 1986 ) .
They found that in that decade , domestic violence against women dropped from 12.1 % of women to 11.3 % while domestic violence against men rose from 11.6 % to 12.1 % .
The rate of severely violent incidents dropped for both groups : From 3.8 % to 3.0 % of women victimized and from 4.6 % to 4.4 % for men .
In 1986 , a report appeared in Social Work , the journal of the National Association of Social Workers ( Nov./Dec. 1986 ) on violence in adolescent dating relationships , in which it was found that girls were violent more frequently than boys .
Another report on premarital violence ( O'Leary , et al ) found that 34 % of the males and 40 % of the females reported engaging in some form of physical aggression against their mates in a year .
17 % of women and 7 % of men reported engaging in severe physical aggression .
35 % of the men and 30 % of the women reported having been abused .
Also in 1986 , Marriage and Divorce Today , a newsletter for family therapy practitioners , reported on a study done by Pillemer and Finkelhor of the Family Violence Research Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire .
The study , based on interviews of over 2000 elderly persons in the Boston metropolitan area , found that 3.2 % of the elderly had been abused .
52 % of the abuse victims were men .
The idea of women being violent is a hard thing for many people to believe .
It goes against the stereotype of the passive and helpless female .
This , in spite of the fact that women are known to be more likely than men to commit child abuse and child murder ( Daly & Wilson 1988 report 54 % of parent - child murders where the child is under 17 were committed by the mother in Canada between 1974 and 1983 , for instance .
The Statistical Abstract of the United States 1987 reports that of reported child maltreatment cases between 1980 and 1984 between 57.0 % and 61.4 % of these were perpetrated by the mother .
Nagi 1977 found 53.1 % of perpetrators were female , 21 % male and 22.6 % both .
Note that because mothers tend to have more access to children than do fathers that these results should not be interpreted to mean that were things equal , women would still commit more abuse ) .
In addition , a study in a doctoral dissertation by psychologist Vallerie Coleman of 90 lesbian couples , showed that 46 % had experienced repeated violent incidents ( Garcia , 1991 ) .
Results like these are greeted with great suspicion by those who see domestic violence as a political issue to be exploited rather than a social problem to be solved .
Coramae Mann , a criminologist at Indiana University , studied the case records of all murders committed by women between 1979 and 1983 in six major U.S. cities .
Her findings contradicted commonly - held ideas about women who murder , and she was criticized by some people for this .
" They would raise the question , ' Well you have these poor battered women . '
I said these were n't poor battered women .
Many already had violent criminal records .
They were n't weak or dependent .
They were angry . "
Straus & Gelles commented in their 1986 report that " violence by wives has not been an object of public concern ...
In fact , our 1975 study was criticized for presenting statistics on violence by wives . "
So domestic violence is an issue framed in the media and in the political arena as one of male perpetrators and female victims .
Violence in gay and lesbian relationships is rarely discussed , and violence against men in heterosexual relationships less so .
When it is addressed , there is a response .
When I became the caretaker of a memorial fund for a male victim of domestic violence , I unexpectedly took on the role of counselor for men calling from all over the country to talk to me at length about their or their father 's victimization .
When the subject of battered husbands was raised on British television and the London Times did an article on the subject , hundreds of calls came in from male victims to a special helpline set up by a Women 's Aid group ( Rooke 1991 ) .
The terms " wife beating " and " battered women " have become political expressions , rather than descriptions of reality .
And because the issue of domestic violence has been substantially taken out of the arena of serious sociological study , and thrust into the political arena , the definitions of spousal abuse , and the proposed remedies to spousal abuse , will be political ones -- not necessarily ones which reflect the reality of the existing problems .
In a book on domestic violence , Roger Langley and Richard C. Levy conclude a chapter on battered husbands by saying , " Husband abuse should not be viewed as merely the opposite side of the coin to wife abuse .
Both are part of the same problem , which should be described as one _person_ abusing another _person_ .
The problem must be faced and dealt with not in terms of sex but in terms of humanity " ( Langley & Levy 1977 , p. 208 ) .
Ironically the book in which this quote appears is entitled " Wife Beating : The Silent Crisis . "
Legislation about domestic violence is always oriented toward the female victim .
For instance , in 1991 , Senator Joseph Biden again introduced the " Violence Against Women Act " which at this writing has passed the senate Judiciary Committee .
It has a section called " Safe homes for Women " which specifically allocates funds to " women's " shelters ( Biden 1991 , also see Boxer 1990 ) .
Also note actions like that of Ohio governor Richard F. Celeste who granted clemency to 25 women who were in prison for murdering their husbands .
The reason he gave for this was the " Battered Woman Syndrome " which , obviously , no man can claim as his defense ( Wilkerson 1990 ) .
There is very little concern shown either for the idea of making spousal abuse a capital crime with the victim as extra-judicial executioner , nor for the idea that perhaps some of the men who murder their spouses might be suffering from an analogous " Battered Man Syndrome . "
There is only one case I am aware of in which a man was able to use a similar defense .
Warren Farrell writes about it in his book _ Why Men Are the Way They Are_ ( Farrell 1986 , p. 231 ) :
Betty King had beaten , slashed , stabbed , thrown dry acid on , and shot her husband .
Eddie King had not sought prosecution when she slashed his face with a carpet knife , nor when she left him in a parking lot with a blade in his back .
Neither of these incidents even made the police records as statistics .
She was only arrested twice -- when she stabbed him so severely in the back and so publicly ( in a bar ) that the incidents had to be reported .
All these stabbings , shootings , and acid - throwings happened during a four - year marriage .
During a subsequent shouting match on the porch of a friend 's house , Betty King once again reached into her purse .
This time Eddie King shot her .
When an investigation led to a verdict of self - defense , there was an outcry of opposition from feminists and the media .
Farrell compares this case , in which " a two - second delay could have meant his death , " to that of the celebrated case made into the television movie The Burning Bed in which the protagonist murdered her husband while he slept .
In conclusion , I think that the available data show that husband battering is a serious problem , comparable to the problem of wife battering .
Even if the statistics collected in the last several years are completely wrong and only one in 14 victims of spousal abuse are men , these are men who are hurting and need services that are currently not available .
There is such a strong stigma against being a battered man , carried over from medieval times when the battered man was considered the guilty party , that special attention should be paid to reaching out to these victims .
Simply opening up " Women 's Shelters " to men is not enough .

The Sirius and XM satellite radio companies may have succeeded in merging , but their combined company could declare bankruptcy within the year .
The New York Times reports that Sirius XM has hired lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing , and its CEO Mel Karmazin has been in talks with television satellite company EchoStar about a potential acquisition of his company .
The company 's main obstacle is that floating satellites high above the earth is an expensive and increasingly unnecessary means of distributing music , which could be one reason the company has been using its satellites for other purposes since at least last year .
The problem is not that satellite radio sucks – far from it .
This technology delivers great - sounding music to places the internet mostly can't reach – most importantly , highways .
And it features real live DJs who program a decent mix of music at a time when many fans have tired of administering their own music experiences ( research , download , transfer , listen , repeat ) .
But the window of opportunity for satellite radio is closing fast as inexpensive internet and cellphone streaming services threaten to extend to the car – and that 's even if the economy were in great shape .
Given the current outlook , Sirius XM 's demise could come sooner than expected .
I 'm pretty well acquainted with satellite radio's charms , having tested a few units over the years and enjoyed it in the occasional rental car .
For hardcore commuters , it 's been a godsend .
But with internet radio already appearing in cellphones , plans to install cellular modems in car dashboards already underway , and earthbound 3G ( and later WiMax ) signals able to provide ever - increasing audio quality , satellite radio will soon face competitors that offer interactivity and more channels while delivering equivalent sound quality – all at a far cheaper price , or even for free .
Then , there 's the economy .
As households trim budgets , cutting monthly satellite subscription fees – especially when there are so many free music options ( FM , HD Radio , cellphone streaming , free music downloading , etc. ) – is going to be an attractive option to many .
As Bloomberg points out , Sirius XM had $ 360 million in cash on September 30 and $ 120
million in an escrow account related to a deal with Major League Baseball .
But its stock has traded under $ 1 on the Nasdaq stock market since September , and in November , Karmazin revised his figures for 2009 subscriber growth downward by one million subscribers .
He 's also staring down $ 175
million in bonds due next Tuesday , $ 350 million in bank debt due in
May , and $ 400 million of convertible bonds due in December .
Plus , Howard Stern 's $ 500 million contract is up for renewal next year .
( An acquisition by EchoStar could result in that deal being renegotiated sooner . )
" [ Karmazin is ] a little bit like Captain Kirk in Star Trek – always finding his way out of situations no matter how implausible , " Radio - Info executive editor Tom Taylor told Bloomberg .
" He now needs to pull a very big rabbit out of a hat . "

Advertisement China says video footage that purportedly shows Chinese security personnel violently beating Tibetans last year is " a lie " .
The video apparently shows protesters being beaten with sticks , and kicked and choked by China 's security forces .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says the footage shows China 's " brutality " .
But a Chinese government official said many of the images and voices in the video had been pieced together from different sources .
The video - sharing site YouTube has recently been blocked in China , which could be because the site had been carrying the contentious video .
Edited together
The footage was released by the Central Tibetan Administration , Tibet 's government - in - exile , last week , and cannot be independently verified .
But Tseten Samdup Chhoekyapa , the Dalai Lama 's representative , said the footage showed " police beating protesters " .
" The footage clearly shows the beating of Tibetan captives even after they are handcuffed and tied , a violation of international norms , " said the representative .
The government - in - exile also said the footage featured a Tibetan called Tendar , who died after being beaten by the Chinese security forces .
The Dalai Lama group is used to fabricating lies to deceive the international community
Chinese government official
It said Tendar was on his way to his office when he was beaten while trying to stop Chinese police officers hitting a monk .
Some of the footage was shot in or near Lhasa after riots and protests erupted throughout Tibetan areas in March last year , according to exiled Tibetans .
During the unrest last year Chinese state - run television released its own footage of Tibetans , including monks , rioting in Lhasa .
But Tibetan exiles say this is the first time there has been footage that shows Tibetans being beaten by the Chinese security forces .
Slashed policeman
In its first response to the video's release , an unnamed government official from China 's Tibetan Autonomous Region said it was a lie .
He was speaking to the official Xinhua News Agency in a report that was released late on Tuesday .
" Technology experts found that video and audio was edited to piece together different places , times and people , " Xinhua said , quoting the official .
China also rejected the claims about Tendar .
" Tendar died from a disease at home awaiting court trial , " the official said , adding that he had used a knife to " slash " a policeman .
The official added that the injured person in the video was not Tendar and the wounds were fake .
" The Dalai Lama group is used to fabricating lies to deceive the international community , and the aim of this video is to hide the truth of the 14 March riot , " Xinhua quoted the official as saying .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says that about 220 Tibetans were killed and nearly 1,300 seriously injured following the unrest last year .
The Chinese government says at least 18 civilians and one policeman were killed , mostly in riots in Lhasa on 14 March .

For some quick info on him , I recommend reading A Different View of Vilsack and see a statement by Organic Consumers director Ronnie Cummins on Vilsack and an Organic Consumers alert opposing Vilsack for Ag Secretary ( below ) .
Iowans also remember the rides on Monsanto 's corporate jet that Vilsack - the Biotech " Governor of the Year " - enjoyed during his time in office .
He repayed Monsanto by working with the Republican floor manager in the House , promising to do everything he could to get a seed bill to pass .
This bill took away county power to regulate GMOs within county borders .
Iowans who I 've spoken to tell me about their disappointment in Vilsack 's vote ( as a state senator ) to take away local control on hog factory farms in Iowa .
During his time as governor " Vilsack oversaw the largest proliferation of hog confinements in the states history . "
These new hog CAFOs put tens of thousands of independent family hog farmers out of business in the state .
The end result of this was a " decimation of rural Iowa " and serious degradation of the state 's drinking water .
Not the best method of extracting a tooth Millions of people in England have resorted to DIY dentistry , a survey by consumer magazine Which ? suggests .
The poll , of 2,631 adults , found 8 % had tried to fix their own dental problems - and a similar number knew somebody who had tried .
Of those who admitted trying the DIY approach , one in four had tried to pull out a tooth using pliers .
Since a new dental contract was introduced in 2006 there has been growing concern over access to care .
But the government said the findings of the survey were unreliable , and said access to NHS dentistry was improving .
While worries about accessing or paying for dental care can clearly be a concern , it really is n't advisable to resort to do - it - yourself care
Susie Sanderson
British Dental Association Ministers have announced an independent review of NHS dentistry in England , which will report back later this year .
Which ?
will be making a submission to this review and is currently carrying out detailed research to build an accurate picture of the state of NHS dentistry .
The latest survey found 12 % of those who had tried DIY techniques had tried to extract a tooth by using a piece of string tied to a door handle .
Some 30 % of DIY dentists had tried to whiten their teeth with household cleaning products .
Other DIY procedures people admitted to included : • Using household glue to stick down a filling or crown ( 11 % ) • Popping an ulcer with a pin ( 19 % ) • Trying to mend or alter dentures ( 8 % ) •
Trying to stick down a loose filling with chewing gum ( 6 % )
Which ?
health campaigner , Jenny Driscoll , said : " This research shows the desperate measures people will resort to .
" Everyone should have access to good quality dental treatment so it 's worrying to see so many people resorting to doing it themselves . "
It is ludicrous to suggest that three million people are doing DIY dentistry
Barry Cockcroft
Chief dental officer for England Susie Sanderson , of the British Dental Association , said : " While worries about accessing or paying for dental care can clearly be a concern , it really is n't advisable to resort to do - it - yourself care .
" We hear too many horror stories about people pulling out the wrong tooth , or causing themselves to have an infection , and urge anyone considering this path to think again .
It is all too easy to make the problem worse , rather than solve it .
" If you are having trouble accessing NHS dental care then contact your local primary care trust . "
Political reaction Mike Penning , the shadow health minister , said : " It is a scandal that millions of people are resorting to pulling out their own teeth as a result of Labour 's disastrous mismanagement of NHS dentistry .
" These survey results are a direct consequence of the introduction of Labour 's botched dental contract which has left millions without an NHS dentist . "
But Barry Cockcroft , the chief dental officer for England , gave the Which ?
survey very short shrift .
He said : " These findings come from an online multiple choice survey that has no statistical credibility .
It is ludicrous to suggest that three million people are doing DIY dentistry .
" DIY dentistry is dangerous and unnecessary .
Thanks to our investment of over £ 2bn in NHS dentistry , there are now lots of new NHS dental practices expanding and opening around the country . "

Obviously , everything about great sex involves touching .
Really mastering the subtleties of touching is one of the best ways to really explode a woman 's ideas of just how amazing sex can be .
The thing that I really love about the " idea " of touching a girl , is that the sensation travels in both directions .
She gets the pleasure of feeling your hands on her skin , and you get the pleasure of feeling her skin with your hands .
And when you are both really in tune with that exchange of pleasure , it can be absolutely awesome .
So what is the best way to touch a woman ?
It depends on the woman .
I 'm going to explain EXACTLY what you need to know to figure it out for your woman .
There are a few important keys to touching that can let her know , INSTANTLY that you know exactly what you are doing -- and get her powerfully aroused .

Learn the 3 Different Kinds of Orgasms You Can Give Your Woman Like It Was Second Nature
The first thing you should know , if you do n't already , is that women LOVE to be touched .
Touch is very important to all humans , but it is , generally , much more important to women , and they respond very strongly to touch .
It is a powerful reward to a woman when you touch her , and it can instantly make her feel great .
Now , of course , some women are more reserved about it ... some are more formal and are not comfortable feeling such good feelings with someone until they know them well .
Some women are just closed off and do n't like anyone to enter their space , and even in a relationship , they resist having another person touch them so easily ...
And some women simply do not like being touched .
They find it unpleasant and they recoil from it .
But the truth is , women in those last two categories ( ABSOLUTELY those in the last one ) have had some trauma in their lives , probably child sexual abuse , that has damaged them to the extent that they can't accept this natural and beautiful form of shared pleasure .
That 's a sad truth of the world .
For the other women , depending on their degree of shyness , touch is always a pleasure and a treat ... assuming they like the guy that is touching them , and it 's appropriate to the relationship .
By appropriate , I mean , a female friend might love it if you rub her shoulders , but might be uncomfortable with something more " romantic , " like caressing her hair and cheek .
I am going to talk about touching in a romantic context , whether it be on a first date or with your wife of 20 years .
And I 'm not talking about directly sexual touching .
Sensual touching is an art that you should definitely spend some time mastering -- because it will be incredibly rewarding to both you and the woman in your life .
Touch her more .
However much you are already touching your girlfriend , wife , or lover ... you can do it more often .
I can't emphasize enough how much of an emotional connection and bond can be formed by this simple action .
Women link many feelings of sexuality , love , and trust with the sensations that are aroused in them when a man puts his hands on her .
It can make her feel both sexually excited and safe at the same time .
It can also make her body release certain chemicals into her blood that make her feel more attraction to and more comfort with the man that she is with .
How 's that for the simplest tip ever ?
Try it out .
I promise that it is as effective as it is simple .

Look into her eyes .
Well , here 's one that 's even more simple ... but again ... it 's so much more powerful than it sounds .
When you are putting your hand on her , whether you are caressing or squeezing ... or petting or holding or any other kind of touching ... Look into her eyes as you are doing it .
You will find that if you hold eye contact with a woman -- even if she looks down for a moment -- she will be drawn into your gaze and that you can hold her there .
This will add an amazing amount of emotional intensity to your touch .
She will feel it deeply in her body .
You may think , heck , I already look at her when I touch her ...
But just try this -- try being aware of intentionally holding her eye contact as you touch her .
I think you will find that it makes a very big difference .

When you are putting your hand on her , whether you are caressing or squeezing ... or petting or holding or any other kind of touching ... Look into her eyes as you are doing it .
Try touching her in new ways .
There are particular types of touching that women find more romantic , more sensual , and more arousing than others .
And , of course , since all women are different , you 're going to have to do some experimenting to find out what the woman in your life responds to most .
The key is to really tune in to her and notice how she is responding .
That tuning in or " Paying Attention " that I always talk about , is actually the really important part of this tip ...
But here are a few ways you should try touching her -- most women respond very positively towards ALL of them .
Pay attention to see which ones your girl goes for :
Use the very tips of your fingers and run them very , very lightly , so that it is almost a tickle , anywhere ( or everywhere ) on her skin .
Stroke her gently , but not tentatively with the entire face of your hand .
Try running it up her back , her neck , her legs , arms , or the side of her face .
Just hold her firmly .
This can be such a powerful feeling for a woman .
Just place your hand on her shoulder , the back of her neck , her thigh , arm , or hand ... and just hold her .
Let her feel your masculine strength , but do n't , obviously , hurt her .
If you do this right , she should feel the tenderness and protectiveness behind your touch .
Cup her with your hand , and stroke gently with your thumb ... This combines the first idea of gentle finger tips with the last one of holding her firmly ...
I particularly like to hold the back of her neck and then gently stroke her cheek with my thumb ... while looking into her eyes .
Also try holding the back of her head and stroking her temple , or hold her arm and stroke her shoulder , or her thigh and stroke her knee .
Add eye contact to all of these and she will melt .
Pet her hair .
I have never met a woman who does not enjoy having her hair stroked .
For girls with straight hair , you can let your fingers run through it .
If she has curly hair , just pet , so that you do n't get stuck and start yanking on her knots !
To really send her into orbit , start at her neck and use your fingers to pet upwards into her hair along her scalp .
You can bring a woman very close to orgasm with this one .
.
There are particular types of touching that women find more romantic , more sensual , and more arousing than others .
And , of course , since all women are different , you 're going to have to do some experimenting to find out what the woman in your life responds to most .
The key is to really tune in to her and notice how she is responding .
That tuning in or " Paying Attention " that I always talk about , is actually the really important part of this tip ...
Tip # 4 : Feel With Your Feelings .
I saved the best one for last ... but it is also the one that is most complicated to explain , and can be more challenging for some men to master .
That 's because , as guys , we 're just not as " in touch with our feelings " as women are .
But this is of HUGE importance if you really want to rock her world in ways that will make her forget any other guy she has ever been with .
The basic truth is : A woman can FEEL , not just the physical sensation of your hand on her skin , but also she can FEEL the emotional content of your touch .
I know this sounds a little bit " out there , " but again , as always , I challenge you to TRY it before you dismiss it because this is really an incredibly powerful truth .
When you touch a woman while thinking sexual thoughts about her , and when you focus that intent into your touch , she will FEEL it very strongly ... and her body will respond to it .
That sexual energy will flow from you and into her .
Likewise , when you feel tender feelings of attraction and protectiveness for your woman , and you stroke her hair , it makes her feel loved and safe .
And there is nothing that will provide you both with a more amazing night of mind - melting sex than when the woman in your arms feels loved and safe .
I know that I 'm leaving a lot out here , and that , especially this last tip is kind of hard to wrap your brain around .
The truth is , that this issue of touching with emotion is part of a MUCH bigger picture of understanding women and female sexuality , and just too big a topic for this article .
However , do n't hesitate to get started by using the great tips above .
You will be amazed that even these brain - dead simple tips can make a huge difference in how women respond to you sexually .
If you are in a relationship , you will be even more amazed at the positive changes that just a tiny bit of information can cause .
You can go to a marriage counselor , or talk to a therapist , or read books on " communicating " better , but there is NOTHING in my experience that improves a relationship more or strengthens the bond between a man and a woman than touch and sex .
Keyes : Stop Obama or U.S. ' will cease to exist ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday February 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Alan Keyes , a three - time presidential candidate , called President Obama a " radical communist " and a " usurper " and said with him in charge , America " is going to cease to exist " at a pro-life fundraiser Thursday .
" Obama is a radical communist and I think it is becoming clear .
That is what I told people in Illinois and now everybody realizes it is coming true , " said Keyes who ran unsuccessfully against Obama for the Senate in 2004 .
" He is going to destroy this country and we are either going to stop him or the United States of America is going to cease to exist , " said Keyes .
In an interview in Hastings , Neb. with a KHAS reporter at the fundraiser , Keyes called Obama an " abomination " for some of his pro-choice views .
" The man is an abomination , " Keyes said , going on to accuse Obama of being supportive of infanticide .
" That is a man with such a seared conscience , I can't even understand why anyone in their right mind would consider him worthy of political support . "
Keyes also claimed that Obama had no standing to be president .
Keyes said Obama was actually born in Kenya and so did not meet the Constitutional presidency requirements of being a natural - born U.S. citizen .
He said Obama was a " usurper occupying the office without constitutional warrant . "
" He has refused to provide proof that he is in fact a natural - born citizen , " Keyes said .
" I 'm not even sure he is president of the United States . "
When the reporter interviewing him apparently cracked a smile at this , Keyes angrily responded with " that is not a laughing matter .
We 're going to find ourselves in the midst of chaos , confusion and civil war . "
Keyes is one of several people who have filed lawsuits challenging Obama 's citizenship .
Despite his far - right views , Keyes was not adverse to joining Michael Moore 's traveling mosh pit during the 2000 presidential campaign .
Moore , a left - leaning documentarian who is often demonized by the right , promised Keyes that if he joined the mosh pit , he would receive his endorsement .
KHAS has more details here .

If you thought that 7 x 7 x 7 Rubik ’s Cube was a little too difficult for your tiny brain , what with its 1.95 * ( 10 ^160 ) permutations , have I got a deal for you .
This 3 x 3 x 1 Rubik ’s Cube ( aka the “ Floppy Cube ” ) is so simple that your cat should be able to solve it – with one paw tied behind its back .
Apparently , this Japanese cube - modder figured out a way to slice up the original cube so a single layer could still pivot and work as a simplified mini-puzzle .
In addition to the 1 - layer cube , he ’s also built a 2 - layer version , which is still much easier to solve than the original .
Me , I just used to take all the stickers off and put them on the proper sides .
Is n’t that a reasonable solution ?

Common Wine Myths
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .

Wine is one of the best known , but least understood open source projects .
It is a mystic application that everyone knows about , many use , but few truly understand .
Reading forum posts , blog entries and tutorials about Wine show that Wine is surrounded by many myths and half truths .
In this article , we will attempt to clear up some of the misconceptions about the project .
Myth :
Wine does n't run any program well :
There are currently 1863 applications with a Platinum rating ( applications which install and run flawlessly on an out - of - the - box Wine installation ) in Wine 's Application Database ( AppDB ) .
Additional applications are receiving a Platinum rating at a rapid rate .
Popular Windows applications such as Adobe Photoshop CS3 , World of Warcraft and Microsoft Office 2007 all run under Wine .
Myth : Wine requires native Direct3D support :
Wine implements the Direct3D libraries already .
Direct3D 9 and earlier has been implemented for the most part .
There are of course implementation bugs , but those are being worked on .
The Direct3D runtime is a slow work in progress , and so may be missing some features .
Direct3D 10 is unimplemented , but the core infrastructure is in place and future implementation is in the planning stages .
Native Direct3D should not be used in Wine , except for the DirectX runtime library ( d3dx9_*.dll ) , to work around missing features in Wine .
Myth : Wine requires native Internet Explorer 6 : Wine comes with its own version of Internet Explorer based on Mozilla 's Gecko layout engine for applications that use IE for rendering .
See the Wine Gecko project for details .
There is a ton of work being put into this area of Wine since it covers such a large area of code .
As a result , many applications depending on Internet Explorer rendering may not run well .
For those applications , using native Internet Explorer serves as a workaround .
This is neither required nor recommended because Internet Explorer 's license does not allow people without a Windows license to use it .
Myth :
Wine is only for Linux :
Wine should run on any POSIX system that has kernel threading .
However , since most
Wine developers are using some version of Linux , these other operating systems do n't enjoy the same level of support or compatibility .
Wine currently builds and runs applications on Linux , Mac OS X , FreeBSD , Solaris and OpenSolaris .
Work is also being done to get Wine to work on NetBSD and OpenBSD , the effort is progressing well .
Myth :
Wine is only 32 - bit capable :
This is partially true , but the situation is changing .
Wine has the capability of running 64 bit applications , ( see this December , 2008 thread ) , but it is not yet enabled by default .
A ton of work is being put into making the internals of Wine 64 bit compatible .
Checking the Wine commit log , one can see frequent additions of patches aimed at 64 bit Wine .
Running 64 - bit
Wine currently requires the use of a special GCC compiler from SVN to compile , so it 's mostly for developers at this point .
It is worth pointing out though that about two thirds of the internal Wine conformance tests already pass .
This is , of course , different from running Wine as a 32 - bit application on 64 - bit hardware .
Doing so works fine as long as your operating system has the 32 - bit compatibility libraries installed .
Wine is commonly used for playing games on 64 - bit Linux distributions .
In fact , most packagers already build 32 - bit binaries for 64 - bit operating systems .
Myth :
Wine stole code from Microsoft !
It 's illegal to use !
Wine is a clean room implementation of the Microsoft Windows API .
Wine developers have never used leaked Windows source code or disassembled its output .
The implementation is made and tested using a suite of conformance tests , ensuring that Wine has the same behavior as Windows .
The conformance tests are built daily and tested on various versions of Windows and Wine .
Results can be seen on the Wine Test Runs page .
Wine is a very complex piece of software that has come a long way in the past 15 years of development .
Releasing its first stable version ( 1.0 ) this past year is a testament to the complexity and size of this program that took thousands of hours of development to implement what Microsoft did with many times the resources .
While Wine does not yet have perfect compatibility with all Microsoft Windows applications , the Wine team is working hard to change this .
Wine is a very mature , fast - moving and complex piece of software .
There 's no better time than now to try Wine .

Stimulus
Science Windfall From Legislators
House passes package ; Senate is still working on its version
THE HOUSE passed an $ 819 billion stimulus package ( H.R. 1 ) last week that contains more than $ 13 billion for research and development .
At the same time , the Senate was working on its version of the bill ( S. 1 ) , an estimated $ 888 billion package that has some $ 12 billion for R&D .
" The investments in science and technology in the recovery package are timely and targeted .
They will create high - quality jobs in the short term while making strides to strengthen American competitiveness over the long - term , " said Rep. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . ) , chairman of the House Committee on Science & Technology , in support of H.R. 1 .
Thomas H. Lane , president of the American Chemical Society , which publishes C&EN , sent a letter to Congress encouraging them to " move swiftly to pass legislation with the science and technology portions intact . "
Members of Congress used letters like Lane 's to support the bill .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) told members of the House that she received lots of letters supporting the bill , including one from Nobel Laureates .
Despite such support , no Republican voted for the bill .
On the Senate side , Republican support is needed to pass S. 1 .
As the leadership works to get bipartisan support , science advocates are watching the R&D funding in the Senate bill , which is different from that in H.R. 1 .
In S. 1 , NASA is set to get $ 1.5 billion , more than twice the funds allocated by the House .
On the other hand , NSF would receive $ 1.4 billion , which is about half of the amount set by the House .
The Department of Energy 's Office of Science would get nearly $ 500 million , 75 % less than in H.R. 1 . R&D funding for other science agencies also varies .
The Senate is expected to vote on S. 1 soon .
If the bill is passed , a conference committee with representatives from both governing bodies will meet to iron out differences in their bills .
I saw something on NHL on the Fly last night that I do n’t remember ever seeing before , a player going on a breakaway , without a stick .
Dominic Moore of the Toronto Maple Leafs blocked a shot on the penalty kill , and it shattered his stick .
So then Moore was heading in alone on goal with a puck , but no stick .
NHL rules prohibit players from scoring with a kicking motion , so he very alertly kicked the puck to teammate Jason Blake who took the shot .
Now they did n’t score on the play , but that does n’t make this replay any less remarkable in my opinion .
That is a great example of not quitting on a play for sure .
Bravo !
Thanks to the folks on the Message Board of Hockey ’s Future , I found a similar incident from last season , with Jarkko Ruutu :
Pc Nash now just wants to return to work after the accident A police officer kept chasing a suspect for his first arrest - despite getting a six - inch branch stuck in his eye .
Pc John Nash slipped on mud and slid head first into a bush while pursuing the man in Rochdale , Greater Manchester , just six days into the job .
He only realised he was injured when he arrested the suspect , who told him he had " better get to hospital " .
Pc Nash , 25 , underwent three hours of surgery , which saved his eye , and says he now just wants to return to work .
The officer was in an unmarked police vehicle following a car being driven erratically on an estate when it was abandoned in Walton Close .
Two men ran off and Pc Nash gave chase , in conditions described as " driving rain " , and cornered one in a dead end .
The stick came to rest underneath Pc Nash 's brain Insp Ian Hanson , of the Police Federation , said : " John fell in some mud and initially thought he banged his head on his baton , which he had drawn .
" When he detained the man he thought was the offender shortly afterwards , it was actually the man who said : ' you 'd better get to hospital mate ' . "
Mr Hanson , of Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) , said the stick penetrated Pc Nash 's eye , shattered his eye socket and stopped just underneath his brain .
" He was incredibly lucky not to lose his eye , or indeed his life , " he added .
Pc Nash was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital , where he underwent three hours of surgery .
Doctors had expected him to lose his sight , Mr Hanson said .
It must have been quite frightening for them to see their colleague come back with this thing sticking out of his eye
Insp Ian Hanson , of the Police Federation " Ultimately , it 's through the skill of the surgeons that he is in the lucky position that he has kept his eye and not suffered any brain damage , " he added .
" It shows the dangers that police officers face every day , but we in GMP are very proud of John .
He is very much the reluctant hero and all he wants to do is get back to work .
" John is more bothered about the impact it had on his colleagues at the scene .
It must have been quite frightening for them to see their colleague come back with this thing sticking out of his eye . "
PC
Nash has got his peripheral vision back and a " significant " amount of his sight has returned .
The suspect was arrested but later released without charge .

" The animal upside down with ruptured joints and often a broken leg , twists frantically in pain and terror , so that it must be gripped by the neck or have a clamp inserted in its nostrils to enable the slaughterer to kill the animal with a single stroke , as religious law prescribes . " .
Ordinarily the cattle would be killed humanely with an electric bolt , but for months the abattoir had been on a special kosher order for America .
By rabbinical law the animals had to have their throats slit and then be hung upside down to bleed to death .
The tubes twisted so the animals were turned on their backs .
As they reached the end , chains were wrapped around their hind legs .
A crane shot the cattle into the air one by one and snapped their back legs .
Then a fork was inserted into each beast 's nose as one of two Jewish butchers blessed the long knife in his hand , said a short prayer and slit the throat of the animal which was then pulled higher into the air , the blood pouring in sheets from its neck and its front legs kicking wildly .
We would sometimes watch in horrified fascination from a window above the killing box as the creatures were hauled along the bleeding trough in their final throes .
Once a thrashing cow hurled itself against the window where we stood , shattering the glass and spattering us with gore .
You could not watch for long .
Bob Geldof , Is That It ?
" Animals being ritually slaughtered in the United States are shackeld around a rear leg , hoisted into the air , and then hang , fully conscious , upside down on the conveyer belt for between two and five minutes - and occasionally much longer if something goes wrong on the killing line before the slaughterer makes his cut . "
" The animal upside down with ruptured joints and often a broken leg , twists frantically in pain and terror , so that it must be gripped by the neck or have a clamp inserted in its nostrils to enable the slaughterer to kill the animal with a single stroke , as religious law prescribes . "
When Kosher is n't Kosher
She told me that the first time she visited a kosher slaughter house , she heard screaming cattle from a half kilometer away and wondered what was different in this place .
What she saw was shocking .
I quote from her book , Thinking in Pictures : And Other Reports from My Life With Autism by Temple Grandin " I will never forget having nightmares after visiting the now defunct Spencer Foods plant in Spencer , Iowa fifteen years ago .
Employees wearing football helmets attached a nose tong to the nose of a writhing beast suspended by a chain wrapped around one back leg .
Each terrified animal was forced with an electric prod to run into a small stall which had a slick floor on a forty - five degree angle .
This caused the animal to slip and fall so that workers could attach the chain to its rear leg [ in order to raise it into the air ] .
As I watched this nightmare , I thought , ' This should not be happening in a civilized society . '
In my diary I wrote , ' If hell exists , I am in it . '
I vowed that I would replace the plant from hell with a kinder and gentler system . "
And she has been doing that for years now .
You may wonder why the Rabbayin listen to a gentile , autistic woman .
Kosher Slaugher
So unless you have cruel heart kosher meat should be avoided .

TEL AVIV —
An unexpected resolution to the conflict in the Middle East occurred over the weekend as Israeli leaders agreed it was time to pack up and move on .
“ We ’ve had a prosperous 60 years , turning a hellish desert into an oasis of milk and honey , ” said a spokesperson for the Jewish state .
“ Now it ’s time to venture forward , to seek out new challenges . ”
Israel handed over its keys to the Palestinians , along with the codes to its nuclear arsenal .
“ It ’s all yours now , ” said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in a telephone conversation with Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin .
“ Enjoy the beautiful country we leave you . ”
Although Israel was allowed to stay until the end of the month , the Palestinians have already begun disassembling the infrastructure , replacing roads and bridges with vast rocky terrain and sand dunes .
Once prolific fruit orchards are being deprived of water and allowed to rot away .
“ It ’s a bit of a fixer - upper , ” admitted Yassin , “ but we love the location . ”
As Israel packed up its final belongings , loading the last few boxes onto a U - Haul trailer , the question remained : Where next ?
“ Maybe Monaco … or something Vatican - adjacent , ” said Olmert , as he knelt to the ground and kissed the soil in a symbolic farewell to his erstwhile homeland .
“ We do n’t need a lot of room . ”

If you have n’t heard that 2009 is the year of 3D , it should be clear very soon .
There are over 15 feature movies coming out in 3D this year – “ My Bloody Valentine 3 - D ” and “ Coraline ” were the first and are still in theaters .
Coming soon are “ Monsters Vs. Aliens , ” “ Pixar ’s Up ” And “ Horrorween . ”
So what is all the excitement about ?
It ’s because we ’re talking about modern 3D .
The old cardboard red and blue ( anaglyph ) “ glasses ” — and their associated headaches — are long gone .
If you hear someone refer to these old - style glasses for theater use , you can feel completely comfortable in correcting them .
You can drop that notion altogether – that was your father ’s 3D .
That ’s why I was so vehemently against Dreamworks Animation ’s use of anaglyph glasses for their 3D Superbowl ad – sure there is some awareness generated , but awareness of what ?
Headaches ?
People will just get confused and think that they have to bring those very same glasses to the theater .
No .
What we are now talking about is “ passive polarized ” 3D glasses in most cases .
Beverly Hills based RealD espouses this technology and I mention them by name as they are essentially the theatrical projection standard for modern 3D with 90 - 95 % of all installations .
The technology is not color coded and will not place any undue processing requirements on your brain for a 3D experience .
Therefore , no headaches like your father had .
To the contrary – the experience is thrilling when done correctly ( yes , there can be badly made 3D movies , just like any other 2D movie ) and immersive .
So the technology is much better – what about the content ?
The goal of any great director is to have 3D take a back seat to the audience ’s experience and use the format to augment the story .
It is when you forget that you are watching a 3D movie that the magic happens !
You brain is more engaged and your experience is heightened with a greater attachment to what is going on in the movie .
It should be seamless – a great 3D director / DP will take a scene and determine how to best use 3D to bring the audience into the movie ; a window , rather than a wall with a projection if you will .
You will see a gradual departure from those “ comin ’ at ya ” 3D movies toward a much more fluid integration of 3D … more subtle .
Believe me , when 3D is done correctly it is like adding color to a movie .
The clarity is also astounding ; something about the brain bringing two different images together of a single scene works much better than having only a single image .
The brain is doing some fuzzy logic calculations there and the outcome is a totally new experience for the theater .
3D expertise in filmmaking is expanding and 2009 will be a testament to that .
We have the masters of course : James Cameron ( “ Avatar ” ) for example .
He has been involved with modern 3D for years and actually partnered with Vince Pace to invent and build an industry leading 3D camera system called Fusion .
But we have the new generation as well like Thomas Jane ( “ The Dark Country ” ) who has the vision to create a 3D experience and the wisdom to call upon 3D veterans to assist him in making it happen .
Add somewhere in the middle these directors , all of whom are engaged in 3D projects : Steven Spielberg , Peter Jackson , Robert Zemeckis , Steven Soderbergh , Tim Burton , George Lucas , Gore Verbinski , Jerry Bruckheimer , Alexandre Aja , Joe Dante , etc .
Oh , and all future digital animations from Pixar , DWA and Disney will be in stereoscopic 3D , starting right now .
Need I go on ?
Andrew Way , the chief executive of the Royal Free Hospital , said the move to electronic records had cost the hospital £ 10 m , increased waiting times for patients and required an extra 40 admin staff .
Way told the BBC he had personally apologised to staff for taking the decision to go ahead with the project .
Way said it cost £ 10 m to implement the technology and fix it .
He estimates it cost the hospital another £ 6 m because it treated less patients and because the system failed to properly bill other parts of the NHS for work done .
Way said : " I think it is very disappointing that the work we had to do as a trust has caused our staff so much heart - ache and hard work .
" I have personally apologised for the decision to implement the system before we were really clear about what we were going to receive .
" I had been led to believe it would all work . "
The Royal Free is one of the early adopters for the increasingly beleagured project .
Last month the Public Accounts Committee suggested giving the scheme another six months to show some improvement or put it out of its misery .
The National Programme for IT is one of the world 's largest public technology projects .
It is expected to cost at least £ 12.7bn and is currently about four years behind schedule .
Some parts of it , like digital X - rays , appear to be working but the central patient record scheme has suffered from a series of problems .
In the north of England patient records rely on Lorenzo software from iSoft - the government was forced to bail the firm out .
In the south of England the project was meant to benefit from competition between two suppliers - BT and Fujitsu - but then Fujitsu decided to end all involvement .
Accenture also decided to end all involvement with the scheme .
This month BT said it was putting a number of contracts under review after announcing a big write down at its services arm .
The NHS contract is thought to be high on the review list . ®
How Big is Our Universe ?

Imagine that our entire Solar System were the size of a quarter .
The Sun is now a microscopic speck of dust , as are its nine planets , whose orbits are represented by the flat disc of the coin .
How far away is the nearest star to our sun ?
In our model , Proxima Centauri ( and any planets that might be around it ) would be another quarter , two soccer fields away .
This is the typical separation of stars in our part of the galaxy .

In that time , a star at the edge of one of these distant galaxies has exploded -- " gone supernova . "
Can you spot the supernova in the picture at right ?
Even though the explosion is as bright as a billion suns , it is so far away that it is just a speck of light .

The universe is a big , big place .
But how big ?
And how do we know ?
Throughout history , humans have used a variety of techniques and methods to help them answer the questions ' How far ? ' and ' How big ? '
Generations of explorers have looked deeper and deeper into the vast expanse of the universe .
And the journey continues today , as new methods are used , and new discoveries are made .
( To learn more about distance , visit How Big is Our Universe . )
In the third century B.C. , Aristarchus of Samos asked the question ' How far away is the Moon ? '
He was able to measure the distance by looking at the shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse .
It was Edmund Halley , famous for predicting the return of the comet that bears his name , who three centuries ago found a way to measure the distance to the Sun and to the planet Venus .
He knew that the planet Venus would very rarely , every 121 years , pass directly between the Earth and the Sun .
The apparent position of the planet , relative to the disk of the Sun behind it , is shifted depending on where you are on Earth .
And how different that shift is depends on the distance from both Venus and the Sun to the Earth .
This rare event , the transit of Venus , occurred again quite recently , June 8 , 2004 .
It was knowing this fundamental distance from the Earth to the Sun that helped us find the true scale of the entire Solar system for the first time .
When we leave the solar system , we find our star and its planets are just one small part of the Milky Way galaxy .
The Milky Way is a huge city of stars , so big that even at the speed of light , it would take 100,000 years to travel across it .
All the stars in the night sky , including our Sun , are just some of the residents of this galaxy , along with millions of other stars too faint to be seen .
The further away a star is , the fainter it looks .
Astronomers use this as a clue to figure out the distance to stars that are very far away .
But how do you know if the star really is far away , or just not very bright to begin with ?
This problem was solved in 1908 when Henrietta Leavitt discovered a way to tell the ' wattage ' of certain stars that changed their pulse rate linked to their wattage .
This allowed their distances to be measured all the way across the Milky Way .
Beyond our own galaxy lies a vast expanse of galaxies .
The deeper we see into space , the more galaxies we discover .
There are billions of galaxies , the most distant of which are so far away that the light arriving from them on Earth today set out from the galaxies billions of years ago .
So we see them not as they are today , but as they looked long before there was any life on Earth .
Finding the distance to these very distant galaxies is challenging , but astronomers can do so by watching for incredibly bright exploding stars called supernovae .
Some types of exploding stars have a known brightness - wattage - so we can figure out how far they are by measuring how bright they appear to us , and therefore how far away it is to their home galaxy .
The image below is both the oldest and youngest picture ever taken .
It is the oldest because it has taken the light nearly 14 billion years to reach us .
And it is the youngest because it is a snapshot of our newborn universe , long before the first stars and galaxies formed .
The bright patterns show clumps of simple matter that will eventually form stars and galaxies .
This is as far as we can see into the universe .
It is time , not space , which limits our view .
Beyond a certain distance , light has n't had time to reach us yet .
So how big is the universe ?
No one knows if the universe is infinitely large , or even if ours is the only universe that exists .
And other parts of the universe , very far away , might be quite different from the universe closer to home .
Future NASA missions will continue to search for clues to the ultimate size and scale of our cosmic home .

You may not have heard of the Zumbafone yet , but its makers are confident it could revolutionize the way you communicate .
Of course , they wo n't tell you much more -- because the Zumbafone is currently considered top - secret , and you do n't have clearance to enter the land of Zumba Lumba .
Intrigued ?
Or maybe just confused ?
Either way , you are n't alone .
Read on .
Mysterious Manufacturing
Let 's start with the basics :
The Zumbafone is a carefully shrouded device being developed by a British company called IA Technologies .
The company manufactures military technology and a bunch of other stuff that , no matter how many times I read the various descriptions , I 'm not quite sure what it is .
Within its Hereford - based headquarters , the folks at IA Tech have been working on what they call the world 's first fully accurate voice - controlled mobile phone .
It 's also , they say , the world 's first " backup replacement mobile " -- meaning it stores all of its information on a remote server rather than on the phone itself .
Because of that , your contacts and other data supposedly remain secure even if your phone is lost .
How the Zumbafone Works
The Zumbafone is the size of a credit card and contains two interlocking pieces .
One half snaps off to function as an all - inclusive earpiece - phone .
The other , when connected , offers a more traditional keypad and screen .
I , for one , am hoping it also makes sandwiches -- but that may be wishful thinking .
This much we do know :
Once you attach the earpiece half , the Zumbafone links you to an " Internet portal " that holds all of your information .
Say the name of a contact , and you 're instantly connected .
Tap a button , and you can speak out a text message and have it sent wherever you need .
Incoming text messages are displayed on the screen half of the phone if you have it attached , or spoken aloud if you 're wearing the earpiece .
Zumbafone in Action
The guy who designed the Zumbafone is a fellow named Dean McEvoy .
He 's listed as CEO of " Zumba Limited , " which may or may not be the same thing as " Zumba Lumba . "
McEvoy says he is dyslexic and has always struggled with tasks like typing and reading text messages .
The Zumbafone is his four - years - in - the - works solution .
The device is slated to be on store shelves by the end of 2009 .
It 's still seemingly too top - secret to be fully demoed , but the following video gives a little more detail about the cryptic creation .
Just do n't tell anyone we showed it to you .
For a while I have been pondering over a problem that arises when your functionally written program has some state with cross references – for example a list of users , each of which uses a number of computers , and a list of computers , each having an owner .
Implicit referencing
For doing queries on such data , it would be convenient if every reference is just the referenced object itself .
Although we would visualize this as a graph , semantically , it is more like an infinite tree .
This is possible in Haskell , due to laziness , and if you create the data structure cleverly , it even uses constant memory , no matter how “ deep ” you enter this infinite tree ( a recent post of mine talks about this ) .
A possible data definition would be :
data User = User { userName :: String , uses :: [ Computer ] } data Computer = Computer { computerName :: String , owner :: User -- references the Users } data State = State [ User ] [ Computer ] testState = let user = User " Conrad " [ computer ] computer = Computer " Z3 " user in State [ user ] [ computer ]
Explicit referencing
But such a representation is very unsuitable for updates ( at least I ca n’t think if a nice way of updating such a graph without breaking the internal cross- references ) and serialization , which is a must for a HAppS based application .
So what one would probably start with is this data structure :
data User = User { userId :: Int , userName :: String , uses :: [ Int ] -- references the Computers } data Computer = Computer { computerId :: Int , computerName :: String , owner :: Int -- references the Users } data State = State [ User ] [ Computer ] testState = State [ User 0 " Conrad " [ 1 ] ]
[ Computer 1 " Z3 " 0 ]
I think the semantics of this are clear .
Note that the referencing is currently not type - safe , but this can be provided by phantom types .
Maybe I ’ll write more about that later .
Now imaging you want to display the information about the first computer with your web application .
You extract the information with let State _ cs = testState in head cs and pass that to your templating engine .
But what if your template wants to display the name of the owner ?
It only has access to his userId .
You would either need to know what information the template will ever need , extract that from the state beforehand and pass it along , or give the template access to the whole state .
In that case , though , there has to be lookup - logic in your output code , which is also not nice .
Woudl n’t it be nice if you could , in your application logic , work with the explicit references , which are easy to modify and store , but somehow turn that into the implicit referencing ?
Duplicated representation
One way would be to have two unrelated sets of data structures , ExplicitState , ExplicitUser , ExplicitComputer , which use explicit identifiers to reference each other , and ImplicitState , ... which are defined as the first representation of our state .
It is then mostly trivial to write a function that converts ExplicitState to ImplicitState .
The big disadvantage of this is that you have to maintain these two different hierarchies .
It also means that every function on the state has to be defined twice , which often almost identical code .
Clearly , this is not desirable .
Annotated representation
It would be more elegant if the state is stored in one data type that , controlled by a type parameter , comes in the one or the other representation .
To do that , we need two types :
One that contains a value , and one that contains just a reference :
newtype Id v =
Id v deriving ( Show , Typeable , Data ) newtype Ref v = Ref Int deriving ( Show , Typeable , Data )
Then we need to adjust our data definitions , to make use of these .
( I ’ll leave out the names , to keep the code smaller )
data User ref = User { userId :: Int , uses :: [ ref ( Computer ref ) ] } data Computer ref = Computer { computerId :: Int , owner :: ref ( User ref ) } data State ref = State [ User ref ] [ Computer ref ]
Here we introduce a type parameter “ ref ” , which will later be either Id or Ref .
Note that now a reference also states the object it is a reference for , which greatly increases type safety .
Functions on these data types that do n’t work with the references will be polymorphic in the “ ref ” type parameter , so only need to be written once .
A User Id is a complete user with all related data , while User Ref is a user with only references .
And a Ref ( User Ref ) is reference to a user , which contains references ...
Not so kind kinds
Did you notice the lack of a deriving clause ?
Our data structures have the relatively peculiar kind ( (* -> *) -> * ) , which makes it hard for the compiler to derive instances for things like Show .
But we already know that we will only use
Id or Ref for the type variable , so we can use ghc ’s StandaloneDeriving language extension and have these instances created :
deriving instance Show ( User Id ) deriving instance Show ( User Ref ) deriving instance Show ( Computer Id ) deriving instance Show ( Computer Ref ) deriving instance Show ( State Id ) deriving instance Show ( State Ref )
Toggling a type parameter
The next step is to write the conversion function .
It will have type
unrefState :: State Ref ->
State Id
For that , and for later , we need lookup functions :
unrefUserRef :: State Id -> Ref ( User Ref ) ->
Id ( User Id ) unrefUserRef ( State l _ ) ( Ref i ) = Id $ fromJust $ find ( \u@( User i' _ ) -> i == i' ) l unrefComputerRef :: State Id -> Ref ( Computer Ref ) ->
Id ( Computer Id ) unrefComputerRef ( State _ l ) ( Ref i ) = Id $ fromJust $ find ( \u@( Computer i' _ ) -> i == i' ) l
These expect a State ( with implicit referencing ) and a reference , and look up this reference .
The function unrefState then looks like this :
unrefState :: State Ref ->
State Id unrefState ( State us cs ) = let unrefState = State ( map ( unrefUser unrefState ) us ) ( map ( unrefComp unrefState ) cs ) in unrefState where unrefUser :: State Id -> User Ref ->
User Id unrefUser s ( User i refs ) = User i ( map ( unrefComputerRef s ) refs ) unrefComp :: State Id -> Computer Ref ->
Computer
Id unrefComp s ( Computer i ref ) = Computer i ( unrefUserRef s ref )
Note how we “ tie the knot ” in the let expression .
This is the trick that ensures constant memory consumption , because every reference points back to the same place in memory .
Satisfied already ?
So what do we have ?
We have no duplication of data types , we can write general functions , and we can resolve the explicit referencing .
We can also easily write functions like unrefUser :: State Ref ->
User Ref ->
User
Id , which transform just a part of the state .
But writing unrefState is very tedious when the State becomes more complex .
Each of the other unrefSomething functions are very similar , but need to be written anyways .
This is unsatisfactory .
What we want , is a generic function , something like
gunref :: State Ref -> a Ref -> a Id
which , given a state with explicit references , replaces all explicit references in the first argument ( which could be State Ref or User Ref or anything like that ) with implicit ones .
This function can not exist , because we would not know anything about a and b .
But maybe we can do this :
gunref :: ( Data ( a Id ) , Data ( a Ref ) ) => State Ref -> a Ref -> a Id
Typeable and Data
Before being able to do so , we need to derive Data for our types .
We can start with
deriving instance Data ( User Id ) deriving instance Data ( User Ref ) deriving instance Data ( Computer Id ) deriving instance Data ( Computer Ref ) deriving instance Data ( State Id ) deriving instance Data ( State Ref
but that will complain about missing Typeable instances .
Unfortunately , ghc ’s deriver for Typeable ( even the stand - alone - one ) , does not handle our peculiar kind , so we need to do it by hand .
With some help from quicksilver on #haskell , I got it to work :
instance Typeable1 ref =>
Typeable ( User ref ) where typeOf _ = mkTyConApp ( mkTyCon " User " ) [ typeOf1 ( undefined :: ref ( ) ) ] instance Typeable1 ref =>
Typeable ( Computer ref ) where typeOf _ = mkTyConApp ( mkTyCon " Computer " ) [ typeOf1 ( undefined :: ref ( ) ) ] instance Typeable1 ref =>
Typeable ( State ref ) where typeOf _ = mkTyConApp ( mkTyCon " State " ) [ typeOf1 ( undefined :: ref ( ) ) ]
everywhere is not enough
Turning to the documentation of Data .
Generics , I notice with some disappointment that there is no function that is able to change a type – they all seem to replace a value by another value of the same type .
But the functions gfoldl and gunfold sounded like they could be used for this .
Warning :
What comes now is a very non-haskellish hack that subverts the type system , just to get the job done .
Please read it with a healthy portion of distrust .
If you know of a cleaner way of doing that , please tell me !
Wrapped Data
I want to do some heavy type hackery , so I need to disable haskell ’s type system .
There is Data .
Dynamic , but not even that is enough , as we need to carry a type ’s Data instance around as well .
So let ’s wrap that up :
data AData where AData :: Data a => a ->
AData instance Show AData where show ( AData a ) = " < " ++ show ( typeOf a ) ++ " > " fromADataE :: forall b. Data b => AData -> b fromADataE ( AData d ) = case cast d of Just v -> v Nothing -> error $ " Type error , trying to convert " ++ show ( typeOf d ) ++ " to " ++ show ( typeOf ( undefined :: b ) ) ++ " . "
There is also a function that converts an AData back to a normal type , if possible .
If it ’s not possible , then there is a bug in our code , so we give an informative error message .
AData transformers
Similar to everywhere , we want to have transformers that combinable .
They need to have the change to convert an arbitrary value , but also signal that they could not convert something ( and this something has to be recursed into ) .
I came up with this :
type ADataT = AData ->
Maybe AData extADT :: forall a b. ( Data a , Data b ) => ADataT -> ( a -> b ) -> ADataT extADT at t a@( AData v ) = case cast v of Just x ->
Just ( AData ( t x ) ) Nothing -> at a doNothing :: ADataT doNothing = const Nothing
ADataT is the type for such a transformer .
doNothing will not transform anything , and extADT can be used to add any function to the list of tried transformers , in the spirit of extT .
The ugly part
To apply such a transformer , I want to use this function , which I ’ll describe in the code comments :
everywhereADT :: forall a b. ( Data a , Data b ) => ADataT -> a -> b -- first check if we can transform this value already everywhereADT f v = case f ( AData v ) of -- if so , coerce it to the users ’ requested type , which hopefully goes well Just r -> fromADataE r -- if not , we need to recurse into the data structure Nothing -> recursed -- for that , we first need to figure out the arguments to the -- constructor .
We store them in the untyped list where args :: [ AData ] ( Const args ) = gfoldl k z v -- gfoldl lets us have a look at each argument .
We wrap it in AData -- and append it to the list k ( Const args ) arg = Const ( AData arg : args ) z start = Const [ ] --
We need the data constructor of the input data type .
If the user did not want -- it to be transformed , it will be the same c = toConstr v --
To give better error messages , we make sure that the outmost type constructor -- of the requested type actually has the data constructor we were given .
Otherwise -- gunfold will complain in a non-helpful way input_type = dataTypeRep ( constrType c ) output_type = dataTypeRep ( dataTypeOf ( undefined :: b ) ) recursed = if input_type /= output_type then error $ " Can not convert < " ++ show input_type ++ " > "++ " to < " ++ show output_type ++ " >. " -- the types match , so we assemble the output type , using gunfold else snd ( gunfold k' z' c ) k ' :: forall b r . Data b => ( [ AData ] , b -> r ) -> ( [ AData ] , r ) -- we start by reversing the input list z ' start = ( reverse args , start ) -- then we call us recursively on the argument and feed the result -- to the output constructor k' ( ( AData a ) : args , append ) = ( args , append ( everywhereADT f a ) ) --
Used for folding ( we do n’t need to retain the original constructor ) data Const a b = Const a
What a beast !
But surprisingly , it works .
Here are some examples .
Note that I always have to specify the requested output type :
bool2Int :: Bool ->
Int bool2Int False = 0 bool2Int True = 1 * Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) True :: Int 1 * Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) True :: ( ) *** Exception : Type error , trying to convert Int to ( ) .
* Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) ( True , False ) :: ( Int , Int ) ( 1,0 ) * Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) ( [ True , False ] , True , ( ) ) :: ( [ Int ] , Int , ( ) ) ( [ 1,0 ] , 1 , ( ) ) * Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) ( [ True , False ] , True , ( ) ) :: [ ( ) ]
*** Exception : Can not convert to .
* Main > everywhereADT ( doNothing `extADT` bool2Int ) [ True ] :: [ Bool ] [***
Exception : Type error , trying to convert Int to Bool .
I hope this code does not inflict too much pain on any Haskell - loving reader .
I know I violated the language , but I did n’t know how to do it better ( at least not without using Template Haskell ) .
I also know that this is not very good performance wide :
Every single value in the input will be deconstructed , type - compared several times and re-assembled .
If that is an issue , then this function should only be used for prototyping .
Almost done
To apply this to our state , we only need to glue it to our lookup functions from above :
gunref :: ( Data ( a Id ) , Data ( a Ref ) ) => State Ref -> a Ref -> a
Id gunref s w = let unrefState = gunref ' unrefState s in gunref ' unrefState w gunref ' :: ( Data ( a Id ) , Data ( a Ref ) ) => State Id -> a Ref -> a Id gunref ' unrefState = everywhereADT unref ' where unref ' = doNothing `extADT` unrefUserRef unrefState `extADT` unrefComputerRef unrefState
Now we have a generic unreferencer .
I set the type a bit more specific than necessary , to make it safe to use ( under the assumption that the list of lookup functions is complete and will not leave any Ref in the output ) .
* Main > testState State [ User {user
Id = 0 , uses = [ Ref 1 ] } ]
[ Computer {computer Id = 1 , owner = Ref 0} ] * Main > gunref testState testState State [ User {user
Id = 0 , uses = [ Id ( Computer {computer Id = 1 , owner = Id ( User {user Id = 0 , uses = [ Id ( Computer {computer Id = 1 , owner = Id ( User {user Id = 0 , uses = ..
Oh , and by the way , if you want to test this code , you ’ll need at least :
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable , FlexibleInstances , GADTs , FlexibleContexts , StandaloneDeriving , ScopedTypeVariables #-}
An alternative to CCS is to burn less coal .
Combined heat and power ( CHP ) generation involves capturing the waste heat from power stations and pumping this hot water to neighbouring houses in district heating systems .
Danish CHP plant is over 90 % energy efficient
Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) involves removing carbon dioxide from the combustion stream of fossil fuel powered generating plant and sequestering it under ground in water - bearing geological strata .
The objective is to reduce or eliminate CO 2 emissions from electricity generation with focus on coal - fired plant .
CCS has three main elements :
Capture of CO 2 either pre- or post - combustion
either pre- or post - combustion Transport to burial site , normally by pipeline
Compression and burial in geological strata
The process involves large - scale engineering work , is expensive and uses a significant proportion of the power generated by the plant .
The IPCC estimate that the energy cost is somewhere between 20 and 25 % .
In the UK the average efficiency of coal - fired plant is 37 % , with 63 % of the energy lost as waste heat .
With CCS the energy efficiency drops to 30 % assuming 20 % of the power produced goes to bury CO 2 rather than to power society .
An alternative to CCS is to burn less coal .
Combined heat and power ( CHP ) generation involves capturing the waste heat from power stations and pumping this hot water to neighbouring houses in district heating systems .
Danish CHP plant is over 90 % energy efficient .
Thus 3 times as much energy is extracted per unit of fossil fuel in CHP compared with normal plant fitted with CCS and this may equate to 67 % reduction in coal use .
Energy costs should therefore be reduced at national and individual level and CO 2 emissions reduced by similar amount .
In Denmark , a certain CHP plant is also fitted with CCS .
This is truly the belt and braces approach to environmental care .
Jevon ’s paradox once again rears its ugly head .
Governments must therefore legislate for energy efficient homes and appliances to avoid pointless waste of cheap energy that CHP may provide .
The obvious draw back with CHP is the engineering work required to build new plant and install district - heating systems in major cities .
Given the political will , the Danes , Dutch and Fins have proven this is possible to achieve .
Conventional CCS is quite distinct from CCS - EOR ( enhanced oil recovery ) .
This process is related to CCS with the difference that the CO 2 is buried in a mature oil field .
Given favourable geology , the CO 2 is miscible with the residual oil which may be mobilised towards production wells and which may otherwise have been left behind in the depleted reservoir .
The primary objective here is to increase oil recovery .
The additional oil produced may pay for the exercise though economics may be marginal depending upon the setting .
The sequestered CO 2 tends roughly to balance the additional CO 2 from combustion of the extra oil produced .
Most existing CCS - EOR projects utilise natural sources of CO 2 produced from geological strata and do not yet use CO 2 from power generating plant .
StatoilHydro ’s flagship Sleipner CCS project also buries natural CO 2 co-produced with oil and natural gas from the Sleipner Field .
One report suggested that this CO 2 may be leaking back to surface , but recent work by Statoil suggests it is not .

The publication of The Satanic Verses in September 1988 caused immediate controversy in the Islamic world because of what was perceived as an irreverent depiction of the prophet Muhammad .
The title refers to a disputed Muslim tradition that is related in the book .
According to this tradition , Muhammad ( Mahound in the book ) added verses ( sura ) to the Qur'an accepting three goddesses who used to be worshipped in Mecca as divine beings .
According to the legend , Muhammad later revoked the verses , saying the devil tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans ( hence the " Satanic " verses ) .
However , the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the Archangel Gibreel .
The book was banned in many countries with large Muslim communities .
On 14 February 1989 , a fatwā requiring Rushdie 's execution was proclaimed on Radio Tehran by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the spiritual leader of Iran at the time , calling the book " blasphemous against Islam " ( chapter IV of the book depicts the character of an Imam in exile who returns to incite revolt from the people of his country with no regard for their safety ) .
A bounty was offered for Rushdie 's death , and he was thus forced to live under police protection for years afterward .
On 7 March 1989 , the United Kingdom and Iran broke diplomatic relations over the Rushdie controversy .
Drug smugglers successfully build ramps to jump border fence John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Replace posts with cardboard
The planned 670 - mile fence along the US border with Mexico has proven remarkably ineffective at deterring or stopping illegal crossers to the United States , advocates and critics of the fence admit .
Moreover , the fence 's construction remains in limbo in numerous areas , where legal , political and engineering obstacles have brought its implementation to a halt .
And , where the 600 miles of fencing are already up , along the borders of California , Arizona and New Mexico , " smugglers and illegal immigrants continue to breach the fencing that is up , forcing Border Patrol agents and contractors to return again and again for repairs , " the Wall Street Journal noted Wednesday .
" The smugglers build ramps to drive over fencing , dig tunnels under it , or use blow torches to slice through .
They cut down metal posts used as vehicle barriers and replace them with dummy posts , made from cardboard . "
The " rough " measure by which the Border Patrol keeps track of illegal crossings was down 18 % for 2008 .
Crossings appear down in parts of Arizona .
But a May report by Congress ' research service found a " strong indication " that crossers had simply found new routes .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano once famously quipped that a 50 - foot barrier would simply spur the invention of a 51 - foot ladder .
Staunch advocates of the fence admit that it does n't stop illegal crossings .
" It 's not the whole fix , not even most of the fix , " Steven Camarota , research director at the Center for Immigration Studies , told the Journal .
Opponents say the fence prevents animals from reaching their original habitats and is a taxpayer " boondoggle , " a gross expenditure of taxpayer dollars with little tangible results .
The fence remains incomplete along about 70 miles along the Rio Grande , in Texas .
It 's encountered myriad problems : environmentalists want a review to protect endangered or rare species ; property owners have raised their hackles over eminent domain seizure of their land ; and engineers have had trouble keeping floods from compromising the soundness of the barrier .
" It does become frustrating , " a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol was quoted as saying .
President Obama 's position on the fence and whether it should be completed remains unclear .
He voted for it in the Senate but expressed concern about whether it " makes sense " to have a barrier everywhere along the planned route .
Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano is also said to be a skeptic .
But a White House spokesman says construction will continue .
" Mr. Obama supports the fence as long as it is one part of a larger strategy on border security that includes more boots on the ground and increased use of technology , " a White House spokesman told the Journal .

Few conversations about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict seem restrained by reason ; worse , someone inevitably tosses out the word “ Zionism ” in some form or another .
Things generally go to hell after that .
“ Antisemitism ” follows closely on the invocation of the dreaded Zionist , and from then on the “ conversation ” too often becomes a matter of person A proving that person B hates Jews and person B either defending himself or cloaking actual antisemitism in the guise of being anti-Zionist .
All sorts of proofs and arguments follow from both sides .
I like to call it the good Jew / bad Jew routine .
It was recently suggested that a glossary of terms should be developed .
Unfortunately , many of these terms are subjective and a true glossary would need to be provided by each user of the word .
But the call to duty was raised and i’ve supplemented what i already knew with some quality time at Mid-East Web , the Jewish Virtual Library , and E - Zion .
I purposefully did not visit “ anti- Zionist ” resources because i do n’t really believe that there ’s a Zionist in my closet or that a shadowy cabal of powerful , Jewish bankers is plotting the domination / destruction of the planet .
I do n’t believe in Leprechauns either .
Originally , the request for a glossary covered all the various modifiers that might be put before the noun “ Jew ” ( which may , in itself , be offensive to some … but i’ve failed to find a connotationless moniker for the situation ) .
A secular Jew might similar to a Christmas / Easter Christian .
He would be a believer , but would not define himself by his religious belief .
The same definition applies to a “ cultural Jew ” .
A secular Jew might also be a person of Jewish extraction .
There is debate within the Jewish community as to what it means to be a Jew ; many of these labels come from within Judaism rather than without .
But i do n’t have the time and you do n’t have the patience for the kind of reading necessary to explain all that .
An “ observant Jew ” is just what it sounds like : someone who observes the calender , dietary restrictions , festivals , etc. of Judaism .
But being an observant Jew falls into a multitude of categories too .
Reform , orthodox , ultra - orthodox , etc .
And none of these variations on a Semitic theme have anything to do with politics .
A secular Jew might well be very conservative , politically , and there ’s nothing that says an observant Jew cannot be a flaming liberal Defeatocrat … i know at least one of those .
All of the above exist in a spectrum , and the spectrum is more important than the label .
Just because one is Jewish does not mean that one must hold certain political beliefs .
Labels are useful until they trap us .
For example , most would probably think that the ultra- orthodox Jewish community is very ‘ Zionist ’ ; the labels fit together nicely .
But it ’s wrong .
The ultra-orthodox community is often the most anti-Zionist section of the Jewish community .
Which brings us to today ’s loaded word .
I ’ve read a lot on this now , much of it overlapping and in basic agreement , and it ’s as confusing as confusing gets .
We ’ve reduced the word “ Zionist ” in a manner similar to our reduction of the word “ Communist ” to mean Stalin ’s USSR .
There are enough twists , turns , and schisms in the Zionist movement that it would be a good subject for a Russian novel .
You ’d need that kind of page count to do it justice .
“ Zionism ” was coined in 1891 by Nathan Birnbaum , but Theodor Herzl founded the Zionist movement in 1897 .
There is no official Zionist ideology , sorry .
But basically Zionist ideology boils down to the belief that the Jews are a people or a nation like anyone else , and that they have the right , and should , gather together in a national homeland .
The idea of the Jews as distinct people is not entirely religious .
It is also a product of the 19th Century enlightenment , which also gave us the full flowering of nationalism .
European Jews gained their first measure of freedom ; some left Judaism , some converted , but there was still a sense that they would be Jews no matter what they did .
( Here i call philosophical bullshit .
Of course the first generation would always be Jews , just like first generation immigrants are more old country than new , while their grandchildren are old country in name only . )
The idea of a Jewish nation fit nicely with the the ideas of German racists and gave them an excuse to persecute .
But if the Jews were a people , they lacked an actual nation .
Zionism is the ideology to achieve the nation .
The late 1800 ’s were not a good time to be Jewish in Russia .
Leon Pinsker was originally an assimilationist , at least until the Odessa pogrom of 1871 .
He changed his mind and penned Auto - Emancipation .
Pinsker thought that Argentina would make a nice homeland , but his fellow Russians liked the idea of Palestine much better .
The idea at this point was to organize and lobby the great powers to grant the Jews a homeland , a movement that became known as political Zionism .
Herzl was all for political Zionism and he had the power and connections to pursue it .
The first Zionist Congress was willing to settle for Uganda or Cyprus , but the Russian Zionists would have none of it and declined the offer .
Herzl , and other Europeans were n’t actually looking for new digs themselves … they were just trying to be helpful to their “ brethren to the East ” .
All this was happening at the same time as political philosophy in Russia was tending towards Marxism and revolution , and Zionism was pretty entangled with that process .
( Is this complicated enough for everyone ? )
Herzl died about the same time that any hope for political Zionism ended .
At the time , Russian Zionists were mostly members of the SDLP ( the party that would later split into Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks .
Unfortunately , the antisemitism that would come to characterize Russian Communism was already evident .
Ber Borochov left the SDLP and founded his own party , Poalei Tziyon , which rested on a synthesis of Marxism and Zionism .
Borochov theorized along Marxist lines but ran into the same problem as other Russians : how do you throw a prolaterian revolution without a proletariat ?
Simple , you get a new country and build a proletariat … no revolution needed .
There ended up being multiple forms and groups of socialist Zionists .
Arthur Ruppin ( an ethnic Pole born in German territory and trained as an economist ) was sent to examine the Palestinian situation in 1907 .
His ideas led to the kibbutz , which solved some practical problems of settlement and dovetailed nicely with the socialist ideals of the settlers .
Where the colonial model of the first aliya failed the kibbutz succeeded .
It also made a handy place to hide arms and organize defense force .
Combining the remnants of political Zionism with the practical , settler approach became known as synthetic Zionism ; it is generally credited with producing the Balfour Declaration .
Now begins the growth of serious conflict between the Arabs and the Jews of Palestine ; WWI ; and the British fiddling with their mandate in the post war years .
Mostly it was n’t pretty and grew ever more violent and unyielding .
Yet another split developed between those who wanted to work with the British and those wanting to fight whoever got in the way .
Enter Ze ’ev Vladomir Jabotinsky .
He formulated the idea of a Jewish defense force that would show Arab neighbors that the Jews could not be pushed into the sea .
When the British balked at overseeing such a force , Jabotinsky went ahead with it anyhow .
He also founded the revisionist Zionist movement in 1925 with fellow radicals who disagreed with the socialist Zionists and were bitter over the British subdivision of Palestine .
The main tenent of revisionist Zionism is a claim to both sides of the Jordan river .
The revisionist did n’t gain much power in the official Zionist council .
The labor Zionists under David Ben-Gurien held the real power .
The two groups cooperated at times and fought each other just as often .
Labor basically controlled the Israeli government until after the Six Days war , after which the revisionists were allowed to participate in the government .
The Yom Kippur war broke the hold of Labor over the Israeli government .
It soon found itself in the minority , replaced by militant , religious Zionists and the Likud party , which inherited revisionist Zionism .
At this point , Likud revisionist Zionism basically represents the ideology to the world .
It is through Likud policies – the settlements in particular – that Zionism has taken on its current connotations .
Obviously it is a form of Zionism ; just as obviously it is not the only form of Zionism .
Unfortunately it portrays itself as true Zionism , similar to our own politicians making pronouncements about the “ real ” America .
I hope that i disappointed the black and white crowd , as you suck anyhow and i’m far less worried about Zionists in my closet than i am about you shouting your proclamations far and wide .
And one thing is abundantly clear after this headache inducing experience : the word Zionist is thrown around with far too much abandon by people who have no idea what they ’re talking about .
I realize that some of those people will be here any minute to rant from one side or the other ; most of them wo n’t even have read the above .
Fuck it , i’ll light the fuse .

IanOS is an experimental 64 - bit operating system written from scratch as a learning experience .
The source code is available online and the creator of the OS has made some detailed documentation available to go with the source code .
This is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to venture into writing a 64 - bit OS .
The author makes his intention about this OS clear “ I never had any intention of producing a true OS .
There are plenty of those about and it would be a very foolish , or vain , person who thought that they could compete with the likes of FreeBSD and Linux .
But my interest in computers is n’t practical ; I just find programming them , particularly at this level , to be a supremely satisfying intellectual pursuit ” .
Writing an operating system from ground up is no small feat .
It involves understanding the CPU architecture , structure of a boot sector , memory management , device driver etc .
When a newbie decides to learn how to write a hobby OS , the usual advice from the bearded OS gurus is “ Poke around Linux kernel ” .
But the inherent problem with that approach is the lack of proper documentation and the overwhelming size of the project .
IanOS is a 64 - bit operating system , that was created for the sole purpose of understanding the initial steps of creating an OS .
The disclaimer on the project page reads :
only by a very wide stretch of the imagination could my system be described as an ‘ operating system ’ , but it does boot , multi-tasks simple programs , and even has rudimentary keyboard and IDE hard disk device drivers ”
The project page has clear instructions on how to get started .
The author recommends a list of tools that he used while developing this OS and some links to the required documentation .
Tools :
Host OS – Any flavor of Linux
Emulator / Debugger – AMD ’s SimNow , qemu
Compilers – gcc
Editors – Hex editor and an IDE
Disk image – mtools
The documentation page is constantly growing and has very specific information about the source code .
This definitely makes it easy to follow the code and understand the different sections .
It is a perfect place for anyone who is waiting to get started on writing a OS or simply to understand the low - level intricacies of an operating system .
Another great resource for understanding the OS internals and Computer Architecture is Gustavo Duarte ’s articles on System Internals .
These are some well - written series of articles that explain in detail the Memory Management , CPU Cache , CPU Privileges , Kernel Boot Process and other OS relevant subjects .
Galway ultra runner Richard Donovan made history yesterday as the world 's first athlete to run seven consecutive marathons on seven continents in less than seven days .
The 42 - year - old father of one successfully completed a gruelling endurance race that would test the physical and mental prowess of the world 's strongest men .
Aside from running more than the traditional marathon distance of 26.2 miles a day , simply flying around the world in less than a week -- logging up 26,719 air miles -- is a feat that few sane people would dare to consider .
He had to contend with - 20C temperatures when he began the event in Antarctica last Saturday .
Richard was one of the few passengers who managed to fly out of snowbound London on Monday only to face a scorching heatwave when he crossed the finish line in Sydney yesterday .
His ' marathon ' marathon took him to Antarctica , Cape Town , Dubai , London , Toronto , Santiago and Sydney in just five days , 10 hours and eight minutes .
His only food and rest stops were aboard an airplane , said event co-ordinator and friend Ferghal Murphy .
" He was going from cold to hot to cold .
He 's literally been on an airplane seat when he's not running and there 's lots of sleep deprivation , " he said .
But Richard , who is the chairman of UltraRunning Ireland , is already a world record - breaker in the field of ultra distance running .
He became the first runner in the world to run a marathon at both the North and South Poles in 2002 and has run in some of the most unforgiving climates and challenging geographies in the world , including the Sahara Desert , Mount Everest , the Inca Trail and the Amazon jungle .
His motivation for his latest odyssey was to create awareness of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and to promote the Irish charity Goal 's aim of sending international peacekeepers to the region .
Richard said his latest run was also a personal achievement .
" I 've run at both poles , and in deserts , mountains , jungle and various other terrain and climatic conditions .
I think the Antarctic challenge is the last frontier , " he said .

On the foggy morning of Saturday , July 28 , 1945 , Lt. Colonel William Smith was piloting a U.S. Army B - 25 bomber through New York City when he crashed into the Empire State Building at 9:45 a.m , killing 14 people .
Fog
Lt. Colonel William Smith was on his way to Newark Airport to pick up his commanding officer , but for some reason , he showed up over LaGuardia Airport and asked for a weather report .
Because of the poor visibility , the LaGuardia tower wanted him to land , but Smith requested and received permission from the military to continue on to Newark .
The last transmission from the LaGuardia tower to the plane was a foreboding warning : " From where I 'm sitting , I ca n't see the top of the Empire State Building . "
Avoiding Skyscrapers
Confronted with dense fog , Smith dropped the bomber low to regain visibility , where he found himself in the middle of Manhattan , surrounded by skyscrapers .
At first , the bomber was headed directly for the New York Central Building ( now called the Helmsley Building ) but at the last minute , Smith was able to bank west and miss it .
Unfortunately , this put him in line for another skyscraper .
Smith managed to miss several skyscrapers until he was headed for the Empire State Building .
At the last minute , Smith tried to get the bomber to climb and twist away , but it was too late .
The Crash
At 9:49 a.m. , the ten - ton , B - 25 bomber smashed into the north side of the Empire State Building .
The majority of the plane hit the 79th floor , creating a hole in the building 18 feet wide and 20 feet high .
The plane 's high - octane fuel exploded , hurtling flames down the side of the building and inside through hallways and stairwells all the way down to the 75th floor .
World War II had caused many to shift to a six - day work week ; thus there were many people at work in the Empire State Building that Saturday .
The plane crashed into the offices of the War Relief Services of the National Catholic Welfare Conference .
Catherine O'Connor described the crash :
The plane exploded within the building .
There were five or six seconds — I was tottering on my feet trying to keep my balance — and three - quarters of the office was instantaneously consumed in this sheet of flame .
One man was standing inside the flame .
I could see him .
It was a co-worker , Joe Fountain .
His whole body was on fire .
I kept calling to him , " Come on , Joe ; come on , Joe . "
He walked out of it .
Joe Fountain died several days later .
Eleven of the office workers were burned to death , some still sitting at their desks , others while trying to run from the flames .
Damage From the Crash
One of the engines and part of the landing gear hurtled across the 79th floor , through wall partitions and two firewalls , and out the south wall 's windows to fall onto a 12 - story building across 33rd Street .
The other engine flew into an elevator shaft and landed on an elevator car .
The car began to plummet , slowed somewhat by emergency safety devices .
Miraculously , when help arrived at the remains of the elevator car in the basement , the two women inside the car were still alive .
Some debris from the crash fell to the streets below , sending pedestrians scurrying for cover , but most fell onto the building 's setbacks on the fifth floor .
The bulk of the wreckage , however , remained stuck in the side of the building .
After the flames were extinguished and the remains of the victims removed , the rest of the wreckage was removed through the building .
Death Toll
The plane crash killed 14 people ( 11 office workers and the three crewmen ) plus injured 26 others .
Though the integrity of the Empire State Building was not affected , the cost of the damage done by the crash was $ 1 million .

THE WAR ON DRUGS AS THE HEALTH OF THE STATE
by Bob Black
No one ever made a more important observation in seven words than Randolph Bourne once did : " War is the health of the state " ( Resek 1964 : 71 ) .
War has been the main motor for the extension of state power in Europe for a thousand years ( Tilly 1992 ) , and not only in Europe .
War enlarges the state and increases its wealth and its powers .
It promotes obedience and justifies the repression of dissent , redefined as disloyalty .
It relieves social tensions by redirecting them outwards at an enemy state which is , of course , doing exactly the same thing with all the same consequences .
From the state 's perspective , there is only one thing wrong with wars : they end .
That wars end is ultimately more important than whether they end in victory or defeat .
Occasionally defeat spells destruction for states , as for the Ottoman and Austro - Hungarian Empires after World War I , but not usually , and even if it does , they give way to other states .
The state - system not only endures , it prevails .
Usually war is well worth the risk -- not to the combatants or the suffering civilians , of course : but well worth the risk to the state .
Peace is something else again .
The immediate consequence may be a recession or a depression , as after the American Revolution and World War I , whose hardships are all the more galling when they fall upon the population which " won " the war and naively supposes it will share in the fruits of a victory which belongs to its state , not to the people .
The regime may artificially prolong the wartime climate of repression and sacrifice , as did the United States by working up the Red Scare after World War I , but soon the people crave what Warren Harding promised them , a return to normalcy .
The vanquished , of course , rarely fare as well as occupied Japan and Germany did after World War II , but even then the Germans initially experienced famine .
There have been epochs in which certain states were almost always at war , such as Republican Rome , whose oligarchs , as Livy ( 1960 ) repeatedly demonstrates , were well aware of the way war was a safety - valve for dissipating class conflict .
Colonial wars well serve the purpose since they are fought far from the home country and usually waged against antagonists who are , however gallant , greatly inferior militarily .
The British Empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is a good example .
Engorged with the wealth of commercial capitalism ( soon to be unimaginably enlarged by the Industrial Revolution ) , secure in its insularity , shielded by the world 's greatest navy , with a robust and ruthless ruling class wise to the ways of statecraft , the British State could afford a war anytime it needed one .
The cannon fodder was easy to come by .
There were outright mercenaries such as Hessions on the market .
And yesterday 's enemies were today 's troops .
The Irish , repeatedly crushed in the seventeenth century , were one source .
Starting in 1746 the British annihilated the society and culture of the Scottish Highlanders , then recruited regiments from the survivors .
They would repeat these cost - effective methods in India , in Africa , everywhere .
And then there were the English sources of expendibles : the peasants forced off the land by enclosure of the commons , and the urban poor .
They would not be missed , and there were always more where they came from .
But times have changed .
Some states can possibly carry on in the old way for awhile -- maybe Serbia , North Korea , Iraq -- but the United States cannot , for at least two reasons :
We are too squeamish , and we are too poor .
Too squeamish in the sense that , as Saddam Hussein crowed before the second Gulf War , America is a society which cannot tolerate 10,000 dead .
He was right , although that did him no good , since he was unable to inflict 10,000 or even 1,000 deaths .
Grenada and Panama were larks , but even such two - bit gang wars as Lebanon and Somalia were not , and nobody has any stomach for war in Haiti or Bosnia .
Americans are fast losing their taste for media wars , to say nothing of real wars .
And too poor for any war long enough to put a lasting blip in any President 's ratings .
The attack on Iraq was the urning - point .
As adroitly handled as the manipulation of the mass mind was , Americans only went along with the war on the condition that the " Allies " pay for it .
Even the most dim - witted are dimly aware that the lion 's share of their Federal taxes goes to pay for war debts and military spending they never reaped any benefits from .
The trade - off for lives in a high - tech , media - savvy , photogenic war is money .
It costs more , immensely more , than war ever has .
But America does not have more , immensely more wealth than it ever has .
It has less , and less and less all the time .
Even with the massed forces of ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN and all the rest of the mainstream media behind him ( Black 1992 : ch. 9 ) , and despite an overwhelming victory which owed as much to luck as skill , George Bush became the first President to win a war and then lose an election -- to a pot- smoking , womanizing draft - dodger .
Thus the regime is caught in what the Marxists used to call a " contradiction . "
It needs war , for war is the health of the state , but ( with occasional ephemeral exceptions ) it cannot afford either to win wars or lose them .
But what kind of a war is it possible to wage , at not too intolerable a cost , which avoids these twin pitfalls -- a war which can not be won or lost ?
The " War on Drugs . "
Which is not a real war , of course , but what the Germans call a Sitzkrieg , a phony war .
Formerly they sold us the war to end all wars .
Now they sell us an endless war .
The March of Dimes is an instructive precedent .
The March of Dimes raised lots of money which ( what was left of it after most of it went for advertising and administration ) financed research on a polio vaccine .
Then came catastrophe : Jonas Salk found a polio vaccine .
So , its purpose accomplished , the March of Dimes went out of business , right ?
( Just kidding . )
No , the organization moved on to an amorphous quest , to conquer " birth defects , " of which there are so many varieties that the March of Dimes can count on doing business for many years to come .
Some people say " the ends justify the means , " others say they do n't .
The March of Dimes has transcended the contradiction :
The means justify the end .
Such is the utility , to the state , of the War on Drugs .
It can not be lost , for there is no enemy to lose it to .
And for countless reasons it can not be won .
The government cannot inderdict more than a fraction of the cocaine , heroin , marijuana and other drugs which , by illegalizing them , the government has raised the price on to the point that they are well worth smuggling in .
And some of the dope , such as marijuana and opium , is easily produced domestically .
Many tens of millions of Americans have indulged in illegal drugs , including the President .
Their kids see no reason not to try what their parents did , regardless what the parents are preaching now .
Children tend not to heed their parents when they know they are lying .
Besides , there is always alcohol .
And in the suburbs as in the ghetto , legalizing drugs has jacked up their prices so far that busting drug dealers has no " supply - side " effect .
Taking a drug dealer off the street just opens up a vacancy for another entrepreneur .
Indeed , it is standard practice for dealers to get their competitors busted to take that competitive edge .
But it makes no more difference who is dealing the drugs than it makes who is running the state .
Indeed , they may be the same people !
The Drug War is the health of the state .
Because it is only a phony war , the War on Drugs is fiscally manageable .
The government can spend as much or as little as it likes , since the result is always the same .
Even the out - of - pocket costs are disguised , divided as they are among Federal , state and local governments and confused with funding for law enforcement .
The single greatest expense , prisons , is one which most people mistake for just about the best thing the government does for them .
Underpinning this error is a misconception about what the product of the criminal justice system is .
It is not crime control , for even if that could be measured with any accuracy , there is no evidence that law enforcement in general reduces crime ( Jacob 1984 ) .
The product is crime rates ( Black 1970 ) , which are a function , not of the amount of crime , but of the amount of law enforcement .
Thus the authorities can manufacture a " crime wave " if they want more money , or ease up on enforcement if they want to take credit for doing exactly the opposite -- a reverse Catch - 22 , a no-lose situation .
Aside from themselves and their higher - ups , the only beneficiaries of those 100,000 more police that President Clinton will put on the streets will be Dunkin ' Donut franchisees .
What 's more , to some extent the War on Drugs pays for itself .
Just as armies used to subsist largely by " living off the land , " pillaging the districts they passed through , so the drug warriors cram their coffers with booty from forfeitures .
And that 's just on the formal , legal level .
Off the books , of course , the police have always seized a lot more drugs than ever found their way to the evidence room .
The dealers and junkies are unlikely to complain .
( The classic scenario : a cop makes an illegal search on the street .
He finds something .
He asks , courteously , " Is this yours ? "
The answer is always no . )
Some dope the police sell on their own account .
Some they use themselves .
And some they use for " flaking " ( planting drugs on suspected drug dealers ) and " padding " ( adding more dope to what was found to turn a misdemeanor into a felony ) ( Knapp Commission 1973 : 103-104 ) .
In still another way the War on Drugs offers one of the benefits of a real war without its costs and risks .
Every real war is a civil liberties holocaust ( Murphy 1973 ) .
Even on the formal , legal level , national security -- a so - called compelling state interest -- tends to trump fundamental rights , at least until the shooting stops .
Meanwhile patriotic vigilantes carry out the castrations , the lynchings , the arsons -- the dirty work too dirty for the state to do , even in a supposed wartime emergency , but not too dirty for the state to wink at afterwards .
The United States during World War I and the Red Scare is one example ; the Italy which the liberals let the Fascists take over , after letting them extralegally smash the socialists , communists and anarchists , is another .
But peace returns and the legal ground lost is mostly recovered , or even more ground is taken .
Once the state has demolished the radical opposition irreparably , it may well restore constitutional rights to the impotent remnants and bask in its own announced glory , parading its tolerance once it does n't matter any more .
The phony war is much more effective .
It can not be conducted without massive invasions of liberty and property .
The single most important right implicated , and endangered , by the War on Drugs is the Fourth Amendment , which forbids unreasonable searches and seizures .
This body of law effectively began during Prohibition , and today it is , as Professor Fred Cohen says , " driven by drugs . "
The rights of everyone are defined by the rights the judiciary grudgingly grants to drug offenders .
Other rights are reduced too .
Under the forfeiture laws , private property is taken without due process or just compensation .
Applied to Native Americans and others , drug laws interfere with freedom of religion ; so does the common practice of forcing drunk drivers into " rehabs " for indoctrination in the religious tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous .
Even the campaign against gun ownership is an indirect consequence of the War on Drugs .
Participants in the drug trade have to enforce their own contracts , since the state will not .
And prohibition has made drugs very valuable commodities : in the inner cities , by far the most valuable commodities .
Meanwhile , drug addicts rob and steal to support their habits .
The result is an arms race and the clamor for gun control .
One prohibition leads to another .
For the criminal , the ultimate challenge is the perfect crime .
For the state , it is the perfect law .
Is it prohibition ?
Maybe not .
Drug prohibition is today much more popular than alcohol prohibition ever was , but within living memory , decriminalization was a serious possibility .
It might become so again if the anti-drug hysteria continues to rise till it reaches a level impossible to sustain .
And it probably will rise , because the drug war has been institutionalized .
Various agencies and organizations have a vested interest in its unlimited extension , although its unlimited extension is not only impossible , it would deprive the state of the great advantage of drug war over real war : its predictability and manageability .
As some organs of government grow and grow , there is less for others .
Since victory , like defeat , is impossible , there will never be a " peace dividend " to divvy up .
The state is probably already draining more wealth out of civil society than is consistent with the state 's own long - term interests .
If it takes more and more , the parasite will kill the host -- or the host will kill the parasite .
Eventually the state may succumb to its own success .
The state is huge .
And it is bureaucratic .
That means that it is intricately subdivided by function ( or by what was initially considered a division of labor by function : in fact , overlapping or competing jurisdiction is common and tends to increase over time ) .
Even if the left hand knows what the right hand is doing , it may not be able to do anything about it .
( Or else , in the words of the German proverb , " one hand washes the other . " )
Inter - agency cooperation becomes more difficult as it becomes more frequent and more necessary .
" The complexity of joint action " thwarts action , or its purpose ( Pressman & Wildavsky 1984 : ch. 5 ) .
It is very hard , administratively , to reduce a bureau 's budget , but easy to increase it .
Bureaus fiercely resist zero - based budgeting -- that is , starting from scratch , the annual rejustification of every line of the budget request -- as reinventing the wheel .
And it is difficult for higher - level authority to identify areas for cost reduction , if it even wants to , since the very raison d'etre of bureaucratic organization is deference to institutionalized expertise .
The easy way is to take the previous budget as presumptively the next one ; it is only departures from the status quo , not the status quo itself , which require justification .
The bureau , staffed with supposed experts , is itself the usual source of justifications for departures , and the departures are always in the direction of more money and more power for the bureau .
What goes for each bureau goes for all of them .
Thus government grows .
Referring to the way competition between workers lowers wages for all of them , Fredy Perlman ( 1969 : 17 ) observed : " The daily practice of all annuls the goals of each . "
Inter - agency interactions tend to have the same effect .
So does inter -agency competition for tax money .
The long - term implications for the War on Drugs are , for the state , ominous .
The more the state extends its control over society , the less control it has over itself .
The more the state absorbs society , the weaker the state as an entity responsive to a common will becomes .
It disintegrates into an authoritarian pluralism reminiscent of feudalism , but lacking its romantic charm .
Some agencies fatten off the War on Drugs , most do not .
The ones that do are the first to go their own way .
Attorney General Janet Reno had no control over the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms when it exterminated the Branch Davidians to win what amounted to nothing more than a gang war : but she took responsibility .
The Drug Enforcement Administration is likewise as independent as Hoover 's FBI or anybody 's CIA .
For the state , another inevitable adverse consequence of the Drug War is corruption ( Sisk 1982 ) .
Not that corruption is necessarily a bad thing for the state .
Up to a point , police shakedowns of drug dealers , bookies , pimps and other extralegal entrepreneurs benefit the state in more than one way .
The more the cops collect in payoffs and confiscations , the less they have to be paid in salaries .
Cops whose supervisors know they are on the take ( as they do , since they are on the take too ) ( Chambliss 1988 ) look the other way unless and until for some reason they need to get rid of a particular cop .
Corruption is thus a management tool .
But some cops get too greedy and go too far .
Most are " grass - eaters " ( bribe - takers ) who take what comes their way , but some are " meat - eaters " ( extortionists ) -- proactively corrupt -- who actively seek out or set up corruption opportunities , like the Special Investigative Unit detectives depicted in the movie Serpico ( Daley 1978 ; Knapp Commission 1973 ) .
The grass - eaters cover for the meat - eaters ( the " blue code of silence " ) since they all have something to hide .
Until recently , police administrators and their academic allies thought that they could keep corruption under control through various institutional reforms most of which were initially proposed by the Knapp Commission ( Sherman 1978 ) .
Maybe the reforms would have worked , except for one thing : the War on Drugs .
Corruption is making a comeback , even in the Knapp - reformed NYPD ( Dombrink 1988 ) .
Because penalties are much harsher and the profits of drug trafficking much higher , the protection the police sell commands a much higher price ( Sisk 1982 ) .
Drug - driven corruption is the growth sector of police misconduct ( Carter 1990 ) .
For the state , the problem with runaway corruption is that it cannot be confined to where its benefits exceed its costs .
The state needs the police for a modicum of selective law enforcement and , much more important , for social control -- as the occasion calls for , to break strikes , evict squatters , suppress riots , repress dissidents and keep traffic moving .
Even in our sophisticated times , when manipulation is the hippest of control strategies , there is often no substitute for the gun and the billy - club .
But a pervasively corrupt police force cannot be counted on when push comes to shove .
Meat - eaters cannot spare the time to enforce the law .
Officers on the nod are ineffective knights of the club .
Police who are enforcing drug laws are unavailable to enforce others .
There 's been a tremendous expansion in undercover police work in recent years ( Marx 1988 ) , inevitably accompanied by more corruption ( Girodo 1991 ) .
Police , as workers , are notoriously difficult to manage because they are usually out by themselves , unsupervised .
Detectives especially are in a position to be secretive about their activities ( Skolnick 1975 ; Daley 1978 ) , and more drug enforcement means more detective / undercover work .
These cops are pursuing their own agendas .
Why do dogs lick their balls ?
Because they can .
Corruption scandals demoralise the police and delegitimate the state .
Most people obey the law most of the time , not because they fear punishment if they do n't , but because they believe in the system .
As they cease to believe , they will cease to obey -- not only the laws that do n't matter ( like " do n't use drugs " ) but also the ones that do ( like " pay your taxes " ) .
And , ironically , crackdowns on corruption impair police effectiveness for other purposes ( Kornblum 1976 ) .
The state has overbuilt itself so heavily that the weight begins to crack the foundations .
It is not the sort of elephantiasis that can be eased by privatization .
It does n't matter who collects the garbage .
What matters is who has the guns .
Not " social pork " but the essence of sovereignty -- the means to enforce order -- is tumorous .
Thus the cancer is inoperable .
The state may die , fittingly , of an overdose .

Al - Jazeera ’s coverage of dictators is more honest than AP’s
This story provides a perfect demonstration of the corruption of the American media .
What else can it be called when Al - Jazeera ’s coverage of tinhorn dictators is more honest than the coverage provided by Associated Press .
Just look at the difference in how the two services each covered the recent … uh…election in North Korea :
The AlJazeera.net story :
Kim ‘ re - elected ’ in N Korea vote
Kim Jong-il , the North Korean leader , has been re-elected to the country ’s parliament in elections that have been closely watched for hints as to his possible successor .
In an unsurprising result Kim was re-elected by voters in Constituency 333 with 100 per cent support , the official KCNA news agency said on Monday .
The report said voters renewed their “ unshakable determination to devotedly safeguard ” the North Korean leader .
The Associated Press story :
North Korean leader Kim re-elected to parliament
Kim Jong
Il was unanimously re-elected to North Korea ’s rubber - stamp parliament , state media said Monday , in elections closely watched for signs of a political shift or hints the autocratic leader is grooming a successor .
All eligible voters in Constituency No. 333 cast ballots for Kim , renewing their “ unshakable determination to devotedly safeguard ” the leader , the official Korean Central News Agency said in first results from Sunday ’s poll .
Contrast the two headlines : Al - Jazeera put quotation marks around the word “ re-elected ” in recognition of the fraudulent nature of the “ election . ”
AP , on the other hand , may as well have been reporting that the British Prime minister had been re-elected .
Contrast the second paragraphs : Al - Jazeera refers to Kim ’s unanimous election as “ unsurprising ” ( in parens ) , another acknowledgement of the fraudulent nature of the “ election . ”
AP simply reports that all eligible voters cast ballots for Kim as if that ’s a common occurrence in elections .
Shame on Associated Press .
They are so consumed by political correctness that they seem incapable of simply saying , “ Kim Jong Il is a petty dictator and this election was a fraud . ”
The only thing missing from their story was this line :
“ Former President Jimmy Carter traveled to Pyongyang to observe the election and certified that it met the highest international standards for honesty and transparency . ”

If a half - percentage - point increase in unemployment rate is n’t ugly enough for you , there ’s more from your government statisticians : almost a full percentage point jump in a broader measure of unemployment .
The Labor Department reported today that its most comprehensive measure of joblessness hit 14.8 % in February , from 13.9 % in January .
That ’s just about 1 out of 7 Americans who are either unemployed and looking for a job , want a job but stopped looking , or part - timers who want full - time jobs .
We ’ve already blown through the prior high point of the data series , which the Bureau of Labor Statistics started in 1994 .
An even broader ( since discontinued ) series hit 15 % in late 1982 , and we ’re likely to fly right through that one next month .
The 8.1 % official unemployment rate , up from 7.6 % in January , only counts people who are available for work and actively looked for a job in the prior four weeks .
The 14.8 % figure ( known as the “ U - 6 ” by the BLS ) includes everyone in the 8.1 % figure , plus people who say they want a job and looked for work recently , along with people working part - time because they could n’t get a full - time schedule .
How high can the U - 6 go ?
Just looking at forecasts for the main unemployment rate , the broader measure would hit 17 % by the end of next year .
Some economists say 18 % to 20 % — 1 out of 5 people unemployed in some way — would n’t be terribly surprising .
If employers are n’t hiring , job hunters would be more likely to give up hope and stop looking even if they do want jobs .
After the 2001 recession , employers took roughly two years to resume meaningful hiring and competition was stiff for the jobs available .
Anyone searching for a job during this recession is already aware of that grim reality .

NEW YORK , Feb 17 ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday the current global recession will “ surely be the longest and deepest ” since the 1930s and more government rescue funds are needed to stabilize the U.S. financial system .
“ To stabilize the American banking system and restore normal lending , additional TARP funds will be required , ” Greenspan said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York .
The U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program designed to help bail out banks has been partially successful , he said .
Despite his prognosis on the current downturn , Greenspan said the pace of economic deterioration “ cannot persist indefinitely . ”
He reiterated , however , that a housing recovery is a necessary condition for the end of the financial crisis , and said that “ the prospect of stable home prices remains many months in the future . ”
The stock market , meanwhile , is being suppressed by “ a degree of fear not experienced since the early 20th century , ” Greenspan said .
“ Certainly by any historical measure , world stock prices are cheap .
But as history also counsels , they could get a lot cheaper before they turn . ”
A recovery in the equity market driven by lessening fear could be “ a seminal turning point of the current crisis , ” he said .
Citing the Japanese experience of the 1990s , Greenspan said U.S. authorities need to assure the repair of the financial system before major fiscal stimulus takes hold .
“ Unless we are successful at that , in my judgment , the positive impact of a fiscal stimulus will peter out after its scheduled completion , ” he said .
He said the real test of fiscal stimulus is whether it “ primes the pump ” for private demand .
Greenspan said the Federal Reserve ’s myriad emergency lending programs and the Treasury ’s TARP funds have the potential of being unwound eventually without leading to inflation or great cost to the taxpayer .
He warned , however , that politics could be an obstacle .
“ At the first signs of stabilization and a flattening of the unemployment rate , I presume the Federal Reserve will start to rein in much of its credit extension , ” Greenspan said .
“ However , Congress is likely to strongly object to any tightening of credit prior to full employment being restored .
Policy reversals on the fiscal front are nearly certain to meet stiff resistance , ” he said .
The U.S. Treasury will have to heavily issue debt to fund its stimulus package , and while at the moment the Treasury is having no difficulty finding buyers for it , there is a limit to the expansion of the federal debt , he said .
Greenspan , a proponent of self - regulation , said he was “ deeply dismayed ” when in August 2007 the premise that firms had the enlightened self interest to monitor their own risk exposure “ failed . ”
“ I see no alternative to a set of heightened federal regulatory rules for banks and other financial institutions , ” he said .
“ Even with the breakdown of self regulation , the financial system would have held together had the second bulwark against crisis , our existing regulatory system functioned effectively .
But under crisis pressure it , too , failed , ” Greenspan said .
That said , he still believes self - regulation is a first line of defense for market effectiveness .
“ We need not rush to reform .
Private markets are imposing far greater restraint at the moment than would any of the current sets of new regulatory proposals . ”
Answering a question after his speech on whether he would have done anything differently during his tenure as Federal Reserve chairman to try and prevent the housing bubble , Greenspan said , “ I think it would be desirable to find a way to suppress asset bubbles .
“ But I am skeptical that it can be done . ” ( Editing by Leslie Adler )
NYC May Begin Taxing Plastic Bag Usage
Image : currybet
Besides the incandescent lightbulb , the plastic bag is the number one target of environmentalists as flagrant wastefulness .
Not only do plastic bags usually end up in the trash , but they do so in large quantities and are made out of virtually non-biodegradable plastic .
On top of this is the fact that they are rarely necessary .
Most of the time you use a plastic bag you could easily have brought some of your own bags instead ( I tend to leave a few in my car just in case I ever forget ) .
That ’s why New York City ’s Mayor Bloomberg is looking to actively fight plastic bag usage by adding a 6 cent charge for each bag used .
This plan mimics similar policies in place in Ireland and Australia that charge consumers for the bags they use .
In Ireland , the tax ( which is more than NYC ’s proposed tax at 33 cents ) has reduced plastic bag usage 94 % .
However , this brings up the age - old debate :
Which is better , taxation or prohibition ?
Obviously we want people to use less plastic bags , but how should we encourage consumers to be more environmentally friendly ?
Let ’s look at some of the pros and cons :
Taxation
Pro :
High taxes reduce consumption greatly
Pro :
If you really need a bag , you can still get one
Con :
Tax revenue disappears quickly as customers change their behavior
Con :
Low taxes may not reduce plastic use enough
Prohibition
Pro :
No one will be using any bags
Pro : Consumers wo n’t face additional taxation
Con :
If you forget a bag or make an impluse purchase , you may be out of luck
Con : Popular support for this option may be low since nobody likes losing choice
What do you think ?
Is this a good plan for NYC ?
Should the tax be higher or should there be no tax and a total ban ?

A new book attempts to cast the crisis in civil liberties as a left / right issue .
But ultimately it is the timid , compliant climate of UK politics that is to blame , says John Kampfner
The 12 years of New Labour have seen an erosion of civil liberties without precedent in modern British history .
The list is alarming : identity cards that will store 50 pieces of personal information on each of us ; a surveillance system that allows local councils to snoop on us for fly - tipping ; a quarter of the world ’s closed - circuit television cameras ; and a length of pre-trial custody that would be deemed unacceptable in China , Russia or Zimbabwe .
In total , 45 criminal justice laws have been passed since 1997 , more than the aggregate for the previous century , creating more than 3,000 new criminal offences .
The Assault on Liberty , Dominic Raab ’s lament for Britain ’s lost liberal democracy should reinforce the arguments of those already worried by the state of British human rights ; and it should make those who dismiss these concerns think again .
The roots of the problem are , according to Raab , a mix of the political day - to - day and the philosophical underpinning of a pro-European centre - left party .
The 24 - hour news culture and baying for blood of the tabloids has meant that successive prime ministers and home secretaries have needed to sound tough .
The more crime was perceived to rise , the more ministers vowed to do ‘ whatever it takes ’ .
This auction of fear led to antisocial behaviour orders ; the events of 9/11 in America and 7/7 at home led to a similar trade - off of our liberties to counter the terrorist threat .
So far , so incontrovertible .
I do wonder , though , how a future Tory government would deal with these dilemmas .
Would David Cameron or his shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve ( for whom Raab works as chief of staff ) really face down the Sun and the Daily Mail once in office ?
Would they put their concerns over prison overcrowding into practice , by agreeing to early releases , or telling the courts to take a more subtle approach to sentencing , as those perfidious Europeans do ?
Somehow I doubt it .
The second part of the analysis is more complex , based around the relationship between state and individual , which Raab traces through British history , from Magna Carta to the present .
He quotes John Stuart Mill :
‘ The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community , against his will , is to prevent harm to others .
His own good , either physical or moral , is not a sufficient warrant . ’
Then , via Marx , Lenin and Polly Toynbee , he offers this : ‘ Socialists and social democrats take a fundamentally different approach to the liberal conception of rights .
For the liberal , individual liberty and choice must be respected , with the quid pro quo that the same individual has — and must take — personal responsibility for his actions . ’
The argument may be tendentious , but it should not be dismissed out of hand .
I continue to be appalled by how blase some on the left are about rights .
‘ You ’re not becoming one of those libertarians , are you ? ’ an acquaintance scoffed at me recently for expressing my concerns about CCTV and ID cards .
The choice , he said , was whether I wanted a better society or a return to the Tories , who famously step over beggars on their way to the opera .
Advocates of civil liberties on the left need not be categorised as laissez - faire libertarians who reject state intervention to reinforce security or economic stability .
The cause is in danger of being hijacked by forces of the right , repositioning themselves as the guardians of our freedoms .
Raab is generous enough to list parts of the dark history of Conservative governments , from the shooting dead of three IRA members in Gibraltar to the Spycatcher affair .
As the book progresses , Raab finds himself caught in a political armlock that requires him to portray Europe as the fount of all evil .
He obsesses over the incorporation of the Human Rights Act into British law , claiming it introduces the wrong kind of rights culture .
If Raab had compared the civil liberties performance of continental Europeans with ours ( Tory and Labour ) over the past 20 years , he would have been forced to concede that their governments have been more careful , their parliaments more responsible .
Ultimately , it comes down to a more courageous and enlightened political culture , one that , sadly , the UK presently lacks .
John Kampfner is chief executive of Index on Censorship .
His book on capitalist authoritarianism will be published in the autumn by Simon and Schuster .

Chuckie Taylor led a notorious anti-terror unit while his father ruled Liberia " Chuckie " Taylor , the son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor , has been sentenced by a US court to 97 years in prison for torture .
It is the first time a US court applied a 1994 law allowing the prosecution of citizens who commit torture overseas .
Chuckie Taylor , 31 , who headed a notorious paramilitary unit during his father 's rule , said he would appeal .
Charles Taylor is on trial at a court in The Hague - he denies 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
It is hard to conceive of any more serious offences against ... of human beings
Judge Altonaga US
District Judge Cecilia M Altonaga imposed the sentence on Chuckie Taylor - whose real name is Charles McArthur Emmanuel - at a hearing in a Miami court .
Shackled and dressed in a prison jumpsuit Taylor showed no emotion or reaction at the sentence , but told Judge Altonaga he would swiftly appeal .
He also said he rejected an offer from prosecutors to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence .
" My innocence was important to me then , as it is now , " said Taylor .
" My sympathies go out to all the people who suffered in the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone , " he added .
" It is hard to conceive of any more serious offences against the dignity and the lives of human beings , " Judge Altonaga said just before announcing the sentence .
" The international community condemns torture , " she added .
Torturing group
The prosecution had urged that Chuckie Taylor be sentenced to 147 years in prison .
Defence lawyers though had argued for leniency , arguing that many of the witnesses at his trial in October 2008 lied in a bid to win political asylum in the US or to settle political vendettas .
Chuckie Taylor was born in the US but after his father won Liberia 's 1997 elections he moved to the country , and was made the head of the notorious Anti-Terrorist Unit ( ATU ) while in his early 20s .
Charles Taylor
Snr faces war crimes charges in The Hague
This elite pro-government military division was widely feared in Liberia and the crimes were especially brutal when the unit was cracking down on a rebellion which began in 1999 .
At his trial in Miami late last year , Chuckie Taylor was accused of committing or conspiring to commit executions , imprisoning a group of individuals in a hole in the ground , burning victims and administering electric shocks .
The jury made a direct link between some incidents of torture and the defendant .
Liberia is currently trying to recover from 14 years of conflict .
At nationwide hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , victims are recounting the heinous crimes that tore the country apart .
Charles Taylor denies the charges he backed brutal rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone .
He stepped down in 2003 , as rebels advanced on the capital Monrovia .

Week by week , portrait of my pregnancy
The day I found out I was pregnant is still as vivid in my mind as though it were yesterday .
Alastair , my partner of five years , and I had only just started trying for a baby , and suddenly - far sooner than I had expected - it was happening .
I was thrilled , of course .
I called Alastair , a restaurateur , and asked to meet him for lunch .
WEEKS 13 TO 16 .
When she announced her pregnancy at 3 months , Natasha was a stone heavier , weighing 10st 4lb , but her friends could see no difference
He says he knew from the grin on my face what I was about to tell him , even before I produced the pregnancy test stick from my handbag .
I spent the rest of the day grinning from ear to ear , trying my hardest to work , but all the while thinking : ‘ Wow , I ’m pregnant ! ’
At 31 , I was more than ready to become a mother .
But , like most modern women , I have put myself through many a gym class in a bid to keep the figure I had in my early 20s , and I was terrified about the prospect of losing it in just nine months .
Almost from the moment I found out I was pregnant , I felt hugely fat .
WEEKS 17 TO 20 : Natasha , who 's always been a size 10 , finally accepted at the end of month 4 that she was a whole dress size bigger and went out to buy some size 12 jeans
Even in the first 12 weeks , while physically my body did n’t change that much , I was convinced I could see a bump beneath my clothes .
But when I announced my pregnancy at three months , friends said I did n’t look any different .
I was astounded - I thought I already looked like a beached whale .
Yet here I was weighing 10st 4lb - a stone heavier - and apparently looking exactly the same as I ’d always done .
Once into the second trimester , however , the weight gain picked up pace .
WEEKS 21 TO 24 : By month five , Natasha gave up the fight to squeeze into normal clothes
I was n’t particularly hungry throughout the pregnancy , but it seemed as though each morning a new layer of fat had materialised across my body .
When , at 14 weeks , I was asked if I ’d consider allowing myself to be photographed each week from then on , my first thought was : ‘ You must be joking ! ’
I was feeling hideous as it was - and things were only going to get worse .
Why would I want a record of me getting bigger and bigger , when I ’m the first to destroy any photograph of me that makes me look even remotely fat ?
WEEKS 25 TO 28 .
Natasha became bizarrely confident stripping down for the photos
But after thinking about it , I decided that perhaps it would n’t be so bad to have a set of photos documenting the changes my body had to go through in order to grow a human life .
Still , as someone who has always been a size 10 and weighed 9st 4lb ( I am 5 ft 7in ) , it was difficult to adjust to the fact that calorie intake had absolutely no impact on my size any more .
I knew it was all ‘ for the baby ’ , but I still hated it - especially the creeping appearance of ‘ back fat ’ .
Natasha pictured during weeks 29 to 32 of her pregnancy
On the day of my first photoshoot , I was so embarrassed by my new state that I kept my robe on until the last minute and spent most of the time enviously eyeing the girl photographer ’s flat stomach and skinny legs , and feeling depressed that I ’d probably never be slim again .
When I finally had to accept , at the end of month four , that I was now a whole dress size bigger , I actually cried - and went out to buy a pair of size 12 jeans .
By five months , I had no choice but to give up the fight and stop trying to squeeze into ‘ normal ’ clothes .
From now on , it was proper maternity clothes and unflattering bras that normally I would n’t be seen dead in .
Natasha pictured at weeks 33 to 35 of her pregnancy
Given how miserable I ’d felt early on in my pregnancy about being ‘ fat ’ , you might expect that by now I would be completely depressed .
Bizarrely , though , I suddenly felt hugely confident .
I no longer bothered with a robe at the photoshoots , instead standing half - naked , making chit - chat , while the photographer set up .
I went to a ball and wore a bright orange and gold dress that normally I would consider far too garish .
WEEKS 36 TO 38 .
At the end of her pregnancy , Natasha weighed 13 1/2 stone
I even started to get a thrill from seeing the needle on the scales inching its way towards the 131/ 2 stone where it would end up .
And here 's the result : Natasha with baby
Finn at eight weeks
Friends would say reassuringly that most of that extra weight was the baby , and I actually felt rather gleeful as I replied that , no , the baby inside me weighed just a few pounds - and any extra weight was in fact me .
What 's interesting is that even when your body shape is changing radically , you still preserve the same mental self - image .
In reality , I was waddling along with a big bump which could barely fit behind the steering wheel of my car ; yet in my mind ’s eye , I was just the same as I ’d always been .
It helped that , physically , I had a very easy pregnancy and was often able to forget I was pregnant at all .
I carried on working as a journalist until the baby was born , and was still out for a few evenings each week - just as I had been before falling pregnant .
I actually went into labour just a few hours after leaving the office , while out for dinner with a friend .
At first , because the baby was n’t due for another week , I thought I just had stomach ache .
It was n’t until 3 am that I finally realised I was in labour .
Feature conceived by Glamour magazine
To our delight , our gorgeous little boy Finn arrived by natural birth at 7.30 am .
At 6lb 4oz , he seemed so much smaller than the vast bump which had accommodated him .
Within a few days , my stomach had started to shrink .
But any visions I had of my fitting into my skinny jeans within a month or so - like some smug celebrity mother - were well and truly shattered .
The reality was that I was left with a deflated balloon and a crumpled tummy button .
I weighed myself for the first and last time a few weeks ago , and found I ’m still a stone heavier than I was before falling pregnant .
And that is five months on !
As for the pictures - am I glad I did them ?
Well , yes , I am .
It ’s clear my body did do something amazing , and I ’m glad I ’ve got the process on record .
But the growth in the job sites does not mean that independent contractors are immune to recessionary forces .
" Businesses tend to hold on to their employees , " said Inder Guglani , chief executive of Guru .
" With resources shrinking , they 'll reduce freelancers first .
The total dollars spent on freelancers in the economy , that 's definitely contracting . "
But the online matchmakers say other trends are helping to offset that decline .
Better bandwidth and newer software tools make remote work easier .
" Businesses have figured out how to be comfortable with employees working remotely , and that has educated workers and managers , " said Fabio Rosati , chief executive of Elance .
The system at oDesk lets employers monitor contractors ' work remotely .
A boss can see when a worker is logged in , peek at a screen shot and even view the worker on a Web cam .
With oDesk handling all the invoicing and payment , some companies are shifting the contractors they already have to oDesk .
Rachel Pennig , manager of customer support for PBwiki in San Mateo , Calif. , which creates collaborative wikis for clients , said she found at least half of her 12 - member team on oDesk .
One stay - at - home mother from South Carolina started as a contractor , kept increasing her hours , and wound up on the staff , she said .
The sites all operate on the same principle as eBay , enabling workers to build their reputations .
All the sites issue 1099 tax forms and other documentation , saving trouble for employers .
The sites survive on fees , charging employers or taking a commission from freelancers ' pay , often 5 to 10 percent .
The sites all take a cut of the work , although each one works a little differently .
Odesk takes a 10 percent charge on all services .
Elance deducts between 6.75 percent and 8.75 percent from the payment , covering both its service fee and credit card costs .
The range varies , depending on whether freelancers use the free listing service , or pay a one - time fee of $ 9.95 to $ 39.95 .
While Guru.com allows some freelancers to sign up for free , it charges a 10 percent fee on top of their billings .
For freelancers who pay for premium services , ranging from $ 29.95 per quarter to $ 129.94 per quarter , Guru takes 5 percent of the total bill .
Mr. King , the analyst , said he had also seen a rise in competitive sites serving narrower markets , like NineSigma and InnoCentive , tailored to the research and development field , or Crowdspring and Genius Rocket , which provide designers , or Rent A Coder , offering computer programmers .
In addition , he said , the big sites continue to add features , largely to keep people from taking business connections offline to avoid the fees .
Explicit Parallelism via Thread Pools March 13 , 2009
I ’m happy to say that this post is being finished up from my new home in Portland , Oregon !
After many years of searching around I ’ve finally decided to study at Portland State .
Its probably optimisitic of me to think I ’ll have more time as a graduate student , but I hope this is the beginning of much more involvement for me in the Haskell community .
Thread Pools from the Control - Engine Package
Control .
Engine was recently released on hackage , providing a simple way to instantiate worker threads to split - up the processing of streaming data .
Its was originally developed as a spin - off library from my DHT and I ’ve since generalized it to cover numerous cases .
Trivial Thread Pools
The trivial module Control .
ThreadPool can cover static examples such as a recent question asked on the haskell - cafe :
I have a function that does some IO ( takes a file path , read the file , parse , and return some data ) , and I would like to parallelize it , so that multiple files can be parsed in parallel .
‘ Control .
ThreadPool ’ gives us an easy answer ( but not as slick as the map reduce answer the person was asking for on cafe ) .
First we have our typical fluff .
import Control .
ThreadPool ( threadPoolIO ) import System .IO ( openFile , IOMode ( .. ) ) import System .
Environment ( getArgs ) import Control .
Concurrent .
Chan import Control .
Monad ( forM_ ) import qualified Data.
ByteString .
Lazy .
Char8 as L main = do as <- getArgs
As you can see below , we simply say how many threads we want in our thread pool and what action ( or pure computation , using ‘ threadPool ’ ) we wish to perform .
After that its just channels – send input in and read results out !
( input , output ) <- threadPoolIO nrCPU op mapM_ ( writeChan input ) as -- input stream forM_ [ 1..length as ] ( \_ -> readChan output >>= print ) where nrCPU = 4 op f = do h <- open
File f ReadMode c <- L.hGetContents h let !x = length .
L.words $ c hClose h return ( f , x )
And while this does nothing to demonstrate paralellism , it does work :
[ tom@Mavlo Test ] $ ghc - O2 parLines.hs -- make - threaded - fforce - recomp [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( web.hs , web .o )
Linking web ... [ tom@Mavlo Test ] $ find ~/ dev / Pastry - name * lhs | xargs ./ parLines +RTS - N4 - RTS ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry/Network/Pastry/Module/Joiner.lhs
"
,107 ) ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry /Network/Pastry/Config.lhs " ,14 ) ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry /Network /Pastry/Data/LeafSet.lhs " ,120 ) ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry/Network/Pastry/Data/Router.lhs " ,87 ) ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry/Network/Pastry/Data/RouteTable.lhs
",75 ) ( " /home/tom/dev/Pastry /Network /Pastry/Data/Address.lhs " , 152 )
Control Engine Setup
The thread pools are simple , but what if you need more flexibility or power ?
What happens if you want to have an up - to - date state shared amoung the threads , or there ’s a non-paralizable cheap computation you need to perform before the main operation ?
The answer is to use Control .
Engine instead of Control .
ThreadPool .
The engine provides managed state , numerous hook location , and an abilty to inject information to mid-engine locations .
Injectors
The inject * calls can bypass the input hooks ( injectPreMutator ) or bypass everything besides the output hooks ( injectPostMutator ) – thus creating a ‘ result ’ that had no corrosponding ‘ job ’ .
Hooks
Hooks are capable of modifying or filtering jobs or results .
All hooks are of type state -> a -> IO ( Maybe a ) ; its important to note the type can not change and if a hook returns Nothing then the job or result stops there .
Hooks can either be input , pre-mutate , post - mutate , or output .
Input and output hooks are ran in series on all jobs or results respectivly ; this is intended for low computation tasks that should n’t be done in parallel later .
Pre and post mutate hooks happen on the ( parallel ) worker threads before an after the main task , called the mutator .
Mutator
The engine consists of N mutator threads , which is the only operation capable of transforming the jobs into a different ( result ) type .
State Management
Control .
Engine was built with the idea that jobs and state reads were frequent while alterations to the state were rare .
A design decision was made to use STM to resolve all contention on state alterations and have a manager watch the TVar for change then bundle those changes in a quicker to read fashion ( MVar ) for the input , output , and worker threads .
The state provided to the hooks and mutator is always consistent but not guarenteed up - to - date .
When modifications to the state occur a transactional variable is modified , which wakes the stateManager ; in turn , the state manager updates the state MVar which is read by each thread before processing the next job .
In the future IORefs might be used instead of the MVar – all contention is handled by the STM and the only writer for the MVar ( future IORef ) should be the State Manager .
Web Crawling
Now lets figure out how to help users who need more flexibility using Control .
Engine instead of Control .
ThreadPool .
MyCatVerbs , from #haskell , suggested a web crawler that uses URls as the job and the mutator ( worker ) can add all the links of the current page as new jobs while ignoring any URL that was already visited .
Lets start !
The imports are n’t too surprising – tagsoup , concurrent , bloomfilter and Control - Engine are the packages I draw on .
module Main where import Control .
Concurrent ( forkIO , threadDelay ) import Control .
Concurrent .
Chan import Control .
Monad ( forever , when ) import Control .
Engine -- Control - Engine import Control .
Exception as X import Data.BloomFilter -- bloomfilter import Data.BloomFilter .
Hash -- bloomfilter import Data.BloomFilter .Easy -- bloomfilter import Data.IORef import System .
Environment ( getArgs ) import Text .HTML.Download -- tagsoup import Text .HTML.TagSoup -- tagsoup type URL = String data Job = GetURL URL | ParseHTML URL
String deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show ) main = do ( nrCPU:url : _ ) <- getArgs
The library tries to remain flexible which makes you do a little more work but do n’t let that scare you !
It needs an IO action to get tasks and an IO action that delivers the results .
Most people will probably just want a channel , but sockets or files would do just as well .
input <- newChan output <- newChan
Starting the engine is a one line affair .
You provide the number of threads , input , output , a mutator function and initial state .
In return you are provided with an ‘ Engine ’ with which you can modify the hooks and use the injection points .
For this web crawler my ‘ state ’ is just a bloom filter of all visited URLs so I ’ll keep that in the one hook its needed and declare the engine - wide state as a null – ( ) .
For the chosen task the mutator needs a way to add more jobs ( more URLs ) so as pages are parsed any new URLs can be queued for future crawling ; this is handled via partial application of mutator funciton .
eng <- initEngine ( read nrCPU ) ( readChan input ) ( writeChan output ) ( mutator ( writeChan input ) ) ()
As mentioned , I ’ll use a bloom filter to keep the web crawler from re-visiting the same site many times .
This should happen exactly once for each URL and is fairly fast so I ’ll insert it as an ‘ Input Hook ’ which means a single thread will process all jobs before they get parsed out to the parallel thread pool .
let initialBF = fromListB ( cheapHashes nrHashes ) nrBits [ ] ( nrBits , nrHashes ) = suggestSizing 100000 ( 10 ** ( - 6 ) ) bf <- newIORef ( initial BF,0 ) let bfHook = Hk ( uniqueURL bf ) 1 " Ensure URLs have not already been crawled " addInputHook eng bfHook
Finishing up main , we print all results then provide an initial URL .
Notice we run forever – there ’s no clean shutdown in this toy example .
forkIO $ forever $ printResult output writeChan input ( GetURL url ) neverStop eng where neverStop eng = forever $ threadDelay maxBound
And from here on we ’re just providing the worker routine that will run across all the threads and we ’ll define the input hook .
TagSoup performs all the hard work of downloading the page and parsing HTML .
Just pull out the < a href= ” … ” > tags to add the new URLs as jobs before returning any results .
In this example I decided to avoid any sort of error checking ( ex : making sure this is an HTML document ) and simply returning the number of words as a result .
mutator :: ( Job -> IO ( ) ) -> st -> Job -> IO ( Maybe ( URL , Int ) ) mutator addJob _ ( GetURL url ) = forkIO ( do e <- X.try ( openURL url ) :: IO ( Either X.SomeException String ) case e of Right dat -> addJob ( ParseHTML url dat ) _ -> return ( ) ) >> return Nothing mutator addJob _ ( ParseHTML url dat ) = do let !urls = getURLs dat !
len = length urls fixed = map ( \u -> if take 4 u /= " http " then url ++ '/' : u else u ) urls mapM_ ( addJob . GetURL ) fixed return $ Just ( url , len ) where getURLs :: String -> [ URL ] getURLs s = let tags = parseTags s in map snd ( concatMap hrefs tags ) hrefs :: Tag -> [ ( String , String ) ] hrefs ( TagOpen " a " xs ) = filter ( ( == " href " ) . fst ) xs hrefs _ = [ ] printResult :: ( Show result ) => Chan result -> IO ( ) printResult c = readChan c >>= print
Filtering out non-unique URLs is just the bloom filter in action .
uniqueURL :: IORef ( Bloom URL , Int ) -> st -> Job -> IO ( Maybe Job ) uniqueURL _ _ j@( ParseHTML _ _ ) = return $ Just j uniqueURL bf _ j@( GetURL url ) = do ( b,i ) <- readIORef bf if elemB url b then putStrLn ( " Reject : " ++ url ) >> return Nothing else do writeIORef bf ( insertB url b , i + 1 ) when ( i `rem` 100 == 0 ) ( print i ) return $ Just j
Performance
P.S. No serious performance measurements have been made beyond extremely expensive ( and trivially parallel ) problems , so those do n’t count .
14Mar2009 EDIT : Said something about Control .
Engine before showing the diagram to make reading smoother .
EDIT2 : ThreadPool example shown was a version using MD5 , not length – oops !
Fixed now .
Square Enix sent shockwaves through the Japanese games market today with the surprise announcement that Dragon Quest IX will not make its original March 28 release date .
Instead , players will have to wait until July 11 .
As reason for the delay , the company cited the discovery of major bugs in the game .
It attempted to make the requisite fixes without changing the date , but determined that more time was necessary .
This delay has to come as a blow to all involved parties .
For fans , Dragon Quest is one of Japan 's biggest games , with some expecting part IX to sell five million units domestically .
For retailers , main Dragon Quest games tend to sell upwards of two million units in the first two days of sales .
Most major retailers had already opened up pre-orders for DQIX , with some even promoting special 7:00 AM opening times .
For Square Enix , the damage is a bit more measurable .
The company 's Square Enix Holdings parent issued revised earnings forecasts for the year 2008 today .
Citing a delay in the release of a major March game , the company lowered sales forecasts from 160 billion yen to 133 billion and operating profit forecasts from 21 billion to 12 billion yen .
Square Enix will detail its full earnings report for the first three quarters later today , and will also likely share further comment about the DQIX delay .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday , after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA .
The blast caused damage but there were no immediate reports of injury .
Policemen inspect the area after a van loaded with a bomb exploded in northeast Madrid .
The Red Cross received a call at 7:37 a.m. ( 1:37 a.m. ET ) , in the name of ETA , warning of the bomb .
The Red Cross immediately contacted police , who cordoned off the area , a Red Cross spokeswoman told CNN .
The blast occurred shortly after 9 a.m. ( 3 a.m. ET ) outside the building of a construction company , CNN partner network CNN + reported .
The company , Ferrovial Agroman , is involved in building a high - speed train line in the Basque region , which ETA opposes .
The attack came just hours after Spain 's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain .
Authorities allege the new parties are simply new names for other leftist Basque parties already outlawed for their links to ETA .
" What ETA did this morning ratifies the Supreme Court decision last night , " Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters , at the scene of the explosion .
At least 30 vehicles parked in the street were damaged , as well as the construction company offices , the Spanish police said in a statement .
The bomb , it added , was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area .
Exactly four years ago , on Feb. 9 , 2005 , ETA placed a bomb in the same Madrid neighborhood that was hit on Monday .
That attack caused dozens of injuries , and damaged a different glass - façade office building .
ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence .
It is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States .

10 Tips for Staying Happy at Work Before you start looking for greener career pastures , try these tips for maintaining a happy outlook on the job .
Beverly West , Monster Contributing Writer
If you find yourself longing for greener work pastures , do n't immediately go looking for the first exit ramp off of your chosen career path .
The Balance Team , which specializes in professional - and personal - growth seminars for administrative and executive assistants in Fortune 1000 companies , suggests these 10 tips for staying content at work :
1. Keep Personal Problems Personal
When you 're preoccupied with personal issues , it 's difficult to concentrate or be happy at work , says Alison Rhodes , a founding partner of The Balance Team .
By all means , make sure you have your kids covered in the event of an emergency , but realize that nobody 's personal life is ever going to be completely problem - free .
Just as you need to let go of work to enjoy your time at home , it 's important to leave personal worries at home so you can focus and be productive at work .
2. Create an Office Nest
" You are at your job for at least eight hours a day , which is more time than you probably spend in your bed , " says Jennifer Star , a founding partner of The Balance Team .
" Make your space your own , decorate your area as much as your company policy permits , and make yourself as comfortable and relaxed as you can be in your office .
3. Develop an Office Support System
" Gathering a circle of colleagues who share similar backgrounds or lifestyles can take a lot of pressure off you at work , " says Rhodes .
" When you are able to voice your feelings to people who understand , it can really help minimize stress .
4. Eat Healthy and Drink Lots of Water
" Maintaining a good diet and keeping yourself properly hydrated throughout your workday can really make a big difference in your energy level and attitude , " says Shirly Weiss , a certified holistic health and nutritional counselor and consulting expert for The Balance Team .
" And if you can manage to maintain a diet of whole foods , as opposed to refined foods such as sugar and bread , then you 'll really be ahead of the game .
5. Be Organized
Create a manageable schedule to handle your workload , suggests Stacy Raden , a founding partner of The Balance Team .
" A sense of empowerment stems from accomplishment , " she says .
" When you feel overwhelmed , it tends to intensify dissatisfaction .
By being proactive and taking control , employees can feel a sense of satisfaction , enhanced confidence and motivation .
6. Move Around
" Working in an office can be a very sedentary job , so it 's especially important to your overall sense of health and happiness to take a few minutes during your workday to get up and move a little , " says Jason Bergund , founding director of Dancetherapy , a dance class , and a consulting expert for The Balance Team .
7. Do n't Try to Change Your Coworkers
" You can't change anyone ; you can only change the way you react to them , " says Star .
" Do n't let other people 's actions affect you .
Just figure out a way to resolve conflicts and avert uncomfortable situations . "
8. Reward Yourself
Identify a reward outside of your job , and indulge yourself , says Raden .
Whether it be dinner with friends , a movie , exercise or a manicure , treat yourself every once in awhile .
Just as stress from home can interfere with work , the positive aspects of your life can influence mood at work as well .
9 . Take a Breather
" In yoga , we practice the breath of joy , in which we inhale a long breath and then exhale laughter , " says Sarah Schain , founding director of Yoga Tales studios for children and a consulting expert for The Balance Team .
Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides .
Inhale deeply , then exhale laughter and bend forward .
Try to do this movement 10 times .
10 . Focus on the Positive
" Identify the things that you like at work , even if they are as simple as your coworkers or the nice view from your office window , " says Raden .
" You create your own mind - set .
If you stress the positives , you will make your job more enjoyable .
Worrying about the negatives may cause you to become overwhelmed . "
As Barack Obama ’s troop escalation begins in Afghanistan and talking heads debate how many more troops the US should send , the leadership of what was once the largest antiwar organization ( UFPJ ) in the United States rejected a call for a unified antiwar protest on March 21st , 2009 .
Instead , they issued a call to go to Wall Street on April 4th , 2009 and encourage the war profiteers to move “ beyond a war economy , ” while toning down the demand to end the wars and occupations now to a demand to merely end them .
Like antiwar organizer Ashley Smith told me in an email : “ ( That is ) something Dick Cheney could support . ”
The implication of this call by UFPJ is that now that Barack Obama and the Democrats are in power , there is no longer any need to protest against war .
Not only is this incredibly naive , it is downright dangerous for the future of the world .
As anybody who has paid the least bit of attention to the nature of the US economy over the past century , its very foundations rest on the production of war and materials for war .
Also apparent to those of us who have been paying attention is that the Democrats are just as responsible for this reality as the Republicans are .
Just because George Bush and his administration were personally reprehensible and their arrogance and disregard for principles most Americans hold dear was as obvious as the nose on Pinocchio ’s wooden face does n’t mean that the policies of the Democrats are substantially different .
Consequently , the antiwar movement would be foolish to think they have a government of allies in Washington , DC now .
There may be a more personable bunch of folks ruling the country now , but the odds of those folks pulling out of Afghanistan or Iraq now instead of later without a major push from the American people insisting that they do so are about as poor as they were under the Bush administration .
The time for the antiwar movement to demand that the Obama administration end the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan is now , before its political ego becomes entangled in a military exercise that is ill - advised , poorly done , and just plain wrong .
Walking through New York ’s financial district carrying signs expressing a hope that the trillion dollar war economy will go against its profit margin because it is morally wrong to profit from death is not a bad thing .
It might feel good and even change some minds , but it wo n’t change the bottom line .
And it is the bottom line that must be changed .
Understanding this fact requires the antiwar movement to be united and specific .
The demands are simple : Bring all of the troops back from Iraq and Afghanistan now .
Not in 2010 , or 2011 or 2012 , but now .
Both of these operations have gone on long enough , no matter what the generals tell Obama or the American people .
Since the Pentagon has n’t been able to accomplish what it wanted despite being militarily engaged for close to a decade in both countries , it ’s high time that we insist that our timetable be put into effect .
Fortunately , a coalition has formed around this simple demand .
The National Assembly to End the Wars and the ANSWER coalition have joined forces and are holding protests in at least three major US cities on March 21 , 2009 .
Washington , DC , Los Angeles and San Francisco will be the sites of these protests .
In addition to calling on the Obama administration and Congress to remove the troops from Afghanistan and Iraq now , the protests also address the issue of US support for the violent occupation of Palestine by Israel–another important issue that the UFPJ prefers not to highlight in their public calls to join their protest .
Unless and until the issue of Palestine is addressed in an honest and just way that does not merely echo the desires of the Israeli expansionists , things in the Middle East will remain volatile and dangerous .
According to most public opinion polls , the majority of Americans understand this yet Washington continues to support Tel Aviv no matter what it does –murderous attacks on Gaza or illegal settlements in the West Bank , it does n’t seem to matter .
The US money and weaponry continues to flow .
Additionally , in the wake of recent election results in Israel , the threat of an Israeli attack on Iran ( with at least tacit US support ) grows stronger .
Unless the US government is put on notice that this is beyond the pale , the current relative calm in the Middle East and South Asia will become a thing of distant memory .
It is not my intention to disregard or disrespect UFPJ ’s march on April 4th in New York .
Indeed , if one can attend that protest and one of the protests on March 21st , please do .
However , if one has to choose , the intentions of the March 21st protests are certainly more immediate and , if the world without war that UFPJ envisions is to ever occur , essential to that vision .
After all , in order to move beyond the war economy , does n’t it make sense that we must end the wars / military occupations currently taking place ?
If we do n’t get this message out there , those who want to expand the war in Afghanistan and ultimately bring it into Pakistan on a much greater scale will assume they have the approval of the US public .
The job of the antiwar movement is to let them know that this is not the case .
March 21st , 2009 is the first national manifestation of this in the Obama era .
After years of debate , the movement got a big boost in Trenton last month when the state Senate approved a bill that would allow medical use of marijuana .
It is the first time such legislation has emerged from committee .
A full vote is still needed by the Assembly , but Gov. Corzine has said he would sign the bill .
TAMPA , Fla. , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) -- A Florida woman charges in a lawsuit that the Church of Scientology contributed to her son's death by denying him access to antidepressants .
The lawsuit filed in Tampa , Fla. , contends that 20 - year - old Kyle Brennan shot himself in 2007 while with his Scientologist father , who allegedly took away Brennan 's medication and tried to put him into a church - oriented drug treatment program .

Brennan was n't a Scientologist and had been staying with his father , Thomas Brennan , in Clearwater , Fla. , for about a week before his death .
The lawsuit alleges two other Scientology members convinced Thomas Brennan to lock up his son's medication .
The St. Petersburg ( Fla . )
Times said Tuesday that church officials denied any role in Brennan 's death , saying the defendants were n't Scientology leaders and the incidents all took place off church property .

This 25 year old woman has never given birth and has no history of STIs .
Each photo was taken at approximately 10:00 pm every day starting the first day of her menstrual cycle .
For the duration of this project , she used condoms as her birth control method so as not to introduce semenal fluid into the photoshoot .
She did not use tampons or mooncups during her menstruation either .
This cycle is of normal / average length for her , about 33 days .
Her cycle ’s follicular phase ( variable number of days preovulation ) lasts until about day 20 or 21 .
Her fertile phase lasts from days 13 to 21 with ovulation on day 20 .
Her luteal ( postovulation ) phase is 13 days long ( 12 - 16 days is the norm and is not variable in a normal cycle ) .
This is a graph of her basal body temperature for this cycle .
As you can see , after ovulation on about day 20 , her temperature began to rise due to the heat - inducing hormone progesterone produced by the corpus luteum .
This temperature shift signifies that ovulation has already occurred .
The coverline would be drawn at 97.4 F. Check out more information about the Fertility Awareness Method of birth control to learn more about cyclical temperature changes .
You may notice on the right side of some photos , some jagged looking skin , which is the remnants of her hymenal ring .
Her os ( opening in the cervix ) is round because she has never given birth ; the os becomes more of a slit after childbirth .
On the sides of the photos , you can see her vaginal rugae , which are the ridges that make the elastic muscular canal of the vagina able to open / expand dramatically during arousal and childbirth .
She also tracked the depth / movement of her cervix in her vagina .
These gradual shifts are not really distinguishable in the photos , but was a tangible change as the depth she needed to reach a finger inside to touch her own cervix varied slightly each day .
She also noted the firmness of the cervix and openness of the os – again a change she was feeling with her finger .
Her uterus is tipped backward ( retroflexed ) , so you may notice that the cervix is pointing upwards in some photos .
The body of the uterus lies more towards her back than over her bladder as it does in most women .
Much scientific literature states that a retroflexed uterus is an anatomical variation that is present in about 20 - 30 % of the population , and sometimes considered a genetic trait .
Another perspective is that proper alignment of all the pelvic organs can help tonify a woman ’s fertility , ease menstrual cramps , and allow the proper flow of blood , lymph , nerve & chi energy .
Attention to posture , Mayan abdominal massage , and addressing underlying inflammation or injuries might help right the uterus into an anteverted position .

So you 've decided to go the lame - ass " dinner and a movie " route for Valentine 's Day , only you can't get even get a reservation at the 59 Diner and going to the movies these days just makes you wish you 'd applied for that concealed handgun permit .
Buck up , little camper , for even ordering a pizza and playing a DVD can win your way into that special guy / gal 's pants heart by lowering their defenses with one of these tried - and - true scenes :
5. " As You Wish " -- The Princess Bride
Lost in the sappy romanticism of the Dread Pirate Roberts ' " shocking " revelation to Buttercup that he was , in fact , her childhood flame are subtle hints of the fierce agrarian class struggle in Florin .
Westley , a serf , was forced to couch his love for a member of the landed class in code lest he have his eyes put out with hot pokers .
4. " Gimme a kiss " / The Lobster Scene - Annie Hall
My childhood impressions of New York City were shaped by this movie and The Warriors , which is probably why I 'm still terrified of going there .
There are any number of great scenes in Annie Hall , though , which just makes you wonder what Allen did to turn audiences off to the idea of him as a romantic lead .
Oh , right .
3 . " There 's a magnificence in you , Tracy . " --
The Philadelphia Story
They do n't make 'em like this anymore .
Not with two of the best actors of their generation in a romance that does n't rely on Three 's Company - esque misunderstandings and a madcap chase at the end set to " Gimme Some Lovin ' , " anyway .
2. Yes , That Scene -- When Harry Met Sally
I do n't care that you 've seen it a hundred times .
I do n't care if you 're sick to death of Billy Crystal and his insufferable Yankees worship .
I 'm including it because seeing Meg Ryan 's little performance in the theater made me realize two things :
1 ) That I had never heard sounds like that coming from a woman before , and 2 ) I was just too damn lazy to put forth the effort to change that .
1. " In Your Eyes " -- Say Anything
It is n't so much that nobody had ever employed similar tactics before -- the boombox held aloft is really just an extrovert 's answer to the mixtape -- it's that the sensitive and independent Cusack was such a maddeningly perfect male .
I think I speak for every zit - faced teenage boy who did n't kickbox and could n't rock the trenchcoat over a Clash t- shirt without looking like a complete tool when I say : fuck you , Lloyd Dobler .

Top 5 laptop makers : 1 . Hewlett - Packard 2 . Acer 3 . Dell 4 . Toshiba 5 . Asustek Top 5 netbook makers : 1 . Asustek 2 . Acer 3 . Hewlett - Packard 4 . OLPC 5 . Dell Mary Lou Jepsen did n't set out to invent the netbook and turn the computer industry upside down .
She was just trying to create a supercheap laptop .
In 2005 , Jepsen , a pioneering LCD screen designer , was tapped to lead the development of the machine that would become known as One Laptop per Child .
Nicholas Negroponte , the longtime MIT Media Lab visionary , launched the project hoping to create an inexpensive computer for children in developing countries .
It would have Wi -Fi , a color screen , and a full keyboard — and sell for about $ 100 .
At that price , third - world governments could buy millions and hand them out freely in rural villages .
Plus , it had to be small , incredibly rugged , and able to run on minimal power .
" Half of the world 's children have no regular access to electricity , " Jepsen points out .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The miserly constraints spurred her to be fiendishly resourceful .
Instead of using a spinning hard drive she chose flash memory — the type in your USB thumb drive — because it draws very little juice and does n't break when dropped .
For software she picked Linux and other free , open source packages instead of paying for Microsoft 's wares .
She used an AMD Geode processor , which is n't very fast but requires less than a watt of power .
And as the pièce de résistance , she devised an ingenious LCD panel that detects whether onscreen images are static ( like when you 're reading a document ) and tells the main processor to shut down , saving precious electricity .
To build the laptop , dubbed the XO - 1 , One Laptop per Child hired the Taiwanese firm Quanta .
It 's hardly a household name , but Quanta is the largest laptop manufacturer in the world .
Odds are that parts of the machine on your desk , whether it's from Apple , Dell , or Hewlett - Packard , were made by Quanta — possibly even designed by Quanta .
Like most Taiwanese computermakers , it employs some of the sharpest engineers on the planet .
They solved many of Jepsen 's most daunting engineering challenges , and by 2007 , the OLPC was shaping up .
The poor kids of the world would have their notebook — if not quite for $ 100 , for not a whole lot more .
Inspired ( or perhaps a bit scared ) by the OLPC project , Asustek — Quanta 's archrival in Taiwan and the world 's seventh - largest notebook maker — began crafting its own inexpensive , low - performance computer .
It , too , would be built cheaply using Linux , flash memory , and a tiny 7 - inch screen .
It had no DVD drive and was n't potent enough to run programs like Photoshop .
Indeed , Asustek intended it mainly just for checking email and surfing the Web .
Their customers , they figured , would be children , seniors , and the emerging middle class in India or China who can't afford a full $ 1,000 laptop .
What happened was something entirely different .
When Asustek launched the Eee PC in fall 2007 , it sold out the entire 350,000 - unit inventory in a few months .
Eee PCs were n't bought by people in poor countries but by middle - class consumers in western Europe and the US , people who wanted a second laptop to carry in a handbag for peeking at YouTube or Facebook wherever they were .
Soon the major PC brands — Dell , HP , Lenovo — were scrambling to catch up ; by fall 2008 , nearly every US computermaker had rushed a teensy $ 400 netbook to market .
All of which is , when you think about it , incredibly weird .
Netbooks violate all the laws of the computer hardware business .
Traditionally , development trickles down from the high end to the mass market .
PC makers target early adopters with new , ultrapowerful features .
Years later , those innovations spread to lower - end models .
But Jepsen 's design trickled up .
In the process of creating a laptop to satisfy the needs of poor people , she revealed something about traditional PC users .
They did n't want more out of a laptop — they wanted less .
Spec Shot : Laptop vs. Netbook
Many netbooks trade the speedy onboard processors and roomy hard drives of a full - size laptop for online apps and small — but fast — solid state drives .
The result ?
A formidable machine at a third of the price .
Lenovo ThinkPad T500 Laptop Dell Inspiron Mini 9 Netbook Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26 GHz Processor Intel Atom N270 Single Core 1.6 GHz Microsoft Windows Vista Home Operating System Ubuntu Linux 8.04 1 GB System Memory 512 MB
80 - GB hard drive Storage 4 - GB solid state drive 15.4 inches , 1280 x 800 pixels Screen Size 8.9 inches , 1024 x 600 pixels 802.11b/g Wireless Access 802.11b/g $ 959 Price $ 299 Many netbooks trade the speedy onboard processors and roomy hard drives of a full - size laptop for online apps and small — but fast — solid state drives .
The result ?
A formidable machine at a third of the price .
By the end of 2008 , Asustek had sold 5 million netbooks , and other brands together had sold 10 million .
( Europe in particular has gone mad for netbooks ; sales there are eight times higher than in the US . )
In a single year , netbooks had become 7 percent of the world 's entire laptop market .
Next year it will be 12 percent .
" We started inventing technology for the bottom of the pyramid , " Jepsen says , " but the top of the pyramid wants it too . "
This bit of trickle - up innovation , this netbook , might well reshape the computer industry — if it does n't kill it first .
I wrote this story on a netbook , and if you had peeked over my shoulder , you would have seen precisely two icons on my desktop : the Firefox browser and a trash can .
Nothing else .
It turns out that about 95 percent of what I do on a computer can now be accomplished through a browser .
I use it for updating Twitter and Facebook and for blogging .
Meebo.com lets me log into several instant - messaging accounts simultaneously .
Last.fm gives me tunes , and webmail does the email .
I use Google Docs for word processing , and if I need to record video , I can do it directly from webcam to YouTube .
Come to think of it , because none of my documents reside on the netbook , I 'm not sure I even need the trash can .
Netbooks have ended the performance wars .
It used to be that when you went to an electronics store to buy a computer , you picked the most powerful one you could afford .
Because , who knew ?
Maybe someday you 'd need to play a cutting - edge videogame or edit your masterpiece indie flick .
For 15 years , the PC industry obliged our what - if paranoia by pushing performance .
Intel and AMD tossed out blisteringly fast chips , hard drives went on a terabyte gallop , RAM exploded , and high - end graphics cards let you play Blu-ray movies on your sprawling 17 - inch laptop screen .
That dream machine could do almost anything .
But here 's the catch : Most of the time , we do almost nothing .
Our most common tasks — email , Web surfing , watching streamed videos — require very little processing power .
Only a few people , like graphic designers and hardcore gamers , actually need heavy - duty hardware .
For years now , without anyone really noticing , the PC industry has functioned like a car company selling SUVs :
It pushed absurdly powerful machines because the profit margins were high , while customers lapped up the fantasy that they could go off - roading , even though they never did .
So coders took advantage of that surplus power to write ever - bulkier applications and operating systems .
What netbook makers have done , in effect , is turn back the clock :
Their machines perform the way laptops did four years ago .
And it turns out that four years ago ( more or less ) is plenty .
" Regular computers are so fast , you really can't tell the difference between 1.6 giga and 2 giga , " says Andy Tung , vice president of US sales for MSI , the Taiwanese maker of the Wind netbook .
" We can tell the difference between one second and two seconds , but not between 0.0001 and 0.0002 second . "
For most of today 's computing tasks , the biggest performance drags are n't inside the machine .
They 're outside .
Is your Wi-Fi signal strong ?
Is Twitter down again ?
Netbooks are evidence that we now know what personal computers are for .
Which is to say , a pretty small list of things that are conducted almost entirely online .
This was Asustek 's epiphany .
It got laptop prices under $ 300 by crafting a device that makes absolutely no sense when it 's not online .
Consider : The Eee 's original flash drive was only 4 gigs .
That 's so small you need to host all your pictures , videos , and files online — and install minimal native software — because there 's simply no room inside your machine .
Netbooks prove that the " cloud " is no longer just hype .
It is now reasonable to design computers that outsource the difficult work somewhere else .
The cloud tail is wagging the hardware dog .
Most consumers have never heard of Taiwan 's quiet , unheralded PC firms , but they 've been behind some of the most important hardware of the past three decades .
Quanta first gained notice in the ' 80s for cleverly cramming new components into notebooks .
Then , in 2001 , Apple contracted with the company to design its G4 notebook from top to bottom .
The product was a spectacular success , and Quanta was soon doing engineering for every other major PC maker .
Asustek and MSI , the two other giants of the Taiwanese laptop world , also branched out from motherboards into everything from LCD TVs to mobile phones .
These companies are enormous : Quanta had sales of $ 25 billion last year , more than marquee firms like Amazon.com , Texas Instruments , and Electronic Arts .
Even though the Taiwanese manufacturers remained subservient to the well - known PC brands , they soaked up tons of knowledge over the years .
For instance , when Intel created its x486 chip in 1988 , Asustek built a compatible motherboard before Intel could make its own board work .
Later , Asustek was producing components for Apple laptops .
" Nine times out of 10 , " recalls John Jacobs , a former Apple manager who now covers the LCD market as an analyst for DisplaySearch , " when we said ' Jump , ' they said ' How high ? '
That 's how Asustek learned a lot . "
But for all their success , companies like Asustek and MSI were outsiders .
And when Asustek released the Eee netbook , big firms like Dell , HP , and Apple did nothing for months .
" All the other brands were thinking , ' Oh , this is crap , ' " recalls Lillian Lin , Asustek 's global marketing director .
Dell and HP were n't going to pioneer a $ 400 laptop , because they were already selling laptops for $ 1,000 .
Why mess with a good thing ?
MSI had no laptop business at all , and Asustek had only a small business selling full - price machines under its own brand , mostly in Asia and Europe .
Since the Taiwanese were n't addicted to selling SUV - class computers , they could swoop in like Honda with smaller , more efficient models .
They also knew how to design on the cheap after years of producing motherboards with excruciatingly tiny margins .
In The Innovator 's Dilemma , Clayton Christensen famously argued that true breakthroughs almost always come from upstarts , since profitable firms rarely want to upend their business models .
" Netbooks are a classic Christensenian disruptive innovation for the PC industry , " says Willy Shih , a Harvard Business School professor who has studied both Quanta 's work on the One Laptop per Child project and Asustek 's development of the netbook .
The Taiwanese firms , Shih argues , now have enormous clout in the PC industry .
In the US , we regard branding and marketing — convincing people what to buy — as core business functions .
What Asustek proved is that the companies with real leverage are the ones that actually make desirable products .
The Taiwanese laptop builders possess the atom - hacking smarts that once defined America but which have atrophied here along with our industrial base .
As far as laptop manufacturing goes , Taiwan essentially now owns the market ; the devices are n't produced in significant volumes anywhere else .
If you had asked Taiwanese hardware CEOs a few years ago about their relationship with Dell , HP , and Apple , they'd have told you that the American companies did the branding and sales while outsourcing their design and production to Taiwan .
Today the view from Asia is increasingly the reverse .
" When I talk to them now , " Shih laughs , " they say , ' We outsource our branding and sales to them . ' "
" But what about Photoshop ? "
It 's the standard retort from those who dismiss netbooks as children 's toys .
Sure , a dinky 1.6 - GHz chip and Linux are fine for email and silly things like YouTube .
But what about when you need to do some real computing , like sophisticated photo editing ?
The cloud wo n't help you there , kid .
In the narrowest sense , this is true : A really powerful application like Adobe Photoshop demands a much faster processor .
But consider my experience :
This spring , after my regular Windows XP laptop began crashing twice a day , I reformatted the hard drive .
As I went about reinstalling my software , I could n't find my Photoshop disc .
I forgot about it — until a week later , when I was blogging and needed to tweak a photo .
Frustrated , I went online and discovered FotoFlexer , one of several free Web - based editing tools .
I uploaded my picture , and in about one minute I 'd cropped it , deepened the color saturation , and sharpened it .
I have n't used Photoshop since .
Keep in mind that I like Photoshop .
I 'm not doing this to make any geeky ideological point about how bleeding - edge I am or how much I hate paying for boxed software .
It 's simply that the hassle of finding my Photoshop disc now exceeds the ease of using FotoFlexer .
The code for working with the browser - based app is a mere 900 KB , and " to the average user , that comes down really fast , " as Sharam Shirazi , CEO of Arbor Labs , which created it , points out to me .
My Photoshop experience is just one example of how the software industry is changing .
It used to be that coders were forced to produce bloatware with endless features because they had to guess what customers might want to do .
But if you design a piece of software that lives in the cloud , you know what your customers are doing — you can watch them in real time .
Shirazi's firm discovered that FotoFlexer users rarely do fancy editing ; the most frequently used features are tools for drawing text and scribbles on pictures .
Or consider the Writely app , which eventually became the word processor part of Google Docs :
When Sam Schillace first put it online , he found to his surprise that what users wanted most was a way to let several people edit a document together .
" It used to be , ' I 'm buying a paint program , and I 'll get the one with 5,000 features .
I do n't know what 2,000 of those features are , but I 'll get it just in case , ' " Schillace says .
" Today it 's just , ' Which one is most easily available ?
Which one is ready online ? '
So applications are competing on merit ; they 're not competing on bulk . "
NEW YORK -- Chad Pennington has mastered NFL quarterbacking .
And personal comebacks .
Chad Pennington put being released by the Jets behind him and led the Dolphins to the AFC East title .

For the second time in three years , Pennington is The Associated Press 2008 NFL Comeback Player of the Year .
The Miami Dolphins star is the first player in the 11 seasons of the award to win it twice .
" This time last year , I 'm getting ready to watch the ball drop in Times Square .
No playoffs , no starting job , no anything , " Pennington said Wednesday , reflecting on the end of his 2007 season with the New York Jets .
" Now here we are playing in a wild - card playoff game with a team that was 1 - 15 the year before , " he added .
" We were able to move the dash over one and be 11 - 5 , so it 's pretty special . "
As special as the way Pennington turned around his fortunes .
This time , Pennington was coming back from being benched in New York last season , then discarded this summer when the Jets acquired Brett Favre .
Two years ago , Pennington returned from two rotator cuff operations in eight months in 2005 and led the Jets to the playoffs to grab comeback honors .
What 's his secret ?
" Get hurt the following year and then come back , " he said , laughing .
" It 's a reflection upon this organization and upon my teammates .
This could have easily been an awkward situation with the new guy coming in the day of the first preseason game .
It could have been a situation where there could have been sides chosen .
These guys in this locker room wanted no part of that .
They just wanted whoever to come in and help win .
" It has been a blessing .
I 've been blessed to have good teammates and good coaches and I 'm real thankful . "
The Dolphins needed to lean on Pennington as a leader as much as a passer .
They rallied around his work ethic , his preparation and his cool demeanor in the toughest circumstances , and it resulted in an AFC East championship , Miami 's first since 2000 .
" One of the things Chad has been tremendous with is he has been able to take the message you send every day to the team , " said coach Tony Sparano , a prime contender for AP Coach of the Year .
" From my standpoint , it 's almost like you have another coach in the locker room all the time .
To have a guy like him be a little bit of the torch carrier with your message to the team is very important .
" It was very special for the entire organization for Chad to be able to get that award . "
HONG KONG  Nissan Motor joined Toyota , Mazda and Mitsubishi on Monday in forecasting a loss for the current financial year , and announced it was cutting 20,000 workers in one of the most aggressive cutbacks so far by a Japanese company since the start of the global downturn .
The announcement reflected a growing urgency among Japanese manufacturers as it becomes clear that the downturn and the strength of the yen is hitting Japan more severely than expected .
“ In every planning scenario we built , our worst assumptions on the state of the global economy have been met or exceeded , with the continuing grip on credit and declining consumer confidence being the most damaging factors , ” Nissan ’s chief executive , Carlos Ghosn , said in a statement .
“ Looking forward , our priority remains on protecting our free cash flow and taking swift , adequate and impactful actions to improve our business performance . ”
Over the last two weeks , sharp earnings revisions and job cuts have been announced by nearly all of Japan ’s best - known companies , including Toyota , Sony , Hitachi , NEC , Hitachi and Panasonic .
Toyota Motor , the world ’s largest car manufacturer , on Friday forecast a net loss of 350 billion yen , or $ 3.8 billion , for the year , its first since 1950 .
THE HAGUE , Netherlands , Jan. 9 ( UPI ) -- Dutch Education Minister Ronald Plasterk says an orthodox Christian group will no longer receive a subsidy after allegedly attempting to cure homosexuality .
Plasterk said this week that the annual government subsidy provided to the Our Way foundation will be no more due to the Christian group 's suspected attempts to alter the sexual orientations of gay and lesbian individuals , Radio Netherlands / Expatica said Friday .

The Our Way group responded by claiming the religious organization does not support any other groups that target homosexuals and their sexual orientations .
" Our subsidy is intended to promote an open discussion of homosexuality among orthodox Christians , " the group said .
" It is out of the question that we support clubs that advocate helping people to get rid of their homosexual feelings . "
After the initial allegation of gay cure research appeared in a publication , Members of Parliament Boris van der Ham and Anouchka van Miltenburg pushed for the removal of the subsidy , which amounted to $ 67,000 a year .
The NYPD officer caught on tape bodyslamming a cyclist to the curb during a group Critical Mass ride through Times Square last July has been fired .
Though charges of assault , harassment and filing a bogus police report are still pending against rookie cop Patrick Pogan , a spokesman for the NYPD confirmed that he was dismissed ten days ago and that the termination was directly related to the Critical Mass incident .
But Stuart London , a lawyer for Pogan , tells the Times the NYPD did n't fire his client — he quit in order to " concentrate his efforts on fighting the criminal charges that are against him , so that when he is ultimately acquitted he can reapply to the Police Department . "
Referring to the NYPD 's claim that Pogan was canned , London says , " They make errors all the time . "
Indeed !
A spokesperson for advocacy group Times Up had this to say : " The NYPD is taking a heavy hand on dealing with this police officer , but we hope that Mayor Bloomberg will direct the higher - ups at the NYPD to discontinue their pattern of dangerous tactics and selective enforcement against cyclists . "
The Lowe ’s Companies , the nation ’s second - biggest home improvement retailer after Home Depot , said Friday that its fourth - quarter profit dropped 60 percent , and it forecast 2009 earnings short of Wall Street ’s expectations .
The latest results narrowly missed analysts ’ estimates as consumers spent less on items for their houses amid a deepening recession .
Its shares fell 6.6 percent , to $ 15.86 .
Earnings declined to $ 162 million , or 11 cents a share , in the three months ended in Jan. 30 , from $ 408 million , or 28 cents a share , in the period a year ago .
The retailer said revenue fell 4 percent , to $ 9.98 billion from $ 10.4 billion a year ago .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 12 cents a share on revenue of almost $ 10.1 billion .
Those estimates typically exclude one - time items .
Fast PFNETs in Erlang 14 February 2009
Introduction
Posted by Oliver Mason in algorithm
Pathfinder Networks ( PFNETs ) are networks derived from a graph representing proximity data .
Basically , each node is connected to ( almost ) every other node by a weighted link , and that makes it hard to see what ’s going on .
The Pathfinder algorithm prunes the graph by removing links which are weighted higher than another path between the same nodes .
For example : A links to B with weight 5 . A also links to C with weight 2 , and C links to B with weight 2 .
Adding up the weights , A to B direct is 5 , A to C to B is 4 .
Result : we remove the link from A to B , as the route via C is shorter .
There are different ways to calculate the path lengths ( using the Minkowski r-metric ) , but you get the general idea .
The resulting PFNET has fewer links and is easier to analyse .
In Schvaneveldt ( 1990 ) an algorithm for computing PFNETs is given , but it is rather complex and computationally intensive .
There is an improved algorithm called Binary Pathfinder , but that is apparently more memory intensive .
Not very promising so far , but then along comes A new variant of the Pathfinder algorithm to generate large visual science maps in cubic time , by Quirin , Cordón , Santamaría , Vargas - Quesada , and Moya - Anegón .
This algorithm is a lot faster ( by about 450 times ) , but has one disadvantage : speed is traded in for flexibility .
The original Pathfinder algorithm has two parameters , r ( the value of the Minkowski metric to be used ) and q ( the maximum length of paths to be considered ) .
The fast algorithm only has r , and always uses the maximum value for q ( which is n - 1 ) .
I know too little about the application of PFNETs to say whether this is important at all ; for the uses I can envisage it does not seem to matter .
As added bonus , the algorithm in pseudo code in Quirin et al. is very short and straightforward .
They ’re using a different shortest - path algorithm to identify , erm , shorter paths .
And then it ’s very simple to prune the original network .
A picture tells more than 1 K words , so here instead of 2000 words the before and after , graph layout courtesy of the graphviz program :
Here , each node is linked to every other node .
Running the PFNET algorith on it , we get the output shown in the second figure .
If you compare the output with the actual result from Schvaneveldt ’s book ( p.6/7 ) , you ’ll realise that it is not identical , and the reason for that is that the example there limits the path - length , using the parameters ( r = 1 , q = 2 ) rather than ( r = 1 , q = n - 1 ) as in the example shown here .
As a consequence , the link from N1 to N4 ( with a weight of 5 ) disappears , because of the shorter path ( N1 - N2 - N3 - N4 , weight 4 ) .
But that path is too long if q is just 2 , and so it is kept in Schvaneveldt ’s example .
Implementation
It is not possible to implement the pseudo - code given in Quirin et al directly , as they use destructive updates of the link matrix , which we obviously cannot do in Erlang .
But the first , naïve implementation , is still quite short .
The input graph is represented as a matrix ( n x n ) where each value stands for the link weight , with zero being used to indicate non-existing links .
I have written a function that creates a dot file from a matrix , which is then fed into graphviz for generating images as the ones shown above .
There are basically two steps : creating a matrix of shortest paths from the input matrix , and then generating the PFNET by comparing the two matrices ; if a certain cell has the same value in both matrices , then it is a shortest path and is kept , otherwise there is a shorter path and it ’s pruned .
Here is the main function :
find_path ( Matrix ) -> Shortest = loop1 ( 1, length ( Matrix ) , Matrix ) , generate_pfnet ( Matrix , Shortest , [ ] ) .
Next we have the three loops ( hence ‘ cubic time ’! ) of the Floyd - Warshall shortest path algorithm to create the shortest path matrix :
loop1 ( K , N , Matrix ) when K > N -> Matrix ; loop1 ( K , N , Matrix ) -> NewMatrix = loop2 ( K,1 , Matrix , Matrix , [ ] ) , loop1 ( K+1, N, NewMatrix ) .
loop2( _ , _ , _ , [ ] , Acc ) -> lists:reverse( Acc ) ; loop2 ( K , I , D, [ Row|Rest ] , Acc ) -> NewRow = loop3( K , I,1 , D , Row , [ ] ) , loop2 ( K , I+1, D , Rest , [NewRow|Acc ] ) .
loop3 ( _ , _ , _ , _ , [ ] , Acc ) -> lists:reverse( Acc ) ; loop3 ( K , I , J , D , [ X|Rest ] , Acc ) -> loop3( K , I , J+1 , D , Rest , [ min ( X , get ( I , K , D ) + get ( K , J, D ) ) |Acc ] ) .
The final line implements the Minkowski metric with r = 1 ; this could be expanded to include other values as well , eg r = 2 for Euclidean , or r = ∞ ( which seem to be the most common values in use ; the latter means using the maximum weight of any path component along the full path ) .
And here are two utility methods , one to find the smaller of two values , and one to retrieve an element from a matrix ( which is a list of rows ) .
There is something of a hack to deal with the fact that zero does not mean a very small weight , but refers to a non-existing link :
min( X , Y ) when X < Y -> X ; min( _X , Y ) -> Y. get ( Row , Col , Matrix ) -> case lists : nth ( Col , lists : nth ( Row , Matrix ) ) of 0 -> 999999999 ; X -> X end .
And finally , generating the PFNET by comparing the two matrices ( again , awful hack included ) :
generate_pfnet ( [ ] , [ ] , Result ) -> lists : reverse( Result ) ; generate_pfnet ( [ R1|Rest1 ] , [ R2|Rest2 ] , Acc ) -> Row = generate_pfrow ( R1,R2 , [ ] ) , generate_pfnet ( Rest1 , Rest2 , [ Row|Acc ] ) . generate_pfrow ( [ ] , [ ] , Result ) -> lists : reverse( Result ) ; generate_pfrow ([ C|Rest1 ] , [ C|Rest2 ] , Acc ) -> case C of 999999999 -> C1 = 0 ; _ -> C1 = C end , generate_pfrow ( Rest1 , Rest2 , [ C1|Acc ] ) ; generate_pfrow ( [ C1|Rest1 ] , [ C2|Rest2 ] , Acc ) -> generate_pfrow( Rest1 , Rest2 , [ 0 |Acc ] ) .
Discussion
So this is the basic code .
It works , but there is scope for improvement .
it only currently generates PFNETs with ( r = 1 , q = n - 1 )
there is no parallelism , hence it ’s not really making use of Erlang ’s strengths .
the three loops do n’t look very elegant , and could probably be replaced by list comprehensions
Because of the matrix being updated , it does n’t look that easy to parallelise the processing , but it would work at the level of updating the individual rows .
If that can be done in parallel , it would probably provide some speed - up ( provided the matrix is not of a trivial size ) .
So the first step would be to change the matrix processing using lists : map / 2 , and replacing this then by pmap , as described in this article by Dave Thomas .
Once the code is up to scratch with full parallelism , and tested on larger matrices I will probably put it up on Google Code in case other people are interested in using it .
If you have any suggestions , tell me in the comments !

If we are serious about overcoming an anxiety disorder , we need to approach anxiety from every positive angle and perspective that we have available to us .
Therefore , we focus on three main areas , all three of which must be addressed in therapy :
1. COGNITIVE
( thinking / belief processes )
Here we learn new methods and ways to change our old thinking patterns and habits .
If we ’re always thinking and expecting the worst to happen , then we will continue to suffer .
We can train or condition our minds to think and respond differently than we have in the past .
Or think of it this way – our brain was conditioned to think and feel negatively , but NOW we can be reconditioned to think rationally and healthfully .
We have many dozens of specific methods and strategies that we use to overcome anxiety -- and you only need to find several methods that work well for you .
We usually start CBT ( cognitive - behavioral therapy ) at this stage .
Some effective cognitive - behavioral techniques are :
Slow - talk / slow walk / slowing down / relaxing
Stopping automatic negative thinking ( ANTs )
The acceptance paradox : how we keep the fires burning and how to put them out
Rational and helpful self - statements that become permanent and " automatic " thoughts
Continuing to move forward , step by step
Whose voice are you listening to , anyhow ?
Do we have to listen and believe all the old lies ?
The determination factor : becoming more focused and determined .
Determination is a powerful process .
It does not involve aggression or any other negative emotion .
It is a postive emotion that means , " I am serious about overcoming my anxiety .
If I work on therapy daily , and give it time and patience , I know I will gradually reduce my anxiety in these situations .
Focusing :
What are you paying attention to ?
Are you paying attention to what is rational ?
Or , are you still seeing things from an irrational , skewed perspective ?
Later , it ’s important we address perfectionism , anger , frustration , setbacks , and our view of the world .
2. BEHAVIORAL
( what we DO )
The behavioral aspect of therapy is the part where we actually put everything into place -- in everyday , real - life , practical situations where we are bothered by anxiety and depression .
This area is always handled at the same time or directly after cognitive therapy , because we need a strong foundation of cognitive and emotional skills and strategies so that we can begin living and acting differently before we confront real - life challenges .
Each and every anxiety symptom has a direct strategy that works , given your determination , time , and patience .
There are no roadblocks that cannot be overcome .
This stage is essential for people with anxiety problems ( such as social anxiety disorder ) and serves as a powerful adjunct to individual treatment for others .
3. EMOTIONAL
( relaxation / peaceful / strength , and power strategies )
It is important to have some type of relaxation or " de - stress " strategy that is accessible whenever we need it .
In this area , calmness and peace are the goals .
The more your brain is quiet and relaxed , the easier therapeutic information can get into it and be processed .
This is simply another way to let the therapy reach your brain and gently sink in .
Our focus is on peace and calmness here .
We do not focus on decreasing anxiety by using these methods .
Why ?
As peace and calmness become a little stronger , it tends to " crowd out " the anxieties and fears we have .
Therefore , we never need to focus on the anxiety , the nervousness , or the fear .
Our attention is on healing , healthiness , and inner peace .
All of this is achievable in a good cognitive - behavioral group .

Nuclear Fusion - Fission Hybrid : A Possible Solution for Clean Nuclear Power
January 28th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Nuclear power is one of the most controversial alternative energies , partially due to the toxic waste it creates .
Now physicists at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a system that uses fusion to eliminate the transuranic wastes created by nuclear plants .
The scientists ’ proposed fusion - fission hybrid reactor contains a Compact Fusion Neutron Source ( CFNS ) that provides neutrons through fusion to a surrounding fission blanket that uses transuranic waste for nuclear fuel .
The neutrons augment the fission reaction , thus giving the waste incineration process efficiency and stability .
The CFNS , which has not yet been built , is based on a tokamak machine that uses a “ magnetic bottle ” to confine high temperature fusion plasmas .
While the idea for a fusion - fission hybrid has been batted around the scientific community for years , the UT physicists have invented a device that finally makes the CFNS possible : the Super X Divertor .
The Divertor can handle the heat and particle fluxes of compact devices , and enables the CFNS to produce large amounts of neutrons without destroying the system .
A prototype fusion - fission hybrid , however , is many years away — UT scientists still have to perform simulations , engineer their device , and seek funding .

A graphical approach to visualization Protovis
Protovis composes custom views of data with simple marks such as bars and dots .
Unlike low - level graphics libraries that quickly become tedious for visualization , Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode data , allowing inheritance scales and layouts to simplify construction .
Protovis is free and open - source , provided under the BSD License .
It uses JavaScript and SVG for web - native visualizations ; no plugin required ( though you will need a modern web browser ) !
Although programming experience is helpful , Protovis is mostly declarative and designed to be learned by example .
Protovis is no longer under active development .
D3.js , with improved support for animation and interaction .
D3 builds on many of the concepts in Protovis ; for more details , please read the The final release of Protovis was v3.3.1 ( 4.7 MB ) .
The Protovis team is now developing a new visualization library , , with improved support for animation and interaction .
D3 builds on many of the concepts in Protovis ; for more details , please read the introduction and browse the examples
This project was led by Mike Bostock and Jeff Heer of the Stanford Visualization Group , with significant help from Vadim Ogievetsky .
We welcome your comments and suggestions .
Updates
September 17 , 2010 - Release 3.3 is available on GitHub .
Getting Started
How does Protovis work ?
Consider this bar chart , which visually encodes an array of numbers with height :
var vis = new pv .
Panel ( ) . width ( 150 ) . height ( 150 ) ; vis . add ( pv . Bar ) . data ( [ 1 , 1.2 , 1.7 , 1.5 , . 7 , . 3 ] ) . width ( 20 ) . height ( function ( d ) d * 80 ) . bottom ( 0 ) . left ( function ( ) this .
index * 25 ) ; vis . render ( ) ;
This blue bar is rendered once per number , mapping the data to height using a little function ( d * 80 ) .
Thus , a mark represents a set of graphical elements that share data and visual encodings .
Although marks are simple by themselves , you can combine them in interesting ways to make rich , interactive visualizations .
To simplify construction , Protovis supports panels and inheritance .
A panel is a container for replicating marks .
Inheritance lets you derive new marks from existing ones , sharing some or all of the properties .
For example , here we derive labels for a rule and bar :
var vis = new pv .
Panel ( ) . width ( 150 ) . height ( 150 ) ; vis .
add ( pv . Rule ) . data ( pv . range ( 0 , 2 , . 5 ) ) . bottom ( function ( d ) d * 80 + . 5 ) . add ( pv . Label ) ; vis .
add ( pv . Bar ) . data ( [ 1 , 1.2 , 1.7 , 1.5 , . 7 ] ) . width ( 20 ) . height ( function ( d ) d * 80 ) . bottom ( 0 ) . left ( function ( ) this .
index * 25 + 25 ) . anchor ( " bottom " ) . add ( pv . Label ) ; vis . render ( ) ;
The rule ’s label inherits the data and bottom property , causing it to appear on the rule and render the value ( datum ) as text .
The bar ’s label uses the bottom anchor to tweak positioning , so that the label is centered at the bottom of the bar .

Travelling into Palestine ’s West Bank and Gaza Strip , which I visited recently , is like a surreal trip back into an apartheid state of emergency .
It is chilling to pass through the myriad checkpoints — more than 500 in the West Bank .
They are controlled by heavily armed soldiers , youthful but grim , tensely watching every movement , fingers on the trigger .
Fortunately for me , travelling in a South African embassy vehicle with official documents and escort , the delays were brief .
Sweeping past the lines of Palestinians on foot or in taxis was like a view of the silent , depressed pass - office queues of South Africa ’s past .
A journey from one West Bank town to another that could take 20 minutes by car now takes seven hours for Palestinians , with manifold indignities at the hands of teenage soldiers .
My friend , peace activist Terry Boullata , has virtually given up her teaching job .
The monstrous apartheid wall cuts off her East Jerusalem house from her school , which was once across the road , and now takes an hour ’s journey .
Yet she is better off than the farmers of Qalqilya , whose once prosperous agricultural town is totally surrounded by the wall and economically wasted .
There is only one gated entry point .
The key is with the occupation soldiers .
Often they are not even there to let anyone in or out .
Bethlehem too is totally enclosed by the wall , with two gated entry points .
The Israelis have added insult to injury by plastering the entrances with giant scenic posters welcoming tourists to Christ ’s birthplace .
The “ security barrier ” , as the Â­Israeli ’s term it , is designed to crush the human spirit as much as to enclose the Palestinians in ghettoes .
Like a reptile , it transforms its shape and cuts across agricultural lands as a steel - and - wire barrier , with watchtowers , ditches , patrol roads and alarm systems .
It will be 700 km long and , at a height of 8 m to 9 m in places , dwarfs the Berlin Wall .
The purpose of the barrier becomes clearest in open country .
Its route cuts huge swathes into the West Bank to incorporate into Israel the illegal Jewish settlements — some of which are huge towns — and annexes more and more Palestinian territory .
The Israelis claim the purpose of the wall is purely to keep out terrorists .
If that were the case , the Palestinians argue , why has it not been built along the 1967 Green Line border ?
One can only agree with the observation of Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad , who has stated : “ It has become abundantly clear that the wall and checkpoints are principally aimed at advancing the safety , convenience and comfort of settlers . ”
The West Bank , once 22 % of historic Palestine , has shrunk to perhaps 10 % to 12 % of living space for its inhabitants , and is split into several fragments , including the fertile Jordan Valley , which is a security preserve for Jewish settlers and the Israeli Defence Force .
Like the Gaza Strip , the West Bank is effectively a hermetically sealed prison .
It is shocking to discover that certain roads are barred to Palestinians and reserved for Jewish settlers .
I try in vain to recall anything quite as obscene in apartheid South Africa .
Gaza provides a desolate landscape of poverty , grime and bombed - out structures .
Incon - gruously , we are able to host South Africa ’s Freedom Day reception in a restaurant overlooking the splendid harbour and beach .
Gunfire Â­rattles up and down the street , briefly interrupting our proceedings , as some militia or other celebrates news of the recovery from hospital of a wounded comrade .
Idle fishing boats bob in long lines in the harbour , for times are bad .
They are confined by Israel to 3 km of the coast and fishing is consequently unproductive .
Yet , somehow , the guests are provided with a good feast in best Palestinian tradition .
We are leaving through Tel Aviv airport and the Israeli official catches my accent .
“ Are you South African ? ’ he asks in an unmistakable Gauteng accent .
The young man left Benoni as a child in 1985 .
“ How ’s Israel ? ” I ask .
“ This is a f** ked - up place , ” he laughs , “ I ’m leaving for Australia soon . ”
“ Down under ? ” I think .
I ’ve just been , like Alice , down under into a surreal world that is infinitely worse than apartheid .
Within a few hours I am in Northern Ireland , a guest at the swearing in of the Stormont power - sharing government of Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness .
Not even PW Botha or Ariel Â­Sharon were once as extreme as Ian Paisley in his most riotous and bigoted days .
Ireland was under England ’s boot for 800 years , South Africa ’s colonial - apartheid order lasted 350 years .
The Zionist colonial - settler project stems from the 1880s .
The Israeli ruling class , corrupt and with no vision , can no longer rule in the old way .
The Â­Palestinians are not prepared to be suppressed any longer .
What is needed is Palestinian unity behind their democratically elected national government , reinforced by popular struggles of Palestinians and progressive Israelis , supported by international solidarity .
South Africa ’s stated position is clear .
The immediate demands are recognition of the government of national unity , the lifting of economic sanctions and blockade of the Palestinian territories , an end to the 40 - year - old military occupation and resumption of negotiations for a two - state solution .
On a final note , the invitation to Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh as head of a national unity government was welcomed by President Mahmoud Abbas , and will be dealt with by our government .
As they say in Arabic : “ Insha ‘ Allah [ God- willing ] . ”

Adapter are still experiencing the distortion issues , but now Apple Engineering is supposedly telling people this is only compatible with the Apple Cinema Display .

Reader
Yoel reports that AppleCare has contacted him to say Engineering retroactively decided the adapters are ONLY compatible with the 30 - inch Apple Cinema Display , and not with any other 30 - inch displays on the market now .
They are , you know , " technically " compatible , except for the distortion issues we outlined here .

One , that 's really strange , since we do n't usually see companies retroactively take back support after a product has been released .
Two , users actually say that the distortion issue appears on Apple Cinema Displays too , which makes this whole thing sound kinda flimsy .
We 're still hoping for a software fix .

Why AICN Does n't Post Links To Stories Like This Christian
Bale thing that 's everywhere !
Published at : Feb. 3 , 2009 , 5:43 p.m. CST by headgeek
Hey folks , Harry here ...
I 'm getting slammed with assloads of people angry at me for not posting the Bale explosion from the set of McG's TERMINATOR : SALVATION .
Well , first off - there 's a real simple reason .
It is n't news .
And it certainly is n't cool news .
It is a moment in a man 's life taken completely out of context and most likely leaked to personally embarrass Christian Bale .
Now , I know what a lot of you are thinking ...
There 's no excuse for a temper tantrum like that to ever occur and if you are going to act that way , you deserve to be embarrassed by your own actions .
Except , you want to hear the REALITY behind that clip ?
I know this because I happen to be somewhere where someone that was there that day and for the shoot is .
And this person is n't a publicist , nor are they invested in Bale 's career .
They 're just someone that thinks it is absolute bullshit that this moment in Bale 's life is being aired and that the real story should get out there .
The DP on TERMINATOR SALVATION , Shane Hurlbut , is a apparently a light tweaker .
He 's a fairly young DP and likes to fiddle with his lights on set during action , which is a big " NO NO " on most productions unless worked out in advance with performers .
But apparently Shane was a pretty unrepentant light tweaker .
The scene in question , was a very emotional and tough scene between Christian Bale and Bryce Howard .
A scene that required soul bearing and a deep level of immersive concentration .
The sort of scene where everyone on set knows not to get in anyone 's eye lines , and definitely not to move lights around while FILMING .
You lock that shit down before the scene starts .
Bale had indeed warned the DP on multiple occasions about messing with lights while the cameras were rolling , and Bale was in the midst of a painful scene with Bryce , what was described to me as being the emotional center of the film and his character for the film .
Now , the reason I know all of this is because the person that was there , felt that it should be made perfectly clear that Christian Bale was the utmost gentleman and cool guy on set .
And the DP really was doing something that professional DPs with experience just do n't do .
Not during a performance .
You do n't need me to give you a link , it 's all over the internet , I just felt that you should know what really went down - and that this particular outburst did indeed modify the DP 's behavior - and for future DPs .
Fuck with the lights before and after your actors are acting .
Not during .
I stay out of the ' personal gossip ' arena because frankly ... can you imagine your personal shit aired for all to see .
None of us are perfect , and certainly we have all sinned to some degree .
Actors , Actresses , Celebrities and the people exploited on sites like TMZ .
They 're human beings that I personally feel are owed the same inalienable rights that the rest of us hold dear .
Can you imagine cameras documenting your every attempted private moment .
This moment was something that occurred in the heat of a moment on set between professionals .
The audio is so clear on Christian , that it 's obvious a mike was on him or a foot and a half above him .
These are the sorts of moments that are private affairs .
Yet somehow , because he 's an actor .
We feel it 's permissable to air his dirty laundry .
It is n't our business .
It is n't anybody 's fucking business .
Will this affect TERMINATOR SALVATION ?
Will this give us insight into his character ?
Only because I found some details out , do we know it was in the midst of a scene between him and Bryce Howard .
But that 's accidental ... and certainly has n't been revealed by CNN or any other media , because they just run the clip with BEEPS .
Is it funny ?
I suppose it may be .
It allows regular people to laugh , point fingers and call someone other than themselves an ASSHOLE .
But frankly , I find it disgusting .
It 's the exact thing that I made AICN to not be about .
I wrote this , not to create an endless TALKBACK , but to express my opinion on the spreading of stories like this and making Christian look bad , when he is n't .
Next month , New Zealand is scheduled to implement Section 92 of the Copyright Amendment Act .
The controversial act provides ' Guilt Upon Accusation ' , which means that if a file - sharer is simply accused of copyright infringement , they are immediately guilty .
The punishment - summary Internet disconnection .
The term “ 3 Strikes ” is a familiar one to those monitoring attempts to crack down on illicit file - sharing .
Many countries are looking at proposals which if implemented , would mean that a ‘ graduated response ’ is taken against those accused of online copyright infringement .
‘ Strike One ’ would earn the infringer a warning , ‘ Strike Two ’ would result in a slowing of the user ’s Internet connection , with Internet disconnection proposed on a third accusation .
However draconian these proposals might appear , they are nothing compared to the proposed ‘ Section 92 ’ of the Copyright Amendment Act in New Zealand .
Scheduled for introduction at the end of February 2009 , the act assumes that any individual simply accused of sharing copyright works on the Internet , is guilty .
The punishment for ‘ guilty ’ is summary disconnection from the Internet .
Understandably , this proposal has n’t been well received by many outside of the entertainment industries .
Indeed , RIANZ , New Zealand ’s answer to the RIAA , has been a vocal supporter .
One group voicing dissent is The Creative Freedom Foundation .
On December 18th the group launched with the aim to “ unite artists who are against the removal of New Zealander ’s rights through proposed changes in Copyright law , done in the name of protecting creativity . ”
Foundation Co-Founder and Director , Bronwyn Holloway - Smith is strongly opposed to Section 92 , which she says threatens Internet disconnections “ without evidence or even a trial . ”
“ The result of this law could be that one rogue employee or even one virus infected computer could bring down a whole organization ’s internet and it ’s highly likely that schools , businesses , hospitals , and phone services will be harmed by this , ” she said .
Hollyway - Smith warns that as the government has shown support for the bill , unless there is a major public protest against it the proposals will “ roll over into law ” – just 54 days from now .
To this end , the foundation has started a petition and campaign against the “ Guilt Upon Accusation ” laws , called “ Not in my Name ” .
The petition can be signed on the Creative Freedom Foundation website .

Scientists are watching closely to see if small faults crossing under the Salton Sea are transferring energy to the larger , more dangerous San Andreas fault after a series of small quake swarms in the area .
The quakes appeared to be tapering off by Monday afternoon , according to the monitoring system run by the U.S. Geological Survey and Caltech .
But in a 48 - hour period starting Saturday morning , 42 quakes shook just south of Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea .
The quakes ranged in magnitude from 0.5 to 3.3 , with three larger than 3.0 hitting the area Saturday afternoon .
Scientists are particularly interested in the area because an earthquake that starts in Bombay Beach and ripples northwest along the San Andreas fault could be the Big One that devastates Los Angeles , said Graham Kent , a research geophysicist at UC San Diego .
These quakes appear to be taking place at the hazy intersection of several recently mapped faults crossing beneath the Salton Sea and the the San Andreas fault .

The worry for scientists comes from a case in 1987 , when a magnitude - 6.2 earthquake on one of the crossing faults appeared to trigger a 6.6 quake 12 hours later on the Superstition Hills fault to the south .
The San Andreas fault is north of these crossing faults and the geometry is similar , Kent said .
This swarm , he said , “ is a flashing yellow light that tells you to be prepared and to spend some time trying to understand the significance . ”
These last time a swarm of this type occurred in the area was 2001 , so they are not especially unusual , said Kate Hutton , a seismologist at Caltech .
Hutton said scientists do not yet know if quakes this small can trigger anything dangerous on the San Andreas .

“ Every time you have a swarm of earthquakes , it does raise the chances of having a larger quake , but it does n’t raise it a huge number , ” she said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sales of newly built U.S. single - family homes unexpectedly rose at their fastest pace in 10 months in February , while prices fell by a record margin from a year ago , a government report showed on Wednesday .
The Commerce Department said sales rose 4.7 percent to a 337,000 annual pace , the fastest increase since April last year , from an upwardly revised 322,000 in January .
Despite the increase , February sales were the second lowest ever after the drop in January to the slowest pace in records going back to 1963 , the department said .
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales at a 300,000 rate in February .
The median sales price in February fell a record 18.1 percent to $ 200,900 from a year earlier , the department said .
The median marks the half - way point , with half of all houses sold above that level and half below .
The inventory of homes available for sale in February was at 330,000 , the smallest since June 2002 .
The February sales pace left the supply of homes available for sale at 12.2 month ’s worth .
Google has banned the term " netbook " from being used in ads placed on its wildly popular Adsense network .
Why , you ask ?
Well apparently , the term " netbook " is a trademark owned by Psion .
Anyone remember Psion 's Netbook Pro? No ?
You are n't alone .
Last year when the netbook world started heating up , Psion was warning manufacturers that it owned the trademark on " netbook " and I suspect that , considering the Psion netbook is nothing but a memory of a little bag of fail , the company may be looking to sell the trademark .
Either that or they are hoping to launch a netbook people will actually buy and want to have the only " netbook " on the market .
Google informed advertisers that " netbook " could no longer be used in ads they place , chalking up a win for Psion .
Where exactly this trademark war will go is hard to say .
" Netbook " is a word used by consumers , the media , and even Intel to describe products in a generic manner .
A trademark becomes difficult to enforce and perhaps even unenforceable if the trademarked term becomes generic .
Should Psion succeed in killing off the term " netbook " as a way to describe the current litany of small and cheap notebooks on the market , what will we call them ?
Will we revert to the sub - notebook moniker or coin a new phrase ?
What do you think we should call them ?

Ministers have accused Harriet Harman , the deputy Labour leader , of already plotting how to succeed Gordon Brown if the party loses the next general election .
With the latest polls showing the Tories opening up a 20 - point lead over Labour , fellow ministers believe Ms Harman is deliberately distancing herself from the Prime Minister and trying to appeal to party members at the expense of the Government .
Last week Ms Harman launched an outspoken attack in a cabinet meeting on the culture of greed in the City , calling for a retrospective clawback of the bonuses paid to executives in banks bailed out by the taxpayer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Her comments , which rapidly became public , put her at odds with colleagues who argued that bankers ’ contracts could not be torn up and that such action would wreck Labour ’s reputation for being business - friendly .
It also went far beyond Mr Brown ’s preference for a clamp down on future bonuses rather than those that have already been paid .
One minister said last night : “ She is trying to appeal to the party , rather than the country ” and added that she should be “ reined in ” .
Ms Harman has also championed moves to require public sector bodies , such as schools and councils , to take social class into account in the allocation of money , services and jobs .
To the irritation of colleagues , she signalled her support for proposed anti-discrimination legislation to “ embed ” considerations of social class , alongside sex and ethnicity , in the decisions of civil servants .
Such moves are popular – particularly with the Labour left – but put her at odds with Mr Brown and official government policy .
Fellow ministers suspect that she is trying to position herself for a future leadership contest by spearheading such criticisms .
They are particularly angry that she appears to be distancing herself from the PM at a time when cabinet unity is under pressure , claiming that his tacit support for her deputy leadership campaign helped clinch her victory .
The accusations were strongly denied last night by a spokeswoman for Ms Harman , who insisted that her loyalty to the Prime Minister was not in doubt , saying : “ She is a very loyal deputy .
She always has been and she always will be . ”
But as tensions ran high yesterday , Labour figures suggested she could have been the source of a claim in The Guardian that Mr Brown was being touted by the German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , for a new job as a global financial watchdog .

The author of the report – dismissed by Downing Street sources as “ complete fantasy ” – was Jackie Ashley , who is known to be close to Ms Harman .
However , the suggestion that Ms Harman was behind the report was dismissed as nonsense last night by a spokeswoman for the Labour deputy leader .
But one frontbench colleague said : “ Harriet is being pumped up by a small clique of admirers .
She is n’t exactly discouraging it and it ’s not helpful . ”
In a reference to Mr Brown ’s discreet support for her in the deputy leadership contest , he added : “ She should remember how she got her job and who voted for her . ”
MPs believe Ms Harman is bound to stand in a future leadership contest , if only to ensure a woman ’s name is on the ballot paper .
She has told allies that she was playing a “ long game ” and that the party needed articulate women in its higher echelons .
Close supporters told her , after she got the better of a Prime Minister ’s Question Time clash with William Hague last year , that she had the fighting spirit and popular appeal to succeed Mr Brown .
Ms Harman , who is also Labour chair , the Leader of the House of Commons and minister for Women and Equality , has also attacked sexism in the City .
She has set up a review of pay in the finance sector , arguing it discriminates against women , and criticised the widespread use of lap - dancing clubs to entertain clients .
The consensus at Westminster is that she has little chance of victory , with one party source insisting yesterday : “ The idea that she would ever be elected leader is laughable . ”
She was similarly written off in the deputy leadership election 18 months ago , but narrowly saw off Alan Johnson to win the post in the fourth round of counting .
Her high - profile post chairing the party and her appeal to Labour ’s grassroots guarantees a strong vote even if she does not clinch the top job .
An Ipsos MORI poll for Sky News yesterday gave the Tories a 20 - point lead over Labour , suggesting that the “ Brown bounce ” had fizzled out .
It put the Conservatives on 48 per cent ( up four points ) , Labour on 28 per cent ( down two ) and the Liberal Democrats on 17 per cent ( unchanged ) .
If replicated at a general election the figures would put David Cameron in Downing Street with an overwhelming majority of more than 200 .
The haemorrhage of support for Labour since the beginning of the year sets the scene for a grim night for the party on 4 June , when European and local council elections take place .
There are growing fears in Labour headquarters that it could finish third behind the Liberal Democrats , triggering a fresh round of speculation over whether Mr Brown should be replaced before the election , which is due in 2010 .
Party people :
The other contenders
Ed Balls Schools Secretary
Remains one of Gordon Brown ’s closest confidants and likely to be his choice for leader .
Would attempt to appeal to the soft left and would cite his economics background as a key qualification .
Led the Government ’s robust response to the Baby P scandal .
Jon Cruddas MP for Dagenham
Won plaudits for his deputy leadership campaign 18 months ago and has steadfastly refused to join the Brown administration .
Admired by the party ’s grassroots for campaigns for more social housing and higher taxes for the best - off .
His blunt style could turn off Middle England .
Alan Johnson Health Secretary
Preferred choice of many Labour MPs , who believe his down - to - earth style would produce a useful contrast to David Cameron .
But his age – he will be 60 if the election is in 2010 – could mean he is only a short - term damage - limitation candidate .
David Miliband Foreign Secretary
Six months ago he was the clear front - runner , but he had a disastrous party conference and was slapped down as a “ novice ” by the PM .
Almost certain to stand in the next contest , representing himself as a generational change and able to reach to all sections of the party .
Ed Miliband Climate Change Secretary
Fast coming up on the rails , highly ambitious beneath the affable exterior .
He was urged to resign over the controversial plans to expand Heathrow airport – which would then have given him “ distance ” from a Labour loss at the next general election .
Worcester County Jail Planning Wind Turbine Installation
February 3rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Worcester County Jail is jumping on the renewable energy bandwagon and installing a wind turbine test tower for a 12 month trial .
The 160 foot tall meteorological tower will gauge wind speed , direction , and turbulence at the prison site .
Noise levels , environmental area , and air space will also be evaluated .
If the year - long evaluation goes well , the jail plans on installing a 2.5 MW wind turbine — potentially enough power for over 500 households .
Eventually , the Sheriff ’s Office will install 2 more similarly sized turbines .
The turbines , which should more than cover the jail ’s electricity use , will save the county $ 350,000 — much needed cash in an economic climate that has caused many cities to go bankrupt .
Extra power will be sold back to the municipal grid .

I do n't know quite what to say about Japan 's GDP numbers ; horrifying is the word that springs immediately to mind .
Free fall is the second : it declined at an annualized pace of nearly 13 % last quarter , as exports plummeted and companies slashed investment .
And the Wall Street Journal says the decline is n't finished yet :
Already , data point to further deterioration in the economy .
Industrial output is expected to drop by around 20 % during the first quarter , a government survey says .
After tumbling by a record 35 % in December , exports sank 46 % from a year earlier during the first 20 days of January .
In this environment , the jobless rate could climb to an all - time high of 6 % or so later this year , from 4.4 % in December , economists say .
It was n't long ago that I was pleased to start writing that Japan was creeping out of more than a decade of doldrums ; now it seems to me that this was just the very tail end of America 's credit bubble , as our uncontrolled spending boosted demand in an economy that was still fundamentally weak .

Does organic food really taste better ?
At TheCooksDen , we decided to apply the scientific method to that important question .
We brought in an unbiased test subject — one who has superior taste buds , is unaffected by marketing hype , and is unafraid to express her opinions publicly .
Meet Hammy the Hamster .
Hammy was kind enough to participate in hours of rigorous testing in order to get to the bottom of this critical issue .
Read on for the results — they just may surprise you .
Highlights
First off , a bit about our technique is in order .
Hammy was asked to repeatedly choose between an organic food item and a conventional item of the same type .
Click on this video to see documentation of several test trials .
Outtakes
Of course , Hammy was not always so cooperative .
Like a well - trained athlete , sometimes she just was n't up to her best .
Below see video documentation of several trials where Hammy was not quite so interested in our scientific quest .
Results
When all was said and done , Hammy chose organic .
In over sixty percent of the trials that resulted in a clear selection , Hammy opted for the organic item .
Below is the summary of results , broken down by individual food item .
Hammy was ' indifferent ' frequently , choosing to groom herself , rest or run away entirely .
Those trials are noted below as well .
Organic Conventional Indifferent Banana 6 3 5 Walnut 3 5 3 Strawberry 5 2 4 Carrot 7 3 4 Broccoli 4 3 7 Cheese 6 2 3 Total 31 18 26
For five out of the six food types , Hammy preferred organic .
She did , however , seem to have a preference for conventional walnuts over organic .
This fascinating inconsistency deserves further investigation and will no doubt be the subject of follow - up research .
More Info and Music Credits
Of course , no hamsters were harmed during the filming of these movies .
In fact , Hammy got a pretty good feast out of the deal .
Music for the videos was provided by Kevin MacLeod at Incompetech.com .
If you 're looking for music for your movie , I highly recommend his site .
Got some ideas on what Hammy should try out next ?
Maybe a convection oven or a high - end saute pan ?

A WEEK or so ago America was seized by a spasm of fury over the bonuses paid to executives at AIG , a troubled insurance company .
Across the country Americans were enraged that people who had helped to cause the financial meltdown were being rewarded for their incompetence .
And Washington responded in kind .
Congressmen queued up before the television cameras to tell everybody how upset they were .
Larry Summers , the president 's chief economic adviser , described the bonuses as “ outrageous ” .
Even Barack Obama tried to drop his ultra -cool persona to say how “ angry ” he was .
The House voted overwhelmingly to impose a 90 % tax on such bonuses .
The media responded to the storm of outrage by producing a stream of articles on American populism — the political disposition that damns established institutions , from Wall Street to Washington , and tries to return power to “ the people ” .
Newsweek devoted almost an entire issue to the subject .
But no sooner was the ink dry on these articles than the populist storm seemed to blow itself out .
Many of the journalists who had been fanning the flames of anger attended a white - tie Gridiron Dinner in Washington on March 21st to perform silly song - and - dance routines .
Wall Street rallied two days later when the treasury secretary , Tim Geithner , published his plan to tackle toxic assets held by banks .
Steny Hoyer , the House majority leader , suggests that bonus legislation “ may not be necessary ” now that 15 of the top 20 “ bonus babies ” at AIG have agreed to give their bonuses back .
Was the fuss over AIG a sign of a new populist mood in America ?
Or was it just a storm in a teacup ?
It is hard to answer this question in a country in which anger is a form of entertainment and where the political parties have turned partisanship into a fine art .
Television personalities such as Bill O'Reilly are always angry about something or other .
Many of the politicians who proclaimed their outrage at the “ malefactors of great wealth ” are delighted to take campaign contributions from the very same malefactors .
But , for all that , there are good reasons for taking the resurgence of populism seriously .
One is the breadth of the discontent in the country .
Left - wingers complain that Mr Obama is selling out his supporters in order to rescue irresponsible financial institutions .
Right - wingers worry that he is using taxpayers ' money to save people from the consequences of their own profligacy .
This fear has plenty of resonance outside the world of political enthusiasts : a recent Harris poll shows that 85 % of Americans believe that big companies have too much influence on politicians and policymakers .
Another factor is the size of the slump .
America has lost almost 2 m jobs in the past three months .
The number of job openings is down 31 % from a year ago .
Consumer confidence is falling on all fronts .
Mortgage delinquencies are at a record high .
The future of attempts to stimulate the global economy is also in jeopardy : European leaders have implied that they will oppose pressure from Americans and Chinese to produce their own stimulus programme at the forthcoming G20 meeting .
America may be witnessing the return of an old - fashioned version of populism , driven by economic anxiety and directed at economic interests .
The people who gave the name to “ populism ” in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were worried about a prolonged agricultural depression and furious at the vested interests in Wall Street and Washington who , they thought , were responsible for that depression .
Populists accused the elites of turning America into a land of “ tramps and millionaires ” .
This brand of populism went underground during the boom years , but Franklin Roosevelt revived it during the Depression .
In one of his most passionate speeches , in 1936 , he attacked the “ economic royalists ” of big business and the Republican Party .
In the 1960s economic populism was trumped by cultural populism .
The Republican Party championed the interests of the “ silent majority ” against bra-burning feminists , civil - rights activists and effete liberals who were more interested in protecting the rights of criminals than preserving law and order .
The Democrats made desultory attempts to revive economic populism in 2000 and in 2004 : Al Gore campaigned for “ the people against the powerful ” and John Kerry denounced outsourcing companies .
But this proved to be no match for the Republicans ' cultural populism .
Now economic populism is returning to the heart of American politics .
This economic populism is made particularly potent by the long - term decline of faith in American institutions .
The General Social Survey has been polling Americans about their confidence in major institutions ( among other things ) since 1972 .
The preliminary data for 2008 show a marked drop in confidence in every American institution since 2000 except military ones and education .
The proportion of people expressing “ a great deal of confidence ” fell from 30 % in 2000 to 16 % in 2008 for big business , from 30 % to 19 % for banks , from 29 % to 20 % for organised religion , from 14 % to 11 % for the executive branch and from 13 % to 11 % for Congress .
It was up , to 52 % , for the armed services .
These figures are the stuff that nasty movements are made of .
Populism poses serious problems for both political parties , not least because the very institutions which they spend their lives squabbling over are some of the least respected in the country , just above television and the press .
The danger for Mr Obama and the ruling Democrats is that the administration is relying heavily on private investors and Wall Street banks to implement its various rescue plans .
This inevitably means rewarding some of the people who were responsible for the crisis .
The president hopes that his budget will channel destructive anger into support for his policies .
But he could also find his administration blown off - course or even swept aside by popular outrage .
This one is more of a personal thing for me ( since I homebrew ) , but Reason ’s Greg Beato has a nice story about the legalization of homebrewing .
After Prohibition , a little wrinkle in the law allowed home wine making , but not home beer making .
As the consolidation of the beer market reached its peak , people replaced homebrewing for necessity with homebrewing for flavor — despite the illegality .
I ’ve often called the legalization of homebrewing in 1978 “ the one good thing Jimmy Carter ever did ” ; I thought it was something he drove due to his brother .
The story , on the other hand , shows that it was one of those little changes almost snuck into a bill by an obscure congressman and passed with little debate or even fanfare .
Congress made a small change to remove an antiquated and unnecessary restriction on human freedom , and in 30 years we ’ve seen the American beer scene rise from the depths of homogeneity to become one of the most vibrant beer - making countries in the world .
A little liberty goes a long way .
Maybe the next step will finally be the legalization of home distilling ?

It was all about nationalism , militarism , war , torture , state secrets , attacks on privacy , the use of tax funds to subsidize “ conservative values , ” the outsourcing of government in a fascistic business - government partnership , the banning of products and services that government does n’t like , the regimentation of educational life , government impositions in the name of security , and so on .
It is the great merit of the end of the Bush years that many of these threats have receded , if only slightly .
Consider the problem of nationalism , for example .
The neoconservatives who ran the country during the last two Bush terms exploited this dangerous impulse for all it was worth .
If you were not for their wars , you were against America , and hence deserving of jail without trial .
The whole ideological apparatus of the Bush years was profoundly anti-intellectual , and while the neocons shouted down anyone who compared these years to the Third Reich or Mussolini , the ideological comparison was actually quite apt : right - wing government control stems from the same motives of exalting security , discipline , and chauvinism above liberty .
In two short months , however , that ethos has subsided , and it has been replaced by a threat from the left .
It is tragic that Obama should be president at all .
If we had a position called “ national well wisher , ” “ national greeter , ” or “ national symbol of accomplishment , ” he would be perfect for the job .
He is elegant and graceful and articulate , and inspires people in an unusual way .
As chief policymaker , however , he has revealed himself as nothing more than a two - bit socialist .
After all the ghastly statism of the Bush years , you might think that the left would back off from using power to achieve its aims .
Instead , they have learned nothing .
The left has been lying in wait for its chance .
As the Obama people entered the White House , it ’s as if they found a closet labeled “ failed ideas of the past . ”
They opened it and the contents spilled everywhere .
They started grabbing things and putting them in the regulatory books and in legislation .
What an amazing pile of junky , worn - out , bogus policy ideas !
Equal pay for equal work .
Infrastructure spending .
More money to the public schools .
Socialized medicine .
Rock - bottom interest rates .
Welfare !
Every wish granted by government .
Down with business .
Down with business failures .
Curbs on fat - cat pay .
Down with Wall Street .
Turn on the money spigots .
Expropriate the expropriators .
Subsidies for every lifestyle that flies in the face of bourgeois prejudice .
Thus are we again reminded of what a profound threat the left represents to liberty .
It ’s been more than a decade now since we ’ve seen this at work , and probably longer really .
Clinton was a pain but he was smart enough not to take his reigning ideological framework too seriously .
He actually showed some deference to reality from time to time .
The Obamaites are different .
They are woefully ignorant of economics .
They seem to actually believe all that socialist claptrap that has provided an excuse for innumerable foreign dictators : the idea that government is the source of wealth , and can make anything happen with the push of a button .
They see no limits to the possibility that government can make society perfect , righting every perceived social injustice , and bringing prosperity to all via stealing from the haves and giving it to the have - nots .
Is there inequality ?
Mandate equality .
Is there deprivation ?
Provide !
Recession ?
Spend hundreds of billions !
What we have here is not just a profound love of the state ; it is a profound confidence in the capacity of the unlimited state to create heaven on earth .
How does this square with the idea of human liberty , of social cooperation and the rights of all ?
Herein lies the great mystery of leftism .
The left seems oblivious to the relationship between their chosen means and their ends .
It ’s not that they hate liberty as such ; it is that they believe that it must always take a backseat to other social priorities like equality .
In the end , they have a tendency to build the total state and find themselves taken aback when the whole of society is caged .
Those Obamaites !
So compassionate , loving , universally minded , progressive — except that their ideological cousins managed to starve and destroy whole civilizations .
Loyalty to their creed means death because their ideology is the pathway to the gulag , and for one simple reason : their preferred means of social change is the state .
The state is always and everywhere a threat to liberty , and liberty is the basic building block of prosperity and civilization .
Despite the slogans about progress , the upshot of the Obama administration is as deeply reactionary as anything that Bush conjured up .
Despite all the hype and hope , what Obama offers is nothing new .
It amounts to the robber state and the regimentation of society , a plan that will kill off prosperity and the conditions that allow for it .
The Republicans are right to fight this tendency at every turn , for it represents a radical attack on all things truly American .
Worse still , by playing with the printing presses , the policy tendency here is also deeply dangerous .
It could destroy the dollar internationally and domestically , igniting a hyperinflation that no one will be able to control once it gets going .
One only wishes that the Republicans had been so principled when their president was in charge !
The Obama administration says that we have to give the stimulus time to work .
No need .
The stimulus will not work .
If we manage to pull ourselves out of this slump , it will be despite and not because of this stimulus package .
When putting together my book , I wondered which threat was actually more dangerous for us , the right or the left .
I ’m still not sure , for national socialism and international socialism are in close competition .
I ended up focusing on both .
It ’s a hard truth for Americans to face , that neither team in Washington is going to guard what we love the most .
That is something we are going to have to face .
Liberty is for the citizens to guard themselves .

Notes valued at millions of Zimbabwe dollars have been virtually worthless Zimbabwe is revaluing its dollar again , removing twelve zeros from the currency with immediate effect .
The country 's central bank is introducing seven new notes in an effort to stave off economic collapse .
The country is in the grip of world - record hyperinflation .
The most recent estimate in July 2008 put it at 231 m % .
Only last month , a Z$ 100 trillion note was introduced and the government moved to allow people to use foreign currencies alongside Zimbabwe 's dollar .
The announcement will see Z$ 1 trillion reduced to Z$ 1 .
The denominations of the new notes are Z$ 1 , Z$ 5 , Z$ 10 , Z$ 20 , Z$ 50 , Z$ 100 and Z$500 .
The governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe , Gideon Gono , said : " Yesterday 's trillionaires , I am sorry , will not be able to buy their favourite drink today , " according to the AFP news agency .
Mr Gono gave no updated inflation figures .
Given the choice of multiple currencies , who would want to trade in Zimbabwe dollars ?
John Robertson
Harare - based economist
Last year , the central bank was forced to take 10 zeros from the local unit in an effort to make the currency more manageable , but the zeros returned within a few months .
On Sunday , US $ 1 ( £ 0.71 ) was equal to Z$ 3 or Z$ 4 trillion .
In a separate bid to tackle inflation , the government last month allowed businesses to charge in foreign currencies and said those businesses could pay their workers in foreign currency .
Until then , only licensed businesses could accept foreign currencies , although it was common practice .
The government added that the country 's stock exchange , which has not traded for two months , would also be licensed to trade in foreign currency , once listed firms and the exchange provide evaluation criteria .
Humanitarian crisis John Robertson , a leading Harare - based economist , said Mr Gono 's latest statement contained some positive measures but did not go far enough .
" It would appear he is trying to restore the Zimbabwean dollar , but , given the choice of multiple currencies , who would want to trade in Zimbabwe dollars ? " he told the Reuters news agency .
Zimbabwe is also facing a deepening humanitarian crisis .
A cholera outbreak has killed more than 3,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
And the World Food Programme says seven million Zimbabweans are in need of food aid , up from 5.1 million in June .
The country 's situation has been worsened by the political crisis that resulted from last year 's disputed presidential elections .
But last week , Zimbabwe 's opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said his party would join a unity government with President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF .
After the announcement , former UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan led calls for world leaders to help rebuild Zimbabwe 's economy .

Easy Three - Step Mescaline Citrate
Materials needed :
1 ) Peruvian torch or San Pedro cactus powder
2 ) Lye ( use gloves and ventilation )
3 ) Xylene ( use gloves and ventilation )
4 ) Glass gallon jug with lid or stopper
5 ) Glass funnel
6 ) Glass jars
7 ) Citric acid
8 ) Long dropper pipette
9 ) Glass turkey baster
10 ) Measuring cup and teaspoon
11 ) Square Pyrex dish and fan for evaporation
Step 1 - Extraction : ( Base / Non-Polar )
Mix 1 - cup ( 300 grams ) lye into 3 quarts cold water , stirring constantly .
Let cool .
Pour into jug .
Add 2/3 cup ( 100 grams ) powdered cactus to the jug .
Mix well .
Add ~1 quart xylene to the jug .
Shake and roll to mix well .
Mix occasionally over the next 24 + hours as the lye breaks down the cactus .
Allow enough time for separation into layers before proceeding to the next step .
Step 2 - Salt : ( Acid / Polar )
Prepare acidic solution by diluting ½ teaspoon ( 2g ) citric acid into ½ cup ( 120 ml ) distilled water .
Collect top xylene layer from the jug using the baster , putting the xylene into a new jar .
Add approximately one - fifth of the prepared acidic water to the xylene jar .
Put the lid on the xylene jar and shake it up a few times .
Wait a couple minutes to settle .
Collect bottom water layer using a long dropper , putting the water into the evaporation dish .
Return xylene to the cactus solution and mix for another 24 hours .
( Optionally , you can add 1 Tbsp lye to the jug after the third extraction . )
Complete 5 extractions over 5 days to use all of the water .
Step 3 - Evaporation :
Pour liquid into a flat - bottomed glass dish under a fan in a low humidity / mild temp environment .
After a few days , scrape the residue from the dish and powder using a razor blade .
The powder will continue to dry over the next few days .
Makes 3 - 10 doses depending on potency of cactus and dosage desired .

Since citric acid is food safe , this is the safest recipe to release to the public .
I bet you could choke down another 50 milligrams .

for the salting step , it would probably be easier to freeze that water layer , then pour off the solvent would n't it ?

I suppose , but with long ( 9 " ) pipetes , you can get it done in 5 minutes instead of 5 hours .
BTW , just because citrate is a larger molecule , do n't think you will end up with less mescaline .
You 'll just get more product to work with .

This is n't necessarily safer than crystallizing with HCl , its the choice of almost all pharmaceutical companies and they release their product to the public as well .
Perhaps procedure - wise it might be safer working with citric acid over HCl because of safety issues / risk of worse chemical burns , but as far as being food safe all of the HCl evaporates out of your final product for the most part .

I do n't have a scale , so I 've just been winging it .
It 's a pretty friendly substance , so a little more or less wo n't send you off the deep end .
Try filling a 00 capsule , and see what that does for you .
Two capsules is a pretty good dose .
I have n't tried three , but it would probably melt the world .

Alright , here 's a picture of some more crystals .
I put the mescaline - containing water from each extraction into a small jar overnight and allowed the crystals to precipitate out .
I then removed the old water , and added clean water to the crystals and swirled it around to get them out of the jar .
I then collected the crystals in the collection dish and evaporated .

The Public Knowledge advocacy group stepped up its campaign to get the Federal Communications Commission to make it clear that wireless text messaging and short codes fall under the Communications
Act 's common carrier umbrella .
" Without such a classification , wireless carriers could decide who says what to whom through text messages , as well as who is allowed to use short codes to address those messages , " PK's Jef Pearlman wrote on his policy blog on Monday .
The group has sent a letter to the FCC explaining its position .
Short codes — those five - or six - number sequences you can punch on your cell phone to send or opt in for news and information — are everywhere .
You can send in a crime tip with the codes , get " mad love " advice ( good luck with this ) , participate in TV game shows , donate to charities , get political action updates , contact emergency medical services in a sports stadium , buy ring tones , and do tens of thousands of other salubrious or idiotic things with them .
But in September of last year , Verizon abruptly ended the short code Camelot days by refusing to give one to the pro-choice group NARAL .
The company said that its policies bar " highly controversial " or potentially " unsavory " messages .
As the public 's temperature rose over the move , the company reversed the decision .
Alas , once these things happen , you know how it goes — the regulatory question genie jumped out of the bottle .
Once out , it immediately asked whether the big wireless incumbents get to function as gatekeepers of short code content .
PK says no , no , no .
The crux its stance is that text and short code messaging should be classified as a common carrier service under Title II , Section 202 of the Communications Act .
In fact , let 's sweat the details here and quote the language .
( a) Charges , services , etc .
It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or
unreasonable discrimination in charges , practices , classifications ,
regulations , facilities , or services for or in connection with like
communication service , directly or indirectly , by any means or
device , or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or
advantage to any particular person , class of persons , or locality ,
or to subject any particular person , class of persons , or locality
to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage .
To some , the aforementioned may seem as if it settles the matter .
But not to Verizon , which argues that short codes do not constitute a " transmission based service , " and thus cannot be understood as citizens of Common - carrierland .
The company 's logic goes like so : " Any transmission service to and from the short code must be supplied separately , " Verizon told the FCC in mid-April .
So , if Ars is getting this right , short codes can't be classified as common carriage because they 're really just short cuts that trigger the data that you get after you send off the code .
PK responds that short codes are basically phone numbers , and a telco can't refuse a phone number to individuals or companies that it does n't like .
" Provisioning a phone number is part of the underlying voice service , " Pearlman argues .
" Likewise , provisioning a short code is part of an underlying text messaging service .
And carriers are not permitted to discriminate in any of these activities . "
But Verizon warns that putting short codes on the protected species list will have dire consequences , including the " widespread availability of legal and illegal adult content on mobile devices , including devices used by minors . "
Naked came the short code
At this point , it seems only right that Ars readers be treated to Verizon 's ad guidelines , which apply to commercial short code ad campaigns , in all their high Victorian glory .
The list of thou shalt nots include " anything that is obscene or indecent or that contains strong sexual , explicit or erotic themes . "
In case you can't figure it out yourself , that means anything depicting or promoting pedophilia , " non-consensual contact , " prostitution services , " nudity , nude beaches or naked cruises or resorts , " or escort services or strip clubs .
And let 's not have any " extreme profanity , " either .
But that 's the just the tip of the iceberg .
Verizon 's guidelines say that materials that promote or glorify " rape , torture , cannibalism , suffering or death " are out of bounds , as are adoption and organ transplant services , products made from endangered species , and hunting trips that guarantee that you 'll get to bump off at least an animal or two .
The list is also quite protective of numerous nonliving things .
No products that unscramble cable or satellite services , please , and no items that " promote software or techniques that bypass copyright protections . "
No knockoffs of designer products , Verizon warns .
No intel about guns and ammo available at gun shows .
And for goodness sake , no radar detectors or " products or sites that appear to facilitate or promote the evasion of laws . "
And while we 're at it , credit card repair services , " multilevel marketing schemes , " and Web sites " that have online gambling as a central theme " can take a walk — as can " products and sites of questionable legality . "
Verizon cites " miracle cure " sites as an example .
Beyond that , you get to figure out whether you are legal or not .
Oh , and outfits that promote " services , contests or games that predict winners of races or sporting events " also need not apply .
Finally , the wireless service reserves the right to block " hate speech " and any ad that " trivializes historic events such as the Holocaust , the Irish Famine or September 11th . "
The Armenian Massacre , the Trail of Tears , and the Inquisition did n't make the list , but the night is young .
To some , these guidelines may come off an obsessive - compulsive attempt to anticipate the objections of every conceivable interest group , from the animal rights crowd and gun controllers through the anti-porn screamers and MPAA / RIAA copyright squads .
The list could get progressively longer and more complicated if the FCC does n't relieve Verizon of its anxiously guarded role as Grand Bowdlerizer of Short Codes .
( CNN ) --
Two months before dying , a Virginia woman confessed to killing two women nearly 42 years ago , authorities said Friday , telling police she shot the women because they had taunted her for being a lesbian .
Constance Smootz Hevener , 19 , was shot to death at an ice cream shop where she worked in 1967 .
Sharron Diane Crawford Smith , 60 , confessed in a November 28 interview to shooting the women at a Staunton ice cream store in 1967 , authorities said .
" I was just pushed so far , " Smith said , according to a transcript of a police interview .
Smith was arrested and charged with first - degree murder in the deaths of Constance Smootz Hevener , 19 , and Hevener 's 20 - year - old sister - in - law , Carolyn Hevener Perry , according to CNN affiliate WVIR .
But health problems forced a postponement of a December court date , WVIR said , and Smith , who had heart and kidney problems , died January 19 .
Authorities on Friday said they consider Smith the guilty party and are working toward closing the case .
In a transcript of the police interview , Smith told police she and the women worked at High 's Ice Cream .
The night of the shooting , she went to the store to tell the women she could not work the next day and took her . 25 - caliber pistol with her .
" I was just going to tell them that I could n't work and one thing led to another . "
She acknowledged that teasing " about my lifestyle " had gone on for a while .
Asked how the victims knew about it , she said , " How do kids find out about anything ?
I mean , it was really unusual back then . "
She also said her stepfather had sexually abused her , but refused to elaborate on whether that played a role in the shootings or helped push her " over the edge . "
" I do n't know .
I 'm not trying to psychoanalyze it , " she said .
In other interviews with police , Smith said that she got into a physical altercation with Hevener at the store , which was consistent with evidence at the crime scene , Commonwealth Attorney Raymond Robertson said .
Bruises on Hevener 's body were inconsistent with injuries that would have resulted from a fall after being shot , he told reporters .
" She expressed shame in herself .
I never saw any tears .
She expressed her concern for the family members [ of the victims ] , as to bringing closure to this case , " police investigator Mike King said .
Smith told police she acted alone , authorities said .
But Staunton Police Chief Jim Williams said questions about the case remain .
" There will likely be questions surrounding this case we will never be able to answer , " he said .
One of those questions was the whereabouts of the murder weapon , but a late development Friday may have solved that mystery .
In the November interview , Smith told police she gave the weapon to a detective on the police force in 1967 , David Bocock , and that he buried it .
" He just said that it was sort of dangerous to have a gun , you could hurt somebody , " Smith said , according to the transcript .
" He said , ' I 'll fix it for you if you want . '
I figured it was the best thing to do . "
It was unclear whether Bocock , who died in 2006 , knew of Smith 's involvement in the murders .
The two knew each other , as Bocock taught Smith to shoot , but authorities said they were still investigating the relationship and whether Bocock was trying to cover for Smith .
Later Friday , the Staunton News - Leader newspaper reported its circulation manager had turned over to police a . 25 - caliber automatic handgun .
Kathy Myers told the newspaper that Bocock gave the gun to her now - deceased husband , a former Staunton police officer , in 1981 , telling him , " Do n't let anybody know I gave this to you . "
Myers said she forgot she had the gun until she saw the police news conference Friday , and turned it over to authorities .
Myers told the News - Leader that King said the gun matches the description Smith gave police .

Wikipedia is gearing up for an explosion in digital content with new servers and storage designed to handle larger photo and video uploads .
Video file sizes are quickly reaching the dozens and hundreds of megabytes , and the proliferation of high - megapixel cameras means even small photos can take up a few megabytes , says Brion Vibber , CTO at the Wikimedia Foundation , which operates Wikipedia .
Until early 2008 , the user - generated encyclopedia 's primary media file server had just 2TB of total space , Vibber says .
" For a long time , we just did not have the capacity [ to handle very large media files ] , " he says .
Wikipedia has since scaled up from 2TB to 24TB and now 48 TB of storage for its primary medial file server , and recently raised file upload limits from 20 MB to 100MB .
The amount of storage actually being used is about 5TB but that will grow quickly , Vibber says .
For example , users are uploading public domain classical music , and some recordings can last a half - hour .
Documentary films that are out of copyright are also being uploaded , and some users are struggling to keep files under the 100MB limit , according to Vibber .
Vibber 's long - term goal is to let users upload feature - length , high - quality videos , but in addition to capacity limits he says there are challenges related to getting files in the appropriate format and the physical movement of large files .
" There 's no limit , and there 's no practical limit , " Vibber says .
" The limits will get bigger and bigger to where it will be relatively easy for someone who has a legitimate need to upload a two - hour video of good quality . "
Wikipedia 's new servers and storage were supplied by Sun , which provided donations and special pricing on Sun Fire x4500 and x4150 servers and StorageTek arrays .
( Compare storage products . )
Wikipedia , which handles more than 10 billion page views a month , also uses Sun 's open source MySQL as its primary database software .
Wikimedia operates a primary data center in Tampa , Fla. , and caching centers in Amsterdam and South Korea , and has a total of 450 or so commodity servers from a mix of vendors , Vibber says .
The site 's technology goals this year and next include improving usability , making it easier to edit articles and upload videos and photos , and integration with media file sites like Flickr , he says .
The donations from Sun came in the midst of a big fundraising push by Wikimedia , which raised more than US $ 6 million from 125,000 donors , allowing it to fund operations through the end of its fiscal year on June 30 .

Equality Saturation : A New Approach to Optimization , Ross Tate , Michael Stepp , Zachary Tatlock , Sorin Lerner , POPL 2009 .
Optimizations in a traditional compiler are applied sequentially , with each optimization destructively modifying the program to produce a transformed program that is then passed to the next optimization .
We present a new approach for structuring the optimization phase of a compiler .
In our approach , optimizations take the form of equality analyses that add equality information to a common intermediate representation .
The optimizer works by repeatedly applying these analyses to infer equivalences between program fragments , thus saturating the intermediate representation with equalities .
Once saturated , the intermediate representation encodes multiple optimized versions of the input program .
At this point , a profitability heuristic picks the final optimized program from the various programs represented in the saturated representation .
Our proposed way of structuring optimizers has a variety of benefits over previous approaches : our approach obviates the need to worry about optimization ordering , enables the use of a global optimization heuristic that selects among fully optimized programs , and can be used to perform translation validation , even on compilers other than our own .
We present our approach , formalize it , and describe our choice of intermediate representation .
We also present experimental results showing that our approach is practical in terms of time and space overhead , is effective at discovering intricate optimization opportunities , and is effective at performing translation validation for a realistic optimizer .
Domestic violence can happen to men , not only to women , according to Group Health research in the June American Journal of Preventive Medicine .
" Domestic violence in men is under - studied and often hidden -- much as it was in women 10 years ago , " said study leader Robert J. Reid , MD , PhD , an associate investigator at the Group Health Center for Health Studies .
" We want abused men to know they 're not alone . "
His findings confirm some common beliefs but also debunk five myths about abuse in men :
Myth 1 : Few men experience domestic violence .
Many do .
In - depth phone interviews with over 400 randomly sampled adult male Group Health patients surprised Dr. Reid and his colleagues : 5 % had experienced domestic violence in the past year , 10 % in the past five years , and 29 % over their lifetimes .
The researchers defined domestic violence to include nonphysical abuse -- threats , chronic disparaging remarks , or controlling behavior -- as well as physical abuse : slapping , hitting , kicking , or forced sex .
Myth 2 : Abuse of men has no serious effects .
The researchers found domestic violence is associated with serious , long - term effects on men 's mental health .
Women are more likely than men to experience more severe physical abuse , said Dr. Reid .
" But even nonphysical abuse ---- can do lasting damage . "
Depressive symptoms were nearly three times as common in older men who had experienced abuse than in those who had n't , with much more severe depression in the men who had been abused physically .
Myth 3 : Abused men do n't stay , because they 're free to leave .
In fact , men may stay for years with their abusive partners .
" We know that many women may have trouble leaving abusive relationships , especially if they 're caring for young children and not working outside the home , " said Dr. Reid .
" We were surprised to find that most men in abusive relationships also stay , through multiple episodes , for years . "
Myth 4 : Domestic violence affects only poor people .
The study actually showed it to be an equal - opportunity scourge .
" As we found in our previous research with women experiencing domestic violence , this is a common problem affecting people in all walks of life , " said Dr. Reid .
" Our patients at Group Health have health insurance and easy access to health care , and their employment rate and average income , education level , and age are higher than those of the rest of the U.S. population . "
Myth 5 : Ignoring it will make it go away .
Not so .
" We doctors hardly ever ask our male patients about being abused -- and they seldom tell us , " said Dr. Reid .
" Many abused men feel ashamed because of societal expectations for men to be tough and in control . "
Younger men were twice as likely as men age 55 or older to report recent abuse .
" That may be because older men are even more reluctant to talk about it , " he added .
This study extends Group Health 's research on domestic violence , a.k.a. intimate partner violence .
The team 's previous publications have documented the prevalence , persistence , and health effects of domestic violence on women .
In the current study , they asked men the same questions that they had asked of women .
" Our team is concerned about abuse of people : of women as well as men , " Dr. Reid added .
" We do not want to downplay the seriousness of domestic violence as experienced by women . "

President Obama plans to rescind limits on federal funding for research on human embryonic stem cells by signing an executive order Monday , fulfilling a campaign promise to frustrated supporters of the scientific work .
The action has been eagerly anticipated by the thriving community of California stem cell research , centered in the Bay Area , which hopes to generate both a prosperous new industry and an arsenal of weapons against debilitating diseases .
White House aides confirmed Friday that Obama will announce a stem cell policy shift in an East Room ceremony .
He is expected to lift restrictions imposed by President George W. Bush in August 2001 .
Scientists in the Bay Area , one of the world 's top centers of stem cell research and arguably the strongest in the nation , said they expect that Obama will allow the National Institutes of Health to support research on hundreds of embryonic stem cell lines that did not qualify for federal funding under the Bush policy .
Bush had agreed with religious and conservative groups opposed on moral grounds to the extraction of stem cells from human embryos .
He limited NIH support to work on 21 embryonic stem cell lines that already had been created by 2001 .
But researchers protested that those cells were unsuitable for use as therapies and were inadequate for the exploration of the full scientific potential of stem cell studies .
Dr. Deepak Srivastava , director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease in San Francisco 's new biotechnology complex at Mission Bay , said Obama probably has timed his announcement to allow stem cell researchers to qualify for some of the billions of dollars to be provided to NIH under the nation 's stimulus package to jump - start the ailing economy .
Srivastava said California is well placed to capture a significant share of that federal money because the state 's $ 3 billion taxpayer - supported stem cell agency , the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , has already paid to train scientists , support research and build new laboratories .
The institute was created by a voter initiative in 2004 .
" We 're really ahead of the curve and in the best position to make the discoveries now that the federal government is going to be a player , " Srivastava said .
At least $ 200 million dedicated to stem cell research is part of a fast - tracked federal stimulus grant fund that could deliver money to labs as early as summer 's end , said Dr. Arnold Kriegstein , director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UC San Francisco .
" I do n't think they appreciate how much the floodgates will open , " said Kriegstein , who expects that the money could fund about 200 projects .
" I would n't be surprised if we had that many applications from UCSF alone . "
While the Bush policy significantly hampered stem cell research , it did not forbid private funding of the work .
Research teams throughout the country found alternate sources of support , and several states followed California 's lead and created grant programs .
Scientists and disease advocacy groups had chafed at the Bush restrictions because they saw in stem cell research the possibility of cures or more effective treatments for a broad range of diseases .
Embryonic stem cells retain the ability to transform into any of the specialized cell types that make up the body , such as nerve , muscle or skin cells .
The hope is that such cells could provide replacement tissues for many illnesses , including spinal cord injuries and diabetes .
But the scientific strategy raised ethical and moral objections that are not confined to concerns over the destruction of human embryos .
The early stage embryos are usually obtained from fertility clinics where clients have a surplus of embryos after completing their families .
Some embryos are also created specifically for research by swapping a new nucleus into an egg cell from a woman who must go through hormone treatments to induce egg production .
Such procedures raise thorny issues related to the risks of treatment , informed consent and the respectful handling of human material .
Kriegstein said the NIH took no leadership role in the formulation of ethical guidelines for much of stem cell work because it was not funding it .
Universities and other institutions have set up their own criteria , but Kriegstein said he hopes the NIH will help set national standards .
While Obama is free to allow NIH grant awards to study embryonic stem cell lines created since 2001 , other federal restrictions remain .
The agency will probably not be permitted to fund the actual derivation of new embryonic stem cells , under a federal law limiting embryo research called the Dickey - Wicker Amendment , Kriegstein said .
The state 's stem cell agency , however , can fund the creation of new embryonic stem cells , and these could presumably be studied with federal support if Obama acts as anticipated Monday .
The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine was set up by the voter initiative Proposition 71 to fund research that the federal government could not support under the Bush restrictions .
Robert Klein , a real estate developer who spearheaded the initiative , said the NIH is now eager to work with the institute .
" There was this oppressive ideological blockade of the development of medical science , " said Klein , who now chairs the state stem cell institute 's governing body .
" We 've been finally freed from the Middle Ages . "
Dr. Irving Weissman , director of Stanford 's Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine Institute , said Obama 's policy will relieve researchers from the onerous requirement to segregate projects funded by the NIH from work on embryonic stem cells .
Weissman said he will attend Obama 's signing ceremony in Washington on Monday .
" I never thought I would actually fly cross-country just for something like this , " said Weissman , " but then I changed my mind .
I 've been working and speaking out about the ban for about eight years , and now I want to be there . "
Among the Obama Administration 's highest priorities should be these ten progressive notions :
1. Tax the Looters .
During the last eight years , the rich and powerful profited while everyone else struggled to keep their heads above water .
Bush fellow travelers typically made their money at the expense of the common good ; for example , by selling fossil fuel and sub - prime mortgages .
Now is the time for these profiteers to pay for the mess they created .
Wealthy individuals should pay more taxes , as should corporations whose practices facilitated the looting of America .
2. Partition Iraq .
It ’s time for the United States to recognize what everyone else in the world seems to understand : Iraq is an artificial entity , cobbled together by the British , that cannot function as a democracy because of intractable differences between Kurds , Shiites , and Sunnis .
The surge produced stability by repatriating Iraqis to areas controlled by their ethnic group .
The Three State Solution recognizes this reality ; it would govern Iraq as a federation with Kurds in the north , Sunnis in the center , and Shiites in the south .
3. Guarantee a Living Wage .
It seems illogical to tackle some of the roots of inequality — education and discrimination — without taking on the central economic issue : wages .
For the past quarter century , the gap between minimum wage workers and America 's executives has grown until it is now 1:821 .
There should be a national living wage statute that sets a humane floor adjusted by region ; for example , in Berkeley the law would raise the minimum wage for a single adult from $ 8 to $ 11.93 per hour .
4. Co-opt the Afghani Insurgents .
History teaches that no Western power has conquered Afghanistan ; the British and Russians failed , and the US - led NATO force is sliding into defeat .
A pragmatic US policy would recognize that most Afghan insurgents are not guided by fanatical Islam ; they ’re not Wahabbis , but rather bandit capitalists — they go where the money is .
We should adopt the counter - insurgency policy that worked in Iraq with Sunni militants and buy off the Afghani insurgents .
We should pay Afghani “ mercenaries ” to fight the Taliban , and religious extremists , while our coalition rebuilds the country .
5. Raise Gasoline Taxes .
America needs to make a conscious decision to move away from carbon - based fuel .
However , demand for fuel - efficient vehicles varies with the price of gasoline .
To motivate Americans to shift behavior away from gas - guzzlers , the federal government should levy a variable consumption tax that would keep the price of a gallon in the range of $ 4–5 dollars , regardless of fluctuations in the petroleum market .
( Enlightened tax credits would protect disadvantaged populations . )
6. Cancel Deployment of Ballistic Missile Defense Systems .
There are two critical problems with the US Ballistic Missile Defense System : it does n’t work and it has curtailed effective diplomacy with Russia .
Obama should halt deployment of the missile defense system .
That would save $ 5 billion per year and facilitate fruitful cooperation with Russia .
7. Issue Recovery Bonds .
During World Wars I and II the U.S. Treasury marketed special bonds — Liberty and “ War ” bonds — to strengthen the economy .
That ’s what is required now : new bonds , with positive tax incentives , that will encourage Americans to save their money and underwrite rebuilding of the US infrastructure .
Citizens need more practical opportunities to be patriotic .
8. Cooperate with Russia to Reduce Nukes .
Terrorism has gotten so much attention that most Americans have forgotten the problem of nuclear proliferation .
A key objective of Obama diplomacy should be to rebuild our relationship with Russia , negotiate a reduction in nuclear weapons , and strengthen our agreement to police loose nuclear materials .
9. Provide Healthcare for All of America ’s children .
America ’s dirty secret is that millions of its children are denied healthcare because their mothers and fathers are among the working poor : families who make to much for the children to be eligible for Medicaid , but who typically can’t afford to take care of their children ’s basic health needs .
There ’s a simple solution : expand Medicare to cover all children under 12 .
10 . Pass a New Homestead Act . The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged the development of land outside the original thirteen colonies .
Now America needs a new Homestead
Act that would encourage occupancy and renovation of properties empty because of foreclosure or ill - considered development .
If left alone , these homes often become blights on their communities .
The Federal government should pass a law giving priority rights to these properties to First Responders — police , fire , and public health workers — and then to public servants such teachers .
On January 20 , President Obama will have a lot on his plate .
Nonetheless , he ’d be well advised to honor his progressive roots and implement these ideas .

Remember Kyrgyzstan ?
Longtime readers of this space will recall our extensive coverage of that country ’s “ Tulip Revolution , ” also dubbed the “ Pink Revolution , ” way back in those heady days when George W. Bush ’s “ global democratic revolution ” was said to be the wave of the future .
The so - called color revolutions in Georgia , Ukraine , and the landlocked and desperately poor Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan were supposedly sparked by Bush ’s “ fire in the mind ”  a phrase lifted out of Dostoyevsky ’s
The Possessed and used in one of the former president ’s more unhinged perorations .
In the case of Kyrgyzstan , however , it looks like that fire has blown back in our faces .
After pouring all sorts of resources , including cash , into the coffers of the Tulip Revolutionaries , via overt aid and covert payments to “ nongovernmental organizations , ” basically underwriting their campaign to overthrow the regime of then - President Askar Akayev , what has the U.S. got to show for it ?
The Kyrgyz government recently announced that it was unilaterally canceling the contract that grants us the right to maintain the Ganci air base at Bishkek ’s Manas airport , a key link in the increasingly fragile supply lines that service U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Western news reports invariably couple this announcement with the recent conclusion of an aid pact with the Russians guaranteeing $ 2 billion .
U.S. government and NATO officials openly accuse the Russians of interference , yet the real reasons for the base closure are only mentioned in passing , if at all : the 2006 killing of a Kyrgyz citizen by a U.S. soldier , one of 1,500 stationed in and around the air base .
The soldier , Zachary Hatfield , shot and killed Alexander Ivanov , a 42 - year - old truck driver and father of two sons , at a checkpoint where Ivanov was in the process of delivering fuel to Manas .
Ivanov had supposedly threatened Hatfield with a knife .
A USA Today report includes this testimony from Ivanov ’s son and other truck drivers :
“ ‘ He told me often that American soldiers behaved insolently and unceremoniously , ’ he said .
‘ I want only one thing : that the guilty man be punished , ’ he said .
Ivanov ’s colleagues accused the U.S. servicemen of behaving disrespectfully towards local workers .
Yevgenyi
Trai said he and his co-workers have decided to deliver fuel to the airport bypassing the U.S. military checkpoint , ‘ because there is a threat to our lives there . ’
” ’Americans are boorish with us , pushing us into the [ security tent ] with gun butts , ’ Trai said . ”
Other news reports indicate that as Hatfield approached the security tent , Ivanov brandished a weapon .
Whether or not this was immediately after being whacked with the butt of a gun is an open question , and there is a real dispute over whether Ivanov posed a threat .
There is some indication that the knife found may have been taken from his vehicle after the shooting .
The Jamestown Foundation reports : “ At the time of the shooting Ivanov was about 5 - 6 meters away from Hatfield .
Since Ivanov ’s knife was found 20 meters away from the site of the incident , his widow questions whether he was , in fact , threatening Hatfield with it . ”
Kyrgyz prosecutors doubted Hatfield ’s story and pressed murder charges against him , ignoring the status of forces agreement that immunizes U.S. soldiers from legal action by local authorities .
Surely this knowledge of his immunity led to a certain carelessness , shall we say , on Hatfield ’s part .
One Kyrgyz civil rights activist told the Jamestown Foundation that “ Hatfield , knowing he was protected by diplomatic status , intentionally hunted down Ivanov out of anger and low personal character . ”
Ivanov ’s widow was eventually given compensation of some $ 50,000 , which is not the same as an admission of wrongdoing but pretty close to it .
What ’s really bad PR for the U.S. in Kyrgyzstan is that she was initially offered $ 1,000 , which shows just how much value we put on life out there on the far frontiers of our Empire .
No wonder they threw us out .
Partisans of the Obama administration are hoping the new diplomatic dispensation from Washington will mean this sort of thing will become the exception rather than the rule , yet there is little reason to believe this hope is realistic .
The U.S. footprint in countries where we have bases has never been inconspicuous , and relations with the “ natives ” are inevitably rocky : it ’s inherent in the situation .
From Okinawa to Bishkek , U.S. military bases are generators of violence , prostitution , and environmental degradation .
They are , in short , a lot of trouble for the host countries , quite aside from the number of fatherless children they produce .
That there is no real “ change ” in Washington on the foreign policy front was confirmed by the news that we are now frantically negotiating with Uzbekistan for permission to reopen our old base on their territory .
The Uzbek government , you remember , threw us out when we criticized their Maximum Leader , Islam Karimov , after he mowed down hundreds of his subjects in what became known as the Andijan massacre .
Even the Bush administration had to distance itself from Karimov , a nutball with delusions of grandeur , when his neo -communist policies turned murderous .
Oh , but not the “ liberal ” Obama administration .
Change ?
Heck , why not go back to Uzbekistan , anyway , since we ’ve apparently already made a down payment on the rent ?
With President Obama getting ready to launch his Afghan “ surge , ” the U.S. is targeting the ‘ stans in the vicinity : the idea is to build a ring of bases around the battlefield  Pakistan and Afghanistan  to support extensive military operations .
This will add to the instability in the region , provoke a fight with Russia , and expand the list of possible terrorist targets , as well as provoke a backlash in host countries , as it did in Kyrgyzstan .
There is one possible way for the U.S. to “ solve ” its Kyrgyzstan problem and that is by doing what they did last time the locals got uppity .
The former President Akayev roused U.S. ire by similarly threatening to revoke the contract allowing our base to operate , and he was shortly and unceremoniously overthrown by a U.S. - backed - and - funded revolution .
The base stayed .
Could history repeat itself ?
I do n’t know if maybe they ’ve run out of colors to brand their made - in - America “ revolutions , ” but , when push comes to shove , I ’ve no doubt that they ’ll think of something .
Maybe they ’ll go plaid .
I said it in the previous article , and I 'll say it again — there is a limit to what you can do to address latency , and you are absolutely not going to manage to make playing a game remotely as a video feed possible without pings in the single millisecond range .
I 'm not saying this is n't a good idea — it is , and it was over a decade ago when we first considered it .
But the network infrastructure did n't exist then , and it does n't exist now .
It might work in cities with high quality fiber networks if the server farms are located nearby , but it still would be laggy enough to make playing any twitch titles impossible .
For those of us who live in rural areas , this will be a pipe dream for at least another decade minimum .
I 'd also point out that building all of those server farms spread out geographically to make it feasible would be far too expensive to make this a profitable venture .
If it works at all , I 'll eat my hat .
If Mr. Blackwell or Mr. Steele wins the chairmanship , it will still be difficult for Republicans to compete against a Democratic Party that made its way into the history books in November .
Mr. Obama will be sworn in just a week before the 168 members of the committee are to gather here to choose the chairman .
Even Republicans describe this as their bleakest period since Watergate .
Yet the party put another Republican in the White House just six years after Richard M. Nixon left office in disgrace in 1974 .
“ There were other valleys we ’ve been in that were worse than this , ” Mr. Duncan said .
“ I ’m optimistic .
I think we can come back from this .
We are a center - right country .
Only 20 percent of the people consider themselves liberal .
That gives us a huge opportunity .
We have to get our message refined .
We ’ll be back . ”
Still , the problems the party faces now are laid out in often - agonizing detail by the six candidates as they appeal for the committee members ’ votes .
“ We fell behind in investment in technology , " said Saul Anuzis , the Michigan chairman and a candidate for party chairman .
" Clearly fund - raising is going to be a major challenge .
I think we have a lot of challenges . ”
The party has to choose from a field of candidates barely known outside of Washington .
To date , no candidate has shown signs of being the kind of powerful public speaker that party members are yearning for to counter the opposition .
Nor has any candidate presented a new message or vision to keep pace with the Democrats , Republicans acknowledge .
“ I have n’t heard a vision , ” said Joe Gaylord , a longtime Republican strategist who was the chief strategist for Newt Gingrich when Republicans seized control of the House in 1994 .
“ If we do not become a future - oriented , solutions - oriented Republican Party , we are going to be in wilderness for a long , long time . ”
Many of us update our software or install the latest antivirus programs to reduce the chances of becoming the victims of a hacker .
But is it possible for our hardware components to entice hackers as well ?
Hewlett - Packard recently issued a warning to select laser printer owners urging them to update the firmware of their devices or risk the prospect of leaving themselves open to a malicious attack .
In a public advisory , HP warned that certain laser printers are confirmed to have been affected , including 10 different LaserJet models ( ranging from the 2410 to the 9050 models ) , two Color LaserJet models and the 9200C Digital Sender model ( a sheet - fed document scanner ) .
( Source : com.au )
All owners of these devices are asked to download and install firmware upgrades right away .
The computer glitch was discovered by the security services firm Digital Defense , who later reported the problem to Hewlett - Packard .
Apparently , hackers are able to exploit a bug in the web - based control interface of the printer .
Basically , an uninvited guest has the potential to rummage through your arbitrary system configuration files and look over some of your cached documents .
Why bother with an attack of this kind ?
Digital Defense believes that the thrill of exposing vulnerability , more than having access to restricted files , is what drives certain people to malicious behavior .
These people are using directory transversal attacks to target innocent people .
A directory transversal attack is an HTTP - based exploit that lets hackers access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the server 's root directory .
While some analysts have downplayed the severity of outsiders being able to view printer configurations , others are nevertheless concerned over the invasion of privacy that these attacks perpetuate .
( Source : macworld.co.uk )
Those turned off by the prospect of downloading and installing security patches also have the option of simply disabling the online control interface and running their laser printer offline .
In any case , users are urged to act fast in deciding to patch or disable their printers in an effort to reduce or eliminate the prospect of becoming the victim of an attack .
Belgian intelligence concerned about increasing spy presence
February 3 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Despite Belgium ’s strategic location and central role in the Cold War , the Belgian secret services have historically had a very limited presence in the country .
Their postwar function has been primarily one of information analysis , and it was not until 2006 that they were given powers to intercept communications , conduct authorized breaking - and - entry operations , or detain and question suspects .
This situation is changing , however , as the Belgian Federal Parliament prepares to consider a bill on “ special intelligence methods ” that will further expand the powers of Belgian intelligence services .
Last week , Alain Winants , Director of Belgium ’s State Security Service ( SV/SE ) said his agents required expanded investigative powers to combat the increasing presence of foreign spies in the country .
Speaking at a public Parliamentary hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary , Mr. Winants pointed to “ dozens ” of spies who operate in Brussels under journalistic cover .
He stated that it was “ horrible how many Chinese and Russian [ supposed ] reporters are running around Brussels ” using journalism “ as a cover for their espionage activities ” .
Over a thousand foreign journalists are active in the Belgian capital , which hosts the world headquarters of the European Union and NATO , among other international organizations .
If approved , the proposed bill on special intelligence methods will allow SV / SE agents to assume false identities in the course of their investigations , among other powers .

A vector space search involves converting documents into vectors .
Each dimension within the vectors represents a term .
If a document contains that term then the value within the vector is greater than zero .
Here is an implementation of Vector space searching using python ( 2.4 + ) .
1 Stemming & Stop words
Fetch all terms within documents and clean – use a stemmer to reduce .
A stemmer takes words and tries to reduce them to there base or root .
Words which have a common stem often have similar meanings .
Example : CONNECTED CONNECTING CONNECTION CONNECTIONS
all map to CONNECT
We also remove any stopwords from the documents .
[ a , am , an , also , any , and ] are all examples of stopwords in English .
Stop words have little value in search so we strip them .
The stoplist used was taken from : ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/english.stop
self.stemmer = PorterStemmer ()
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 def removeStopWords ( self , list ) : " " " Remove common words which have no search value " " " return [ word for word in list if word not in self .
stopwords ] def tokenise ( self , string ) : " " " break string up into tokens and stem words " " " string = self .
clean ( string ) words = string .
split ( " " ) return [ self .
stemmer .
stem ( word , 0 , len ( word ) - 1 ) for word in words ]
2 Map Keywords to Vector Dimensions
Map the vector dimensions to keywords using a dictionary : keyword= > position
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 def getVectorKeywordIndex ( self , documentList ) : " " " create the keyword associated to the position of the elements within the document vectors " " " # Mapped documents into a single word string vocabulary String = " " . join ( documentList ) vocabularyList = self .
parser .
tokenise ( vocabulary String )
# Remove common words which have no search value vocabularyList = self .
parser .
removeStopWords ( vocabularyList ) uniqueVocabularyList = util .
removeDuplicates ( vocabularyList ) vectorIndex = {} offset = 0 # Associate a position with the keywords which maps to the dimension on the vector used to represent this word for word in uniqueVocabularyList : vectorIndex [ word ] = offset offset += 1 return vectorIndex #( keyword : position )
3 Map Document Strings to Vectors .
We use the simple Term Count Model .
A more accurate model would be to use tf - idf ( termFrequency - inverseDocumentFrequnecy ) .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 def makeVector ( self , wordString ) : " " " @pre : unique ( vectorIndex ) " " " # Initialise vector with 0's vector = [ 0 ] * len ( self . vectorKeywordIndex ) wordList = self .
parser .
tokenise ( wordString ) wordList = self .
parser .
removeStopWords ( wordList ) for word in wordList : vector [ self .
vectorKeywordIndex [ word ] ] += 1 ; # Use simple Term Count Model return vector
4 Find Related Documents
We now have the ability to find related documents .
We can test if two documents are in the concept space by looking at the the cosine of the angle between the document vectors .
We use the cosine of the angle as a metric for comparison .
If the cosine is 1 then the angle is 0° and hence the vectors are parallel ( and the document terms are related ) .
If the cosine is 0 then the angle is 90° and the vectors are perpendicular ( and the document terms are not related ) .
We calculate the cosine between the document vectors in python using scipy .
1 2 3 4 def cosine ( vector1 , vector2 ) : " " " related documents j and q are in the concept space by comparing the vectors : cosine = ( V1 * V2 ) / | | V1|| x | |V2|| " " " return float ( dot ( vector1 , vector2 ) / ( norm ( vector1 ) * norm ( vector2 ) ) )
5 Search the Vector Space !
In order to perform a search across keywords we need to map the keywords to the vector space .
We create a temporary document which represents the search terms and then we compare it against the document vectors using the same cosine measurement mentioned for relatedness .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 def search ( self , searchList ) : " " " search for documents that match based on a list of terms " " " queryVector = self .
buildQueryVector ( searchList ) ratings = [ util .
cosine ( queryVector , documentVector ) for documentVector in self .
documentVectors ] ratings .
sort ( reverse = True ) return ratings

Sony refuses to call its latest 8 - inch mini note — the Vaio P Series
Lifestyle PC — a netbook .
Why ?
It 's a far more capable device than most netbooks , which justifies its price ( twice that of most netbooks ) , Sony officials say .
And boy , are they wrong .
If by " capable " they mean " stuff you can get done with it , " then you 're going to need to learn a lot of hot keys .
Because the worst part of this netbook ( yes , I called it that ) is its mouse .
It 's a pointing stick .
A device this puny is hard enough to use in the first place , and poking a piece of rubber to make selections is just God-awful annoying .
And for clicking , there are two wide , silver buttons beneath the space bar ; they 're positioned so awkwardly you 're going to pray you never have to right - click .
I do n't exaggerate when I say this netbook 's small .
The 8 - inch LED screen displays a high 1,600 x 768 resolution .
That 's impressively sharp , but it means onscreen type becomes extremely small , so even if you have 20 / 20 vision , you 'll be squinting often to double check what you type .
And the netbook weighs a pound and a half — small enough to stuff in a blazer pocket .
( Let 's face it , though :
The idea of carrying one of these things in a coat pocket screams " nerdy douche . " )
Other than stifling your productivity , the Lifestyle 's slow performance wo n't help much either .
This netbook ships with a 1.33 - GHz
Intel Atom processor — not the standard 1.6 - GHz
Atom in other netbooks .
( For some reason , Sony treats Japan with faster processor options . )
We ran some benchmarks on the Lifestyle , and it 's pretty damn sluggish .
For example , in our iTunes conversion test the Lifestyle took about 19
minutes to convert 25 tracks .
By way of comparison , the MSI Wind U120 took 11 minutes to complete the same test .
Did I mention the Lifestyle ships with Vista ?
That 's probably making its performance even worse .
The keyboard is n't great , either .
It 's nice and roomy , but the keys themselves feel very flat and unnatural to type on .
The right Shift key is extremely small , something that many consumers hate about other netbook keyboards .
And did I mention the Lifestyle starts at $ 900 ?
The base model includes a 60 - GB hard disk drive ; the middle model ships with a 64 - GB solid state drive for $ 1,200 ; and the top - of - the - line Lifestyle costs $ 1,500 with a 128 - GB
solid state .
All models ship with a maxed out memory capacity of
2 GB of RAM .
That 's pretty pricey compared to netbooks , which cost $ 400 on average .
Do n't get me wrong :
The Lifestyle is a truly beautiful device — a worthy highlight at the Consumer Electronics Show in January .
The cooler part about the netbook is it ships with a built - in GPS

Rich kids " slumming it " and thinking they 're being cool by smoking pot and living out their " creative " fantasies that usually do n't come to anything , in between travelling to exotic third world places like Bali , Morocco , or Thailand , more or less like a cross between a neohippie and a hipster ( although there is considerable overlap between trustafarians and both of those other subcultures ) commonly found in the Venice , Echo Park Atwater Village , and Silver Lake neighborhoods in L.A. ( although Silver Lake is getting a bit too expensive for all but the wealthiest trustafarians , so some are going to Hollywood and assuredly some will go to Koreatown soon if they have n't already ) .
The term is derived from a combination of " trust fund " and " Rastafarian " .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a $ 787 billion ( 547 billion pound ) package of spending and tax cuts on Friday aimed at rescuing the struggling economy as Congress edged closer to handing President Barack Obama an early political victory .

Democrats wielded their majority to push one of the largest spending bills in U.S. history through the House by a vote of 246-183 .
The Senate was expected to start voting at 5:30 p.m. EST ( 10:30 p.m. British time ) .
Democrats control 58 of the 100 Senate seats and are expected to get at least the two more votes needed to pass the stimulus package and send it to Obama for his signature .
The vote could take a few hours , giving time for Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown to return to Washington to cast the 60th vote .
No House Republicans backed it , arguing it had too much spending and not enough tax breaks .
That dashed Obama ’s quest for bipartisan support he had sought and had hoped would break the gridlock that has gripped Congress for years .
The final plan is split into 36 percent for tax cuts and 64 percent in spending and other provisions .
That was close to the 40/60 split Obama had sought in his effort to jolt the economy , which he has warned could become a “ catastrophe ” without rapid government intervention .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer chastised Republicans , saying they were sticking to the same economic precepts that had proved a failure during the eight - year tenure of Republican President George W. Bush .
“ Millions and millions of Americans will receive a tax cut ” under the measure , he said , adding that “ millions and millions of people ... who have lost their jobs and ca n’t put food on the tables of their families will be helped by this bill . ”
Representative Mike Pence , a member of the Republican leadership , countered during the closing floor debate , “ The only thing the Democrats ’ stimulus bill will do is stimulate more government and more debt . ”
“ The American people are asking , ‘ What ’s 13 bucks a week going to do to get this economy moving again for the average American ? ’ ” he said , referring to extra money that will come in paycheques because of reduced taxes withheld by employers .
The White House said it would take about a month for the money to start flowing .
But a primary concern for economists is that the stimulus will come too late to do much good in 2009 , when many forecasters think full - year output will contract .
“ Unfortunately , the downward momentum in the economy is so steep that it is hard to see how the package can kick in quickly enough to make much difference to 2009 , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight .
TAXES VS SPENDING
Republicans had pressed for larger tax cuts instead of big spending projects but most of their efforts to change the stimulus measure in both chambers failed .
They also cried foul that some programs ballooned , like quadrupling high - speed rail funding to $ 8 billion and that $ 450 million was added for Amtrak security , which was not in earlier versions of House and Senate bills .
They also questioned other spending , including $ 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and $ 300 million for updating the federal fleet with more fuel - efficient vehicles .
“ When you look at some of the spending in this bill , it will do nothing about creating jobs , ” said House Minority Leader John Boehner .
The president has urged the Democratic - controlled Congress to pass the stimulus before the end of the coming holiday weekend so he can sign it into law .
His goal is to create or save 3.5 million jobs in an economy that has seen massive job losses since the recession began in December 2007 .
Obama pressed his case for the stimulus package earlier when he met corporate chief executives at the White House .
“ It ’s a plan that will ignite spending by businesses and consumers , make the investments necessary for lasting economic growth and prosperity , ” Obama said , adding that 90 percent of jobs saved and created would be in the private sector .
The final package includes about $ 500 billion in spending and money for social programs like the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor .
It has about $ 287 billion in tax cuts that include small tax incentives to spur home and automobile sales as well as business tax deductions .
THREE REPUBLICAN VOTES
Democrats trimmed down the package from as much as $ 937 billion to secure the votes of three Republicans that were needed to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate and win final passage .
Republican Senators Susan Collins , Olympia Snowe and Arlen Specter agreed to back the legislation if it was below $ 800 billion .
To achieve that , one major cut was tens of billions of dollars from grants to help states plug growing budget gaps .
Money for building schools was also stripped out and congressional negotiators severely scaled back tax incentives aimed at boosting flagging home and car sales that were deemed too expensive .
Still , the measure includes almost $ 54 billion to help states with their budget deficits and to modernize schools , $ 27.5 billion for highway projects , $ 8.4 billion for public transportation and $ 9.3 billion for Amtrak and high - speed rail service .
The final agreement also included limits on compensation for senior executives of companies receiving government aid from the $ 700 billion financial bailout , including restrictions on bonuses .
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Toyota Motor Corp. said Friday losses for the business year ending next month will be larger than it had earlier forecast as sales weaken in Japan and overseas markets , and an appreciating yen trims the value of repatriated foreign earnings .
Toyota said its operating loss will likely widen to 450 billion yen ( $ 4.95 billion ) for the fiscal year ending March 31 .
In December , the Nagoya - based automaker forecast a 150 billion yen operating loss .
The operating loss is Toyota 's first since the end of World War II .
" Toyota will be facing a tough time for the next few quarters , " said UBS analyst Tatsuo Yoshida in Tokyo .
He said Toyota will need to take bold steps to reduce its capital expenditure and research and development costs if it wants to return to profitability in a year when industry - wide global auto sales are expected to contract 10 % .
UBS said the wider loss was related to a 220,000 unit cut in Toyota 's global annual output estimates which knocked earnings by 210 billion yen and valuation losses by 90 billion yen on interest rate swaps .
Toyota said its outlook was for a net loss of 350 billion yen in the March - ended fiscal year , revising its earlier view for a 50 billion yen net profit .
Net losses in the fiscal third - quarter totaled 164.7 billion yen ( $ 1.81 billion ) , compared to a 458.6 billion yen net profit a year earlier .
Net revenues decreased 28.4 % to 4.8 trillion yen during the quarter .
" We are in a difficult economic climate facing uncertainties , including fluctuations in energy and raw material prices and foreign exchange rates , " Toyota said in a statement .
On a regional basis , quarterly net revenues fell the most in North America , declining 27.3 % to 5.292 trillion yen , followed by an 18.6 % decline in Europe and a 9.6 % fall in Japan .
In the rest of Asia net revenues were down 0.3 % to 2.31 trillion yen .
" The automotive industry . . . is experiencing a rapid contraction of markets in developed countries and a slowdown of market growth in resource - rich counties and emerging markets once expected to grow , " Toyota said in the statement .
Ahead of the earnings announcement , Moody 's downgraded Toyota 's credit rating , saying the length and severity of the global downturn will mean a slow road to profit recovery for the Japanese automaker .
Moody 's cut the rating to Aa1 from Aaa and said it had a negative outlook on the car and truck maker .
" A number of factors in Toyota 's operating environment -- the global economic slowdown , yen appreciation , and volatility in the prices of raw materials -- continue to evolve and thus , in Moody 's view , the company is unlikely to meaningfully improve its operating performance , " in the financial year ending March 2010 , Moody 's said in a statement .
Moody 's said Toyota was likely to maintain its dominant position ( having overtaken General Motors Corp. GM , - 2.37 % in vehicle output last year ) , but would see volume and revenue decline .
Shares of Toyota TM , - 1.29 % ( 7203 ) closed 1.6 % higher at 2,255 .
The benchmark Nikkei index was up 1.6 % at 8,076.62 .
Toyota 's share of the U.S. auto market rose to 16.7 % in 2008 , up from 16.2 % in the preceding year , as vehicle sales totaled 2.2 million units , down 400,000 units on year .
Toyota 's share of the Japanese auto market was unchanged at 42 % in 2008 even as unit sales slipped to 2.2 million units , down from 2.3 million units a year earlier .
Moody 's said Toyota had about 5 trillion yen ( $ 55 billion ) in investment securities that could be sold at short notice to raise cash if needed .
" Toyota has an extremely high degree of financial flexibility , meaning it should be able to withstand any difficulties the industry may experience , " Moody 's said .
Toyota said last year 's 5 % contraction in its global output was the first time in a decade its output had slipped .
Many computer systems are built to house data and turn it into useful information for humans .
When we do this there is a natural desire to make that information consistent .
After all what use is there of a computer system that 's in two minds about things ?
But sometimes computer systems should record contradictory data and help humans deal with that .
This issue came foremost to my mind many years ago when working in health care for the UK National Health Service .
We were building a conceptual model for health care delivery - essentially a conceptual schema for an electronic health care record .
Looking back on it , there were certainly plenty of things I 'd do differently now .
But one thing in particular was something very precious and important - the model was very much a collaborative effort between myself , another software developer , two doctors and a nurse .
The clinicians understood the model and played a full part in developing it - they were not merely passive reviewers .
As a result I think the ideas we developed were particularly valuable in thinking about what a clinical practitioner wants to see in an electronic health care record .
One thing the clinicians were very strong about was this need to capture contradictory information .
I might have a note from the Royal Hope Hospital saying my blood type is A and another note from the Sisters of Plenitude saying my blood type is B .
This would clearly be nonsense , blood types do n't change .
But that does n't mean we cannot record these two bits of data .
Without further investigation we do n't know which one is correct .
Even if we test again and confirm one of them , we can't just throw away the bad one as it may have been the basis for further clinical action .
And of course there are lots of cases where the contradiction is n't as clear cut .
We may never be able to find out which of two contradictory bits of data was wrong or may find a change over time that is extremely unlikely but not impossible .
The key to handling this issue is to represent my blood type not as an attribute of a person class , but as a fully fledged class in its own right - which we called observation .
Each observation applies to a particular patient , but also records such information as when it was made , who made it , and how it was made .
We also saw that observations can be about the absence of things as much as about their presence .
So in some circumstances it may not be possible to figure out my blood group , but it is possible to say that it is n't blood group O .
This we could represent as an observation of an absence of blood group O. ( I have no idea if this example is possible or reasonable , but it can get tricky to think up realistic examples quickly . )
Often observing the absence of things is crucial in a diagnostic process .
Using observations changes the way we determine information about a patient .
Rather than simply asking for a patient 's blood group , we look at all the patient 's blood group observations .
If they are all the same , then we just use that value .
If they differ , we need to delve deeper .
In many cases observations do sensibly change over time , so we might look at all the observations of my weight over time to plot how my weight changes .
Although we need to keep contradictory observations , we also need to capture if we think one of them was wrong .
Some observations , such as a broken leg , will become untrue over time , but the blood group example above is more likely to be a error .
In the erroneous case we have the notion of rejecting ( or refuting ) one observation with another .
So we might have a further test in the Albion Hospital that finds I'm Blood Group A , this observation would then reject the Sisters of Plenitude 's observation .
Rejecting an observation says that we believe it was never true .
We never delete the old observation , instead we mark it as rejected and link it to Albion Hospital 's observation .
An important property of information is that it 's used to guide behavior .
A rejected observation may have been used as evidence for further observations or to justify interventions .
Keeping these links in the record is essential since once an observation is rejected we can then follow those links to investigate the consequences .
If the observation we 've just rejected is a crucial part of evidence for another observation , that should be questioned and maybe rejected as well .
Observations thus form a web of evidence that we can examine as we learn more about the patient .
Most of the time , of course , we do n't use complicated schemes like this .
We mostly program in a world that we assume is consistent .
But there are times where we have to step away from that comfortable assumption .
When that happens then explicit observations are a useful tool

I 'm sure I 'd write it better if I were to do it again now , but the core concepts still seem to hold up pretty well .
I 'd also like to call out my colleagues on this work : Tom Cairns , Anne Casey , Mark Thursz , and Hazim Timimi )
After meeting with the New Democrat Coalition , President Obama told the group of moderate party members Obama : ' I am a New Democrat '
President Barack Obama firmly resists ideological labels , but at the end of a private meeting with a group of moderate Democrats on Tuesday afternoon , he offered a statement of solidarity .
“ I am a New Democrat , ” he told the New Democrat Coalition , according to two sources at the White House session .
Advertisement
The group is comprised of centrist Democratic members of the House , who support free trade and a muscular foreign policy but are more moderate than the conservative Blue Dog Coalition .
Obama made his comment in discussing his budget priorities and broader goals , also calling himself a “ pro-growth Democrat ” during the course of conversation .
The self - descriptions are striking given Obama ’s usual caution in being identified with any wing of his often - fractious party .
He largely avoided the Democratic Leadership Council — the centrist group that Bill Clinton once led — and , with an eye on his national political standing , has always shied away from the liberal label , too .
As recently as last week , he steadfastly refused to define his governing philosophy .
Asked in an interview with The New York Times to describe if he was a liberal , socialist or progressive , Obama demurred .
“ No , I ’m not going to engage in that , ” he said , before calling back the reporters later in the day to question why they would even ask if he is a socialist .
Surrounded by 65 moderate Democrats on Tuesday in the State Dining Room , Obama was happy to portray himself as simpatico with a group of members who are largely socially liberal but fiscally more moderate to conservative .
He said he “ supports free and fair trade , ” according to one attendee , and noted that he was “ very concerned about a return to protectionism . ”
Obama made similar comments last month during his trip to Canada — America ’s largest trading partner — and has shied away from the NAFTA - bashing he engaged in during last year ’s Democratic primary .
Obama also said he would turn to the group — many members of which come from high - technology districts — for help on innovation and smart - growth issues
There is no New Democrat coalition in the Senate , so Obama had no previous affiliation to the group .
His chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , was a member of the centrist group during his time in the House , though .
Rep. Steve Israel ( D - N.Y. ) said the president insisted on listening to questions posed by 10 pre-selected members — but that Emanuel tried to hurry his boss along when the meeting went over its allotted time .
" Rahm was sitting there , like he does , looking at his watch and tapping his foot , " Israel said with a laugh .
The meeting was part of Obama ’s steady courtship of congressional Democrats — left , right and center — in advance of the debate over his proposed $ 3.6 trillion budget .
Last week Obama met with the left - leaning Congressional Black Caucus , before that he met with the conservative - leaning Blue Dogs .
A group of the New Democrats talked to reporters after the meeting .
“ The president made a point to say that not everything in this budget everyone ’s going to like — after all we are Democrats , we do n’t agree half the time with each other anyway — but that , do n’t be nitpicky , ” said Rep. Joseph Crowley ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ Do n’t pick out the one or two items that you do n’t like and use that for the cause celebre for voting down or voting against that budget .
He called upon us personally as New Democrats to support him in this effort . ”
“ We ’re going to begin our conversation about the budget tomorrow , ” said Rep. Ellen Tauscher ( D - Calif. ) , who leads the New Democrats .
“ The president made it very , very clear that his priority for us to be working on is passing this budget . ”
“ We ’re all together with the president , ” she said .

It ’s interesting to look back at international financial surveillance in the run-up to the global economic crisis and look at which risks were foreseen and by whom .
2006 is highly relevant , because it was the last full year before the crisis ( which blew up in late summer 2007 ) .
Â
Below is a couple of paragraphs from the IMF ’s surveillance report for the UK in 2006 relating to financial sector supervision .
Â
Remember this is the system that was created by , and ultimately overseen by , Gordon Brown .
37 .
The authorities consider that financial sector prospects are strong and are taking action to further improve resilience .
The UK banking system is in rude health , taking in stride the financial market correction in May - June 2006 and the tightening of monetary conditions in the second half of the year .
Looking ahead , the authorities see prospects as favorable but risks as underpriced .
One of their key concerns is rising correlations across countries and markets , which is partly attributable to similar strategies ( for trading , risk management , and stress testing ) across financial institutions .
Londonâ€™s role as a global financial center raises the risk of cross - border transmission of shocks , but it also yields benefits in terms of greater liquidity , which improves the financial systemâ€™s ability to absorb shocks .
Regarding financial regulation , the FSA is determined to further develop the principles - based approach and underlines the importance of subjecting proposed regulations to a thorough cost - benefit analysis …
[ staff appraisal ]
43 . Lastly , on the financial sector , which is in a position of strength , the authorities are appropriately promoting the systemâ€™s resilience .
The key financial sector vulnerabilities are low - probability events with potentially severe consequences .
In addressing these risks , the authorities are right to insist on balancing the costs and benefits of regulation .
Plans to further enhance stress - testing and international crisis prevention and management arrangements are welcome .
A few points can be made .
Â
First , these paragraphs are always compromises .
Â
One does n’t know what was said in the actual discussions and especially what the UK side would have requested to be removed from the staff appraisal .
Â
Second , as is typical of bureaucratic documents , there are plenty of CYA sentences in there , so that if something bad happens , they can always say “ look there , we said that might happen ” .
Â
Third , what stands out is that both sides were seriously deluded about the health of banks and the quality of bank supervision ; in that sense , Lord Turner ’s claims on Andrew Marr this morning are correct .
But finally , note the codewords for resistance to tighter regulation : “ balancing costs and benefits ” , “ principles - based approach ” .
Â
There was no appetite on either side of this dialog for getting into the details of what banks were up to .
Â
Which prompts the question : if you ’re philosophically opposed to something in 2006 , what ’s your evidence that you ’ll be any good at doing it in 2009 ?
With only 100 compromised ATM cards thieves were able to grab $ 9 million bucks from the banking system in a new style of attack .
Law enforcement sources told Fox 5 it's one of the most frightening well - coordinated heists they 've ever seen .
" We 've seen similar attempts to defraud a bank through ATM machines but not , not anywhere near the scale we have here , " FBI Agent Ross Rice told Fox 5 .
" We 've never seen one this well coordinated , " the FBI said .
How did the hackers steal $ 9 million in one 30 - minute time period using only 100 ATM cards you ask ?
That should n’t be possible given the daily limits ( usually about $ 500 / day ) placed on all ATM cards .
Well it turns out that the hackers applied military like precision to old ATM Scam techniques and added a touch of devious ingenuity to pull this one off .
Here is a look at how the theft was perpetrated .
First , the bad guys had to obtain the ATM cards .
To accomplish this they hacked into RBS WorldPay and stole at least 100 payroll cards .
According to RBS WorldPay , “ Payroll cards are used by a growing number of U.S. firms to pay wages to employees .
A payroll card is a reloadable stored value card that can be used at any point of sale that accepts credit and debit cards . ”
Second , the bad guys had to figure out how to reload the cards .
To accomplish this they hacked into RBS WorldPay ’s systems once again .
Once this was done they had the power to reload the payroll cards with new fake deposits that they could turn into cold hard cash via an ATM withdrawal .
Third , the bad guys had to clone the card info they stole into thousands of real ATM payroll cards .
This is easily and cheaply done using various over the counter card printing devices .
Given that this market is completely non-regulated , anyone can buy all of the gear necessary to make your very own credit , ATM , Bank , etc. Cards .
Fourth , the bad guys needed to recruit an Army of “ cashers ” to physically go to an ATM machine with the newly minted counterfeit ( but valid ) payroll cards and withdrawal cash .
Cashers is the name given to the street - level thugs that do the actual cash withdrawals at ATMs .
It is hypothesized that there were dozens of them recruited for this scam .
Fifth , the bad guys developed an incredibly precise global attack plan .
It is alleged that they mapped out exactly what ATMs they would hit , the order they would hit them in and on what global time schedule .
This attack plan covered at least 49 different cities around the world for a total of approximately 130 ATM machines .
The cities targeted include Atlanta , Chicago , Montreal , New York , Moscow and Hong Kong .
The whole attack was choreographed to happen within a 30 - minute timeframe .
It is the first time anyone has seen this type of precision and coordination achieved in an ATM rip - off .
Finally , the perpetrators briefed all of their “ cashers ” on the plan of attack .
Then on November 8th , 2008 they launched their attack .
All 130 of the targeted ATM machines around the world were hit during a 30 - minute time period .
During the attack the bad guys reloaded ( via their hack ) the payroll cards as needed .
When all was said and done it is thought that the thieves walked away with over $ 9 Million bucks in cold cash .
As far as I can tell the FBI still does not have any suspects in custody from this theft .
They do have wanted posters out with pictures of some of the “ cashers ” caught on the ATM cameras .
If you know any of these nice folks please report them to the FBI .
RBS Worldpay has issued a press release stating they are working to resolve the security issues associated with this fraud so it does n't happen again .
In addition to the 100 cards used to commit the cash haul , a statement by RBS WorldPay says , " Certain personal information of approximately 1.5 million cardholders and other individuals may have been affected and , of this group , Social Security numbers of 1.1 million people may have been accessed . "
This exposure is due to the successful hacks performed during the payroll card attack .
The opinions and information presented here are my personal views and not those of my employer .

Unredacted documents reveal prisoners tortured to death Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday February 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Human rights groups accuse Pentagon of running secret prisons , cooperating with CIA " ghost detention " program
The American Civil Liberties Union has released previously classified excerpts of a government report on harsh interrogation techniques used in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .
These previously unreported pages detail repeated use of " abusive " behavior , even to the point of prisoner deaths .
The documents , obtained by the ACLU under a Freedom of Information Act request , contain a report by Vice Admiral Albert T. Church , who was tapped to conduct a comprehensive review of Defense Department interrogation operations .
Church specifically calls out interrogations at Bagram Air base in Afghanistan as " clearly abusive , and clearly not in keeping with any approved interrogation policy or guidance . "
The two unredacted pages from the Church report may be found here .
The ACLU 's release comes on the same day as a major FOIA document dump by three other leading human rights groups : Documents which reveal the Pentagon ran secret prisons in Bagram and Iraq , that it cooperated with the CIA 's " ghost detention " program and that Defense personnel delayed a prisoner 's release to avoid bad press .
" In both cases , for example , [ prisoners ] were handcuffed to fixed objects above their heads in order to keep them awake , " reads the document .
" Additionally , interrogations in both incidents involved the use of physical violence , including kicking , beating , and the use of " compliance blows " which involved striking the [ prisoners ] legs with the [ interrogators ] knees .
In both cases , blunt force trauma to the legs was implicated in the deaths .
In one case , a pulmonary embolism developed as a consequence of the blunt force trauma , and in the other case pre-existing coronary artery disease was complicated by the blunt force trauma . "
In a press release , the ACLU summarized the documents as detailing , " [ An ] investigation of two deaths at Bagram .
Both detainees were determined to have been killed by pulmonary embolism caused as a result of standing chained in place , sleep depravation and dozens of beatings by guards and possibly interrogators .
( Also reveals the use of torture at Gitmo and American - Afghani prisons in Kabul ) .
" [ An ] investigation into the homicide or involuntary manslaughter of detainee Dilar Dababa by U.S. forces in 2003 in Iraq .
" [ An ] investigation launched after allegations that an Iraqi prisoner was subjected to torture and abuse at ' The Disco ' ( located in the Special Operations Force Compound in Mosul Airfield , Mosul , Iraq ) .
The abuse consisted of filling his jumpsuit with ice , then hosing him down and making him stand for long periods of time , sometimes in front of an air conditioner ; forcing him to lay down and drink water until he gagged , vomited or choked , having his head banged against a hot steel plate while hooded and interrogated ; being forced to do leg lifts with bags of ice placed on his ankles , and being kicked when he could not do more .
" [ An ] investigation of allegations of torture and abuse that took place in 2003 at Abu Ghraib .
" [ And an ] investigation that established probable cause to believe that U.S. forces committed homicide in 2003 when they participated in the binding of detainee Abed Mowhoush in a sleeping bag during an interrogation , causing him to die of asphyxiation . "
" A large portion of the torture , maiming , and murder of detainees occurred under authority issued under secret rules of engagement in the Pentagon , " wrote Scott Horton , a contributing editor with Harper 's magazine .
" Much of this flowed through Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone , a figure who has so far evaded scrutiny in the torture scandal and now serves as vice president for strategy of QinetiQ North America , a subsidiary of the United Kingdom - based defense contractor QinetiQ .
Even the Senate Armed Services Committee review fails to get to the bottom of Dr. Cambone , his interrogations ROEs for special operations units he controlled , and the death , disfigurement and torture of prisoners they handled .
This is one of many reasons why a comprehensive investigation with subpoena power is urgently needed .
But full airing of the internal investigations already conducted by the Department of Defense is an essential next step . "

The " Place for Friends " is starting to feel lonely .
MySpace , the Rupert Murdoch - owned website once synonymous with social networking , is losing popularity and key staff in its biggest troubles since launching five years ago .
Latest figures show that Murdoch is being beaten in the fight for social networks .
MySpace suffered a drop in visitor traffic last month and is now less than half the size of its younger rival , Facebook .
Three executives recently quit the one - time darling of the internet and there is speculation its co-founders will follow .
MySpace 's loss of status as the cool place to be is an object lesson in the notoriously fickle internet , where today 's cultural icon is tomorrow 's passing fad .
From humble origins in 2003 , the site led the so - called " Web 2.0 " revolution in which users could create their own profile pages and share content with friends .
Murdoch 's purchase of MySpace for $ 580 m was seen as a masterstroke as membership continued to soar , with celebrities and politicians joining the craze .
But then came Facebook , founded by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg , which soon snowballed with an older and apparently more affluent demographic to steal MySpace 's crown .
Gradually newspaper coverage of social networks switched from references to " MySpace and Facebook " to " Facebook and MySpace " .
The rise of Bebo also undermined MySpace 's dominance , while Twitter is among the latest novelties eating into users ' attention spans .
MySpace had 124 million monthly unique visitors last month , a decline of 2 % , according to the marketing research company comScore .
Facebook , by contrast , racked up 276 million unique visitors , an increase of 16.6 % .
Michael Arrington , co-editor of the influential industry blog TechCrunch , posted : " What was a bad situation in November 2008 is starting to turn outright ugly - Facebook is now well over twice the size of MySpace ...
It was less than a year ago that MySpace and Facebook were the same size . "
There are clues behind the scenes that all is not well at Murdoch 's Fox Interactive Media , which runs the site .
Amit Kapur , MySpace 's chief operating officer , resigned after little more than a year in the post to set up a new company .
He will be joined by Jim Benedetto and Steve Pearman , senior vice - presidents of engineering and product strategy .
The exodus comes amid speculation of further departures and rumours that MySpace 's co-founders , Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson , could also walk away in October after the end of their contracts , each worth $ 30 m over two years .
MySpace is clinging on to a marginal lead over Facebook in America but trails badly in Europe .
In Britain , Facebook overtook its competitor in September 2007 , the comScore data shows .
Nick Thomas , an analyst at Forrester Research , said : " In the last 12 months Facebook has extended its dominance in every territory in Europe . "
However , he added : " I 'm not convinced that it 's terminal for MySpace .
The battle is n't over yet . "

The Arctic sea-ice has seen a rapid decline in recent summers
The worst - case scenarios on climate change envisaged by the UN two years ago are already being realised , say scientists at an international meeting .
In a statement in Copenhagen on their six key messages to political leaders , they say there is a increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climate shifts .
Even modest temperature rises will affect millions of people , particularly in the developing world , they warn .
But , they say , most tools needed to cut carbon dioxide emissions already exist .
More than 2,500 researchers and economists attended this meeting designed to update the world on the state of climate research ahead of key political negotiations set for December this year .
New data was presented in Copenhagen on sea level rise , which indicated that the best estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) made two years ago were woefully out of date .
Business as usual is dead - green growth is the answer to both our climate and economic problems .
Danish PM
Anders Fogh Rasmussen Scientists heard that waters could rise by over a metre across the world with huge impacts for hundreds of millions of people .
There was also new information on how the Amazon rainforest would cope with rising temperatures .
A UK Meteorological
Office study concluded there would be a 75 % loss of tree cover if the world warmed by three degrees for a century .
The scientists hope that their conclusions will remove any excuses from the political process .
Dr Katherine Richardson , who chaired the scientific steering committee that organised the conference and issued the six " key messages " , said the research presented added new certainty to the IPCC reports .
" We 've seen lots more data , we can see where we are , no new surprises , we have a problem . "
" Mass migrations "
The meeting was also addressed by Lord Stern , the economist , whose landmark review of the economics of climate change published in 2006 highlighted the severe cost to the world of doing nothing .
He now says the report underestimated the scale of the risks , and the speed at which the planet is warming .
He urged scientists to speak out and tell the politicians what the world would be like if effective measures against global warming were not taken .
He said that if the world was to warm by 5C over the next century , there would be dramatic consequences for millions of people .
Rising seas would make many areas uninhabitable leading to mass migrations and inevitably sparking violent conflict .
Lord Stern : ' The Economics of Climate Change ' underestimated the risks " You 'd see hundreds of millions people , probably billions of people who would have to move and we know that would cause conflict , so we would see a very extended period of conflict around the world , decades or centuries as hundreds of millions of people move , " said Lord Stern .
" So I think it 's very important that we understand the magnitude of the risk we are running . "
He said that a new , effective global deal was desperately needed to avoid these dramatic scenarios - and the current global economic slowdown was in some ways a help .
" Action is rather attractive , inaction is inexcusable .
It 's an opportunity , given that resources will be cheaper now than in the future , now is the time to get the unemployed of Europe working on energy efficiency . "
Lord Stern 's views were echoed by Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen .
" Business as usual is dead - green growth is the answer to both our climate and economic problems .
" I hope the whole world will join us and set a two degree goal as an ambition of a climate deal in Copenhagen , " said Mr Rasmussen .

Stop Evil Spirits And Demons
To get rid of demons and evil spirits , spiritual discernment is a must .
Demons that are hard to see are masters in every form of deception .
Apostle Paul mentions an experience with a demonic power that was a master in every form of deception .
He was hard to see .
You may come into contact with one too .
This is one reason why you must sharpen your spiritual discernment .
Apostolic and prophetic intercessors will face more of these evil spirits in the days ahead .
by Albert Kaplan
Let us read William Herndon 's account beginning with a description of Thomas Lincoln , Abraham 's father : " He ( Thomas Lincoln ) was , we are told , five feet ten inches high , weighed one hundred and ninety - five pounds , had a well - rounded face , dark hazel eyes , coarse black hair , and was slightly stoop - shouldered .
His build was so compact that Dennis Hanks used to say that he could not find the points of separation between his ribs ... was sinewy , and gifted with great strength , was inoffensively quiet and peaceable , but when roused to resistance a dangerous antagonist . "
" It was a wild region , with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods " wrote Lincoln in the Fell autobiography .
More details are found in the sketch he furnished John L. Scripps .
" He ( Thomas Lincoln ) settled in an unbroken forest , and this clearing away of the surplus wood was the great task ahead .
Abraham , though very young was large of his age , and had an ax ( axe ) put into his hands at once : and from that till within his twenty - third year he was almost constantly handling that most useful instrument - less , of course , in plowing and harvesting seasons . "
Herndon reports , " By the time he had reached his seventeenth year he had attained the physical proportions of a full - grown man .
He was employed to assist James Taylor in the management of a ferry boat across the Ohio River near the mouth of Anderson 's Creek , but was not allowed a man 's wages for the work .
He received thirty - seven cents a day for what he afterwards told me was the roughest work a young man could be made to do . "
" In June the entire party , including Offut , boarded a steamboat going up the river .
At St. Louis they disembarked , Offut remaining behind while Lincoln , Hanks , and Johnson started across Illinois on foot .
At Edwardsville they separated .
Hanks going to Springfield , while Lincoln and his step - brother following the road to Coles Country , to which point old Thomas Lincoln had meanwhile removed .
Here
Abe did not tarry long , probably not over a month , but long enough to dispose most effectively of one Daniel Needman , a famous wrestler who had challenged the returned boatman to a test of strength .
The contest took place at a locality known as " Wabash Point " .
Abe threw his antagonist twice with comparative ease , and thereby demonstrated such marked strength and agility as to render him forever popular with the boys of the neighborhood . "
" He enjoyed the brief distinction his exhibitions of strength gave him more than the admiration of his friends for his literary or forensic efforts .
Some of the feats attributed to him almost surpass belief .
One witness declares he was equal to three men , having on a certain occasion carried a load of six hundred pounds .
At another time he walked away with a pair of logs which three robust men were skeptical of their ability to carry .
" He could strike with a maul a heavier blow - could sink an axe deeper into wood than any man I ever saw . " is the testimony of another witness . "
( Interrupting Herndon 's account for a moment to quote from Browne 's biography of Lincoln , on page 53 , quoting Dennis Hanks : " My , how he could chop !
His ax would flash and bite into a sugar - tree or sycamore , and down it would come .
If you heard his fellin ' trees in a clearin ' you would say there was three men at work by the way the trees fell . " )
" They ( the Clary 's Grove boys ) conceded leadership to one Jack Armstrong , a hardy , strong , and well - developed specimen of physical manhood , and under him they were in the habit of " cleaning out " New Salem whenever his order went forth to do so .
Offut and " Bill " Clary - the latter skeptical of Lincoln 's strength and agility - ended a heated discussion in the store one day over the new clerk 's ability to meet the tactic of Clary 's Grove , by a bet of ten dollars that Jack Armstrong was , in the language of the day , " a better man than Lincoln " .
The new clerk strongly opposed this sort of an introduction , but after much entreaty of Offut , at last consented to make his bow to the social lions of the town in this unusual way .
He was now six feet four inches high , and weighed , as a friend and confident , William Green , tells with impressive precision , " two hundred and fourteen pounds " .
The contest was to be a friendly one and fairly conducted .
All New Salem adjourned to the scene of the wrestle .
Money , whisky , knives , and all manner of property were staked on the result .
It is unnecessary to go into the details of the encounter .
Everyone knows how it ended : how at last the tall and angular rail - splitter , enraged at the suspicion of foul tactics , and profiting by his height and length of his arms , fairly lifted the great bully by the throat and shook him like a rag .... "
" Mr. Lincoln 's remarkable strength resulted not so much from muscular power as from the toughness of his sinews .
He could not only lift from the ground enormous weight , but could throw a cannonball or a maul farther than anyone in New Salem . "
" No little of Lincoln 's influence with the men of New Salem can be attributed to his extraordinary feats of strength .
By an arrangement of ropes and straps , harnessed about his hips , he was enabled one day at the mill to astonish a crowd of village celebrities by lifting a box of stones weighing near a thousand pounds . "
( Interrupting Herndon 's account again , on page 154 of Ward H. Lamon 's " The Life of Lincoln " , one reads " Lincoln has often been seen in the old mill on the river bank to lift a box of stones weighing from one thousand to twelve hundred pounds . "
In 1998 the University of Illinois Press published " Herndon 's Informants " , edited by Douglas L. Wilson and Rodney O. Davis .
On page 7 is a May 28 , 1865 letter to William H. Herndon from his cousin , J. Rowan Herndon .
An excerpt , as written , follows : " ... he was By fare the stoutest man that i ever took hold of i was a mear Child in his hands and i considered my self as good a man as there was in the Cuntry untill he Come about i saw him lift Betwen 1000 and 1300 lbs of Rock waid in a Boxx ... "
Continuing Herndon 's account : " There is no fiction either , as suggested by some of his biographers , in the story that he lifted a barrel of whisky from the ground and drank from the bung ; but in performing this later almost incredible feat he did not stand erect and elevate the barrel , but squatted down and lifted it to his knees ... "
" When he walked he moved cautiously but firmly ; his long arms and giant hands swung down by his side .
He walked with even tread , the inner sides of his feet being parallel .
He put his whole foot flat down on the ground at once , not landing on the heal ; he likewise lifted his foot all at once , not rising from the toe , and hence he had no spring to his walk .
His walk was undulatory - catching and pocketing tire , weariness , and pain , all up and down his person , and thus preventing them from locating .
The first impression of a stranger , or a man who did not observe closely , was that his walk implied shrewdness and cunning - that he was a tricky man ; but in reality it was the walk of caution and firmness . "
" From Lincoln ’s campaign biography we read the following : “ In the autumn of 1816 when Abraham was eight years old , his father determined to quit Kentucky .
Already the evil influences of slavery were beginning to be felt by the poor and the non-slave - holders .
But the emigration of Thomas Lincoln is , we believe , to be chiefly attributed to the insecurity of the right by which he held his Kentucky land ; for , in those days , land titles were rather more uncertain than other human affairs .
Abandoning his old home , and striking through the forests in a northwesterly direction , he fixed his new dwelling - place in the heart of the " forest primeval " of what is now Spencer County , Indiana .
The dumb solitude there had never echoed to the ax , and the whole land was a wilderness . "
" The rude cabin of the settler was hastily erected , and then those struggles and hardships commenced which are the common trials of frontier life , and of which the story has been so often repeated .
Abraham was a hardy boy , large for his years , and with his ax did manful service in clearing the land .
Indeed , with that implement , he literally hewed out his path to manhood ; for until he was twenty - three , the ax was seldom out of his hand , except in the intervals of labor , or when it was exchanged for the plow , the hoe , or the sickle . "
" Returning to Herndon : “ Mr. George Close , the partner of Lincoln in the rail - splitting business , says that Lincoln was , at this time , a farm laborer , working from day to day , for different people , chopping wood , mauling rails , or doing whatever was to be done .
The country was poor , and hard work was the common lot ; the heaviest share falling to the young unmarried men , with whom it was a continual struggle to earn a livelihood .
Lincoln and Mr. Close made about one thousand rails together , for James Hawks and William Miller , receiving their pay in homespun clothing .
Lincoln 's bargain with Miller 's wife , was , that he should have one yard of brown jeans , ( richly dyed with walnut bark ) for every four hundred rails made , until he should have enough for a pair of trousers .
As Lincoln was already of great altitude , the number of rails that went to the acquirement of his pantaloons was necessarily immense . "
The primeval forest of America is no more , nor the men and boys who cleared it .
Abraham Lincoln 's father , Thomas , was a man of extraordinary strength .
" ... he could not find the point of separation between his ribs ... " describes a muscularity virtually unknown in the world today .
And , Abraham 's strength was molded , no less than his father 's , by the hardest , sustained physical labor known .
Mr. Offut boasted that there was no stronger man in the State of Illinois than his clerk , Abraham Lincoln .
And , we read in Richard N. Current 's " The Lincoln Nobody Knows " the following : " The strongest man I ever looked at " recalled an Illinoisan who had helped Lincoln with his bath when he was in Galesburg to debate with Stephen A. Douglas ( 1848 ) . "
My favorite description is that of Elliot Herndon , William H. Herndon 's brother .
He succinctly summed up young Lincoln : " I would say he was a cross between Venus and Hercules " .
Continuing to quote Richard N. Currrent , we read , " A couple of years before starting the beard he had referred in public , in his self - deprecating way , to his ' poor lean , lank face . ' "
His nose was prominent and slightly askew , with the tip glowing red , as Herndon noticed .
His heavy eyebrows overhung deep eye - caverns in which his eyes - sometimes dreamy , sometimes penetrating - were set .
His cheekbones were high , his cheeks rather sunken , his mouth wide , his lips thick , especially the lower one , and his chin upturned .
On the right cheek , near his mouth , a solitary mole stood out .
His skin was sallow , leathery , wrinkled , dry , giving him a weather - beaten look .
He had projecting - some said flapping - ears .
His hair was thick and unruly , stray locks falling across his forehead . "
" The foregoing list of traits hardly adds up to a flattering sum .
The physical Lincoln , the external man , was made for caricature , was the delight of cartoonists .
But there was more , far more , to Lincoln 's appearance than all this .
He cannot fairly be depicted by a mere catalogue of his peculiarities .
To the people he met he made an impression which no such inventory can convey . "
" At first glance , some thought him grotesque , even ugly , and almost all considered him homely .
When preoccupied or in repose he certainly was far from handsome .
At times he looked unutterably sad , as if every sorrow were his own , or he looked merely dull , with a vacant gaze .
Still , as even the caustic Englishman Dicey observed , there was for all his grotesqueness , " an air of strength , physical as well as moral , and a strange look of dignity " about him .
And when he spoke a miracle occurred .
" The dull , listless features dropped like a mask . " according to Horace White , an editor of the Chicago Tribune .
" The eyes began to sparkle , the mouth to smile , the whole countenance was wreathed in animation , so that a stranger would have to said , " Why this face , so angular and somber a moment ago , is really handsome ! "
" He was the homeliest man I ever saw . " said Donn Piatt , and yet there was something about the face that Piatt never forgot .
" It brightened , like a lit lantern , when animated . "
" Here was a Lincoln the camera never caught .
When he went to the studio and sat before the lens he invariably relapsed into his sad , dull , abstracted mood .
No wonder , he had to sit absolutely still , with his head against the photographer 's rack , while the tedious seconds ticked by .
It took time to get the image with the slow , wet - plate process of those days .
There was no candid camera , no possibility of taking snapshots which might have recorded Lincoln at his sparkling best .
" I have never seen a picture of him that does anything like justice to the original . " said Henry Villard , the New York Herald reporter .
" He is a much better looking man than any of the pictures represent . "
" The portrait painters were hardly more successful .
" Lincoln 's features were the despair of every artist who undertook his portrait . " his private secretary John G. Nicolay declared .
A painter might measure the subject , scrutinize him in sitting after sitting , and eventually produce a likeness of a sort .
But " this was not he who smiled , spoke , laughed , charmed . " said Nicolay .
The poet Walt Whitman commented after getting a close - up view : " None of the artists or pictures have caught the subtle and indirect expression of this man 's face . "
And again , some years after Lincoln 's death : " Though hundreds of portraits have been made , by painters and photographers ( many to pass on , by copies , to future times ) , I have never seen one yet that in my opinion deserved to be called a perfectly good likeness : nor do I believe there is really such a one in existence . "
" The word pictures do much to supply what the photographs and paintings missed , yet these descriptions also fail to show the man complete .
All who tried to describe him admitted that the phenomenal mobility and expressiveness of his features , the reflections of his complex and wide - ranging personality , were beyond the power of words .
" The tones , the gestures , the kindling eye , and mirth - provoking look defy the reporter 's skill . " the reporter Noah Brooks confessed after seeing Lincoln deliver the Cooper Union speech ( 1860 ) . "
" Beyond a certain point Lincoln 's appearance not only defied description ; it also baffled interpretation .
" There is something in the face which I cannot understand . " said Congressman Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts .
And the leader of the German - Americans in Illinois , Gustave Koerner , remarked : " Something about the man , the face is unfathomable .
In his looks there were hints of mysteries within . "
Here is a rare description of Lincoln in the early 1840's , taken from the October 3 , 1955 issue of " Lincoln Lore " : " The summer edition of the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society has contributed an extremely valuable world portrait of Abraham Lincoln preliminary to his congressional term .
Harmon Y. Reynolds edited the " Masonic Towell " published in Springfield , Illinois and shortly after the assassination of the President prepared an editorial for the issue of May 15 , 1865 , which opened with the statement that he had known Lincoln " ever since 1840 " .
The paragraph in which he described Lincoln in the early forties follows : "
" The people are accustomed to look upon Mr. Lincoln as he appeared when elected President .
The pictures and photographs that meet the eye everywhere , even when flattering him , by no means do justice to his appearance in early manhood .
The first time we saw him to know him , he rose to address the House .
His figure was tall , and his face sufficiently full to relieve the prominences so noticeable in later life .
Although dark , yet his face was fresh , almost to floridness , his eye was brilliant and speaking ( sparkling ) , his hair was heavy and well - dressed , and greatly added to his appearance .
No man in the house seemed to care so little for dress , and yet no one dressed in better taste .
Humor , mercy , and talent were ineffaceably delineated upon his countenance . "
Lincoln described how , in the early 1840's , he appeared to voters who knew him only by his appearance .
In a letter to Martin M. Morris , dated March 26 , 1843 , he wrote , " It would astonish if not amuse , the older citizens to learn that I ( a stranger , friendless , uneducated , penniless boy , working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month ) have been put down here as the candidate of pride , wealth , and aristocratic family distinction . "
I will now close this review by briefly mentioning the daguerreotype image of the young man .
Forensic science confirms its bonefides .
The young man is Lincoln .
In fact , there is no possibility he is not Lincoln .
Because as a child Lincoln suffered a traumatic blow to the head with consequential facial deformities , we are offered unique points of identification which , if present in the Kaplan daguerreotype , would be ponderous evidence .
And , it is all there , clearly , plainly .
These unique , trauma - induced peculiarities of Lincoln 's face ( masterfully analyzed by Dr. Edward J. Kempf. , " Abraham Lincoln 's Organic and Emotional Neurosis " , American Medical Association Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry , April 1952 , Volume 67 , Number 4 , pp. 419-433 ; and " Abraham Lincoln 's Philosophy of Common Sense " , New York Academy of Sciences , 1965 , Volume I , Chapter I , pp. 1 - 18 . ) are seen , unmistakably , in the daguerreotype .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) Introduces Historic Legislation in Wake of State Fiscal Crisis
( San Francisco , C.A. ) Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) today announced the introduction of legislation that would tax and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcoholic beverages .
The bill , the first of its kind ever introduced in California , would create a regulatory structure similar to that used for beer , wine and liquor , permitting taxed sales to adults while barring sales to or possession by those under 21 .
Estimates based on federal government statistics have shown marijuana to be California ’s top cash crop , valued at approximately $ 14 billion in 2006 — nearly twice the combined value of the state ’s number two and three crops , vegetables ( $ 5.7 billion ) and grapes ( $ 2.6 billion ) .
Massive “ eradication ” efforts , wiping out an average of nearly 36,000 cultivation sites per year , have failed to make a dent in this underground industry .
“ It is simply nonsensical that California ’s largest agricultural industry is completely unregulated and untaxed , ” said Marijuana Policy Project California policy director Aaron Smith , who appeared with Ammiano and other officials at a San Francisco news conference to announce the legislation .
“ With our state in an ongoing fiscal crisis — and no one believes the new budget is the end of California ’s financial woes — it ’s time to bring this major piece of our economy into the light of day . ”
Independent experts from around the world , from President Nixon ’s National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse in 1972 to a Canadian Senate special committee in 2002 , have long contended that criminalizing marijuana users makes little sense , given that marijuana is less addictive , much less toxic and far less likely to induce aggression or violence than alcohol .
For example , in an article in the December 2008 Canadian Journal of Psychiatry , Australian researcher Stephen Kisely noted that “ penalties bear little relation to the actual harm associated with cannabis . ”
With more than 26,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

WASHINGTONA decade ago , the U.N. General Assembly set an objective of eliminating or significantly reducing  narcotics cultivation and trafficking by the year 2008 .
According to the data of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime , the effort has been an unmitigated disaster .
Opium and cannabis production have doubled , while cocaine has slightly increased .
The same proportion of adults 5 percent consumes drugs today , mostly marijuana , as in 1998 .
As officials from around the world gather in Vienna this week to chart the next decade of the anti-drug effort , it may be time to rethink the entire approach .
Echoing the Prohibition era in the United States , illegality has engendered organized crime empires that , in order to supply narcotics , undermine the peace and institutions of many countries .
The latest example is Mexico , where President Felipe Calderon has unleashed the wrath of the state against the drug lords .
The war between the state and the cartels , and among the mafias themselves , has mostly taken place in northern cities such as Ciudad Juarez , Tijuana , and Culiacan .
Ten thousand people have been killed and drug - related corruption has been exposed at the highest levels , including the attorney generals office .
The anti-drug budget worldwide is staggering : the United States alone devotes more than $ 40 billion yearly to the effort .
Yet whenever attempts to limit supply manage to raise street prices in one country , prices go down in other countries : in Europe , the price of cocaine has dropped by half since 1990 .
But the crackdown has reduced the purity of the drug , increasing the harm to peoples health .
According to the police , in Britain the purity has decreased from 60 percent to 30 percent in a decade .
Not to mention the consequences to individual liberty .
Those who banned alcohol in 1920 felt compelled to amend the Constitution before they could pass Prohibition .
No such amendment was ever presented to legitimize what Richard Nixon first called the war on drugs in 1971 .
The excesses committed in its name have created all sorts of social stigmas including the fact that about 30 percent of black males in America spend some time in jail in large part due to drug - related offenses .
Three Latin American former presidents Brazils Fernando Henrique Cardoso , Mexicos Ernesto Zedillo , and Colombias Cesar Gaviriarecently put out a report condemning the war on drugs as a counterproductive failure , advocating a public health - based approach instead of repression .
In anticipation of the meeting in Vienna , the latest issue of The Economist magazine , the bible of many current and aspiring enforcers of the law , devoted its cover , a survey and an editorial to making the case for legalization .
For years , conservative publications such as The Wall Street Journal have run articles expressing the same view , including those by its expert on Latin America , Mary OGrady .
Leaders on the right ( Henry Kissinger ) and organizations of the center - left ( George Soros Open Society Institute ) have also spoken out on the issue .
No one knows exactly how drug use would be impacted by its legalization or its decriminalization .
In countries where it is severely punished , consumption is high , which might mean that it would stabilize or even drop .
Many European countries Spain , Portugal , Italy , several Swiss cantons have extremely lenient drug policies ; consumption in those countries ( except for Spain ) is not very high .
But even assuming a moderate increase in consumption , decriminalization or legalization would eliminate or substantially diminish the horrific side effects of the current war .
A movement in favor of legalization has existed in the United States for years .
Because it is associated with the cultural war that has raged since the 1960s , its impact has been small .
But the debate goes on .
In many states the police do not go after personal possession of marijuana , and California is considering a bill that would make it legal .
The vestiges of Puritan dogmatism which H.L. Mencken memorably called the inferior mans hatred of the man who is having a better time  have made it difficult to open a serious debate nationwide .
Today we regard the Opium Wars of the 19th century by which the British retaliated against China for clamping down on opium imports as crazy .
One and a half centuries from now , people will read in total amazement that so much blood and treasure was wasted in the failed pursuit of a private vice that a relatively small percentage of the world population was not ready to give up .
Topolanek Toppled EU without a Leader after Czech Government Collapses
The opposition in Prague has brought down Mirek Topolanek 's government -- even though the Czech prime minister is the current president of the EU .
Euro- skeptics close to President Vaclav Klaus could profit most from Topolanek 's defeat .
To the displeasure of many on both sides of aisle , President Obama on today is hosting the so - called Fiscal Responsibility Summit at the White House .
While some Democrats question the timing of Obama 's expenditure of political capital on Social Security , Medicare and other entitlement reform , obstructionist Republicans are ridiculing the event even as they hype the myth of Republican fiscal discipline .
And a myth it surely is .
Far from the deficit hawks of Republican legend , the modern Republican Party from Reagan forward devastated the U.S. treasury , leaving mounting debt and hemorrhaging red ink for as far as the eye can see .
Of course , you 'd never know it listening to the grousing from some of President Obama 's Republican guests .
On Sunday , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) declared the summit " sobering up here and beginning to rethink the kind of debt that we 're laying on future generations . "
And New Hampshire Senator and aborted Commerce Secretary Judd Gregg turned on his would - have - been boss , sneering :
'' It can either be a nice press event .
Or it can be a substantive event .
History tells us it will be the first .
We 've had these meetings before .
There 's always a lot of people willing to point out the problem . "
As the history of the past 30 years shows , those people " willing to point out the problem " are called Republicans .
The ones doing something about it are called Democrats .
As the chart above shows , the national debt under president Reagan , Bush 41 and Bush 43 exploded as a percentage of GDP , interrupted only by the all - too - brief fiscal sanity of the Clinton years .
And to be sure , the budget surpluses of the late 1990 's seem like a distant memory .
That did n't prevent the AP 's Liz Sidoti , who famously presented John McCain with a box of doughnuts during a 2008 AP campaign forum , from faithfully regurgitating last week Republicans ' talking points about a return to their tall tale of the GOP as heroic guardians of the national purse :
" The GOP 's strategy of emphasizing its so - called bedrock principles - restrained spending , limited government and deep tax cuts - comes as the party works to rehabilitate itself after eight years of Bush 's leadership and rebound from back - to - back elections that saw Republicans lose their grip on Congress and the White House . "
Unfortunately , the Republicans ' fiscal rot did n't begin with George W. Bush , but with Ronald Reagan .
It was the legendary Gipper whose financial recklessness and tax - cutting fetish came to define the modern GOP .
The numbers tell the story .
As predicted , Reagan 's massive $ 749 billion supply - side tax cuts in 1981 quickly produced even more massive annual budget deficits .
Combined with his rapid increase in defense spending , Reagan delivered not the balanced budgets he promised , but record - settings deficits .
Even his OMB alchemist David Stockman could not obscure the disaster with his famous " rosy scenarios . "
Forced to raise taxes twice to avert financial catastrophe ( a fact conveniently forgotten in the conservative hagiography of Reagan ) , the Gipper nonetheless presided over a doubling of the American national debt .
By the time he left office in 1989 , Ronald Reagan equaled the entire debt burden produced by the previous 200 years of American history .
For his part , George H.W. Bush hardly stemmed the flow of red ink .
And when Bush the Elder broke his " read my lips , no new taxes " pledge to address the cascading budget shortfalls , his own Republican Party turned on him .
While Bush 's apostasy helped ensure his defeat by Bill Clinton , it was Clinton 's 1993 deficit - cutting package ( passed without a single GOP vote in either house of Congress ) which helped usher in the surpluses of the late 1990's .
Alas , they were to be short - lived .
Inheriting a federal budget in the black and CBO forecast for a $ 5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years , President George W. Bush quickly set about dismantling the progress made under Clinton .
Bush 's $ 1.4 trillion tax cut in 2001 , followed by a second round in 2003 , accounted for the bulk of the yawning budget deficits he produced .
Like Reagan and Stockman before him , Bush resorted to the rosy scenario to claim he would halve the budget deficit by 2009 .
Before the financial system meltdown last fall , Bush 's deficit already reached $ 490 billion .
( And even before the passage of the Wall Street bailout , Bush had presided over a $ 4 trillion increase in the national debt , a staggering 71 % jump . )
By this January , the mind - numbing deficit figure reached $ 1.2 trillion , forcing President Bush to raise the debt ceiling to $ 11.3 trillion .
And so it goes .
The Republican Party of No decries President Obama 's deficit spending urgently needed to rescue the country from the economic cataclysm over which they presided .
While relatively minor adjustments to the 1980's grand compromise are needed to assure the long - term solvency of Social Security , the GOP will no doubt balk at the serious health care reforms required to avoid the looming Medicare train wreck .
Regardless , the Republicans will continue to point the finger of blame for the endless sea of red ink they themselves produced .
As Vice President Dick Cheney famously said in 2002 , " Reagan proved deficits do n't matter . "

The FBI is advising users of the open source VoIP package Asterisk to upgrade to the latest version , but has so far provided very little evidence on what vulnerability it has detected .
The FBI 's warning as published at the Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3 ) is vague at best .
The warning states : " The recent attacks were conducted by hackers exploiting a security vulnerability in Asterisk software .
Asterisk is free and widely used software developed to integrate PBXii systems with Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) , digital Internet voice calling services ; however , early versions of the Asterisk software are known to have a vulnerability . "
These so - called " vishing " attacks are phishing attacks turned vocal .
Normally , a visher would send out a wave of phishing e-mail with a telephone number enclosed .
Those who call are greeted by workers in a " legitimate " call center , and are prodded to give out private information .
Hackers can supposedly use this new vulnerability to take over to call Asterisk users directly .
The vagueness of the FBI 's warning undermines most of the good it might do ; the government recommends updating to the latest version of Asterisk , but there are two versions currently offered for download : 1.6.03 - rc1 ( beta ) and 1.4.22 .
Without more information on which " early " version of the program the FBI is referring to , its impossible for users of a not - quite - new - but - recent version of the software to know if they 're in the clear or not .
As of December 6 , the FBI had not yet contacted Asterisk 's developers or anyone at Digium .
According to Asterisk 's blog , " [ Neither ]
Digium nor anyone else involved with OSS Asterisk to my knowledge has not been contacted by the FBI or the IC3 ( a division of the FBI ) on this topic , so much of what we know is speculation at this point .
Digium believes at this point that this warning was as a result of security issues that probably have nothing to do with Asterisk in specific , but are more general , such as some sites using poor password choices on VoIP accounts .
It is possible that this is a re-hash of an earlier security issue that was resolved in March , or perhaps of a totally separate set of security issues which are unknown to us . "
Digium is a bit peeved that the FBI would issue such a warning without even attempting to consult the company in any way ; as of that writing , all of Digium 's attempts to reach the FBI have gone unanswered .
The warning may reference a specific bug ( AST - 2008 -03 ) , but that issue was repaired last March .
We 'll update on the situation once it 's clear if there 's actually a problem and what versions of Asterisk are ( and are n't ) affected .
The cost of drugs will be cut in 50 countries
The new chief executive of pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline had said the company will cut prices for its drugs in the developing world .
Andrew Witty said GSK would cut the cost of drugs in the 50 poorest nations to 25 % of price in the UK and US .
He also said the firm would share knowledge of patents and reinvest profits in local clinics .
Charities have long campaigned for such a policy as patents prevent cheaper generic versions of drugs .
' Landmark announcement '
Mr Witty told the Guardian newspaper drugs companies had a duty to help the poor .
This is a gutsy move in a commercial world .
Mike French , World Vision
He said : " We work like crazy to come up with the next great medicine , knowing that it 's likely to get used an awful lot in developed countries , but we could do something for developing countries .
" Are we working as hard on that ?
I want to be able to say yes we are , and that 's what this is all about - trying to make sure we are even - handed in terms of our efforts to find solutions not just for developed but for developing countries . "
Formulas and processes owned by GSK under patent will be shared with researchers and 20 % of the firm 's profits in the developing world will be reinvested in hospitals and clinics there .
Health campaigners have said more needed to be done but they welcomed the initiative .
Oxfam said an affordable HIV treatment , for instance , could stop 6,000 people dying every day in countries affected by the HIV / Aids epidemic .
Charity World Vision 's director of advocacy Mike French said : " Slashing drug prices is good .
But without the necessary health infrastructure many wo n't be able to access those drugs .
Therefore , investment by GSK , along with the knowledge pooling , make this a landmark announcement .
" This is a gutsy move in a commercial world .
Witty has demonstrated a willingness to make saving lives a business goal along with making money . "

The Khronos group announced the ratification and public release of the OpenCL 1.0 specification described as the first open , royalty - free standard for cross-platform , parallel programming of modern processors found in personal computers , servers and handheld / embedded devices .
OpenCL provides programmers tools to speed up a wide variety of applications by taking advantage of untapped GPU processors and multi-core processors found in modern computers .
Apple originally proposed OpenCL as part of their upcoming Snow Leopard operating system , and their release deadline helped accelerate the adoption of the specification .
OpenCL has been developed and ratified by a number of industry companies including Apple , NVIDIA , ARM , Intel , and many others .
We are excited about the industry - wide support for OpenCL , said Bertrand Serlet , Apple 's senior vice president of Software Engineering .
Apple developed OpenCL so that any application in Snow Leopard , the next major version of Mac OS X , can harness an amazing amount of computing power previously available only to graphics applications .
For the end user , this should allow developers to more easily take advantage of existing hardware ( GPUs , CPUs ) to deliver faster software performance .
Apple 's Snow Leopard operating system ( Mac OS X 10.6 ) is due for release in 2009 with recent hints pointing to the 1st quarter .
Behold the Washington - speak :
For example , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , often described as the most influential pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington , " took no position on this matter and did not lobby the Hill on it , " spokesman Josh Block said .
But Block responded to reporters ' questions and provided critical material about Freeman , albeit always on background , meaning his comments could not be attributed to him , according to three journalists who spoke to him .
Asked about this yesterday , Block replied : " As is the case with many , many issues every day , when there is general media interest in a subject , I often provide publicly available information to journalists on background . "
Greenwald notes how Block 's games - now you see me , now you do n't - corrupt our discourse :
Reporters agreed to keep AIPAC 's " private " involvement a secret by allowing them to do everything " on background , " and -- far worse -- then allowed what they knew to be the false impression to be created that AIPAC had no involvement in the campaign .
Instead of the truth , what we have is AIPAC insinuating ( through Mark Mazzetti's article ) and Fred Hiatt outright stating that Freeman 's accusations of AIPAC 's involvement are false and deranged -- all because journalists concealed AIPAC 's involvement by agreeing to keep it all off the record and therefore pretending it did n't exist .
I do n't understand why Block and AIPAC can't lobby against an appointment in public , in the light of day , and for attribution .
Even in my own emails with Block , there was an absurd kabuki dance of ' on the record ' , ' background ' and the like .
This is not national security : you 're a fricking lobby .
What are you so touchy about ?
There 's a sad dynamic here .
The partly rational paranoia of some Jewish groups leads to excessive secrecy which feeds the partly rational paranoia of others .
A little less background and anonymity and a little more Schumer - style grandstanding would actually be healthier .
And a little more honest .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

( CNN ) -- Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek shocked the normally civil European Parliament on Wednesday by warning that Washington 's plans to fight the global economic crisis are " the way to hell . "
Czech Prime Minister Topolanek 's comments come just days before a scheduled visit by President Obama .
The apparently off - the - cuff remarks of the leader of a small Central European country might not normally make waves -- particularly since his parliament had pulled the rug out from under him just the night before .
But the Czech Republic currently holds the rotating six - month presidency of the European Union , making Topolanek , in some sense , one of the leaders of the 27 - country bloc that is larger than the United States .
President Barack Obama plans to visit the Czech capital of Prague next week after stopping in London for the G - 20 summit of leading industrialized and emerging economies .
So for Topolanek to attack the United States -- and its Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner by name -- is a big deal .
" The path the United States has chosen is historically discredited , " he said , advising Americans to " read dusty history books " so as to avoid repeating " the errors of the 1930s " and the Great Depression .
Czech analysts caution that the Topolanek quote getting the most attention -- " the way to hell " -- sounds worse in English than it does in Czech .
" It means a little something different , " said Jan Machacek , an economist and analyst for the Czech newspaper Hospodarske noviny .
" This is an anti-religious country .
When people say hell , they say it much more lightly than people do in America .
It sounds like he listens to AC / DC , " the heavy - metal band .
Jiri Pehe , the head of New York University in Prague and a leading political analyst , agreed that the remark " sounds a bit more sinister in English than it does in Czech . "
Watch more on Topolanek 's comments »
But Pehe made no excuses for the Czech prime minister , who he said spoke out of both ignorance and political conviction .
" He does n't really know very much about the U.S. stimulus package , ( and ) he is a self - professed neo-liberal who believes that government should not intervene " in the markets , said Pehe , a long - time critic of Topolanek 's center - right Civic Democratic Party .
Free -market fundamentalism may be a valid stance for the head of a small country in the middle of Europe , Pehe said , but it was inappropriate for Topolanek to express when the Czech Republic holds the EU presidency .
" He is entitled to those beliefs , but when he says that on this kind of stage -- which means it 's going to travel to the United States -- it 's stupid .
The vocabulary he uses is unfortunate , " Pehe said .
Topolanek may have been flustered , said Machacek , because his government lost a confidence vote in parliament the night before -- by a single vote .
That means he and all the ministers in his government must resign , which he said Wednesday he will do .
Czech President Vaclav Klaus is expected to ask Topolanek to try to form a new government .
Machacek also said Topolanek 's criticism of the U.S. stimulus plan may be based on purely local experience .
" His perspective is influenced by the Czech experience .
This is a small open economy , where the stimulus would not be effective , " he said .
" With a stimulus here , people would save it or buy foreign goods -- ( which would ) stimulate ( other countries ' ) economies , " rather than the Czech one .
" He should be much more careful , not speaking about the Czech experience , but speaking from the EU perspective , " the economist added .
That said , Machacek argued , Topolanek 's position is not completely outside the pale in the European Union .
" The Czech perspective does n't differ that much from the German position , " he said .
" But the Germans would never be so undiplomatic . "

Bob ’s feeling may have something to do , in this case as in many others , with the circumstances under which he first got to know his animal .
After he paid $ 1,500 to a dealer in Missouri , Higgins arrived , at about 3 months old , in diapers , with a bottle .
Although he had his own cage , in his own room , he often slept in the couple ’s bed .
Bob changed his diapers several times a day , and often took him to work at his construction equipment business , slipping him under his shirt .
On the way back , they would get Higgins an ice cream .
Image BEHIND BARS Bob raised Higgins , a baboon , from infancy .
Because Higgins has attacked him , he keeps him caged in a heated building where they often watch TV .
Credit ... Phil Mansfield for The New York Times
Then , when Higgins turned 3 , the problems began .
Carlie , who after all runs a preserve that is home to a yak , two emus , alligators and a camel , found Higgins to be loving .
But when he was out of the cage , she says , “ he was just too destructive . ”
“ I live in a 200 - year - old farmhouse , ” Carlie says .
“ Jumping up and down trying to get out of his cage , he cracked the ceiling and the walls .
He took all the filigree off my bedroom furniture .
One day I went in to feed him and he grabbed me by the hair and yanked me against the cage .
I ended up on the ground in tears , in such agony .
They thought I had a detached retina . ”
Bob has been bitten several times by Higgins , who now weighs 50 pounds and has large incisors .
Once , when Bob was leading him from an outdoor enclosure back to his cage in the house , Higgins exploded and the two got into a battle so ferocious that despite the steel mesh glove Bob was wearing , he screamed for Carlie to get his .22 rifle and put a bullet in Higgins ’s head .
She got Higgins a slice of raisin bread instead , quickly defusing the fight .
But Bob accepts it : a wild animal will never be domesticated , he says .
Higgins now lives in a heated building on the property , which includes a 9 - by - 12 - foot cage and a 30 - by - 12 - foot outdoor exercise area with an 8 - foot ceiling .
One must pass through two locked doors to get inside Higgins ’s cage .
Even Bob does n’t get in the cage with Higgins much anymore .
Allen Hirsch , a successful New York City painter , also bonded with his monkey early in its life .
Benjamin , a 12 - year - old capuchin monkey who came to Mr. Hirsch as a sickly mistreated infant , is like “ a primordial human , ” he says .
“ You recognize something very human in his gaze , a certain understanding , a certain awareness . ”
From the start , Mr. Hirsch said , it has been a time - consuming , demanding relationship .
After Benjamin bit off two of his own diseased toes , Mr. Hirsch stayed with him for four months , rarely leaving his side .
Since having a monkey as a pet is illegal in New York City , he now keeps Benjamin in his country house in Catskill , N.Y. , where a friend must often look after him .
( New York State also banned monkeys as pets four years ago , but Benjamin is grandfathered in . )
Senator 's Solution To Dying Newspapers : Become A Non-Profit
from the lifeline - or - anchor ?
dept
With many newspapers struggling to stay in business , a lot of ideas have been tossed around about how to keep existing papers alive .
One idea , which has reached the US Senate in the form of a bill introduced by Senator Benjamin Cardin , is to allow newspapers to operate as non-profits , which would exempt them from taxes on subscription and advertising revenue , while also allowing them to raise funds via donations , similar to how public broadcasting companies operate .
This approach would seem to have many potential issues .
First of all , to qualify for the program , a paper would no longer be allowed publish editorial endorsements .
This could have the twin effect of chilling editorial commentary in support of or against various candidates ' positions , and driving more bias into the reporting .
It would also put the government in charge of what could or could not show up in a paper 's editorial pages .
Second , to be successful , the papers would be heavily dependent on donations , which could raise questions about objectivity .
But the biggest problem with this approach is that it simply props up a failing business model , rather than forcing the newspapers to adjust to the new realities of the marketplace .
In the senators own words :
" We are losing our newspaper industry , " Cardin said .
" The economy has caused an immediate problem , but the business model for newspapers , based on circulation and advertising revenue , is broken , and that is a real tragedy for communities across the nation and for our democracy .
Whether the loss of newspapers ( as opposed to journalism ) is a tragedy " for our democracy " is certainly debatable .
But the senator is right about the business model being broken .
And if that 's the case , would n't it be wiser to experiment with new , better models , rather than put the old one on life support ?

WASHINGTON -- Gov. Bob Riley said Sunday that he may reject about $ 66 million of federal economic stimulus money meant to expand unemployment benefits , calling it a bribe that usurps state authority .
" I will never support something that takes away our state 's ability to set our own rules and regulations for unemployment , " Riley said .
Riley , in Washington for the National Governors Association meeting , said he is still studying the rules for accepting the extra unemployment compensation money and has not decided whether to turn it down .
If he does , he 'll join a handful of other Southern Republican governors who are finding that some aspects of the $ 787 billion federal economic stimulus package intrude on state policy .
The stimulus law , signed last week by President Barack Obama , will send about $ 3 billion to shore up Alabama 's ailing state budgets , mostly for Medicaid , transportation projects and education .
Riley said the law also gives Alabama about $ 33 million for unemployment compensation , including increasing benefits by $ 25 per week , which he will accept .
But if the state agrees to expand eligibility to even more laid off workers , the figure jumps to about $ 99 million .
" To come out and offer us twice as much if we agree to the federal philosophy , that really is like a bribe , " Riley said in an interview .
" We 're not going to give up Alabama 's responsibility and authority to determine what our own business interests and employee benefits are going to be . "
The extra $ 66 million would last less than three years , and Riley argues that the mandate would remain , leaving Alabama businesses to pick up the slack .
In Louisiana , for example , Gov. Bobby Jindal said the law would eventually cost his state 's businesses an extra $ 12 million in higher unemployment taxes .
An estimated cost for Alabama businesses was not available Sunday .
But if Riley turns down the extra unemployment funds , Democrats in the Alabama Legislature would object , according to state Sen.
Roger Bedford , D - Russellville .
" If governors do n't step up to the plate to help people who are hurting in our states , then the Legislatures have a right to apply for the money and I can assure you we 're going to get every dollar we can to help Alabamians , " Bedford said Sunday .
Nationally , about 37 percent of unemployed workers collect unemployment benefits , according to the National Employment Law Project , which supports the expanded unemployment benefit program to cover more low - wage and part - time workers who lose their jobs .
They estimate that , if states agree to the expansions , another 500,000 workers a year across the country would be eligible to collect unemployment .
Alabama 's unemployment rate in December 2008 was 6.7 percent , up from 6 percent in November .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Obama administration officials are hammering out the details of a $ 50 billion foreclosure prevention program that the president is set to unveil Wednesday in Arizona , sources said .
Details remain scarce , but officials are looking to help homeowners who are in danger of defaulting on their mortgages , as well as those already behind , according to sources close to the discussions .
Until now , most government and industry efforts have centered only on the delinquent .
The administration is under intense pressure to find a solution to the housing crisis , which many experts say is crucial to reviving the overall economy .
More than a million homes are already in foreclosure , and more than 2 million more are expected to succumb this year .
Obama has long promised that his fix will go beyond the steps taken by his predecessor .
The multipart plan will for the first time commit government money to spur loan modifications .
One likely component will be interest - rate subsidies for at - risk borrowers , with the government matching the servicer 's rate reduction .
Borrowers would have to take an affordability test to see whether they could handle the monthly payment on the reworked loan .
" Our focus will be on using the full resources of the government to help bring down mortgage payments and to reduce mortgage interest rates , " Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said last week as he announced the administration 's financial stability plan .
The administration is also expected to ramp up loan modifications of borrowers in default .
These modifications would lower monthly payments to more affordable terms - often 31 % to 38 % of gross monthly income - through reducing interest rates or lengthening the loan 's term .
Several mortgage servicers , as well as mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , already have implemented loan modification programs with mixed success .
The administration would likely require all banks receiving bailout money to implement such plans .
While the administration has not said much so far , industry executives and housing advocates are hoping Wednesday 's announcement will contain a detailed and comprehensive fix for the foreclosure crisis .
Geithner came under heavy fire last week for unveiling few specifics in the long - awaited financial stability plan , the successor to the Bush administration 's $ 700 billion financial industry bailout .
Beyond bailout
Whatever Obama unveils Wednesday , efforts by the administration and Congress will go beyond the financial industry bailout .
On deck is controversial legislation to allow bankruptcy judges to modify loans on primary residences .
The financial industry is staunchly opposed to this measure , but administration officials told them last week to expect it to happen this year .
Also , lawmakers are working to extend and amend measures enacted last year to help troubled borrowers .
The $ 787 billion stimulus package set to be signed into law Tuesday increases the loan limits for mortgages insured under the Federal Housing Administration , as well as those that can be bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , to as much as $ 729,500 , up from $ 625,500 .
The higher limit , which was in effect last year , is designed to help those with larger mortgages refinance into more affordable loans and to make it easier for people to purchase homes in high - cost areas .
To spur home sales , first - time buyers will get a tax credit worth up to $ 8,000 on their 2008 or 2009 taxes , under the stimulus package .
The credit starts to phase out for buyers who make more than $ 75,000 for singles or $ 150,000 for couples .
This measure , which builds on a tax credit enacted last year , is intended to help soak up the inventory on the market , which is also depressing home values .
Congressional Democrats are also looking to fix the faltering Hope for Homeowners program , which was designed to refinance struggling borrowers into government - backed FHA loans .
Few borrowers have signed up , in part because of its high fees .
Lawmakers hope to make it more attractive by easing the terms and providing incentives for servicers to participate .
The House Financial Services Committee recently passed legislation taking these steps .
Such a revamp was in the Senate version of the stimulus package but did n't make it into the final version .
Unemployment still a concern
A major problem confronting the Obama administration , however , is what to do with the rising number of foreclosures stemming from unemployment .
Loan modifications do n't work for these borrowers .
The only viable solution for these delinquent homeowners is to get the economy moving again so they can get jobs and catch up on their bills , experts said .
Whatever the administration chooses to do , it should implement it quickly , experts said .
Several banks , including Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , have agreed to put a moratorium on foreclosures until the president unveils his plan , after coming under pressure from Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass .
Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) are also holding off on foreclosures in the pool of mortgages it owns .
Still , more than 2.4 million homes are expected to succumb to foreclosure this year with as many as 9 million falling into foreclosure over the next four years , according to some estimates .
" Massive foreclosures and their contagion effects formed the epicenter of the financial crisis , " said John Taylor , head of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , who was among those meeting with the administration last week .
" We need a plan that meaningfully reduces loan costs through interest rate cuts and principal loan reductions . "
" The longer Treasury delays announcing substantive measures to bring financial stability to working families and communities , the longer the U.S. financial system and overall economy will suffer , " he said .

( CNN ) -- Bruce Windsor is known as many things : church deacon , soccer coach , father of four .
But facing potential financial problems , he 's now known as something else : suspected bank robber .
Bruce Windsor listens Friday as a judge tells him he faces kidnapping and robbery charges .
Police say the 43 - year - old owner of a real estate company walked into the Carolina First Bank in Greenville , South Carolina , late Thursday with a mask and a handgun .
In court documents filed Friday , police said he forced two bank employees into an office at gunpoint and demanded money .
Police arrived minutes later with the suspect still inside , touching off a tense 90 - minute standoff before he released the hostages and surrendered .
His actions were " out of character " for a man who has never been in trouble with the law before , friends and relatives said .
His tearful sister , defending him as he stood before a judge , said , " He must have just snapped under the pressure . "
In his initial appearance for a bond hearing , Windsor was in an orange jail jumpsuit , shackled and with his hands cuffed .
In a quiet voice , he answered " yes , sir " as the judge explained the charges to him : two counts of kidnapping , one count of robbery and two counts of pointing firearms at a person , charges that could carry more than 30 years in prison if convicted .
A police detective told the judge Windsor said he had been experiencing financial problems .
But police spokesman Cpl. Jason Rampey told CNN they could not yet say for certain whether money problems were the motive for the alleged robbery .
His attorney said in court Windsor had been married for 16 years and was the father of four children .
Reports say the oldest is 11 .
Attorney Sidney Mitchell told the judge he was " a model citizen up until yesterday , ' and we 've obviously got a lot of talking to do with him , " Rampey said .
The judge allowed his family to stand with him during the court appearance .
His sister clutched his arm , crying through most of the brief hearing .
His wife stood behind him , appearing to rub his back .
His pastor at Brushy Creek Baptist Church , where Windsor is a deacon , stood at his side .
His sister told the judge Windsor coaches one of his children 's soccer teams and picks them up every day from school .
" He would never , ever hurt his family , " she said in a halting voice .
Sobbing , she said , " I can't imagine the desperation that must have caused this . "
The incident , she said , " does n't even register . "
Windsor then spoke up , saying , " I 've never stolen anything in my life . "
But the judge reminded the court " this is a very serious incident , " setting the bail at just over $ 1.5 million .
On Thursday , SWAT officers surrounded the Carolina First bank as the suspect allegedly made the hostages move with him at gunpoint inside until he surrendered .
Bank owner Art Seaver , who nervously watched the standoff unfold at the scene , met with his employees before they reopened Friday morning for a " time of reflection and a time of healing . "
Asked if everything was back to normal , he told CNN affiliate WSPA , " No . What is normal ? "
Two different images of Windsor unfolded the day after the incident .
The man his pastor called " one of the best fathers I know , anywhere " and the man court documents said " forced the victims to move with him at gunpoint during the attempted robbery .
The victims were held by the accuser against their will for over an hour . "
Rampey said Greenville 's crisis negotiating team just happened to be training on Thursday for hostage scenario when the call came in for the real thing .
As SWAT officers took up positions outside , negotiators talked to the suspect , who then allowed the hostages to go .
SWAT officers said in court documents they " challenged the subject at gunpoint " before he lay down on the ground and surrendered .
No shots were fired and no one was injured .

Web standards have evolved considerably over the years and browser compatibility is better than ever , but one important area where standards are just starting to catch up is support for streaming video .
Proprietary browser plugins are used extensively across the web to play video from popular sites .
This creates serious lock - in risk and gives proprietary software vendors like Adobe a lot of control over the medium .
Although alternatives such as Microsoft's Silverlight are beginning to change the game and force Adobe to open up , there still is n't a viable , vendor - neutral , standards - based alternative that can shift the balance of power over to end - users and tear down some of the walls that limit how video content is experienced on the Web .
Mozilla and the Wikimedia Foundation have launched an initiative to help improve the quality of open , standards - based video technology .
Mozilla has given the Wikimedia Foundation a $ 100,000 grant intended to fund development of the Ogg container format and the Theora and Vorbis media codecs .
These open media codecs are thought to be unencumbered by software patents , which means that they can be freely implemented and used without having to pay royalties or licensing fees to patent holders .
This differentiates Ogg Theora from many other formats that are widely used today .
The Ogg development improvements will be coordinated by the Wikimedia Foundation .
The organization uses
Ogg for virtually all of its rich media , which makes it one of the largest open media format adopters on the Internet .
In a statement published at the organization 's Web site , Wikimedia deputy director Erik M�ller expressed his support for the initiative and explained that open formats are needed to ensure the availability of free content in unrestricted formats .
" Open standards for audio and video are important because they can be used by anyone for any purpose without royalties , and can be inspected and improved by an open community .
Today , video and audio on the web are dominated by proprietary technologies , most frequently patent - encumbered codecs wrapped into closed - source player widgets , " M�ller writes .
" Wikimedia and Mozilla want to help to build a web where video and audio are first class citizens : easy to use and manipulate by anyone , without compulsory royalty schemes or other barriers to participation . "
Mozilla is integrating support for the Ogg format directly into Firefox 3.1 , so the next version of the popular open source web browser will be able to play Ogg media without requiring any plugins or external software .
The Ogg format will be supported through Firefox 's implementation of the HTML 5 video element , which allows video to be seamlessly interwoven with conventional HTML content and manipulated through the DOM .
Mozilla has recently demonstrated the video element feature being used for streaming video .
Opera is also integrating standards - based video support into its browser and has a working implementation of Ogg for HTML 5 .
Although the technology is starting to fall into place , it will take time for the standard to be supported broadly enough to encourage adoption by sites that stream rich media .
The lack of DRM support inherent in the open implementation will also likely impede adoption by major commercial content creators .
Standards - based solutions may never manage to displace Flash , but the first big steps need to be taken for this to even be a possibility .

SOUAD ABED RABBO was in her apartment on the edge of the Jabalya refugee camp near the Israeli border on January 7 when the call came from Israeli soldiers for everyone in the area to come outside .
Her apartment had been bombed , and there was an Israeli tank unit approaching the building .
" We started coming outside of the apartment , and we were waving white flags to show that we were not fighters , " she said through a translator yesterday .
Among the first to exit the building were one of her sons , Khaled , and his wife and three daughters , Amal , 2 , Sammer , 4 , and Souad , 7 .
Two soldiers were standing on either side of the tank outside the house , she said .
Another of her sons , Husam , told the Herald that one of the soldiers was an officer .
Saudi princess speaks out in support of lifting the country 's ban on women drivers
The wife of one of Saudi Arabia ’s richest men says she is ready to get behind the wheel as soon as the ban on women drivers is lifted .
Princess Amira al - Taweel , who is married to global tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , told the Saudi daily Al - Watan that she already drives when she travels abroad .
' Certainly I 'm ready to drive a car , ' said Amira , whose husband is a nephew of Saudi King Abdallah and is ranked as the world 's 13th - richest person by Forbes magazine .
Women in Saudi Arabia are currently banned from driving because of the risk of creating ' sinful temptation '
' I have an international driver 's license , and I drive a car in all the countries I travel to . '
Women in Saudi Arabia have not been permitted to drive since the establishment of the state in 1932 , but the government is set to lift its ban and issue a decree by the end of the year .
However if the ban is lifted , there are likely to be hurdles such as obtaining licences and insurance which must also be overcome .
Princess al - Taweel said : ' I prefer driving a car with my sister or friend next to me instead of being with a driver who is not ( related to me ) . ’
The prohibition forces families to hire live - in drivers , and those who cannot afford the $ 300 - $ 400 a month for a driver must rely on male relatives to drive them to work , school , shopping or the doctor .
But change will be difficult in this ultraconservative society , where many believe that women at the wheel create situations for sinful temptation .
They argue that women drivers will be free to leave home alone , will unduly expose their eyes while driving and will interact with male strangers , such as traffic police and mechanics .
Woo - hoo !
The Simpsonsare coming .
On St Patrick ’s Day Homer and Grampa will come home in an episode being broadcast in Ireland ahead of its transmission in the US for the first time in the 20 - year history of the show .

Homer is prompted into the out - of - character act of kindness for Abe Simpson after forgetting to join him in the father and son three - legged race at Springfield Retirement Castle ’s seniors ’ sports day .
After a scolding by Marge , Homer takes Grampa across the water to O’Flanagan ’s where he claims to have spent the best night of his life .
On arrival , however , the village is n’t quite how he remembers it .
Father and son inevitably drink too much and end up buying the pub off Tom O’Flanagan , whose voice has been provided by Colm Meaney .
In news which will either be greeted with joy or horror by Fáilte Ireland , the pair also stop off at several Irish landmarks including the Giant ’s Causeway , the Blarney Castle and , obviously , the Guinness Brewery .
To mark the broadcast , the executive producers of the show Al Jean and James L Brooks , along with Nancy Cartwright , the voice of Bart , will also travel to Ireland for an exclusive screening of the episode while Homer Simpson has been drafted into to edit the March edition of Sky Magazine .
Jean , Brooks and Cartwright are also scheduled to feature in Dublin ’s St Patrick 's Festival Parade and are expected to be on a Simpson ’s float which is in the process of being hastily assembled .
The Simpsonsis the longest - running primetime animated series ever and the longest - running comedy series in television history .
With countless awards to its name , the show has become legendary for its sharp humour and unparalleled celebrity guest list over the years .
The episode will be broadcast on Sky1 and Sky1 HD St Patrick ’s Day , Tuesday 17th March at 7.30 pm .

Google Earth fills in its watery blanks .
Users can explore the sea bed , data on the changing oceans , sea-life and even the best surf spots Google
Since Google Earth launched in 2006 ­millions of people have used its virtual globe to " travel " around the planet without leaving home , climbing a digital version of Mount Everest and even flying into space thanks to the program .
Now the internet company plans to take on one of the last bastions of the unknown : the depths of the ocean .
At a high - profile event in San Francisco , Google is expected to announce the addition of vast amounts of underwater imagery and seabed maps to the Google Earth project .
The move will take Google Earth closer to its aim of creating a complete digital representation of the planet .
The existing site , to which an estimated 400 million people have had access , already includes three - dimensional representations of large cities around the world and includes images from street - level and aerial photo­graphy covering thousands of miles across Britain and elsewhere .
The new additions to the program are expected to include views of the ocean , and portions of the seabed .
They will also ­provide detailed environmental data that will enhance information about the effect of climate change on the world 's seas and oceans .
To showcase the transformation , the site 's chief executive , Eric Schmidt , will introduce dignitaries including the former US vice president and environmental campaigner Al Gore , and the ­veteran ocean­ographer Sylvia Earle , who is an " explorer - in - residence " at National Geographic .
Although , so far , there has been only limited data collected about the sea floor , with just 10 % of the habitat mapped at any useful scale for science , bathymetry experts said that the public 's ability to " interact " with the oceans and gain better understanding , as well as see the evidence of global warming , could have quite an impact on perceptions .
" This is the part that 's really exciting , for me : people will understand that we know almost nothing about a lot of these places , and Google will do it for us , " said David Sandwell , professor of geophysics at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography , at the University of California , San Diego .
" There are big voids everywhere , but there are a few little spots where we know quite a lot . "
The inclusion of environmental information forms the latest part of the company 's plan to offer the public more data about climate change .
In 2007 Google convened a high - level meeting of experts to help it develop sources of submarine information and environmental data .
It seems likely that the company will later unveil partnerships with institutions in Europe and the US as part of the project .
" It 's a really useful tool for scientists , to [ be able to ] share data on the oceans , " said Sandwell .
" For me , it 's the detailed global tectonic structure of the sea floor … if you 're a physical oceanographer , the important thing is that the currents and tides are affected by things that stick up from the sea floor . "
The development has a less serious side , however .
It is also believed people using the site will get the chance to take a virtual dip at some of the world 's most famous diving spots , including at sites in the Bahamas , the Red Sea and the Great Barrier Reef .
Despite the project 's long gestation , speculation about the precise details has grown since Google announced it would be holding the event .
Many observers said they were hoping for something spect­acular .
" I do n't think this announcement will be confined to just Google Ocean , " wrote Frank Taylor , who catalogues the development of Google Earth at gearthblog.com .
" When Google makes an announcement like this , they always try to push the envelope on multiple fronts .
And , with Al Gore headlining the event , I 'm sure we 're going to get some data about the environment . "
The new system could potentially be combined with another program to let people ­" virtually " move about anywhere in the world .
At the Macworld Expo in January , Google engineers unveiled a program called EarthSurfer , which combined Google Earth with Nintendo 's Wii Fit to create an exercise game that allows players movement " around the landscape " by way of balancing on a board .
" You control it by leaning forward to go forward , and back to go back , " said David Oster , the EarthSurfer programmer on the project at the time .
" It 's great stuff . "
• This article was amended on Tuesday 3 February 2009 .
David Sandwell is professor at the University of California , San Diego , not the University of San Diego and Google Earth is a program rather than a website .
This has been corrected .
It seems hard to believe after the epic struggle to get it to the big screen , but it ’s only a matter of weeks before we can all go and see Watchmen at the cinema .
We , like you , ca n’t bloody wait .
But there ’s one man who definitely wo n’t be seeing it , not now , not ever .
totalfilm.com sat down with Alan Moore to find out why he hates the film industry so much .
As you might expect , he does n't hold back .
So if you ’re easily offended , look away now ...
1. Comics do n’t work as films .
“ The main reason why comics ca n’t work as films is largely because everybody who is ultimately in control of the film industry is an accountant .
These people may be able to add up and balance the books , but in every other area they are stupid and incompetent and do n’t have any talent .
And this is why a film is going to be a work that ’s done by dozens and dozens and dozens , if not hundreds of people .
They ’re going to show it to the backers and then they ’re going to say , we want this in it , and this in it ... and where ’s the monster ? ”

Convicted child rapist Adrian Gonzalez Cruz should have spent the rest of his life in prison .
But on Tuesday , he took advantage of inattentive Maricopa County sheriff 's deputies and made a brazen lunchtime escape from the Maricopa County Superior Courthouse in downtown Phoenix .
He was still on the loose late Wednesday .
Cruz is on trial for additional charges of kidnapping , sexual assault and sexual contact with a minor .
His escape left victims living in fear and sheriff 's officials evaluating the procedures governing how deputies detain inmates in court buildings .
Cruz was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole for 35 years after sexually assaulting his girlfriend 's 9 - year - old daughter in 2004 .
The mother allowed Cruz to take the girl riding in his ice - cream truck , where he sexually assaulted her .
The girl became pregnant , and because she was too young to carry the baby , she had an abortion .
For that crime , Cruz could have spent the rest of his life in the custody of the Arizona Department of Corrections .
But he was on trial for two other sexual assaults in 2003 - one on a girl younger than 15 - after his DNA was matched to those attacks , and a judge could add decades more to Cruz 's prison stay if convicted .
That trial was nearing an end Tuesday when Cruz took advantage of a lapse in security , slipped from his restraints and walked out of the courthouse .
He even stole a leather coat from a court commissioner 's office in full view of at least one court employee .
The trial continued Wednesday without him .
On a busy day , as many as 800 jail inmates are transported from various jails to the Superior Court for hearings , according to Chief Deputy Dave Trombi .
Most are transported in jail uniforms , but those who are on trial can wear civilian clothing so that the jail stripes do not prejudice a jury .
The inmates remain handcuffed except when they are in the courtroom for trials .
Then , they wear a " stun belt " that allows deputies to administer an electric shock and a leg brace that locks if the inmate tries to run .
Trombi said the policy is to remove the belt and brace when inmates are placed in holding rooms because " if they remove the cuffs , they can easily remove the brace and ( belt ) and use them as weapons . "
Court had just broken for lunch on Tuesday when a deputy escorted Cruz to a holding room on the seventh floor of the East Court Building , where the deputy attached Cruz 's handcuffs to a chain shackled to the floor .
The deputy left Cruz alone in the room , and when another deputy went to check on the inmate several minutes later , only the handcuffs and shackles remained , Trombi said .
" It appears at some point , Cruz was able to manipulate the handcuffs , " Trombi said , adding that paper clips , staples and other materials readily available at a defense table can help an inmate spring free from handcuffs .
Investigators believe Cruz acted alone , Trombi said .
Sheriff 's
Office policy does n't allow an inmate to be left unattended but does n't address the specifics of deputies leaving an inmate unattended in a secure holding room .
Policy serves as a guideline but , Trombi said , a preliminary inquiry has left investigators with the sense that deputies could have strayed from some of those policies in an effort to accommodate busy Superior Court calendars .
A court employee , who asked not to be identified , saw Cruz enter a commissioner 's chambers on the same floor and walk out with a leather jacket .
He was wearing a white long sleeve button - down shirt , gray baggy pants with pinstripes and a black leather jacket , according to the Sheriff 's Office .
The doors to the holding rooms are equipped with locks , but it 's unclear whether the locks were used , Trombi said .
The Sheriff 's Office has launched an internal inquiry into whether procedures were followed .
The two deputies involved remain at work and on the payroll , Trombi said , and will unless the investigation proves they deserve otherwise .
" We 're not having a knee - jerk reaction , " he said .
" We need to find out what happened first . "
By the time deputies learned of Cruz 's disappearance and evacuated the courthouse , Cruz was gone .
Deputies have been contacting people Cruz knows in the Phoenix area , working with other agencies such as Border Patrol and the U.S. Marshals Office and warning Cruz 's victims that he is at large .
One Phoenix woman received the phone call Tuesday night , less than a week after she testified that Cruz had kidnapped and sexually assaulted her in the summer of 2003 .
She 's been staying in her house , behind locked doors , ever since .
" His escape has me terrified , " said the woman , whose identity is being withheld .
" I do n't want to be outdoors .
I know what he 's capable of . "

Former NPD Official Claims That German Party Aims to Build ' Fourth Reich ' Ex-official of a party in Germany warns of " fourth reich , " another holocaust .
PASSAU , Germany , March 3 , 2009  -- Uwe Luthardt , a former senior member of Germany 's far - right National Democratic Party , said he defected from the party because he did not agree with the aims of " building a Fourth Reich . "
" I had joined the NPD because I wanted to do something for Germany .
I was n't interested in a greater Germany , " he told Spiegel magazine .
" Suddenly , everyone was saying we 'll take back Silesia in Poland , and then we 'll give the communists a real trashing .
It was then that I realized this was n't my world , and I left the party . "
He said he was threatened by the local party boss in Jena , who told him , " One does not just leave the party .
One gets kicked out or one disappears .
Someone who just quits usually gets a lot of problems and can find himself waking up in the intensive - care unit . "
For the NPD 's part , a spokesman told ABC News , " The accusations are bold lies , nothing but lies . "
Luthardt still lives in Jena , in eastern Germany , where the local party boss threatened him , but he said he was left alone after he told the party boss he knew all about the dark side of the NPD and would n't hesitate to talk openly about that subject .
In the interview published last week , Luthardt talked about weapons stores and how party members greeted one another with the forbidden " Heil Hitler " salute , sang banned neo -Nazi songs and relished the idea of a new Holocaust against the Jews .
" The simple aim is to restore the Reich in which a new storm trooper organization takes revenge on anyone who disagrees with them , " he said .
" When you went along to evening meetings , you saw all the shaven heads , and a black sun or other Nazi symbols tattooed on their arms .
They usually just boozed or were abusive .
If there 's no opponent around , they just fight among themselves .
" Many have an IQ close to my shoe size .
Most of them are simply failures : failed pupils , people who dropped out of school or apprenticeships , alcoholics who can't find a foothold anywhere else , thugs , " he said .
" But every local organization has three to five men who do n't have criminal records , and they are the ones sent to face the press or to man information stands . "
As for the funding of the NPD , " There are still old Nazis living in South America who donate money to the party , and there are skinhead music concerts , where the bands donate their fees to the party .
Last year , for instance , there was a concert with a profit of almost $ 20,000 . "
Government Lost Bid to Ban NPD
The NPD is a legitimate party that Germany tried unsuccessfully to ban in 2002 .
It is protected by the law that prevents the outlawing of political parties .
The failure to ban the NPD was a major embarrassment for former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder after the discovery that important witnesses for the prosecution worked as informants for the domestic intelligence agency .
The government applied to the constitutional court to outlaw the party , " as it posed a danger to the country 's constitution and democracy . "
The main accusations were that the NPD rejected the German constitution , scorned human dignity and fundamental human rights and tolerated neither other ideologies nor immigrants .
Many analysts believe the legal case actually strengthened the party , which has seen membership increase in recent years .
The party is thought to have about 6,000 members .
The party continued marching and rallying against immigrants and foreigners , and won enough votes to enter parliament in two eastern states , in 2004 and 2006 .
Neo -Nazi attacks reached an all - time high last year , and politicians have now launched new efforts to ban the NPD .
But legal experts warn that there are major hurdles , and another failure would be a huge embarrassment for the state .
Others like Luthardt , the party defector , warn about the neo - Nazis ' real aim to kick out all foreigners so Germans will have jobs again .
" They want the Jews and the foreigners to be transported away once they 've taken over the country again , " he said .
" That 's what they 're talking about when no outsiders are listening .
But there are strict rules that clearly state how everyone should behave in public .
" Anything to do with the Third Reich is especially sensitive and they dream of a Fourth Reich .
They are totally convinced that they 'll win an election one day , and that things will really get going for them .
Everyone can imagine what would happen then . "
“ They woke up pretty quickly , ” says a Treasury official , adding that they protested for a bit .
“ Six months ago , they would have kept the plane and flown it to Washington . ”

Senator Levin said that the financiers will not be able to change their warped mentality , but will have to be reined in by Geithner ’s new leashes .
“ I have no confidence that they intend or desire to change , ” Levin told me .
“ These bankers got away with murder , and it ’s obscene that close to nothing is being asked of financial institutions .
I get incensed at the thought that a bank that ’s getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money is out there buying fancy new airplanes . ”
New York ’s attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , always gratifying on the issue of clawing back money from the greedy creeps on Wall Street , on Tuesday subpoenaed Thain , the former Merrill Lynch chief executive , over $ 4 billion in bonuses he handed out as the failing firm was bought by Bank of America .
In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC , Thain used the specious , contemptible reasoning that other executives use to rationalize why they ’re keeping their bonuses as profits are plunging .
“ If you do n’t pay your best people , you will destroy your franchise ” and they ’ll go elsewhere , he said .
Hello ?
They destroyed the franchise .
Let ’s call their bluff .
Let ’s see what a great job market it is for the geniuses of capitalism who lost $ 15 billion in three months and helped usher in socialism .
Bartiromo also asked
Thain to explain , when jobs and salaries were being cut at his firm , how he could justify spending $ 1 million to renovate his office .
As The Daily Beast and CNBC reported , big - ticket items included curtains for $ 28,000 , a pair of chairs for $ 87,000 , fabric for a “ Roman Shade ” for $ 11,000 , Regency chairs for $ 24,000 , six wall sconces for $ 2,700 , a $ 13,000 chandelier in the private dining room and six dining chairs for $ 37,000 , a “ custom coffee table ” for $ 16,000 , an antique commode “ on legs ” for $ 35,000 , and a $ 1,400 “ parchment waste can . ”
Personal injury cases are not that simple to prove as they sound .
Being the victim of some unfortunate accident only does not make the victim entitled to a compensation claim .
It is a legal procedure and like all the other legal processes , it needs to be followed with a set of steps .
There are three main characters involved in the personal cases namely the claimant , his lawyer and the guilty party along with its insurers .
All have their respective duties that they are supposed to play so does the claimant .
A claimant is supposed to be that person who has been made to go through a lot of physical pain and suffering due to the occurrence of an accident in which he was not at fault .
The claim is being filed by the claimant to get the compensation for his pain from the guilty party .
And , he needs to take certain steps on his on to initiate this process .
Knowing The Extent Of The Fault
The very basic and the necessary step that is to be taken by the claimant is knowing the extent of the fault .
He is supposed to determine whether he has any contribution towards the happening of the accident or not .
There are many such claimants who do not know this very basic point .
They either end up exaggerating the fault of the other party or they underestimate their own innocence .
This step is very vital and basic as rest of the procedure rests on this .
In case the claimant has no fault , then he can carry on with the claim process but on the other hands , coming to know that he himself is also responsible for the accident , then he can not go for the claim .
This evaluation can be conducted on the part of the claimant ’s lawyer s well .
He can tell the extent of the fault after having listened to the whole accident details .
Hiring A Skilled And Specialist Lawyer
The other most significant and basic step is to get the consultancy with a professional and skilled lawyer .
This is the last step that the claimant is required to take because from there onwards , the appointed lawyer takes all the matter in his own hands , relieving the claimant of any other responsibility .
A skilled lawyer helps the claimant right from assessing the fault and determining the compensation amount to the legal proceedings associated with the personal injury claim .
A specialist personal injury lawyer guides the claimant in the best possible manner and he is the one who presents his case with all the conviction that the claimant gets successful in gaining the compensation for his pain and loss .
So , these two are the most significantly basic steps that are to be taken by the claimant and if he takes these two right decisions , then rest of the matter becomes easier for him .

The group has already attracted more than 5,000 members Indians outraged at an attack on women for drinking in a bar have gathered together to send a provocative gift of underwear to right - wing activists .
More than 5,000 people , including men , have joined the Facebook group , which calls itself the Consortium of Pub - going , Loose and Forward Women .
The group says it will give the pink underwear to Sri Ram Sena ( Army of Lord Ram ) on Valentine 's Day on Saturday .
It was blamed for the bar attack in the southern city of Mangalore last month .
Pramod Mutalik , who heads the little known Ram Sena and is now on bail after he was held following the attack , has said it is " not acceptable " for women to go to bars in India .
He has also said his men will protest against Valentine 's Day on Saturday .
' Shocking ' The Consortium of Pub - going , Loose and Forward Women , which was formed on Facebook last Thursday , has also exhorted women to " walk to the nearest pub and buy a drink " on Valentine 's Day .

Advertisement A spokeswoman for the group , Nisha Susan , told the BBC it was giving chaddis ( Hindi colloquial for underwear ) as they alluded to a prominent Hindu right - wing group whose khaki- shorts - wearing cadres were often derisively called " chaddi wallahs " ( chaddi wearers ) .
" We chose the colour pink because it is a frivolous colour , " she said .

More from BBC World Service Ms Susan said the group expected to collect at least 500 pieces of pink underwear from all over the country and send them to Mr Mutalik 's office in the southern city of Hubli .
" It 's a choice between ignoring a group like Ram Sena or responding to its activities .
We have decided to give it attention , but it is attention which it will not like , " she said .
The group has asked people to mail or drop underwear at " collection points " across the country .
The Ram Sena has not yet commented on the group 's moves .
Last month 's attack in Mangalore , which was filmed and then broadcast on national television , shocked many Indians .
Mr Mutalik has said his men will protest against Valentine 's Day celebrations Television pictures showed men chasing and beating up the panicking women .
Some of the women , who tripped and fell , were kicked by the men .
Around 30 people , including Mr Mutalik , were later arrested .
Women 's groups strongly condemned the attack , which was described by the country 's Women 's Minister Renuka Chaudhury as an attempt to impose Taleban - style values .
The Hindu nationalist BJP government in Karnataka state distanced itself from the attack .
It said it had nothing to do with Sri Ram Sena .
But a BBC correspondent says that right - wing Hindu vigilante groups loosely linked to the BJP are active in many parts of India and have in the past targeted Muslim and Christian minorities as well as events such as Valentine 's Day .

A recently published survey found that one third of all broadband Internet subscribers worldwide admits to having downloaded movies or TV - shows illegally .
The majority of these downloaders are well aware that their habits are illegal , but it does n't play on their conscience .
Every other month a new survey pops up , and they all seem to draw the same conclusion : millions of people worldwide download files from filesharing networks such as BitTorrent – and they do n’t think this is morally wrong .
Most recently , Ovum researchers surveyed a large group of broadband Internet subscribers who also own a TV , and polled their video download habits .
The video trends survey found that nearly one third of the respondents watch illegally downloaded video .
Because music and software was n’t included , it is safe to say that the overall piracy rate among broadband subscribers is even higher .
Most people do not download copyrighted videos on a regular basis though .
The survey found that only 4 % of the total sample admitted doing so .
Interestingly , two thirds of the sample – including the ones that never download illegally – did n’t see it as morally wrong .
This discrepancy between the perceived morality and the legal status lies at the core of the ever increasing piracy rate .
Despite the continuous efforts of the anti-piracy lobby attempted to change the public ’s attitude towards piracy , without much success .
The infamous “ You would n’t steal … ” campaign is a prime example of such a failed campaign .
There has n’t been much of a change in the attitudes of the public .
Instead , TV and movie insiders themselves have regularly made fun of the strategy .
For several years the entertainment industry has ignored the endless possibilities the Internet has offered them , while striving to preserve their outdated business models .
Thereby they ignored the cause of the problem .
The rise of illegal downloading is clearly a signal that customers want something that is unavailable through other channels .
So , should sharing copyrighted material be legalized ?
Not per se , but the entertainment industry should focus on monetizing filesharing networks instead of bringing them down .
The movie industry has said many times that it treats piracy as just another competitor , so one day it will hopefully see that sharing is not only a good thing but also an unstoppable thing – with a multitude of profit - making possibilities attached to it .
The following is a letter sent on Tuesday by Jake DeSantis , an executive vice president of the American International Group ’s financial products unit , to Edward M. Liddy , the chief executive of A.I.G .
DEAR Mr. Liddy ,
It is with deep regret that I submit my notice of resignation from A.I.G. Financial Products .
I hope you take the time to read this entire letter .
Before describing the details of my decision , I want to offer some context :
I am proud of everything I have done for the commodity and equity divisions of A.I.G. - F.P. I was in no way involved in  or responsible for  the credit default swap transactions that have hamstrung A.I.G .
Nor were more than a handful of the 400 current employees of A.I.G. - F.P.
Most of those responsible have left the company and have conspicuously escaped the public outrage .
After 12 months of hard work dismantling the company  during which A.I.G. reassured us many times we would be rewarded in March 2009  we in the financial products unit have been betrayed by A.I.G. and are being unfairly persecuted by elected officials .
In response to this , I will now leave the company and donate my entire post - tax retention payment to those suffering from the global economic downturn .
My intent is to keep none of the money myself .
I take this action after 11 years of dedicated , honorable service to A.I.G .
I can no longer effectively perform my duties in this dysfunctional environment , nor am I being paid to do so .
Like you , I was asked to work for an annual salary of $ 1 , and I agreed out of a sense of duty to the company and to the public officials who have come to its aid .
Having now been let down by both , I can no longer justify spending 10 , 12 , 14 hours a day away from my family for the benefit of those who have let me down .
Silence Of The Lambs ( 2010 ) Source : ‘ Silence Of The Lambs ’ ( Jonathan Demme , 1991 ) ; ‘ The Silence Of The Lambs ’ novel ( Thomas Harris , 1988 ) .
From : UniversalDirector : Rupert WainwrightStarring : unknown ( rumoured : Javier Bardem as Hannibal Lecter ) Producers : Scott Rudin ; Thomas Harris .
Notes :
No press releases so far .
Demme ’s 1991 adaptation of Thomas Harris ’s 1988 thriller gathered five Oscars including best picture , but the Hannibal Lecter franchise is somewhat fragmented : the critical and box - office failure of the 2006 Hannibal Rising prequel constitutes a failed attempt to re-leverage the Hannibal character in a series .
What then is the ambit of Wainwright ’s remake ?
Is it a sequel to an existing remake ( 2002 ’s Red Dragon , which is a remake of the 1985 Manhunter , which is based on the first book featuring Lecter ) ?
Or will Red Dragon v3.0 follow as a prequel if SotL v2.0 succeeds …?

It Always Rains In Pac-land
Total Pro Sports -
This past Saturday night , Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears threw a little birthday bash at an upscale Dallas night club .
Many big name guests were there , like the one and only Terrell Owens , DeMarcus Ware , Bradie James , Akin Ayodele and Jamarcus Russell .
The other guest that made an appearance who did not make the guest list on the ticket , was former Cowboy Pacman Jones .
Apparently Pacman decided to class - up the party by using his old making in rain with dollar bills trick .
You know the trick that got him involved in a double shooting a couple of years ago .
I guess he has n’t learned from his mistakes and continues to act like a teenager with too much money .
According to Pro Football
Talk his former teamates were n’t pleased with his antics :
“ All the other players there thought he was a complete idiot for doing it .
It was a upscale bar / restaurant and he acted like it was a cheap Atlanta strip club .
So , no , he has n’t grown up .
” ( Pro Football Talk )
Check out the pics from the event below .
Yes , that is birthday boy Marcus Spears wearing that ridiculous yellow scarf .

Politicians these days just ca n’t seem to stop talking about pot — and for the first time in decades , this is a good thing !
No longer are lawmakers ’ marijuana - centric conversation based upon the notion of penalizing cannabis consumers .
Today , an unprecedented number of politicians are contemplating a society that is no longer bound by the chains of marijuana prohibition .
Speaking live on CNN this morning , California Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez cited the west coast ’s majority support for regulating cannabis like alcohol — as acknowledged by NORML ’s recent Zogby poll — and called for a statewide “ pilot program ” to objectively assess the impact of cannabis legalization upon adult society .
“ Well , certainly , I have seen in my own state of California , people over and over voting … [ on ] the whole issue of marijuana , ” Sanchez said .
“ So maybe it would be a good pilot program to see how that regulation of marijuana might happen in California since the … majority of Californians believe maybe that should happen . ”
Sanchez ’s comments come two weeks after the introduction of proposed state legislation , AB 390 : the Marijuana Control , Regulation , and Education Act , which seeks to tax and regulate the adult sales of cannabis in California .
So far , thousands of members of the cannabis community , as well as several pundits from the mainstream press , have voiced their support for AB 390 .
Are lawmakers listening ?
U.S. Representative Sanchez most certainly is — and she ’s not alone .
If you are reading this blog , then you already know that cannabis prohibition is a fraud and a failure .
You know these facts , but today millions of your friends and neighbors — and even many of your elected officials — are just now waking up to these truths .
And they , like Congresswoman Sanchez , are becoming more and more outspoken in their criticisms of prohibition .
Let ’s encourage them to keep talking .

While I certainly can’t speak for everyone , it certainly seems to me that the call to go green , especially with regards to oil , gasoline , driving less , and more fuel efficient vehicles , has sort of been muted as of late .
Â
I also think the explanation why is obvious .
I have long subscribed to the theory that if you want people to pay attention , take action , and make changes , you ’ve got to hit them where it counts : in their wallet .
Â
This is why I do n’t think it ’s a coincidence that the cries for becoming more environmentally friendly grew louder as gasoline prices climbed higher .
On the flip side , I think this is also why many of us seem to not be as concerned about the environment — or at least trying to make immediate changes — as we once were .
Â
After all , the price of gas has fallen about 50 % from it ’s peak .
But , one opinion does not a fact make , so I thought I ’d pose the following question to my Daily Fuel Economy Tip readers :
Are you less concerned about environmental issues now that gas prices have fallen over 50 percent ?
As expected , this was kind of a hot button question , and nearly 500 people ended up responding .
Â
Here ’s how the responses broke down :
43 % – No , I still care just as much .
19 % – Yes , but I still care , just not as much .
18 % – Yes , I ’m far less concerned
15 % – No , I was never concerned
5 % – Unsure
According to this poll , nearly 40 % of people are less worried about environmental issues than they used to be , simply because the price of gasoline has gone from $ 4 a gallon to $ 2 a gallon !
It ’s not as if $ 4 gas is more harmful to the environment than $ 2 gas , so it seems to me that for many of us , the push to go green had far more to do with economics than it had to do with the environment .
I know that we ’re in tough economic times and that for most of us our self preservation instincts are kicking in , so we ’re much more concerned with the here and now ( economic crisis ) than what may or may not go on in the future ( environmental crisis ) .
That being said , maybe it should be the other way around .
Â
Even if the economy completely tanks , we ’ll still survive .
Â
But , if the environment tanks , that ’s another story .
After all , it ’s going to take more than government bail outs to save the environment .
Xenopus Laevis frog whose pigments can be manipulated by the new compound Tadpoles could hold the key to developing effective skin cancer drugs according to researchers at the University of East Anglia .
The scientists have identified a compound which blocks the movement of the pigment cells that give the tadpoles their distinctive markings .
It is the uncontrolled movement of pigment cells that causes skin cancer in both humans and frogs .
The next step , the researchers say , is to test the compound in other animals .
The man -made compound , NSC 84093 , was chosen out of a list of 3,000 which were screened to see if they affected the pigment cells .
It produced a distinct change in the colour markings on the tadpoles at very low concentrations .
The continuous stripe along the back of a wild tadpole was replaced by a pattern of individual blocks of colour .
The study is published in the journal , Chemistry & Biology .
Top tadpole has normal markings .
The one underneath has broken markings along back Grant Wheeler , a developmental biologist and lead researcher at the University of East Anglia , said : " Forty of the compounds gave us an interesting difference which we wanted to follow up . "
" The reason we were able to look at so many compounds was because it 's very easy to look at the embryos and see the colour change . "
" The pigment cells are interesting for a number of reasons .
" The first is that the place where they develop is not where they end up - they move through the embryo in a process called cell migration . "
Invasive melanomas
It is when melanoma cells migrate through the body to the organs and cause secondary tumours that the disease becomes deadly .
Melanomas are one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer because they are highly invasive and resistant to treatment .
Scientists hope that if they can block this process they can halt the cancer .
The compound in this study works by inhibiting matrix metaloproteinases ( MMP ) which are expressed by melanoma tumours in both humans and frogs .
XENOPUS LAEVIS FACTS
Also known as South African Clawed Frog Has same organs , molecules and physiology as man Can produce eggs all year round From 1930s to 1960s was used for human pregnancy testing by injecting woman 's urine sample into them and seeing if the frog laid eggs within 24 hours indicating that the woman was pregnant Mr Wheeler said a chemist at the university recognised the structure of their compound and realised that part of it had known properties that meant it should bind to a zinc molecule .
MMPs are zinc - dependant enzymes and the researchers observed varying changes to the patterning on the tadpoles according to the strength of dose they were receiving .
Mr Wheeler added : " It 's a long shot .
We are quite far away from a cure for melanoma . "
Ed Yong , health information manager at Cancer Research UK , said : " There is still a lot of work to do before these interesting but preliminary results can be used to benefit people affected by cancer .
" But it just goes to show that studying animals like tadpoles , which may seem unusual , could lead to potential cancer drugs in the future . "
Bevis Man from the British Skin Foundation said : " This is certainly an interesting discovery and is worth keeping an eye on , but is unlikely to get a breakthrough in terms of treatment within the next ten years . "

SXSW 09 Interview : Crude Independence Director Noah Hutton
by David Cornelius
The South by Southwest rundown on � Crude Independence� : � Crude Independence � is a documentary film about the heartland in the process of transplanting itself , and its new heart is pumping oil .
In 2006 , the United States Geological Survey estimated there to be more than 200 billion barrels of crude oil resting in beneath western North Dakota , and now oil companies from far and wide are descending on small rural towns across the state with men and machinery in tow .
First - time director Noah Hutton takes us to the town of Stanley ( population 1300 ) and captures the change wrought by the unprecedented boom .
Through revealing interviews and breathtaking imagery of the northern plains , � Crude Independence � is a rumination on the future of small town America , a tale of change at the hands of the global energy market , and America�s unyielding thirst for oil .
Just what is � Crude Independence � ?
Our title is meant to suggest some paradoxes that the film explores .
How did you come across the people of Stanley , and what made you decide to document their story ?
I first read about Stanley in a New York Times piece written about the oil boom in North Dakota , published in January of 2008 .
I boarded a plane two days later and took an initial scouting trip out there , driving all around the state in a Ford Explorer I rented through Craigslist because I wasn�t yet 21 years old to get a proper rental .
I came to Stanley on this first trip , met some of the people mentioned in the Times article , and knew their story was one I wanted to tell , mostly because I was hearing multiple viewpoints on the boom - those who own their mineral rights , those that don�t , and those who were staying in the motel temporarily to work on the oil rigs .
It struck me as an important American moment - the intersection of small town values with change wrought by multinational oil companies .
At first glance , your movie seems like another in the modern trend of documentaries with a heavy political goal , but the trailer suggests a larger focus on the people .
What were your initial goals with this movie , and what evolved during filming ?
There is no heavy political goal of our film and there never was .
I think the initial vision of the film as a human tale of change in one small town affected by an oil boom has remained constant throughout the process .
We never wanted to make this a sprawling geopolitical oil documentary .
I was more interested in what happens on a personal level to people who have been living in Stanley their whole lives , people whose grandparents first settled on that land by chance when they emigrated to this country from Norway one hundred years ago .
You were filming in Stanley during the 2008 elections , right in the middle of all the �drill here , drill now� debate .
What was it like to be in an oil boom town at such a time ?
Besides a few mild concerns about the beautiful vistas now being dotted with drilling rigs , we really didn�t hear much opposition to the boom .
The only complaints had to do with not owning mineral rights or about the poor condition of the roads and other infrastructure that has been affected by the descent of workers and machinery to Stanley .
The political orientation of the town was most certainly conservative .
This was accepted , and the election really wasn�t causing much drama at all in Stanley .
We met one Democrat that I can remember while we were there , and he was lovingly teased by his friends for his views .
You also scored the music for this film .
What �s that process like ?
I think music in a film like this is incredibly important and I had a pretty clear idea of the kind of feel I wanted , so it was natural for me to have a go at it myself .
It became a very organic process because I was scoring the film as it was coming together in the editing room , and my co-editor Alex Footman would go off and work on segments while I recorded the music , then we�d lay it in and see if it worked .
Because we were doing all of this in - house , we were able to work pretty quickly and had finished a cut of the film with music within about three weeks .
Jonathan Demme is listed as an executive producer on your film .
How did that come about ?
Mr. Demme and I frequent the same independent film house in Pleasantville , New York : The Jacob Burns Film Center .
I first worked behind the refreshment stand there , then got involved with their educational programs and had the good fortune of being able to travel to Uganda to work on a documentary .
Mr. Demme , who hosts a monthly rare cinema series at the Burns Center , came to see the Uganda piece , we met there , and I soon after submitted the proposal for Crude Independence and he was generous enough to come onboard .
This is your first feature .
What got you started making movies ?
I�ve been making little shorts with friends and family movies since I was a kid .
I�ve taught myself how to use all the equipment I�ve worked with and love every stage of the process .
Traveling to Uganda to work on the documentary � Shooting for Peace� was a defining experience for me and made me want to get a project of my own together .
I also have been deeply inspired by filmmakers like Werner Herzog and John Cassavetes .
These are really two of my biggest heroes - Werner I�ve had the good fortune to meet several times and I hold his films and his writing in the highest regard .
His awesome fearlessness has definitely inspired me to just get out there and make something .
Any lessons learned while making this movie ?
I learned a lot about trust and what it takes to capture a story you have a feeling is out there but is reluctant to show itself on film .
There was absolutely no way we could have made this film if we had shown up in Stanley with an agenda .
It took nights at the bar with locals and oil workers just having beers and playing pool - no cameras involved - to build the necessary trust before we were able to get the interviews and access we needed for this story to come across on film .
Are you nervous about coming to South by Southwest ?
I�m not nervous about SXSW - I �m thrilled , and enjoying everything about this experience .
I�m excited to see all the terrific films at the festival and I �m proud that we are going to screen � Crude Independence � for such wonderful audiences in Austin .
Would you like to continue working with documentaries , or do you plan to jump to fiction ?
( In other words , what �s next for you ? )
We have a fiction film in development as well as another documentary .
Which one of these I make next is up in the air as of now , but I hope to move back and forth between fiction films and documentaries .
I will also say that line between fiction and non-fiction is also a bit muddier in my head than it is depicted out in the world .
Finish this sentence :
If I weren�t a filmmaker , I �d probably be ...
A neuroscientist .
It �s my greatest interest , it�s the subject of most of the classes I�ve taken for the past two years at college and the books that I read , and it has become and will continue to be the defining field of this young century .
My hope is to make a film about the brain and the people that study it .
Rock , paper , or scissors ?
Show , don�t tell .
That �s what I�ve been told .
In ten words or less , convince the average moviegoer to watch your film .
See the small - town story of an American oil boom .
� Crude Independence � joins SXSW as part of the Emerging Visions series .
It screens 5:30 PM March 16 and 11:30 AM March 18 .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News said on Sunday it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , marking the latest milestone in a crumbling of the U.S. newspaper business .

REUTERS / Tim Shaffer / Files
In a statement , Philadelphia Newspapers LLC blamed its filing on a “ rare trifecta of a dramatic decline in revenue , the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and a debt structure out of line with current economic realities . ”
The announcement came a day after Journal Register Co , which publishes 20 daily newspapers , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , as U.S. newspaper publishers stumble in a rising tide of debt and sinking ad sales .
Philadelphia Newspapers ’ chief executive , Brian Tierney , did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment .
Inquirer Editor Bill Marimow declined to comment .
Philadelphia Newspapers and Journal Register , which publishes several small papers in the Philadelphia metropolitan area , join the much larger Tribune Co , publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , in a growing line of U.S. newspaper publishers seeking bankruptcy court protection to stay afloat while they restructure .
Philadelphia Newspapers said it will continue normal operations of its newspapers , magazines and online businesses .
It said the filing was made in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania .
It is seeking bankruptcy court approval of up to $ 25 million in debtor - in - possession ( DIP ) financing provided by various lenders through NewSpring Capital .
The money will allow it to keep paying its workers , the company said .
“ The Debtors filed these cases principally to restructure an overleveraged balance sheet , not to restructure leases , contracts or operational agreements , ” the company said in its filing .
The company projected 2009 adjusted EBITDA in excess of $ 25 million , down from about $ 36 million it generated in 2008 .
The company ’s largest unsecured creditors include Royal Bank of Scotland , MCG Capital Corp , CIT Group Inc and the Virginia Retirement System , according to the filing .
The company said it has been negotiating with its lenders for the last 11 months .
In that time , it said lenders including the Blackstone Group , Drinker Biddle and Akin Gump have billed it more than $ 13.4 million in interest penalties .
Its operations are “ sound and profitable , ” it said in a statement .
This is a problem that newspaper publishers such as Lee Enterprises and McClatchy Co have .
While they are profitable , they owe money they borrowed to buy companies and take other actions , often at a ratio to their cashflow that violates their lending agreements .
Some publishers , like Lee and McClatchy , have renegotiated their debt terms to buy more time .
The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News previously were owned by Knight Ridder Inc , one of the largest U.S. newspaper publishers .
Smaller publisher McClatchy swallowed it up for more than $ 4 billion in 2006 , and then sold off several Knight Ridder papers , including the Philadelphia ones .
Tierney , a veteran public relations executive who represented Philadelphia ’s Roman Catholic archdiocese and had tussled with the paper over its coverage of the church , led a group to buy them for $ 515 million in cash .
It is the second paper that McClatchy has sold in recent years to file for bankruptcy .
The other is The Minneapolis Star - Tribune , which the Sacramento , California - based publisher sold for $ 530 million to private equity company Avista Capital Partners .
In a January interview on the Reuters MediaFile blog , Tierney said the company was negotiating with lenders over its debt , at the time coming in at $ 400 million .
He also said ad revenue fell 17 percent in 2008 , and total revenue fell 10 percent .
He forecast a similar decline in 2009 .
Many newspaper publishers are dealing with similar declines .
On a fundamental level , the erosion of the way that most papers make their money portends the possibility of more bankruptcies and raises questions about the gradual destruction of one of the basic ways that people in the United States get their news .
“ Last year , we did almost $ 40 million EBITDA , but our debt service is $ 40 million also , so we ’re in kind of a covenant default , ” Tierney said in January .
“ Some of that debt needs to be significantly restructured ...
But the debt story does get in the way of the audience story . ”

Here is what I thought was one of the more infuriating moments of last night 's press conference .
Chuck Todd with this doozie :
Todd :
Some have compared this financial crisis to a war and in times of war past Presidents have called for some form of sacrifice .
Some of your programs whether main street or Wall Street have actually cushioned the blow for those that were irresponsible during this economic period of prosperity , supposed prosperity that you were talking about .
Why , given this new era of responsibility that you 're asking for why have n't you asked for something specific that the public should be sacrificing to participate in this economic recovery ?
Really , Chuck Todd ?
You 're joking , right ?
If you had asked what he should have asked Wall Street to sacrifice , that would have been one thing .
But the public ?
Unbelievable .
John Amato :
If there 's one thing that Heroes is good at , it 's apparently not family drama if last night 's episode is anything to go by .
Daddy issues for cheerleaders and psychopaths abound , and spoilers await .
Advertisement
Is it just me , or is there something weirdly charming about the way that Heroes seems to be trying its hardest to be contemporary and relevant for people who have n't left the house or had any communication with the outside world for about five years ?
It 's not just the show 's increasingly 24 - esque approach to the internal machinations of governmental policy , but the fact that Claire seems to just have discovered text messaging .
The episode opens with her messaging " Rebel , " the mysterious maybe - good guy who 's been sending her fight the power messages like " U R SO HAWT - F THE MAN " and the like for the last week .
If nothing else , it 's distracting her from pretending to her exceptionally gullible mother that she and her dad did a college tour the week before instead of crashing a plane into generic countryside somewhere .
Eventually , she snaps ( with the great line " Dad was busy ... locking up innocent people . " ) , tells her mom that Daddy HRG has been lying to her for the seven - millionth time , and then cries when her mom throws him out because , like , she loves him really .
It 's just hard when your domineering father figure happens to be a bad - ass spy who forces you to go to community college instead of become a guerilla warrior against the government .
Or something .
Advertisement
In HRG 's defense , he 's clearly still on the side of the good guys and working to bring them down from within ... which is why I 'm not too bothered that he gets drugged and kidnapped by Peter , Matt and Suresh - oh , the moral ambiguity !
- at the end of the episode .
Also , as Claire showed when she saved the life of Alex , the most stereotypical comic book clerk in existence ( " You 're a girl ! " he exclaimed upon seeing Claire , shocked that one would be in a comic book store .
That groan you heard was every single comic retailer in the country ) , she 's not the greatest freedom fighter in the world .
After all , good freedom fighters generally do n't keep those they free in their closet .
Of course , maybe Claire just got her planning skills from her biological father , the increasingly ineffectual Nathan .
This week , Nathan 's new governmental agency got shut down and then unshut down within an hour , because Tracy Strauss froze someone to death in front of a governmental investigator .
Which , when put like that , almost works as a plot .
Sadly , in the actual show , it was less of a nuanced look into the way that fear of the unknown can impact decision making , and more a sudden swing of extremes from " This is inhuman , and worse , unamerican ! " to " You can have whatever you want " because the plot demanded it .
Was this all a cunning plan by Nathan , showing a previously hidden Machiavellian side ?
No , not exactly ; it was all manipulation by this volume 's cardboard cut - out badguy , the Hunter , who 's eager to show that he has no limits to how far he will go yadda yadda yadda .
Also undergoing ill - advised father issues , Sylar continued his strange roadtrip with new sidekick Luke , who only seems to exist to give Sylar a reason to tell us that he's not so bad really , he 's just looking for his father to find out how he ended up this way .
While we can put up with - almost - his saving Luke from the Hero Hunters , we 're really not too convinced by his attempts to teach him not to waste his powers and be more responsible with them .
What 's next , telling him not to put his elbows on the table ?
We can only hope that , when he eventually appears , Sylar Snr. will tell his son to stop being such a wuss ... and perhaps kill Luke in the process .
In the grand scheme of things , this episode did n't really move any of the larger plots forward ( with the exception of HRG leaving his family and being captured ) , and maybe it's that sense of pointlessness - and the characters ' uselessness , or yet another pointless plot where Hiro " learns to be a hero " ( This week :
You can be a hero without superpowers !
Who knew ? ) - that made it feel like Heroes again , as opposed to the last couple of episodes .
Whether that 's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you , of course , but there was one good side to this episode that no - one can deny :
Only one scene of Milo Ventimiglia means less frustration .
The less Peter Petrelli whining , the better .
Venezuelans vote using electronic machines and receive a print - out receipt of their ballot .
They have to deposit this paper in a box so that it can be counted as part of an audit trail to ensure the manual receipts match with the electronic results .
Cash handouts from the Federal Government 's stimulus packages have been likened to a madman at a pub handing out free beer .
Parents , carers and farmers will start receiving bonus payments of up to $ 950 from today as part of a $ 42 billion fiscal stimulus package .
Barnaby Joyce
In December , pensioners and low - income families were on the receiving end of cash payments from a $ 10.4 billion package .
" It 's like a madman giving you free beers at a pub - you 'll drink them but you wo n't respect him , " Nationals Senate leader Barnaby Joyce told reporters .
From Project yndiate :
Brad DeLong :
For more than 170 years , it has been accepted doctrine that markets are not to be trusted when there is a liquidity squeeze .
When the prices of even safe assets fall and interest rates climb to sky - high levels because traders and financiers collectively want more liquid assets than currently exist , it is simply not safe to let the market sort things out .
At such a time , central banks must step in and set the price of liquidity at a reasonable level – make it a centrally - planned and administered price – rather than let it swing free in response to private - sector supply and demand .
This is the doctrine of " lender - of - last - resort . "
For more than half that time – say , 85 years – it has been accepted doctrine that markets are also not to be trusted even in normal times , lest doing so lead to a liquidity squeeze or to an inflationary bubble .
So , central banks must set the price of liquidity in the market day in and day out .
According to the followers of Knut Wicksell , the central bank must keep the market rate of interest near the natural rate of interest .
No , said the followers of John Maynard Keynes , it must offset swings in business animal spirits in order to stabilize aggregate demand .
On the contrary , said the followers of Milton Friedman , it must keep the velocity - adjusted rate of growth of the money stock stable .
In fact , if you do any one of these things , you have done them all , for they are three ways of describing what is at bottom the same task and the same reality .
Thus , as social democracy , government guideposts , and centralized planning waxed and waned elsewhere in the economy , social democracy in short - term finance went from strength to strength .
First , central banks suspended the rules of the free market in liquidity squeezes .
Then they set the price of liquidity as an administered price in normal times .
Then they freed themselves of all but the lightest contact with their political masters : they became independent technocrats , a monetary priesthood that spoke in Delphic terms obscure to mere mortals .
The justification for this system was that it seemed to work well – or at least less badly than central banking that blindly adhered to the gold standard or no central banking at all .
This island of central planning in the midst of the market economy was a strange and puzzling feature – all the more so because so few remarked how strange it was .
There were no calls for a five - percent - growth - of - kilowatt - hours rule as there were calls for a five - percent - growth - of - M2 rule .
There was no Federal Automobile Board to set the price of vehicles the way the Federal Reserve Board set the price of federal funds .
But now it appears that , despite all this , we still have not had enough central planning in finance .
For , even as the central banking authority administered the price of liquidity , the price of risk was left to the tender mercies of the market .
And it is the price of risk that is the source of our current distress .
It is not that the world economy faces a liquidity squeeze .
Far from it : two - year United States Treasury notes with a face value of $ 1,000 will get you $ 998 in cash – the lowest liquidity price since the Great Depression and Japan in the 1990’s .
Yet the risk premia on non-Treasury assets have soared to barely believable heights : the annual interest - rate premium for holding a CD issued by a private bank now stands at five percentage points .
And it is this rise in risk premia that threatens to send the global economy into a deep recession , and turn the financial markets from a spectacle of schadenfreude into a malign source of unemployment and idle factories worldwide .
The US Federal Reserve , the US Treasury , the European Central Bank , the Bank of England , and other public financial regulatory entities are being pushed toward a further expansion of their roles .
The Treasury and Federal Reserve are adding preferred stock to the balance sheets of the US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and FHLBC and the insurance giant AIG in the hope of shoring up their capital cushions and lowering their borrowing costs so that they can buy more mortgages .
The Treasury has asked for authority to purchase $ 700 billion of mortgages to get them off of the private sector ’s books .
Expanding the demand and reducing the supply of these risky assets is a way of manipulating their price .
The Fed and the Treasury are walking down a road that ends with making the price of risk in financial markets , along with the price of liquidity , an administered price .
This was how central banking got started in the first place : letting the market and the market alone determine the price of liquidity was judged too costly for the businessmen who voted and the workers who could overthrow governments .
Now it looks as though letting the market alone determine the price of risk is similarly being judged too costly for today ’s voters and campaign contributors to bear .
New Tax Proposal Would Abolish IRS in Lieu of ‘ Fair Tax ’ System REP .
JOHN LINDER ( R - Ga. ) has introduced legislation which would end the income tax and abolish the IRS and replace them with a state - administered sales tax on all goods and services .
The bill , titled the Fair Tax Act of 2009 ( HR 25 ) , already has 44 cosponsors and has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means .
In a nutshell , the legislation calls for an end to income , payroll , estate and gift taxes to be replaced by a sales - tax system called the Fair Tax .
The Fair Tax , originally developed by economists and businessmen , calls for a flat sales tax of approximately 23 percent on all goods and services .
Under the plan , food , clothing , housing and transportation would be exempt from taxes .
However , in order to keep the wealthy from playing the system , every month , Americans would be reimbursed by the government for the taxes they pay on these .
The reimbursement checks , called “ prebates , ” would be based on the size of one ’s family , not on how much money a person makes .
So , in other words , a family of four , who are all legal residents of the United States , would get approximately $ 700 a month whether they earn the minimum wage or make a million dollars a year .
The program ’s appeal comes from the fact that it is the most progressive tax system out there — and the fairest in the truest sense of the word .
Obviously , people who can afford to purchase mink coats or Ferraris would pay more in taxes than those who buy windbreakers and bicycles .
Americans would also get more money in their pockets as they would receive their total paychecks , and employers would no longer have to shake down their own employees to pay their share of taxes .
You would not be penalized — or taxed — for simply saving your money .
Only spending would incur taxes .
So self - sufficient Americans , who produce their own food , would only be taxed if they sell something .
From a business owner ’s perspective , the Fair Tax would reduce the cost of filing taxes , because all he would have to do is take his total revenue and divide it by the percentage for the Fair Tax .
He would then simply write a check to the government to pay his share .
No more shelling out thousands of dollars for accountants , lawyers and tax experts , who make a mint every year trying to decipher the 60,000 pages in the tax code .
Linder has been introducing this bill for the past decade , and every year it dies in committee .
With high - level tax evaders in the news , the time is ripe for tax reform .
Linder ’s Fair
Tax proposal is a decent plan that , most importantly , calls for the abolition of the IRS , which targets regular Americans for failing to pay their taxes while ignoring the wealthy elites like Tom Daschle and Timothy Geithner .

A Wall Street Journal blogger describes how the UK manufacturer of Monopoly produced special " loaded " editions of the game for distribution to Allied POWs during WWII , complete with files , escape maps , and real money .
n 1941 , the British Secret Service asked the game 's British licensee John Waddington Ltd. to add secret extras to some sets , which had become standard elements of the aid packages that the Red Cross delivered to allied prisoners of war .
Along with the usual dog , top hat and and thimble , the sets had a metal file , compass , and silk maps of safe houses ( silk , because it folds into small spaces and unfolds silently ) .
Even better , real French , German and Italian currency was hidden underneath the game 's fake money .
Departing allied soldiers and pilots were told that if they were captured they should look out for the special editions , identified by a red dot in the Free Parking space .
Any sets remaining in the U.K. were destroyed after the war .
Of the 35,000 prisoners of war who escaped German prison camps by the end of the war , " more than a few of those certainly owe their breakout to the classic board game , " says Mr. McMahon .
Reports in New York say that , on the heels of Caroline Kennedy 's unpleasant departure , New York Gov. David Paterson is set to name Rep. Kristen Gillibrand to fill Hillary Clinton 's Senate seat :
PIX NEWS is being told that Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand is the reported choice of Governor David Paterson to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton .
Two Congressional sources say members of the New York delegation have been invited to join Governor Paterson for the announcement in Albany at noon tomorrow .
Two members of that delegation , agreeing to speak without attribution , confirmed to reporter Marvin Scott that the Governor has telephoned New York 's Democratic members of Congress for their views after Caroline Kennedy withdrew herself from consideration .
One of the contenders , longterm Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney canceled a scheduled appearance on " PIX News Closeup " tomorrow because of a " conflict , " which she did not disclose .
She too will be in Albany .
According to the sources , Gillibrand , now in her second congressional term , was favored by Secretary of State Clinton herself .
Paterson has been under pressure to select a woman .
With most Democratic leaders in Albany coming from the New York City area , one source said this would be an important move for the Governor to have a Senator from upstate .
Sources say Gillibrand would be an asset to Paterson in any bid for election in 2010 .

Introduction
There are two realities “ out there ” now competing for verification among those who think about national affairs and make things happen .
The dominant one ( let ’s call it the Status Quo ) is that our problems of finance and economy will self - correct and allow the project of a “ consumer ” economy to resume in “ growth ” mode .
This view includes the idea that technology will rescue us from our fossil fuel predicament -- through “ innovation , ” through the discovery of new techno rescue remedy fuels , and via “ drill , baby , drill ” policy .
This view assumes an orderly transition through the current “ rough patch ” into a vibrant re-energized era of “ green ” Happy Motoring and resumed Blue Light Special shopping .
The minority reality ( let ’s call it The Long Emergency ) says that it is necessary to make radically new arrangements for daily life and rather soon .
It says that a campaign to sustain the unsustainable will amount to a tragic squandering of our dwindling resources .
It says that the “ consumer ” era of economics is over , that suburbia will lose its value , that the automobile will be a diminishing presence in daily life , that the major systems we ’ve come to rely on will founder , and that the transition between where we are now and where we are going is apt to be tumultuous .
My own view is obviously the one called The Long Emergency .
Since the change it proposes is so severe , it naturally generates exactly the kind of cognitive dissonance that paradoxically reinforces the Status Quo view , especially the deep wishes associated with saving all the familiar , comfortable trappings of life as we have known it .
The dialectic between the two realities ca n’t be sorted out between the stupid and the bright , or even the altruistic and the selfish .
The various tech industries are full of MIT - certified , high - achiever Status Quo techno - triumphalists who are convinced that electric cars or diesel - flavored algae excreta will save suburbia , the three thousand mile Caesar salad , and the theme park vacation .
The environmental movement , especially at the elite levels found in places like Aspen , is full of Harvard graduates who believe that all the drive - in espresso stations in America can be run on a combination of solar and wind power .
I quarrel with these people incessantly .
It seems especially tragic to me that some of the brightest people I meet are bent on mounting the tragic campaign to sustain the unsustainable in one way or another .
But I have long maintained that life is essentially tragic in the sense that history wo n’t care if we succeed or fail at carrying on the project of civilization .
While the public supposedly voted for “ change ” this fall , I maintain that they underestimate the changes really at hand .
I voted for “ change ” myself in pulling the lever for Barack Obama .
I regard him as a figure of intelligence and sensibility , but I ’m far from convinced that he really sees the kind of change we are in for , and I fret about the measures he ’ll promote to rescue the Status Quo when he moves into the White House a few weeks from now .
Where We Are Now
Without reviewing all the vertiginous particulars of the year now ending , suffice it to say that the US economy fell on its ass and that the “ global economy ” did a face - plant as well .
The American banking sector imploded spectacularly to the degree that investment banking actually went extinct -- as if a meteor landed on the corner of Madison Avenue and 51st Street .
The response by our government was to shovel “ loans ” onto the loading dock of every organization that pretended to be something like a bank , while “ bailing out ” an ever - longer line of corporate claimants with a pitiable song - and - dance .
The oil markets went on a roller coaster ride .
The housing bubble collapse grew to avalanche velocity ( taking out whole colonies of realtors , mortgage brokers , and construction contractors in its path ) , the commercial real estate sector developed hemorrhagic fever , retail drove off a cliff on Christmas Eve , the stock market fell in the toilet , jobs and incomes went up in a vapor , and tens of millions of ordinary citizens addicted to revolving credit found themselves in a life - and - death struggle for the means of existence .
None of this is over yet .
The Year Ahead
Much of what has been lost in 2008 will not be recovered : enterprises , personal fortunes , chattels , reputations .
I expect a period of euphoria to mark the early weeks , perhaps months , of the Obama team .
It will be a relief to have a president who speaks English correctly and has experienced something like real life prior to politics .
Restoring credibility and legitimacy in leadership will be a big deal .
If nothing else , we may recover a collective sense of consequence from a president who tells the truth , even the harsh truth .
The age when it was enough to claim that “ mistakes were made ” might be over .
A sign of this sort of change may be the commencement of prosecutions for misdeeds in banking and securities that are now destroying the entire system of deployable capital .
A good place to start will be an investigation of Henry Paulson for insider trading stemming from Goldman Sachs ’s shorting of its own issued mortgage - backed securities when Mr. Paulson was the company ’s CEO .
Beyond his case , there should be enough work at Attorney General Eric Holder ’s office to employ a line of law school graduates stretching from Brattle Street to the planet Mars .
It will be salutary for the nation to see those who engineered the banking collapse come to greater grief than the mere surrender of their Gulfstream jets and Hamptons villas .
By the way , being allergic to conspiracy theories , I do n’t believe for a minute that there is some kind of shadow elite of “ Bilderburgers ” standing in the background to protect these grifters -- and I also believe the reason these paranoid notions persist is because it is otherwise hard to account for the extravagant irresponsibility of the Bush circle and its servelings .
Apart from “ cleaning up Dodge , ” so to speak , and from issues of collective character - and conscience - in - office , I worry that the avalanche of troubles already ongoing will overwhelm Mr. Obama and his people .
It ’s also well worth worrying whether they will pursue policies similar in kind to the ones pursued by Bush , namely throwing money at everything and anything , and it sure looks like they are planning to do just that .
I am especially concerned about an “ infrastructure stimulus ” project aimed at highway improvement at the expense of public transit .
This would be the epitome of a campaign to sustain the unsustainable .
We need to begin planning right away for a transition away from automobiles , not in order to be good socialists but because Happy Motoring is at the core of our unsustainability trap .
The car system is going to fail in manifold ways whether we like it or not , and it will fail due to circumstances already underway .
For one thing , it will cease to be democratic as the remnants of the middle class find it impossible to get car loans , or pay for fuel , or insurance , and that will set in motion a very impressive politics - of - grievance setting apart those who are still able to enjoy motoring and those who have been foreclosed from it .
Contrary to what you might make of the the current situation in the oil markets , we are in for a heap of trouble with both the price and supply of petroleum ( more on this below ) .
And there is no chance in hell that any techno rescue remedy to keep all the cars running by other means will materialize .
A consensus in the blogoshpere says that the stock markets will rebound strongly during the first Obama months .
This is possible just on the basis of pure “ animal spirits , ” but the Obama Bounce will occur against a background of continued dismal business and financial news .
It will appear to defy that news .
By May of 2009 , the stock markets will resume crashing with the ultimate destination of a Dow 4000 before the end of the year .
Meanwhile , jobs will vanish by the millions and companies will go bankrupt by the thousands , especially in the so - called service sector , and in all the suppliers of such , along with the landlords in all the malls and strip malls .
The desolation will mount quickly and will be obvious in the empty storefronts and trash - filled parking lagoons .
In the event , two things will become increasingly clear to the nation : that the consumer economy is dead , and that there is no more available credit of the kind that Americans are in the habit of enjoying .
We ’ll turn around early in 2009 and discover that we are a much poorer nation than we thought because from now on credit will be extremely hard to get for anyone for anything .
The businesses that survive will have to keep going on the basis of accounts receivable .
This is the area where the crash of giants will be heard .
I ’ve been saying since publication of The long Emergency that comprehensive downscaling in all our activities , from farming to business to schooling to governance , will be the categorical imperative of the years ahead .
Giant enterprises requiring giant loans to get from quarter to quarter will tend to not make it .
Borrowing from the future will become a practical impossibility as past bad debts from previous borrowings continue to unwind , cease performing , and get written off .
This argument implies that the federal government will tend to flounder just as General Motors , Citicorp , Target Stores and other gigantic enterprises will tend to flounder .
It would be sad to see a President Obama so hamstrung and helpless , and it is largely why I see his role as largely symbolic -- as a reassuring presence encouraging the distressed public to bravely bear their hardships , and to be kind and helpful among their neighbors .
Households , like businesses , will have to pay as they go from earned income .
The house as ATM is over .
Credit cards are maxed out and credit ceilings are lowering like the ceiling in “ The Pit and the Pendulum , ” preparing to slice - and - dice the old “ normal ” of family life in America .
Bankruptcy will be the new Nascar .
A lot of families will lose everything .
They will sift and disperse into the housing owned by other family members -- parents , siblings -- and a strange new not - altogether comfortable kind of togetherness will become common .
Over time , a lot of people will go looking for casual work “ under - the - table ” ( and probably low - paying ) .
To some degree , these workers will begin to look and act like a new servant class , and before too long they may be absorbed into the households of people who employ them .
There will be plenty of room for them there .
Counties , municipalities , and states will join in the bankruptcy fiesta .
It would be reasonable to expect collapsing services as a result .
This would be a situation fraught with danger -- of rising crime , of public health emergencies as water systems are not kept up and sewage treatment becomes unaffordable .
I do n’t imagine the federal government stepping into every Podunk or Metropolis from sea to shining sea and propping up these services .
People will have to cope with danger and deprivation .
2009 may be the point where we begin to understand what kinds of places will be more hospitable to human society further ahead .
I maintain that our giant urban metroplexes have way overshot their sustainable scale and will contract severely .
With all the economic hardship , we ought to expect a lot of demographic churning , people leaving hopeless places and moving on to something more promising .
I believe we will see them move to smaller towns and smaller cities .
The reorganization of the rural landscape into smaller - scaled farms has not begun to occur -- though 2009 might be very hard on agribusiness , given the shortage of capital and if oil begins to march up in price by late winter .
Eventually , the rural landscape will require the labor of many more people than is currently the case .
Whatever else happens , 2009 will surely see a massive return to home gardening as budgets become strained to the extreme .
As the New Urbanist Andres Duany said recently , “ Gardening is the new Golf ! ”
The Oil Scene
Many were stunned this year to witness the parabolic rise and fall of oil prices up to nearly $ 150 and then back around $ 36 by Christmas time .
Quite a ride .
I said in The Long Emergency that volatility would be the hallmark of post peak oil because it was obvious that advanced economies could not absorb super high prices and would crash in response ; that at some point after crashing , these economies would respond to the new lower oil price , resume their cheap oil habits , and build to another price rise .
. . and crash again .
. . in a declension of ever - lower industrial activity .
What I probably did n’t realize at the time was how destructive this cycling between low - high - and - low oil prices would actually be in the first instance of it , and what a toll it would take right off the bat .
We can see now that our first journey through the cycle took out the most fragile of the complex systems we depend on : capital finance .
As a result , a huge amount of capital ( say $ 14 trillion ) has evaporated out of the system , never to be seen again ( and never to be deployed for productive purposes ) .
It will be harder for the USA to rebound from the grievous injury to this crucial part of the overall system , and Europe has foundered similarly -- though the European nations are not burdened to the same degree by the awful liabilities of suburbia .
Even if these advanced economies -- throw in Japan too -- remain moribund , the price and supply prospects for oil look ominous .
My own guess is that the price of oil has overshot on the low end just as it overshot on the high end , and that , when all is said and done , we ’ll still see an upwardly trending price line over the long haul .
The plunge , which began right after the $ 147 peak in July 2008 , was as much the result of banks , hedge funds , and individuals dumping oil investments and positions to raise cash as it was a matter of the markets predicting a sharp fall - off in economic activity ( and supposedly oil consumption ) .
The truth is that demand destruction for oil in the USA has been surprising mild compared to the drop in price .
Jim Hansen ’s Master Resource Report says that gasoline consumption dropped from 9.29 million barrels a day in 2007 to 8.99 million barrels a day for 2008 .
That ’s not much of a fall - off , especially compared to the price drop .
As Julian Darley of the Post Carbon Institute put it recently : “ There wo n’t be any energy bail - out . ”
And , as many other people have noted , the recent plunge in oil prices strongly implies future supply destruction , since so many planned oil projects have been suspended or cancelled because they are economic losers at $ 40 - a - barrel ( or even $ 70 ) .
Even projects well underway , such as Canadian tar sand production , have been scaled back or shut down because they do n’t make sense at current prices .
Some of these other newer projects will now never get underway -- they have missed their window of opportunity with so much capital leaving the system -- and so the hope of offsetting very - near - future depletions in old giant oil fields looks dimmer and dimmer .
Those depletions are very serious .
For instance , Mexico ’s super - giant Cantarell oil field , the second - largest ever discovered after Saudi Arabia ’s Ghawar field , has shown a 30 percent depletion rate in the past year alone .
( Pemex had forecast a 15 percent rate entering the year . )
Cantarell provides over 60 percent of Mexico ’s total production , and Mexico is America ’s third largest source of imports -- just after Saudi Arabia ( # 2 ) and Canada ( # 1 ) .
Obviously , Mexico soon will lose its ability to export oil , and as that occurs , America is going to feel more than pinch -- more like a two - by - four upside the head .
In short , remorseless depletion is underway and we are less likely now than even a year ago , to make up for it .
At some point , then , demand , even if slightly lower , will catch up with declining supply .
My prediction for 2009 is that we will see two things occur , possibly at the same time : a resumption of rising prices , and spot shortages .
I say this because the global economic fiasco is sure to produce geopolitical friction , and inasmuch as America has to import almost three - quarters of the oil we use , the prospect for trouble is great .
The tragic part of all this , of course , is that the temporary plunge in oil prices has prompted an incurious American public to assume , once again , that the global oil predicament is some kind of a fraud .
Given the flood tide of fraud they have been subject to in banking and investment matters , I suppose you ca n’t blame them from thinking that everything is some kind of a scam .
Given feeble car sales this season , there are reports that an increasing percentage of those sold now are are trucks and SUVs .
Though I give Boone Pickens high marks for stepping up to the leadership plate , I ’m not altogether on board with his energy proposal for swapping natural gas for gasoline in motor fuels while we swap out wind power for natural gas in electric power generation .
I do n’t believe that the ballyhooed shale - gas - plays of the last few years will prove - out long - term , as some huckster ’s claim .
They are expensive to drill and run , and they all tend to deplete very quickly -- around one year .
I ’m not convinced we have the capital or the resources even to come up with the steel necessary to drill for it .
Anyway , the last thing we need is a way to prolong our car - dependency .
In the meantime , there are still those who hope ( as described above ) that various alt.energy systems will insure the continuation of Happy Motoring .
This is an idle hope , and 2009 will be very sobering for those who imagine that hybrid cars , or electric cars , or “ air ” cars , or natural gas cars , or any other kind of car technology will save the day .
Even if President Obama mounts an “ infrastructure stimulus ” program , it will not keep up with all the necessary routine road repair that our highway system requires .
The extreme financial hardship faced by localities and states insures that they will have to postpone a lot of expensive highway maintenance -- even if the federal government fixes a big bunch of bridges and tunnels -- and so we face the interesting prospect that our roadway systems will enter their own deadly zone of systemic failure even before the whole car issue is settled .
I am waiting to see whether Mr. Obama will undertake a restoration of passenger railroad service .
I ’ve said enough about this in the past , but it ’s worth reiterating that a failure to get comprehensive passenger rail service going will be a sign of how fundamentally unserious we are as a nation .
The Specter of Inflation
This is the “ other shoe ” that a lot of people are waiting to drop .
Right now we are caught up in a compressive debt deflation as mortgages stop “ performing ” and loans of all kinds are welshed on .
Since money is loaned into existence , and a great many loans are not being repaid , then a lot of money is going out of existence .
That ’s what I mean when I say that capital is leaving the system .
At the same time , the Federal Reserve has made good on its promise to drop money from helicopters if necessary to prevent an implosion of the banking system ( as all that older money goes out of existence ) , and so it ’s now a question as to when the amount of new money will exceed the disappeared old money .
( Of course when I say money , I mean “ money , ” because we are dealing here in a shadow realm of assumed value . )
In any case , there is bound to be a lag period between the time that the Fed ’s money is dropped from the choppers and the time it actually filters through the banks and other recipients to the so - called “ real economy ” of people who buy and sell real things .
The credible estimates I hear run between six and 18 months .
I ’ll only venture to guess that we could see the start of serious inflation sometime in 2009 .
To some extent , all currencies are now free - falling together , some at slightly faster rates than others , but the situation of the US dollar is so grotesquely dire , and our structural imbalances so monumental , that it is hard to imagine that our currency will not win the international race to the bottom .
Gold resumed its movement upward against the dollar a week before Christmas , and that may be an early sign .
The government -- and anyone badly in debt -- benefits much more from inflation than deflation , so every effort will be made to avert the latter .
The trouble lies in the government ’s dumb incapacity to control dangerous things that it sets in motion , so that an inflationary campaign to avoid compressive deflation can so easily lead to a fiasco of super or hyper inflation -- the kind that kills governments and turns societies into murderous monsters .
I ’ll forecast the that the US dollar is worth 40 percent of its current value by next Christmas .
Geopolitics
Well , now , who the hell knows what ’s in store .
Aside from a few bombs here and there , and pirates skulking around the horn of Africa , the world scene was miraculously free of major incidents in 2008 -- perhaps the worst being a toss up between the September Mumbai bombings and the fiasco in Georgia , where the US prompted Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili to send troops into the South Ossetia region and the move was answered by overwhelming force from neighboring Russia , leaving the US looking feckless and retarded for our troubles .
But otherwise , there was n’t a whole lot of action out there .
Until the last few days of the year , that is .
I ’m sure the ever - growing cohort of American anti-semites who send me emails will be tickled when I assert that the Hamas rocket attacks against Israel of recent days guaranteed a sharp response from Israel -- and now , of course , Hamas is playing the crybaby card : “ ... what ’d we do to deserve this ...? ”
Well , you fucking fired a bunch rockets into Israel .
Did you ever hear of cause - and - effect ?
This matter requires no further elucidation , except that it seems to suggest a ramping back up of hostilities .
I wonder if it is the beginning of a new coordinated offensive by Islamic extremism aimed at taking advantage of the West ’s current economic plight ( and the West ’s probable aversion to anything that will complicate its desired recovery ) .
We ’ll know in a month or so , I think , since any coordinated campaign ( if such a thing were possible ) might well be aimed at confounding the new American president .
The other hot corner of the world right now is the India - Pakistan border where the 60 - year - old rivalry , which has already produced three wars , looks to be gearing up for yet another round .
I ’m not the first one to say that Pakistan is an extremely dangerous regional player , being an economic basket case , possessing a score or so of nuclear bombs , harboring more Islamic fundamentalist maniacs than any other place in the world , and having a government held together with duct tape and twine .
The caper in Mumbai last September could well have been construed as an act of war , but somehow India kept its head .
Who knows where this is going .
. . .
So far I have only described what is already obviously going on .
Add to this the likelihood that Iran is closer to achieving membership in the atomic weapon club .
They ’ve been spinning their centrifuges all year and nobody has done anything about it .
My guess is that neither the US nor Israel will attempt to take out their facilities in the year ahead .
If Iran used a nuclear device against Israel , or anybody else , they would be asking to become , in turn , the world ’s largest ashtray .
End of story .
A different story , though , is how Iran might behave if and when the US Military presence in Iraq is reduced .
I can imagine Iran doing anything possible surreptitiously to gain control over Iraq ’s southern oil regions around Basra , but even the Iraqi Shia do n’t like the Iranian Shia that much .
Anyway , iran ’s economy has suffered hugely from the fall in oil prices .
That nation may be in for more internal trouble than they have seen in thirty years since the Shah was tossed out by the minions of Ayatollah Khomeini .
There ’s been a lot of sentiment the past year that as the US and the Europe fall into economic disarray , China would emerge as the great new hegemonic superpower .
While it ’s come a long way in a quarter - century , China ’s internal problems are still enormous and worsening .
They ’re in trouble with water , food imports , mass unemployment , and energy .
They have locked in some oil contracts around the world , but they are still susceptible to vagaries in the oil markets and Black Swan events .
As the US consumer economy falls into a coma , and the shipping containers from China to WalMart get sparser , the Chinese government will face the wrath of millions of unemployed workers .
I believe they will struggle through 2009 , perhaps growing more surly as the US dollar inflates and their holdings of treasury bills begins to look more like a swindle .
Russia may be suffering economically for the moment due to the crash of oil prices , but they are energy resource - rich -- at least for the next couple of decades -- and if they do n’t like the current price , they can keep more of their oil in the ground until the price looks more attractive .
I think Mr. Putin has the confidence of the Russian people and will survive the current malaise .
Japan remains a riddle wrapped in toasted nori .
They ’re beggaring their own factory workers to stay solvent .
Their banking sector has been zombified for a generation .
They import 95 percent of the energy they use .
Do they have a plan ?
One can imagine them sliding in resignation back to something like the sixteenth century , giving up the whole industrial circus as more trouble than it ’s worth , just as they once gave up on firearms .
The over - arching geopolitical theme of 2009 will be the end of robust globalism as we ’ve known it for some time .
Reduced trade , competition for energy resources , sore feelings over debts and currencies will drive the nations inward or , at least , direct their energies toward their own regions .
Note to Tom Friedman : the world turned out to be round after all .
Conclusion
The big theme for 2009 economically will be contraction .
The end of the cheap energy era will announce itself as the end of conventional “ growth ” and the shrinking back of activity , wealth , and populations .
Contraction will come as a great shock to a world of conventionally programmed economists .
They will toil and sweat to account for it , and they will probably be wrong .
Unfortunately , this contraction will do its work in unpleasant ways , driving down standards of living , shearing away hopes and expectations for a particular life of comfort , and introducing disorder to so many of the systems we have depended on for so long .
People will starve , lose their homes , lose incomes and status , and lose the security of living in peaceful societies .
It will become clear that the Long Emergency is underway .
My hope for the year , at least for my own society , is that we will transition away from being a nation of complacent , distracted , over - fed clowns , to become a purposeful and responsible people willing to put their shoulders to the wheel to get some things done .
My motto for the new year : “ no more crybabies ! ”
