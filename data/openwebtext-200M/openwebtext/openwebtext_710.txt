Police have introduced a new ' three strikes ' regime to target cannabis users following the government 's reclassification of the drug to class B .
After an initial warning , officers will enforce an £ 80 spot fine for a second offence before initiating court action for a third offence .
But John Fassenfelt , deputy chairman of the Magistrates Association , said the reclassification was confusing after the first step , handing out an £ 80 fine , was withdrawn for consultation by the justice ministry .
" It 's giving the wrong message out , " he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme .
" The message now is that you can have cannabis and have a lesser punishment than another Class B drug . "
The government 's decision to reclassify the drug comes despite advice to the contrary by independent health advisors .
Some campaigners have criticised Jacqui Smith for ignoring the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , which failed to establish any direct link between cannabis and mental illnesses like schizophrenia in a study last year , and accused the government of using cannabis as a " political football " .
" They do n't see that prohibition essentially drives the problem underground , makes the problems worse , and does nothing to protect young and vulnerable people " , said Andy Cornwell , from the Cannabis Education Trust .
" Prohibition does n't work , and whether cannabis is in category A , B or C , it 'll make virtually no difference to the number of people using it . "
Cannabis is now in the same legal category as amphetamines and barbiturates , drugs previously considered more much dangerous .
In line with its reclassification the maximum sentence for possession of cannabis will now rise from two to five years .
In a statement the Home Office defended its decision , saying it is based on ' uncertainty ' over the impact of stronger varieties of the drug .
" Skunk , a much stronger version of the drug , now dominates the UK 's cannabis market .
It has swept other , less potent , forms of cannabis off the market , and now accounts for 81 per cent of cannabis available on our streets , compared to just 30 per cent in 2002 . "
Mental health charities disagree over the issue of linking cannabis with poor mental health .
Charity Mind has not included cannabis use it in its policy considerations for the last two years , said a spokesperson .
" Reclassification makes little difference to actual cannabis use , and that money would be better spent on an education and awareness about the potential risks " , said Julia Lamb from the charity .
But Sane , which gave evidence to the ACMD review , echoed the government 's concerns and argued there are hundreds of cases where heavy cannabis , and particularly skunk users , went on to suffer psychotic breakdowns , hallucinations and paranoia .
Cannabis was downgraded to class C in 2004 by then home secretary David Blunkett to reduce the amount of police time spent dealing with those in possession of the drug .
Medical marijuana legalized in Michigan RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Michigan residents suffering from an array of chronic conditions , from cancer to AIDS to Alzheimer 's , will now be able to seek relief from medical marijuana .
State voters on Tuesday approved a measure to legalize medicinal use of the plan .
Michigan is the first state in the Midwest and the 13th nationwide to legalize medical marijuana .
" This is a victory for the patients and their stories resonated with voters , " Dianne Byrum , spokeswoman for Michigan Coalition for Compassionate Care , told the Detroit News .
" The scare tactics from the opposition were over the top and not believable . "
Proponents of the measure say medical marijuana will be able to help up to 50,000 residents ease their suffering .
It was subjected to expected opposition from law enforcement organizations .
Nearly two - thirds of Michigan voters supported the measure , which was one of nearly a dozen Marijuana reform initiatives on ballots across the country .
Massachusetts voters decriminalize marijuana Massachusetts voters have approved Question 2 , which eliminated criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of cannabis .
The new law , which will take effect in 30 days , calls for a $ 100 fine and confiscation of the substance for those caught with an ounce or less with no reporting against a person 's criminal record .
Those under 18 caught with cannabis will pay a larger fine , up to $ 1,000 , and participate in a drug awareness program and perform community service .
Governor Patrick , the attorney general and district attorneys across the state were among opponents of the initiative , saying that decriminalization would promote drug use , cause a rise in violence and workplace safety hazards , and increase the number of car accidents and youths driving under the influence .
" The people were ahead of the politicians on this issue , " said Whitney Taylor , chairwoman of the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy .
" They want to focus our limited law enforcement resources on serious and violent crimes .
They recognize under the new law that the punishment will fit the offense . "
More pro-pot measures approved According to the Marijuana Policy Project , local initiatives in California , Arkansas and Hawaii also passed .
Voters in Berkeley voted to expand areas where medical marijuana distributors could operate .
In Fayetteville , Ark. , and Hawaii County , Hawaii , voters told police to make marijuana possession their lowest priority .
In several Massachusetts cities , voters directed their state representatives to vote in favor of medical marijuana legislation .
First under President Boris N. Yeltsin and then under Mr. Putin , Mr. Yeltsin ’s successor , Aleksy II significantly deepened the role of the church in everyday life -- erecting and restoring cathedrals , introducing Orthodox religious education in public schools and becoming a prominent voice on moral issues .
While church attendance has remained low , growing numbers of Russians identify themselves as Russian Orthodox .

At the same time , the patriarch successfully lobbied the government over the last decade to adopt restrictions on other Christian denominations to impede their efforts to attract adherents in Russia .
In the 1990s , Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in the West saw Russia as fertile territory and sent missionaries here , spurring a backlash .
Relations between Patriarch Aleksy and the Roman Catholic Church were tense during his tenure over the issue of proselytizing , and as a result , he would not agree to a visit to Russia by Pope John Paul II .
Aleksy II did end another religious dispute , reaching an agreement with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia to bring the churches closer together .
The breakaway church had split in 1927 , after the Moscow church ’s leader declared loyalty to the Communist government .
The agreement was signed in the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow , which Stalin had leveled and later became the site of a swimming pool .
You probably heard the saga about Belgian politics in the past two years .
After the elections in June 2007 , it took them nine months to form a government , during which press rumours circulated about the imminent break up of Belgium .
Now again , we are government - less :
The prime minister was accused of unlawfully meddling in the Fortis / BNP - Paribas take - over .
I read several articles about it in the newspapers .
I still do n't understand fully ...
Seems like a typical Belgian tragicomedy :
In October , Prime Minister Leterme tried to save Fortis , one of the most prominent Belgian banks and 49 % government owned , by agreeing to sell them to France 's BNP Paribas .
The insurance arm of Fortis , however , still belongs to the publicly traded Fortis NV , and minority shareholders filed a court challenge against the sale .
When Leterme 's cabinet discovered it was likely to lose the case , cabinet members tried to persuade one judge , via her husband ( who is related to Leterme 's political party ) , to reverse the decision .
The court investigated the case and found unduly political meddling in private businesses and into the juridicial system , a bit no -no .
Leterme took the blame , the government fell , the King say " What , where ? " and everyone goes : " Next please ! " ( Full )
But then again , we are never without a governing bodies .
Besides the King , all of his lawful and unlawful sons and daughters ( with a varying degree of debilism ) and the federal prime minister , we also have 5 " minister - presidents " ...
No , I kid you not !
* The Minister - President of the Flemish Community
* The Minister - President of French Community
* The Minister - President of Walloon Regional Government
* The Minister - President of the Brussels region
* The Minister - President of German Community
Most people driving from Holland to France , drive through Belgium in one and a half hour .
Unless if you are watchful , you miss it .
But .. we got six governments .
Plus provincial governors too . ;-)

Who wants to be a millionaire ?
Most people , surely , except billionaires of course .
Sadly , winning a truck - load of money on the lottery comes with a heap of baggage .
Daydreams of a millionaire lifestyle seem to have a habit of turning sour : isolation , paranoia , drugs , crime , poverty and prison await those who fail to adjust , as this top ten of ' Lottery Losers ' shows :
Jack Whittaker
Won a record $ 314.9 m Powerball jackpot in 2002 .
Life since then has been a long list of arrests , lawsuits , broken relationships and even death .
In 2007 , his then wife , Jewell admitted she wished she had ' torn up the ticket ' .
William " Bud " Post
Won $ 16.2 million in the Pennsylvania lottery in 1988 .
He later described the experience as a ' nightmare ' and wishes it had never happened - who can blame him after he was sued by a former girlfriend eager to get her hands on the cash , and his brother hired a hitman in the hope of inheriting the winnings .
He invested in ill - fated family businesses and within a year was $ 1 million in debt .
Today he gets by on social security payments .
Luke Pittard from Wales
Won a ' measly ' £ 1.3 m on the National Lottery .
After the novelty had worn off and the obligatory lavish holiday , wedding and new home were done and dusted , he got bored and returned to work at McDonalds .
An as - yet - unnamed Sicilian
Won £ 79 m on the Italian lottery in 2008
Before he or she could even collect the winnings , consumer groups were demanding that the windfall be seized by the government .
The winner has since gone into hiding , fearing the Mafia will come calling .
Janite Lee
Won $ 18 million in 1993
Her generosity in giving money to a variety of political , educational and community causes was commendable - but just eight years later she filed for bankruptcy .
Mark Gardiner from London
Won £ 11 m in 1995
Thirteen miserable years later , he has not lost his money , but he has lost all his friends - even the ones he treated to new £ 100,000 homes - and lost touch with his family .
Michael Carroll
Won a £ 9.7 m National Lottery jackpot in 2002
Since then he has appeared in court more than 30 times and been jailed for drug related offences .
In 2008 , he admitted that ' just ' £ 500,000 of his windfall remained .
Willie Hurt
Won $ 3.1 million in 1989
Two years later the money was gone and he was on a murder charge .
Hurt spent his fortune on a divorce and crack cocaine .
Charles Riddle
Won $ 1 million in 1975
The original lottery car crash , he quickly got divorced , faced several lawsuits and was eventually indicted for selling cocaine .
Ken Proxmire
Won $ 1 million in the Michigan lottery
Chris Williams
The Register
December 16 , 2008
The UK ’s second largest ISP , Virgin Media , will next year introduce network monitoring technology to specifically target and restrict BitTorrent traffic , its boss has told The Register .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The move will represent a major policy shift for the cable monopoly and is likely to anger advocates of “ net neutrality ” , who say all internet traffic should be treated equally .
Virgin Media currently temporarily throttles the bandwidth of its heaviest downloaders across all applications at peak times , rather than targeting and “ shaping ” specific types of traffic .
The firm argues that its current “ traffic management ” policy allows it to ensure service quality at peak times for 95 per cent of customers while still allowing peer - to - peer filesharers to download large amounts of data .
The details and timing of the new application - based restrictions are still being developed , Virgin Media ’s Kiwi CEO Neil Berkett said in an interview on Monday following the launch of his firm ’s new 50 M bit /s service .
They will come into force around the middle of next year , he added .
A company spokesman later declined to provide more detail on the CEO ’s comments .
He said : “ Broadband has become integral to delivering home entertainment services and with data consumption growing rapidly , we are exploring new ways to enhance our product offering .
Part of this involves intelligent monitoring and understanding the way people use our broadband service . ”

Meanwhile , the International Monetary Fund , European Union and World Bank announced a joint financing package that should provide $ 25 billion for Hungary .
The money will help bolster a Hungarian economy that has been " hit hard by recent financial market turbulence , " the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said in a statement .
The planned financial package for Hungary follows recent announcements of tentative loan agreements between the IMF and Iceland and Ukraine -- and is the first to a member of the European Union .
" Proposed World Bank assistance would support the design and implementation of reforms in key areas , such as the financial sector , fiscal management , and social sector reforms .
These measures would support the country 's longer - term stabilization and economic restructuring , " said Orsalia Kalantzopoulos , World Bank director for Central Europe and the Baltic Countries .

The research found a google search produced 7g of carbon dioxide
Two search requests on the internet website Google produce " as much carbon dioxide as boiling a kettle " , according to a Harvard University academic .
US physicist Alex Wissner - Gross claims that a typical Google search on a desktop computer produces about 7g CO2 .
However , these figures were disputed by Google , who say a typical search produced only 0.2g of carbon dioxide .
A recent study by American research firm Gartner suggested that IT now causes two percent of global emissions .
Dr Wissner - Gross 's study claims that two Google searches on a desktop computer produces 14g of CO2 , which is the roughly the equivalent of boiling an electric kettle .
Carbon emissions
The Harvard academic argues that these carbon emissions stem from the electricity used by the computer terminal and by the power consumed by the large data centres operated by Google around the world .
If you want to supply really great and fast result , then that 's going to take extra energy
Dr Alex Wissner - Gross
Although the American search engine is renowned for returning fast results , Dr Wissner - Gross says it can only do so because it uses several data banks at the same time .
Speaking to the BBC , he said a combination of clients , networks , servers and people 's home computers all added up to a lot of energy usage .
" Google is n't any worse than any other data centre operator .
If you want to supply really great and fast result , then that 's going to take extra energy to do so , " he said .
Dr Wissner - Gross said he was working on a website called co2stats.com which helps companies identify " energy inefficient " aspects of their websites .
In a statement on its official blog , Google said that Dr Wissner - Gross ' figures were " many times too high . "
The firm said that a typical search returned a result in less than 0.2 seconds and that the search itself only used its servers for a few thousandths of a second .
This , said Google , amounted to 0.0003 kWh of energy per search - equivalent to 0.2g of CO2 .
" We 've made great strides to reduce the energy used by our data centres , but we still want clean and affordable sources of electricity for the power that we do use , " said Google in its statement .
" In 2007 , we co-founded the Climate Savers Computing Initiative .
This non-profit consortium is committed to cutting the energy consumed by computers in half by 2010 and so reducing global CO2 emissions by 54 million tons per year .
That 's a lot of kettles . "

David Copperfield Fan Blade Stunt Fails : Assistant Hospitalized ( Illusion Video )
does a 90 minute show at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas twice daily called An Intimate Evening of Grand Illusion .
During Wednesday night 's show , something went very wrong and an ' illusion technician ' was severely injured .
The stunt involves a giant 12 foot high industrial fan that assistants rotate while Copperfield walks through the whirring blades .
During this particular performance , an illusion technician named Brandon was pulled into the vortex of the moving blades .
He reportedly suffered injuries to his arm and face .
Audience members were shocked as blood was flying and the curtain was closed to block their view .
Many thought it was part of the act when Copperfield initially came out on stage and told the crowd that they might have to end the show .
He went backstage again and returned several minutes later indicating the show was done and instructed the audience to request a full refund .
Clark County Fire Department was dispatched at 11:25 p.m. Spokesperson Scott Allison said they received a 911 call indicating that someone 's arm was stuck in a fan prop .
When EMS arrived on the scene , the man 's arm had been freed but he was bleeding profusely .
Brandon was transported to University Medical Center where he underwent several hours of surgery on his severely damaged arm .
Doctors inserted pins and bolts to repair multiple breaks .
He also required stitches to his face for a large puncture wound .
Copperfield made the following statement afterward , " Many people assume that the death - defying illusions I do on stage are not dangerous .
This unfortunate accident shows that assumption could n't be further from the truth .
We 're just thankful that Brandon 's injuries were n't worse . "
We 've got a video of Copperfield performing the fan illusion below .
Check it out .
Having seen Copperfield 's current act , we found it to be a huge waste of money and possibly the worst Vegas act ever to hit the strip .
There were more shills than legitimate paying customers .

Investing in preventive health care is far more cost - effective than treating people after they get sick , according to a report from the nonprofit advocacy group Trust for America 's Health .
"
We 've got to change the mindset from treating sick people to preventing illnesses in the first place , " said U.S. Sen .
Tom Harkin in response to the report .
Researchers calculated how much rates of certain diseases could be decreased by investing money in programs that have been proven to lower smoking rates and increase healthy eating and physical activity .
They found that within two years , investment in community health programs could lead to a 5 percent reduction in rates of diabetes and high blood pressure , while significantly reducing rates of arthritis and some kinds of cancer within only 10 to 20 years .
For every dollar invested in community - based preventive health care programs , the researchers found , $ 5.60 in later healthcare treatment would be saved .
Investing just $ 10 per person could lead to savings of more than $ 16 billion per year within only five years .
People often think that such programs " [ pay ] off 20 or 30 years from now , " Harkin said , " but this shows you get the money back almost immediately , and then the savings grows bigger and bigger .
"
The report encourages federal , state and local governments to increase tobacco taxes , ban smoking in public places and require nutrition labels on restaurant menus .
It also urges governments to increase funding for community health initiatives , like a program in Dallas that has led to improved eating and physical activity habits among participating youth .
Governments can also encourage healthy living through relatively simple and inexpensive measures , the report said , such as keeping sidewalks in good shape .
" What 's been interesting is that if you make it easier for people to make better choices , they actually do , " said Jeffrey Levi , executive director of the Trust for America 's Health .

Tom Mastny is no longer a Cleveland Indian , but his new team is n’t even in America .
The reliever ’s contract was sold on Tuesday to the Yokohama Bay Stars of the Japanese Central League .
Mastny burst onto the scene at the end of the regular season in 2006 when he was featured in 15 games after being called up .
During this time , he was very promising had a few memorable outings .
In 2007 he played in 51 games with a record of 7 - 2 and helped the Indians make the playoffs for the first time since 2001 .
It was during this season that it seemed like Mastny could be a staple of the Tribe bullpen for some time to come .
Control problems and injuries forced him to pitch just 14 games in 2008 .
Although he did earn one save during the end of the season , he finished with an ERA of 10.80 .
Mastny was originally drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays during the 11th round of the 2003 draft and made around the league minimum during time with the Tribe .
Indians ’ general manager Mark Shapiro now has another hole to fill in bullpen that was rocky at best during the 2008 season .

Artist Evan Roth has devised a clever way to communicate with TSA workers as you travel home this holiday season .
He explains :
T.S.A. Communication is a project that alters the airport security experience and allows the government to learn more about you then just what ’s in your backpack .
Thin 8.5 x 11 inch laser - cut sheets of stainless steel comfortably fit in your carry on bag , simultaneously obscuring the contents you do n’t want the TSA to see while highlighting ideas you do want them to see .
Change your role as air traveler from passive to active .
A farm of about 200 PlayStation 3s were used to by researchers to launch a nearly undetectable phishing attack , says NetworkWorld .
Their goal was to exploit a bug in the Web site security certificates you use daily on the internet .
The researchers were able to hack into Verisign 's RapidSSL.com certificate authority and create fake digital certificates for any Web site on the Internet .
The PS3 farm spits out fake certificates that would be trusted by any browser .
NetworkWorld says that the PS3's Cell Processor is popular with code breakers for its ability to perform cryptographic functions well .
The group plans to present their findings at the Chaos Communication Congress hacker conference , to held in Berlin on Tuesday .
Naturally , Verisign was pissed , and it looks like they were the last to know :
" I can't express how disappointed I am that bloggers and journalists are being briefed on this but we 're not , considering that we 're the people who have to actually respond , " said Tim Callan , vice president of product marketing with Verisign .
How many times do we have to see this play before we admit that it always ends the same way ?
Which play ?
The one where gasoline prices go up , pressure rises for more fuel - efficient cars , then gasoline prices fall and the pressure for low - mileage vehicles vanishes , consumers stop buying those cars , the oil producers celebrate , we remain addicted to oil and prices gradually go up again , petro- dictators get rich , we lose .
I ’ve already seen this play three times in my life .
Trust me :
It always ends the same way  badly .
So I could only cringe when reading this article from CNNMoney.com on Dec. 22 : “ After nearly a year of flagging sales , low gas prices and fat incentives are reigniting America ’s taste for big vehicles .
Trucks and S.U.V.’s will outsell cars in December ... something that has n’t happened since February .
Meanwhile , the forecast finds that sales of hybrid vehicles are expected to be way down . ”
Have a nice day .
It ’s morning again  in Saudi Arabia .
Of course , it ’s a blessing that people who have been hammered by the economy are getting a break at the pump .
But for our long - term health , getting re-addicted to oil and gas guzzlers is one of the dumbest things we could do .
That is why I believe the second biggest decision Barack Obama has to make  the first is deciding the size of the stimulus  is whether to increase the federal gasoline tax or impose an economy - wide carbon tax .
Best I can tell , the Obama team has no intention of doing either at this time .
I understand why .
Raising taxes in a recession is a no - no .
But I ’ve wracked my brain trying to think of ways to retool America around clean - power technologies without a price signal  i.e. , a tax  and there are no effective ones .
( Toughening energy - effiency regulations alone wo n’t do it . )
Without a higher gas tax or carbon tax , Obama will lack the leverage to drive critical pieces of his foreign and domestic agendas .
The Truth About MRirian magibon
This blog is a follow up to my minimalist last blog about Obscurity .
This blog is about losing one 's obscurity .
It 's about marketing in a case - study of magibon .
As many of you know , I do n't have a TV .
I do , however , explore YouTube now and then .
I remember when the invention of the macintosh suddenly made everyone a desktop publisher and the technology now has suddenly made everyone a video producer and while I find it sort of intersting to see what various people are doing , I find it more intresting to monitor what the audience watches .
Now , no one is going to give me a nobel prize for acknoledging that young + attractive + female = audience .
In the early days of youtube the dancing girl videos were hands down the biggest attention grabers ( that plus the pirated TV shows which was what brought me and most people probably to YouTube to begin with to see " that thing " that happened which someone uploaded already .
Clever of them , eh ? )
This is not new , in fact , the very first films in theaters and even kinetascopes had a lot of dancing girls in them too .
But , overtime - people want something more .
Brookers was a huge YouTube phenomenon early on primarily because most people always wondered what the kind of cute girl in high school was doing when she was at home and Brookers presented this very open yet odd view of it .
She was at her best when just being a herself .
Overtime , she never reinvented herself though ( as I spoke about in earlier blogs ) and the audience pretty much knew what she was doing at home and they look for something new .
I 'm sure she still gets lots of hits - people like what they know , but this does n't mean they crave it and marketing is about making people crave .
There are many YouTube stars and the one I 'm going to talk about right now is a girl who I spotted randomly on the " other people are watching scroll " a very long time ago and her video made me so curious I sent it to a few friends .
So ... let 's bulletpoint :
What is magibon ?
magibon is the name for YouTuber MRirian who posts reguarily and gets over a half a million or more views now routinely per video .
Soon she will certain be getting multimilion views per video .
What does she do ?
That 's where it gets interesting ... because she does n't really do anything .
Often she just stares at the camera .
However , when she does speak , she speaks in a child - like voice in japanese .
Sometimes she plays video games .
Sometimes she alternates reading with eating HUGE pizzas .
She usually ends her videos flashing the peace sign pose .
Well , here , take a look for yourself :
Video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anB5SSsiolI&eurl
What do people say about her ?
Well , in addition to the not surprisng sexual comments that are par for the course with youtube - some people get really upset with her because - something I 've not mentioned ... she is n't Japanese .
She 's apparently caucasian .
Her account is registered to Japan , but she says she 's in the US .
Some people say she 's making fun of Japanese culture , some people say she is a Japanophile for which apparently there is a slightly derogative word " Waponese . "
What is the truth ?
Well - as far as I can tell - no one knows .
And if you 've read many of my blogs , you 'll know that I think that this kind of mystery is the key to drama and , therefore , this is a perfect example of drama with no plot .
It 's a dramatic moment because it captures the audience 's curiousity .
And that 's why I bring it up at all .
Okay , but what really is the truth ?
I did a little google and found that a long time ago MRirian used to frequent a BBS which focused mostly on all - things - japanese .
This would mean , that she is probably a fan of the language or culture , so she 's not making fun of anyone most likely .
Her name on those forums is no longer the same , but you can figure out pretty easily who she is because while the main posts are a new name , the quoted posts are still MRirian .
MRirian signs up for YouTube 2 years ago .
One year ago she posts her first video titled " Me doing nothing . " and in it , she does nothing .
In her second video she just makes faces .
In her third , she shows a card with some abstract names and she is just saying hello to people on a bulletin board .
Fourth video - she 's doing nothing .
Fifth video she decides to actually make a " story " where she is watching a Kikoman ad , then she tries some , does n't like it , and then lets Heinz Ketchup conquer the kikoman character .
Okay -
I 'm not going to run through all 44 videos - but I will make some observations .
1 ) She looks older in her earlier videos than her later ones where she looks increasingly young .
2 ) The first videos she 's very definitely just showing herself .
Probably to a friend on a BBS .
Then , they do n't believe her , so she shows a sign to prove that it is really her in her third .
3 ) Remember that young + female + attractive = audience .
Suddenly , people start watching her videos .
She probably is surprised .
But something that happens when people start watching your videos is that you become a YouTube partner and you start making money off the videos .
Going forward , her videos start to become more and more " cutesie " - she looks more and more like a little girl ( despite her profile saying she is 21 .
What do I think ?
I think whether she 's 21 or 16 ( or 24 as some claim ) - I think she stumbled upon an audience and realized that she does n't need to do anything except ....
... here we go ...
... sustain the mystery .
As her hits have skyrocketed , she 's put up more and more videos , more regularly .
In them , she plays up more and more of the " cute anime " character of magidon .
One commenter said " It 's like kittens and puppies but with humans . "
I do n't think it was her original intention , I think she got a response and started seeing where she could go with it .
A big give away video is where she is eating an ENORMOUS slice of pizza inter cut with her reading excerpts from a Japanese grammar book .
The comedy is in the size of the pizza which she is most definitely playing up to dwarf her own size for effect .
As an example of what I 'm getting at where she discovered the interest of her audience - compare her first video of doing nothing with a much much later one :
First Video :
Video : http://youtube.com/watch?v=uDMCnpuZjEQ
A Year Later :
Video : http://youtube.com/watch?v=RVjZVxhrlVk
Notice the choice of clothing , setting , and hair style in particular .
More clues can be found in the videos which she chose to favorite on her channel .
One is a fan video someone made of her looking like an anime character and another is a humorous video that a 40 + aged man created where he , in a dramatic form , postulates on why her videos might have appeal ( beyond the obvious pedophilic pornographic postulations which I think is a little too simple and common an answer . )
So - perhaps Maggie is a 19 year old part time student , part time cashier at the local store or perhaps she 's really 14 , or perhaps she 's a 23 year old post collegiate looking for a purpose in life - whatever the answer is ... the truth is that she 's stumbled upon the secret to marketing and drama ... sustaining the mystery .
However ... when that mystery is unfolded ... she will need to have presented another mystery if she wants to sustain her audience .
right now she has over a million hits a video .
She has an audience that major players in the industry would dream of - but it will all go away unless she twists the mystery at some point ... time will tell that story .
Why do people hate her ?
Outside of the lude comments - she gets a lot of angry YouTuber comments because she gets so many hits .
People sit back and wax philosophic on their vlogs about her and why she gets so many hits and they get none .
The irony is that these people just need to observe reality to have the answer to their question .
Why do they not get the same number of hits ?
They 're just sitting there talking and putting it all on the table .
Sometimes the thing that you need to offer people is something unrecognizable .
Invariably people will say - " All you have to be is young and cute to get viewers . "
Numa Numa .
Video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60og9gwKh1o
9 million views for that upload alone .
' nuff said .
There are so many examples of break out videos which had nothing to do with the young + attractive + female formula - but all of them had to do with creating something unrecognizable .
So , instead of hating her for figuring out how to create a mystery - these people might want to figure out what they can really offer .
final thoughts
The thing that separates a great actor from a standard actor is the ability to open up themselves and share a bit of their humanity with the audience .
The audience feels that connection .
it 's not easy to do and the doing of it comes with no safety net .
But when someone gets in sync with something true about themselves , magic happens whether you 're young , cute , and female or not .
Whether someone is an actor , a musician , a director , a personality , or whatever - the first question one should ask themselves when they can't get an audience is " What am I hiding ? "
A contradiction ... did n't I just make a huge point about that mystery was key and now I 'm saying you can't hide anything ?
Different things .
Reveal your humanity - but hide your story .
New Solar - Powered Electricity Generator is Safe , Silent , and Mobile
January 21st , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
A few years ago , I slept at a campsite next to a trailer running an obnoxiously loud diesel - powered generator all night long .
If AMP ’s silent , solar - powered portable generator had been around , I may have gotten a full night ’s sleep .
The silent , all - weather generator is installed in a trailer with photovoltaic solar panels on its roof .
An average AMP system is decked out with four Kyocera KC - 130 photovoltaic modules that output 4,400 continuous watts and can withstand surges of 8,800 watts .
If the trailer is parked in a cloudy location , it can also be charged from any standard 120V or 140V A/C electrical outlet .
When fully charged , AMP ’s generator includes enough battery power to run a 42 inch LCD television and sound system for over 50 hours .
An emergency response AMP System could power 500 watts of lighting for over 36 hours or 2000 watts of light for over 9 hours .
While an AMP generator could be handy for trailer - bound travelers , it will probably be most useful in emergency situations where grid power is down .
The components installed in the AMP system do not have regulatory approval for use as a life - safety system , but the device ’s inverters can easily run most medical devices .

MSNBC producer can be heard going completely nuts over the air …
The conduct of unconventional warfare is explored in depth in a major new U.S. Army Field Manual on the subject ( pdf ) .
Unconventional warfare ( UW ) is defined as “ Operations conducted by , with , or through irregular forces in support of a resistance movement , an insurgency , or conventional military operations …
This definition reflects two essential criteria : UW must be conducted by , with , or through surrogates ; and such surrogates must be irregular forces . ”
Thus , U.S. support of the Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s constituted unconventional warfare , as did U.S. support of anti-Soviet mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
“ The United States has considerable experience in conducting UW , ” the new manual observes .
“ The best known U.S. UW campaigns include OSS activities in Europe and the Pacific ( 1942 -45 ) , Philippines ( 1941 - 44 ) , Guatemala ( 1950 ) , Cuba ( 1960 -61 ) , North Vietnam ( 1964 -72 ) , South Vietnam ( 1967 -72 ) , Iraq ( 1991 - 96 ) , Operation Enduring Freedom ( 2001 - 02 ) , and Operation Iraqi Freedom ( 2002-03 ) . ”
The 248 - page manual presents updated policy and doctrine governing unconventional warfare , and examines its “ three main component disciplines ” : special forces operations , psychological operations , and civil affairs operations .
Appendices include an historical survey of unconventional warfare as well as an extensive bibliography .
The unclassified manual has not been approved for public release .
But a copy was obtained by Secrecy News .
See “ Army Special Operations Forces Unconventional Warfare , ” U.S. Army Field Manual FM 3-05.130 , September 30 , 2008 .
BEIJING --
After several days of talks between European and Asian leaders , China apparently has allied itself with Europe in calling for a vigorous system of international regulation .
In closed - door talks with European leaders Friday and Saturday , senior Chinese officials said they would back Europe 's effort to overhaul international regulatory systems , European diplomats present at the meetings said .
China most strongly stated its position Friday in a talk between Chinese President Hu Jintao and José Manuel Barroso , ...

We shall see in this article how to make a presentation with LaTeX , using the powerful class Beamer .
If you want to make an outstanding " stressfree " presentation and bring your ideas or your work under a whole new light , let ’s get started !!!
Installing the Beamer class
You will first need to install the package Beamer .
Under Debian or Ubuntu , you can type the following command :
# apt - get install latex - beamer
Once the latex - class Beamer is installed , you are definitely ready to stat your first presentation !!!
Basic presentation with Beamer
\documentclass {beamer}
\usepackage [ latin1 ] {inputenc}
\usetheme {Warsaw}
\title [ Make a LaTeX presentation using Beamer ] {Introduction to Beamer \ \How to make a presentation with LaTeX?}
\author {Nadir Soualem -- Astozzia}
\institute {Math-linux.com}
\date {Jule 13 , 2007}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
\titlepage
\end {frame}
\begin{frame} {Introduction}
This is a short introduction to Beamer class .
\end {frame}
\end{document}
A few explanations :
\documentclass {beamer}
means that our document is a Beamer presentation
\usepackage [ latin1 ] {inputenc}
this package enables us to use special letters ( with accents , cedillas , etc ) .
You can discard this command when the presentation is in English .
\usetheme {Warsaw}
This is our outer theme ( color and background ) .
As you can imagine , there are tons of themes .
You can refer to Beamer documentation for more details .
\title [ Making a LaTeX presentation with Beamer ] {Introduction to Beamer \ \How to make a LaTeX presentation ?}
this defines the title of the presentation .
As you can see , there are two titles :
the first one , between brackets .
[ Making a LaTeX presentation with Beamer ] is a substitute title which appears at the bottom of the page .
This is useful especially if the original title is long .
Since this is anoption only , if it is not mentioned , then the original title is the one shown in the bottom of the page .
the second one , between braces , is the principal title of the presentation .
The command
\author {Nadir Soualem -- Astozzia}
defines Nadir Soualem and Astozzia ( us ! ) as the authors of the presentation .
\institute {Math-linux.com}
defines where the presentation was held .
Finally , we use
\date {July 13 , 2007}
as the date .
To define the document , we use the markers
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
To define a slide of the presentation , we use the markers
\begin{frame}
...
\end {frame}
To define a page title ( frame ) , we mention it as follows
\begin{frame} {Introduction}
Introduction will be the title of the page .
To define the first page , which contains details such as the title , the author , the date , etc - we use a frame in which we include the \titlepage command
\begin{frame}
\titlepage
\end {frame}
To define a frame containing the layout of the presentation , we proceed as follows :
\ AtBeginSubsection [ ]
{
\ begin{frame} < beamer >
\ frametitle {Layout}
\tableofcontents[currentsection,currentsubsection ]
\end {frame}
}
The layout is therefore mentioned at every section and subsection .
You should insert \section and \subsection throughout the presentation and out of the frames :
\section{Name_of_the_section}
\begin{frame}
...
\end {frame}
...
\section{Name_of_the_section}
\subsection{Name_of_the_subsection}
\begin{frame}
...
\end {frame}
Animations — Overlays
A good presentation is one that is dynamic and attracts the audience ’s interest .
Generally , we resort to a dynamic type of presentations .
Alternatively stated , when we speak , we simultaneously show significant points of the talk , or hide others , or keep just the important ones .
We shall see in this section how animations function in Beamer .
Item - by - item list view : the \pause command
In order to view several items of a list on the same slide , we type the following commands inside a frame :
\begin{itemize}
\pause \item Beamer is a wonderful class
\pause \item
One can make animations
\pause \item
One uses the \textbf {pause} command , for example
\pause \item in order to bring in important ideas
\end{itemize}
We will thus see the items of our list , one by one .
Item - by - item list view : the \item <n-> command
An alternative way to visualize the elements of a list item by item is to use the \item < n-> command , where n is a natural number referring to the slide , beginning from which the item appears .
\begin{itemize}
\item <2-> appears from slide 2 on
\item <3-> appears from slide 3 on
\item <4-> appears from slide 4 on
\item <5-> appears from slide 5 on
\end{itemize}
List item interval and isolated items : the \item < n - m > and \item < p > commands
An example is worth a long speech :
\begin{itemize}
\item <2-> appears from slide 2 on
\item < 2 - 4 > appears from slide 2 to slide 4
\item < 4 > appears on slide 4
\item <3-> appears from slide 3 on
\end{itemize}
\item < n - m > means that the list item will appear on slides numbered n to m , whereas \item < p > means that the item will appear on slide p .
Item - by - item long list view : the [ <+->] command
Sometimes the lists you want to display are long and it is not practical to use the
\item <n-> command .
An alternative solution is the use of the [ <+->] command
\ begin{itemize} [<+->]
\item L
\item A
\item T
\item E
\item X
\end{itemize}
Up to now , we have dealt with lists .
We shall now see how to use text and slides .
Displaying and hiding text in slides : the \uncover <n-> , \uncover < n - m > and \uncover < p > commands
\uncover <n-> will display the text from slide n on ;
\uncover < n - m > means the text element will appear from slide n to m .
Finally , \uncover < p > means that the text will appear on slide p .
Here is a case in point of a frame containing the \uncover command .
\begin{frame}
\uncover <2->
{appear from slide 2 on\\}
\uncover <3- 4 >
{appears from 3 to slide 4\\}
\uncover < 4 > {appears on slide 4\\}
\uncover <3-> {appears from slide 3 on\\}
\end {frame}
Be careful not to forget the braces after the \uncover command .
The syntax is as follows :
\uncover <n>{...}
\uncover <n-m >{...}
\uncover <p>{...}
Displaying and hiding text in slides : the \only < n-> , \only < n - m > and \only < p > commands
\only works like \uncover with the exception that the \only command is not as " cumbersome " on slides .
Here is an example :
\begin{frame}
\only <2->
{appear from slide 2 on\\}
\only < 3- 4 >
{appears from 3 to slide 4\}
\only < 4 > {appear on slide 4\\}
\only < 3->{ appear from slide 2 on\\}
\end {frame}
Here is an other example to better grasp the difference between \only and \uncover
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Language used by Beamer : L\uncover <2->{A}TEX
\item Language used by Beamer : L\only <2->{A}TEX
\end{itemize}
\end {frame}
Hide text in slides : the \ invisible < n > commands
\invisible <n> makes text invisible on slide n
\begin{frame}
\invisible < 2> { This text will be invisible on slide 2 , but not on others slides}\ \
This text is always visible\ \
\uncover <1->{Beamer} \uncover <2-> {is} \uncover <3->{super} \uncover <4->{powerful}
\end {frame}
Another alternative : the \alt <n>{...}{...} commands
As an alternative , one can use the \alt {...}{...} command on a slide .
The first argument is the value on slide n .
The second is for values other than n .
Here is an example :
\alt <3 >{I am on slide 3\\} {I am not on slide 3\\}
\only <2->
{appears from slide 2 on\\}
\only < 3- 4 >
{appears from slide 3 to slide 4\\}
\only < 4> {appears on slide 4\\}
\only < 3-> {appears from slide 3 on\\}
Highlighting text in red : the \alert <n>{...} command
To highlight text in red on slide n , we use the \alert <n >{...} command .
\alert <1>{This text} \alert < 2> {is} \alert < 3> {red}
Successively highlighting list items in red : the <+-| alert@ +> command
\begin{itemize}
\item <+-| alert@ +> Robert De Niro
\item <+-| alert@ +> Brian De Palma
\item <+-| alert@ +>
Gerard Depardieu
\item <+-| alert@ +>
Tux
\end{itemize}
Using colors in a text on a slide : the \color <n->{...}{...} , \color <n - m >{...}{...} and \color <p >{...}{...} commands
The first argument is the red , green , yellow , blue , etc ...
The second is the text to be colored
Some colors ...\\
\color <2>{green} {Green color\\}
Great !!!
Creating links : the \hyperlink {...}{\beamergotobutton {... }} commands
To define internal links , we should add the following package in the preamble
\usepackage {hyperref}
Then , we should define a label pointing on the frame :
\ begin{frame}[label=MY_LABEL ]
The link will point to this frame
\end {frame}
you define MY_LABEL as you please !
Finally , on the frame where the link is to be created , we proceed as follows :
\hyperlink {MY_LABEL}{\beamergotobutton{Refer to this page}}
There we are !
We can see a button Refer to this page pointing to the frame labeled MY_LABEL .
Thus , the first argument of \hyperlink {... }{\beamergotobutton {... }} is the name of the label to be pointed at and \beamergotobutton {...} has the name of the button as an argument .
Defining blocks inside frames
For important stuff , we define blocks as follows :
\begin{block} {Block title}
This is a block in blue
\end{block}
\begin{alertblock} {Alert - block title}
This is a block in red
\end{alertblock}
\begin{exampleblock} {Example - block title}
This is a block in green
\end{exampleblock}
As clear as onion soup !!!
Dynamic display of tables : the \pause and \onslide <n-> commands
First off , we should add the package colortbl to the preamble
\usepackage {colortbl}
To display rows dynamically , we shall use the \pause command as follows :
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
Class & A & B & C & D \\\hline
X & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \pause\ \
Y & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \pause\ \
Z &5&6&7&8
\end{tabular}
To display columns dynamically , we shall use the \onslide <n-> command as follows :
\begin{tabular}{lc<{\onslide<2->}c<{\onslide<3->}c<{\onslide<4->}c<{\onslide}c}
Class & A & B & C & D \\
X & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
Y & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
Z &5&6&7&8
\end{tabular}
Writing on several columns : the \begin{columns} ... \end {columns} commands
For two columns , we proceed as follows :
\begin{columns}
\ begin{column}[l ] {5cm}
First column
\end {column}
\ begin{column}[r ] { 5cm}
Second column
\end {column}
\end {columns}
l , r , c refers to the position : left , right , center .
The syntax is as follows :
\begin{columns}
\ begin{column} [ position ] {column width}
...
\end {column}
\ begin{column} [ position ] {column width}
...
\end {column}
\end {columns}
Inserting a figure in a Beamer presentation
To insert an image or a figure , we proceed as in LaTeX by using the \includegraphics command .
Here is an example :
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics [ options ]{path_to_image}
\end {figure}
In Beamer , we should distinguish between two types of figures :
PS type : .eps , .ps and pspicture type ( LaTeX )
General type : .pdf , .png , .jpg , .jpeg
You will need to compile a Beamer - class file .
Compiling a Beamer presentation
I assume that the your file is called file .
tex ..
There are ways to compile , depending on the type of figure you inserted .
For PS - type figures , we shall use the following commands
$ latex file .
tex
$ latex file .
tex
$ dvips file .
dvi
$ ps2pdf file.ps
We shall obtain the file file .pdf .
For general - type figures , we shall use the command
$ latex2 pdf file .
tex
$ latex2 pdf file .
tex
We shall also obtain the file file .pdf .
Conclusion
It goes without saying that explaining all the possibilities that Beamer offers is way too long .
This is why I am referring to this exhaustive documentation documentation .

DAMASCUS , Syria , Dec. 18 ( UPI ) --
Archaeologists have dug up a large ancient cemetery in the middle of the Syrian desert , providing a glimpse into life and death in the 19th century B.C .
The necropolis discovered near the Syrian oasis of Palmyra about 125 miles northeast of Damascus , has at least 30 large burial mounds , ANSA reported Wednesday .
Advertisement
'' This is the first evidence that an area of semi- desert outside the oasis was occupied during the early Bronze Age , '' said team leader Daniele Morandi Bonacossi of Italy 's Udine University , who believes the burial site dates from the second half of the third millennium B.C .
'' Future excavations of the burial mounds will undoubtedly reveal information of crucial importance . "
The team of Italian and German experts , which concluded its 10th annual excavation in central Syria in late November , found the elaborate cemetery along a stretch of an old Roman road marked with stones bearing Latin inscriptions with the name of the Emperor Aurelius , who put down a rebellion led by the Palmyran queen Zenobia in 272 A.D.
The discovery includes a Roman staging post that was perfectly preserved by a heavy layer of sand .
The group 's digs began 1999 , revealing a sprawling complex dubbed the Royal Palace .
This year 's work uncovered an even larger building being called the Eastern Palace .
'' This discovery is not just exceptional for the imposing nature of the building itself , comprising at least 25 individual rooms around a large courtyard , but also for the period in which it was built , ' Morandi Bonacossi said .
'' Until now , there had been no indications that buildings of that size existed in Qatna yet this one appears to have been in use for around 500 years , '' he said .
Qatna was once a powerful trading city .
Over a weekend , word leaked out that AIG is paying yet more retention bonuses .
This move is making a complete and utter sham of the supposed punitive elements of the rescue .
But clearly , there was not enough of an adverse reaction to the earlier announcements of retention bonuses to deter the giant insurer .
A few Congressmen saying bad things has n’t put a dent exhorbitant CEO pay , so why should it be more effective here ?
Some readers have written in to say they have friends or family at AIG who had worked very hard for many years and continued to work hard , and deserved better .
I hate to say it , but the party line on capitalism is that the participants are supposed to bear both risk and reward .
Top people at AIG were very well paid just on a cash basis .
Yes , it is sad if savings in the form of stock holdings are wiped out , but the government is not supposed to be in the business of saving private enterprise from its bad decisions .
There were hardworkng people at Enron and Bear who were not at all culpable in the demise of those firms , but they had their savings wiped out .
I have a hard time understanding why anyone at AIG is deserving of any more than what a top government official would earn .
The ONLY argument I have heard is from David Merkel , that for certain types of business , it would be hard for a newcomer to get up to speed on the existing book of business .
But are there as many people like that as are getting retention bonuses ?
And more to the point , those people are as often likely to be rank and file , are they not ?
Sorry , but this pattern looks like abuse to me , pure and simple .
And perhaps most important , AIG planned to keep these bonuses secret .
That alone strongly suggests they do not pass the smell test .
They are living on government life support and have the nerve to lie by omission about what they are doing with senior level compensation .
From Bloomberg ( hat tip reader Glen ) :
American International Group Inc. , the insurer under fire for paying 168 executives not to quit after a government takeover , is giving retention awards to at least 2,000 more employees , according to a person familiar with the matter .
The “ retention bonus ” equals as much as a year ’s salary and recipients were ordered to keep the payment secret , said the person , who declined to be named because the plan was labeled confidential .
Awards were offered to as much as 10 percent of staff at businesses that are for sale , including plane - leasing and insurance units in the U.S. and overseas , the person said .
AIG said in September that 130 executives will get awards , just days after the New York - based firm got a government rescue package that now totals $ 152.5 billion .
AIG Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy told Congress last week the payments will go to 168 people , with some getting as much as $ 4 million .
“ If it has the money to give these disguised bonuses to thousands of its employees , then I think it is time for Mr. Liddy to write a check to the federal government repaying the money it took , ” said Representative Elijah Cummings , a Maryland Democrat , in a statement yesterday .
Nicholas Ashooh , an AIG spokesman , said life insurance unit chiefs were allowed to give retention awards to as much as 10 percent of their staffs , and selected “ closer to 7 or 8 percent ” of workers .
There are about 37,000 employees in AIG life units around the world , Ashooh said .
A typical payment is equal to about six months of salary , he said … .
Yves here .
There is nothing so arcane about life insurance ( in contrast , say , to reinsurance ) that the employees would be in possession of such special knowledge or skills as to make them irreplaceable .
Back to the story :
Units that AIG is trying to sell employ about 70,000 people , which means that as many as 7,000 could receive payments , the person said .
Cummings said he felt deceived by the company .
“ Liddy told me in writing that his company was awarding 168 retention payments , ” he said .
“ There is no way around that figure .
I cannot imagine Mr. Liddy accidentally overlooking a few thousand employees targeted to receive these funds . ” ….
The insurer requires recipients to keep the payments confidential , according to a contract obtained by Bloomberg News .
Exceptions included financial and legal advisers , as well as immediate family .
If awardees tell other outsiders about the existence of the program , they will forfeit future payments , the contract says … .
Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari , who supervises the U.S. financial rescue program , has called some of AIG ’s bonuses “ excessive for a failing institution . ”

When the Bush Adminstration , dispenser of financial institution handouts , voices disapproval , you know things are out of hand .

Documents reveal how Ohio routed 2004 voting data through company that hosted external Bush Administration email accounts Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 31 , 2008
Print This Email
This Newly obtained computer schematics provide further detail of how electronic voting data was routed during the 2004 election from Ohios Secretary of States office through a partisan Tennessee web hosting company .
A network security expert with high - level US government clearances , who is also a former McCain delegate , says the documents  server schematics which trace the architecture created for Ohios then - Republican Secretary of State and state election chief Kenneth Blackwell  raise troubling questions about the security of electronic voting and the integrity of the 2004 presidential election results .
The flow chart shows how voting information was transferred from Ohio to SmarTech Inc. , a Chattanooga Tennessee IT company known for its close association with the Republican Party , before the 2004 election results were displayed online .
Information technology expert Stephen Spoonamore believes this architecture could have made possible a KingPin or " Man in the Middle " ( MIM ) attack -- a well - defined criminal methodology in which a computer is inserted into the network of a bank or credit card processor to intercept and modify transactions before they reach a central computer .
In an affidavit filed in September , Spoonamore asserted that " any time all information is directed to a single computer for consolidation , it is possible that single computer will exploit the information for some purpose .
...
In the case of Ohio 2004 , the only purpose I can conceive for sending all county vote tabulations to a GOP managed Man - in - the - Middle site in Chattanooga before sending the results onward to the Sec. of State , would be to hack the vote at the MIM . "
Not everyone agrees .
RAW STORY also sent the schematics to computer science professor David L. Dill , a longtime critic of electronic voting machines .
In an email message , Dill said hes skeptical that an attack of the sort described by Spoonamore could have been carried out undetected .
" It seems that the major concern is whether routing election results through a third - party server would allow that third party to change the reported election results ,  Dill wrote .
 These diagrams have n't answered my basic question about that idea .
The individual counties know the counts that they transmitted to the state .
If those results were altered by the state or a middleman , I would think that many people in many counties would know the actual numbers and would raise an alarm . "
Spoonamore has now filed a fresh affidavit ( pdf ) , in regard to a case involving alleged Ohio vote tampering , which asserts that the schematics support a " Man in the Middle " attack having been implemented in Ohio in 2004 .
Ohio provided the crucial Electoral College votes to secure President George W. Bush 's reelection .
" The computer system at SmartTech had the correct placement , connectivity , and computer experts necessary to change the election in any manner desired by the controllers of the SmartTech computers , " Spoonamore wrote in the affadavit .
" Overall , my analysis of the two Architectures provided is the following ,  he added .
" They are very simple systems .
They are designed for ease of use during the one of two times a year they are needed for an election .
They are not designed with any security or monitoring systems for negative actions including MIM or KingPin attacks .
These systems as designed would not be sufficient for any banking function , credit card function , or even or many corporate email systems needing a high degree of confidence .
They are systems which will work easily , but are based on a belief all users and the system itself will be trusted not to be hacked . "
He continued , " There are obviously many parties willing , with motivation , and able to hack an election for a desired outcome . "
Inconclusive Evidence ?
Dill told Raw Story the schematics are inconclusive and that he continues to have questions after reading Spoonamore 's latest affadavit , although he cautioned that he himself is not an expert in Spoonamore 's specialty of network security .
" Basically , the whole thing seems highly speculative , " Dill said .
" It 's important to distinguish ' possible ' from ' probable ' here .
I do n't even know if this is possible .
More details about how the tabulators worked in those particular counties , who was managing them , how the results were uploaded , whether they were all the same kind , etc. would help establish that . "
" As to ' probable ' -- I do n't think that 's been established at all , unless one starts with the presumption that the election was stolen and works backwards from there , " he added .
" I do n't think Spoonamore has made the case that SmartTech and Triad '.. reversed the outcome of the 2004 Ohio Presidential Race . '
I do n't know that it DIDN 'T happen , but , at this point , I think we need to demand better evidence . "
" Neither I nor Spoonamore have any special knowledge on exit polls or Ohio voting patterns in judicial races , " Dill continued .
" I 'd urge you to take a close look at what skeptical political scientists have written .
It 's been a long time , but I was left with the impression that proof was lacking . "
RAW STORY has posted the schematics here for 2004 and here for 2006 .
The Connally Anomaly Spoonamore notes that on election night in 2004 , he observed what he calls the " Connally anomaly , " in which eight Ohio counties that had been reporting a consistent ratio of Kerry votes to Bush votes suddenly changed at about 11 pm and began reporting results much more favorable to Bush .
Election tallies in these counties , plus a few others , also showed the unlikely result of tens of thousands of voters choosing an extremely liberal judicial candidate but not voting for Kerry .
Spoonamore immediately suspected that a Man in the Middle attack had occurred but had no idea how it could have been carried out .
It was not until November 2006 that the alternative media group ePluribus Media discovered that the real - time election results streamed by the office of Ohio's Secretary of State at election .sos.state.oh.us had been hosted on SmarTech 's servers in Tennessee .
" Since early this decade , top Internet ' gurus ' in Ohio have been coordinating web services with their GOP counterparts in Chattanooga , wiring up a major hub that in 2004 , first served as a conduit for Ohio 's live election night results , " researchers at ePluribus Media wrote .
By then , SmarTech had become embroiled in the White House email scandal , during which it was discovered that accounts at rnc.com , gwb43.com , and other Republican Party domains which were hosted by SmarTech had been used by White House staff , , instead of their official government email accounts , to avoid leaving a public record of their communications .
When subpoenaed by Congress , the White House said the emails had been accidentally deleted .
Remaining Questions
Dill further noted after examining the schematics , " The 11/02/04 diagram has several computer icons in the upper left for EN Results entry of various types .
I do n't know how this works , but given that counties are using different software to prepare their totals , I suspect the data is entered by hand into web forms or that spreadsheets are uploaded .
Such an entry method would not easily lend itself to corrupting the original data .
...
Even if data can be changed at the county servers , many pollworkers and possibly others know the results that were reported from their precincts , and someone would probably notice if the numbers reported by the county or state differed from those . "
Dill said it would be helpful to have more information regarding the computers used and how they were connected .
" It would be a great idea to get some more definitive information about how the computers were connected and run in those counties , " he wrote .
" Messing with disks might help cover up evidence after the fact .
But the first thing that had to happen was that county - level results had to be changed in such a way that no one could compare the precinct results with the announced totals . "
Spoonamore said tampering could have been accomplished without broad knowledge .
Some have said " that local County Elections officials had been instructed to fax final results to confirm them , but this action would not have mattered if the local elections boards computers were already under the control of the KingPin , " he wrote .
He said the ultimate results faxed to the Secretary of State from Ohio counties could have been inserted by SmarTech , providing " a smokescreen " that would " mask the already hacked results and provide an illusion the tabulators were not reporting results over the Internet . "

Topic : Political CorrectnessSource : Spiked OnlineIn today 's culture wars , the future of the republic itself is at stake .
Historically , US presidential elections were dominated by competing views on economic and social issues .

This approaching election has increasingly been consumed by a cultural conflict , at the heart of which is a war over American history .
But this is no mere disagreement over the precise details of what happened three or four centuries ago .
It is a battle for the very soul of the United States .
The principal battle is being fought over the founding of the US .
As we will see , this is best captured , by , on one side , the New York Times ’ 1619 Project , which contends America was founded when African slaves first arrived in Jamestown ; and , on the other , President Donald Trump ’s mooted 1776 Commission , which reasserts the traditional , would - be inspiring narrative of revolution and independence as America ’s founding moment .

Global warming is n't just a threat to polar bears in the rapidly warming Arctic , a new study says : Species in the tropics are beginning to feel the effects as well , and it will only get worse .
Researchers surveyed more than 1,900 species of plants , insects , and fungi in a Costa Rica rainforest and came to the troubling conclusion that if world temperatures continue to rise as predicted over the next 50 years , half of those species will have to move to completely new territory to find an appropriate habitat .
The situation is complicated for tropical species , says lead researcher Robert Colwell ; shifting north or south does n't bring significantly lower temperatures , so species will have to take up residence at higher altitudes to survive .
In the absence of mountainsides to serve as a cool refuge , those plants and insects that cannot face higher temperatures may disappear as it would require migrations of hundreds or even thousands of miles to find a suitable cooler climate — crossing habitats utterly changed by human impacts .
" For lowland tropical species whose geographical range lies far from mountains , for example in the middle of the Amazon , " Colwell says , " the prospect for extinction cannot be dismissed " [ Scientific American ] .
The report , published in Science [ subscription required ] , suggests that the treasured biodiversity of rainforest may be just as endangered as the icy splendor of the Arctic .
Many of the insects and plants inhabit narrow ranges , and Colwell argues that some species
will have to move their ranges as much as 2,000 feet higher if the climate heats up by as much as 6 degrees , and that will put them into wholly new environments facing competition that evolution has n't equipped them to face ....
At the same time , species already living near [ mountaintops ] will find themselves with nowhere higher to move [ San Francisco Chronicle ] .
Some experts disagree with his assessment , says Colwell , because of the region 's ancient history .
" The current conventional wisdom even among scientists is that tropical species will be OK despite global warming because in ancient times -- 5 to 50 million years ago -- the climate was warmer and there were tropical forests , " he said .
" We argue this is not so clear .
That there needs to be much more research done to see if this is the case , " he said [ Reuters ] .
And while researchers are busy figuring this out , Colwell suggests that it would n't be a bad idea to protect tropical mountainsides from development , just in case some species are looking for a new home .

A study in today 's Pediatrics says it 's a distinct possibility .
The study is the first to draw a direct link between sexual content on TV and the likelihood that teens who watch it will become parents .
Researchers examined survey data from about 2,000 teens .
They plucked out 23 popular shows and asked how much teens watched each .
They coded the replies to established indicators of sexual content for each show — everything from nudge - nudge jokes on network sitcoms to full - blown intercourse on steamy cable dramas .

What they found :
By age 16 , teens who watched a lot of sexually charged TV were more than twice as likely to be pregnant or father an out - of - wedlock baby as teens who watched very little : 12 % vs. 5 % .
The gap holds steady through age 20 .
Researchers controlled for parents ' race , income and education and teens ' total TV time .
Previous studies have linked sex on TV to earlier initiation of sex ; this is the first to link TV sex to pregnancy .
" I do n't find it surprising , " says Jane Brown , who studies media and adolescent health at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
Most teenagers watch about three hours of TV a day , so the likelihood that they 'll encounter sexual content is high .
" It 's a cumulative effect , " she says .
" It 's probably not any one portrayal that makes the difference , but it 's a consistent , and now unhealthy , sexual script that adolescents do see as a depiction of appropriate behavior . "
Psychologist Dave Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family sees parents " delegating sex education to Hollywood . …
If I 'm a 15 - year - old kid and no one 's really talking to me about sex and I 'm watching a lot of sex on TV , it 's not a direct , conscious decision — but over time I start to think , ' That 's what people do .
That 's the norm . ' " Lead researcher Anita Chandra of the Rand Corp. says even sex talk has an effect .
If a child is watching more than just an hour of TV a day , she says , he is getting " a pretty substantial amount of exposure " to sex .
Brown says most TV shows portray sex as having few life - altering implications , such as pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases .
She calls it a dearth of the three Cs : commitment , contraceptives and consequences .
Even a tame sitcom joke takes a toll , she says .

Paul Krugman calls for Obama and his advisors to push an expanded version of the New Deal ( see the link below by Mark R. Hatlie ) .
According to Krugman , they should boldly throw caution to the winds and Obama should reject this advice .
If he listens to Krugman , the likely result will be a wave of stagflation that makes the experience of the 1970s look mild by comparison .
Such a prescription would both continue and accelerate Bush ’s fiscally reckless policy of propping up malinvestments through massive increases in spending , deficits , and easy credit by the Federal Reserve .
As the continuing fall of the stock market and the rise of unemployment indicate , more bailouts and more “ shock socialism ” do not work .
Obama made a fatal mistake in failing to oppose the aptly described billionaire bailout .
This call for a hyper New Deal rests on a flawed view of history .
According Krugman , the only reason Roosevelt failed to bring recovery was because he spent too little , not too much .
At the same time , he tries to have it both ways by stating that the crisis of the 1930s would have been “ much worse ” without the New Deal .
A key problem with Krugman ’s analysis is that it does not adequately explain why the decade - long New Deal era depression lasted so much longer than previous depressions .
Prior to the 1930s , depressions ( as in the sharp and short downturn of 1921 and 1922 ) had typically lasted for two to three years .
The predominant anti-depression policy before Hoover and Roosevelt was to cut spending , balance budgets , and let prices , profits , and wages readjust to more sustainable levels .
Yet Krugman regards this older approach for curing depressions as “ much worse ” than the New Deal .
The logical implication of his argument is that the New Deal , modest as it was , would have made the Great Depression at leastshorter than previous downturns .
The fact that it did not stands as a stunning indictment of FDR ’s policies .
The unprecedented duration of the depression also represents an indictment of Herbert Hoover ’s approach .
This was because Hoover intervened too much not , as Krugman would have it , too little .
Krugman ’s article neglects the relevant point that Hoover had pursued a mini-New Deal from 1929 to 1933 via programs such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Federal Farm Board .
It was Hoover , not Roosevelt , who was the first president to reject the advice of the “ leave it alone liquidationists . ”
Instead of letting malinvestments ( or toxic assets in today ’s parlance ) readjust at a lower level , he desperately propped them up .
In great part because of Hoover ’s high wage policies , real wages were actually 12 percent higher in 1932 than in 1929 !
Meanwhile , of course , unemployment advanced to record levels as businesses saved on payroll costs by laying off workers .
Perhaps if Hoover had listened to the advice of the so - called “ liquidationists , ” the depression would have been over by 1931 .
More troubling , at least for opponents of war , is Krugman ’s dubious contention that The evidence does not support the view that that war was beneficial for the economy .
In a seminal article for the Journal of Economic History , Robert Higgs convincingly challenged the Keynesian theory of World War II as put forward by Krugman and others .
While unemployment disappeared during the war , it was hardly a step forward .
Moving men and women from the unemployment lines to the killing fields of Anzio did not represent economic progress in any meaningful sense .
During the war , Americans at home suffered from rationing , shortages , more accidents on the job , longer hours , and many other measures of economic deprivation .
Moreover , as Higgs points out , According to Higgs , genuine prosperity did not begin to return until the last months of 1945 and 1946 .
This prosperity occurred under a policy of reverse Keynesianism which included massive reductions in spending because of demoblization , rapid steps toward price decontrol , and scaled back deficit spending .
Higgs sums it up Obama 's best hope to bring lasting recovery is to let the economy go through a short , but sharp , readjustment .
He needs to remove the malivestments not , contra Krugman , perpetuate them .
Obama can faciliate this readjustment to a more sustainable level by cancelling the bailout , cutting spending , and pruning deficits .
Another worthy goal would be to dismantle the Federal Reserve which helped to create this mess through its easy credit policies .
Most of all , however , Obama should end our costly empire by closing down our overseas bases and bringing home the troops .
Only then , can we start to get our financial house in order and move towards genuine economic well being .

Have you joined my incredibly non-annoying , once - in - a - while email newsletter ?
This particular Twitter posting came back to bite the agency person from Ketchum ( New York office ) who made some unflattering remarks about Memphis this morning before he presented on digital media to the worldwide communications group at FedEx ( 150 + ) people .
Not only did an employee find it , they were totally offended by it and responded to the agency person .
The kicker is that they copied the FedEx Coporate Vice President , Vice President , Directors and all management of FedEx ’s communication department AND the chain of command at Ketchum .
Mr. Andrews , the Ketchum presenter , did not take into account that many FedExers are native Memphians and are feircely defensive of their city and their company .
If I interpret your post correctly , these are your comments about Memphis a few hours after arriving in the global headquarters city of one of your key and lucrative clients , and the home of arguably one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of business , FedEx founder Fred Smith .
Many of my peers and I feel this is inappropriate .
We do not know the total millions of dollars FedEx Corporation pays Ketchum annually for the valuable and important work your company does for us around the globe .
We are confident however , it is enough to expect a greater level of respect and awareness from someone in your position as a vice president at a major global player in your industry .
A hazard of social networking is people will read what you write .
Not knowing exactly what prompted your comments , I will admit the area around our airport is a bit of an eyesore , not without crime , prostitution , commercial decay , and a few potholes .
But there is a major political , community , religious , and business effort underway , that includes FedEx , to transform that area .
We ’re hopeful that over time , our city will have a better “ face ” to present to visitors .
James , everyone participating in today ’s event , including those in the auditorium with you this morning , just received their first paycheck of 2009 containing a 5 % pay cut … which we wholeheartedly support because it continued the tradition established by Mr. Smith of doing whatever it takes to protect jobs .
Considering that we just entered the second year of a U.S. recession , and we are experiencing significant business loss due to the global economic downturn , many of my peers and I question the expense of paying Ketchum to produce the video open for today ’s event ; work that could have been achieved by internal , award - winning professionals with decades of experience in television production .
Additionally Mr. Andrews , with all due respect , to continue the context of your post ; true confession : many of my peers and I do n’t see much relevance between your presentation this morning and the work we do in Employee Communications .
Let 's take two wealthy capitalists .
One has $ 10 million in tax - free municipal bonds which earn about $ 500,000 ( 5 % ) in low - risk , no - tax returns .
The second one has $ 10 million sunk into a small business with a payroll of 25 employees and a brick - and - mortar office - warehouse .
This " small business " generates millions in payroll and thus in payroll taxes , pays huge property taxes and sales taxes , and also generates tens of thousands of dollars in local government " junk fees " ( business licenses , parking permits , fire inspection fees , etc. etc . )
The municipal bond investor is unaffected by the recession / depression until such time as one of the local governments which issued the bonds he owns goes bankrupt .
He pays virtually no business or capital - related taxes .
Now let 's consider a third capitalist who has $ 10 million in boutique hedge funds .
Accounting legerdemain enables this capitalist to report much of his hedge - fund generated income as long - term capital gains , thus limiting his Federal taxes to 15 % .
He pays no business - related or payroll taxes , and does n't even pay any FICA ( Social Security ) taxes on his income .
Many will note that the buyer of municipal bonds is providing capital which is spent repairing roads and schools , etc. and thus this money is productively invested .
Others will claim the hedge funds might have provided capital to far - flung firms and thus " greased the wheels " of some distant productive enterprise .
Nice , but which capitalist is actually supporting his community with jobs and taxes ?
Only the small business owner .
Those investing in Muni bonds and hedge funds may support their local community via consumption ( eating out at restaurants , etc. ) or they may not .
They may be paying significant property taxes , or they may not .
The hedge fund investor certainly has placed his capital at risk ( a fact now painfully visible to all ) , but the gains were entirely private when compared to the " real business " funded by the second capitalist who created 25 jobs , paid immense sums in Social Security and Medicare taxes ( recall these are only paid on wages , not on rental or investment income ) , paid property taxes on his business facilities , etc .
Which capitalist do you want in your town ?
The wealthy investor who may or may not spend a dime locally , or the one who creates jobs and pays truckloads of taxes ?
Which one pays the most Federal taxes ?
The " real business " owner , of course .
Which one is most at risk ?
Some might claim the hedge fund investor , but the small business owner can also lose it all .
The real losers when the small business folds are the employees and the local community .
They did n't just lose a frequent customer at a fancy restaurant , they lost livelihoods and hundreds of thousands in tax revenues and " junk fees " paid only by real businesses .
Which capitalist is most benefitted by the U.S. financial and tax system ?
The ones investing in paper assets , of course ; their tax rates are the lowest , their risks are lowest and their flexibility is highest .
Which is the most productive ?
It can be argued that the original venture capitalists who invested in Apple Computer put their capital to extremely productive use .
Fine , agreed .
But how many hedge funds directly funded new enterprises via venture capital ?
Essentially zero .
How much of the Muni bond investors ' capital is actually at risk and funding new enterprises ?
Some new company may snare a local government contract to build a new school , but this sort of spending is not the same as backing Apple Computer 's launch .
Clearly , both kinds of investment are necessary , venture capital and municipal spending raised from the sale of tax - free bonds ; but where does small business , which generates 80 % of the jobs in the U.S. economy , fit into this picture ?
Some small firms are funded by venture capital , and others get local government contracts ; but what businesses receive long - term funding or contracts from hedge funds ?
All of this is to say that invested capital is not taxed equally , nor does it generate equal tax revenues or jobs in the community .
It seems rather obvious that the financial and tax structure of the U.S. punishes the most productive capital and rewards the least productive .
As long as this is the case , then we can expect the real businesses which actually generate most of the jobs and taxes to wither and die under the immense burdens placed on them while capital will flow to the low - tax , low - productivity forms of rentier non-entrepreneural " capitalism " favored by the U.S. tax laws and financial system .
Who 's paying for Medicare ?
Not the rentier capitalist ; his income is untouched because it 's not wages .
Who 's paying medical insurance for employees ?
Not the rentier capitalist ; he does n't need any employees to rake in a healthy low - risk , low - tax return .
" Get America working again . "
Nice , but with what money , when the advantages of low taxes accrue to rentier capital while entrepreneural capital pays full freight and faces staggering risks ?
How many will risk their $ 10 million in a real business with all its high risks , high taxes and high overhead costs ?
Why bother ?
Honestly , it 's much easier to sit at a desk at home and gather long - term capital gains ( which may or may not be productively invested ) or tax - free earnings than put up with the guff of real business .
And if this is the case , then who 's going to risk everything to hire people and " get America working again " ?
This is why I predict 30 million formal jobs will be lost in this Depression ; it 's no longer worth it in terms of risk / return to start businesses when everyone is sucking real businesses dry and leaving rentier capital lightly taxed and lightly regulated .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

TOKYO ( AP ) 
A magnitude 7 earthquake hit northern Japan on Thursday morning , triggering a small tsunami that apparently caused no damage , Japan 's Meteorological Agency said .
There were no reports of injuries .
The agency said the quake hit at 9:21 a.m. local time off the eastern coast Hokkaido , Japan 's northernmost island at a depth of about 12 miles .
A 4 - inch tsunami rippled at the shore about 35 minutes after the quake .
A warning had been issued for a 20 - inch tsunami along the eastern coast of Hokkaido and the northeastern coast of Japan 's main island of Honshu , then lifted about an hour later .
" There was some light shaking , but it was nothing major , " said Yukio Yoshida , a police spokesman in Hokkaido .
Authorities temporarily advised about 10,600 residents of Ofunato in Iwate Prefecture , about 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) northwest of Tokyo , to evacuate their homes , and ordered people to stay way from beaches throughout the region .
National broadcaster NHK showed footage of the coastal area , but there did not appear to be any damage .
The report said the force of the quake had not broken windows or knocked items from shelves .
Japan is one of the world 's most earthquake - prone countries , and experts believe Tokyo has a 90 % chance of being hit by a major quake over the next 50 years .
In 1995 , a magnitude - 7.2 quake in the western port city of Kobe killed 6,400 people .

The most recent edition of Newsweek confirms a few long - held suspicions about the National Security Agency 's controversial post - 9/11 surveillance activities — such as the identity of the Justice Department lawyer who first tipped off
The New York Times about the administration 's warrantless wiretapping and the basis for the internal showdown that led to a now - infamous face - off at the attorney general 's hospital bed .
It also provides a few new revelations — including the classified name of the program : " Stellar Wind . "
In a lengthy profile in the magazine 's December 22 issue , Michael Isikoff names Thomas M. Tamm , formerly an attorney with the Justice Department 's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review , as the ur- source of the earthshattering New York Times story that first revealed the existence of a secret program of warrantless surveillance authorized by the president in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
This is not the first time Tamm has been named as a potential source of reporting on the NSA program .
Indeed , Isikoff himself first did so over a year ago , in a Newsweek story describing an FBI raid on Tamm 's home .
It is , however , the first time that Tamm himself has spoken publicly about his role in the leaks , or discussed his reasons for coming forward .
Perhaps surprisingly , the man whose phone call ultimately led to the program 's exposure knew very little about it at the time .
Against the swelling blogospheric chorus calling for his head — or the quieter but more ominous federal prosecutors who may yet join the choir — Tamm can argue that he never disclosed any operational details of " the program , " which only a few ultra- insiders were familiar enough to call Stellar Wind .
After all , he did n't know any operational details .
Whatever specifics the Times got presumably came from one of the other dozen or so anonymous sources who spoke to the paper .
All Tamm knew was that something " did n't smell right " about an odd second track for wiretap requests that passed through his office — requests that could only be signed by the Attorney General .
When he started raising questions , a superior told him not to poke around — and that the " AG - only " program was probably illegal .
" I thought this [ secret program ] was something the other branches of the government — and the public — ought to know about , " Tamm told Newsweek , " So they could decide : do they want this massive spying program to be taking place ? "
Now , however , the magazine is able to describe Stellar Wind in at least rough outlines :
The NSA identified domestic targets based on leads that were often derived from the seizure of Qaeda computers and cell phones overseas .
If , for example , a Qaeda cell phone seized in Pakistan had dialed a phone number in the United States , the NSA would target the U.S. phone number — which would then lead agents to look at other numbers in the United States and abroad called by the targeted phone .
Other parts of the program were far more sweeping .
The NSA , with the secret cooperation of U.S. telecommunications companies , had begun collecting vast amounts of information about the phone and e-mail records of American citizens .
Separately , the NSA was also able to access , for the first time , massive volumes of personal financial records — such as credit - card transactions , wire transfers and bank withdrawals — that were being reported to the Treasury Department by financial institutions .
These included millions of " suspicious - activity reports , " or SARS , according to two former Treasury officials who declined to be identified talking about sensitive programs .
( It was one such report that tipped FBI agents to former New York governor Eliot Spitzer 's use of prostitutes . )
These records were fed into NSA supercomputers for the purpose of " data mining " — looking for links or patterns that might ( or might not ) suggest terrorist activity .
In a related article in the same issue , Newsweek confirms that , as The New York Times first reported last summer , it was this data mining program that provoked a near - mutiny within the Justice Department , culminating in a dramatic showdown at the hospital bedside of an ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft between then–White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and acting AG James Comey .
The data - mining component of Stellar Wind was first revealed by USA Today in 2006 , nearly five months after the initial Times story about warrantless wiretapping broke .
The wiretapping described by the Times came to be known as the " Terrorist Surveillance Program " — a term that seems to have been invented after the fact to allow officials to testify before Congress on the aspects of Stellar Wind that had been exposed without admitting to any of the activities that had n't yet come to light .
While the TSP purportedly involved recording the actual contents of American targets ' international communications , the data mining program cast a far broader net , sweeping in by the millions " the telephone numbers of callers and recipients in the United States , and the time and duration of the calls " as well as " the subject lines of e-mails , the times they were sent , and the addresses of both senders and recipients . "
This " metadata " dragnet purportedly sucked up the information equivalent of an Encyclopedia Britannica every four seconds .
With that much confirmed , we can speculate a bit as to what might have sparked the rebellion at Justice .
Though it is NSA wiretaps that have received the most attention , it seems that DOJ attorneys must have largely accepted the theory that the president 's inherent powers under Article II of the Constitution allowed him to ignore the requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act when it came to intercepting international communications .
But the data mining program appears to have had a much broader scope .
It was the legal justification for this data collection , cooked up by überconservative attorney John Yoo , that appears to have raised the eyebrows of his successor at the Office of Legal Counsel , Jack Goldsmith .
Newsweek declines to get into what it calls the " mind - numbing " specifics , but says that the nub of the rebellion at Justice stemmed from Goldsmith 's conclusion that the data mining program constituted " electronic surveillance " under the terms of FISA .
That suggests that Yoo 's analysis — of which Comey would later say " no lawyer reading that could reasonably rely on it " — had sought to somehow deny that such sweeping collection constituted electronic surveillance .
Yoo may have been reluctant to rely exclusively on the Article II trump when dealing with vast quantities of domestic communications between parties not even suspected of terror ties .
The question is how anyone could possibly make that claim with a straight face .
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has traditionally distinguished between protected " content " and constitutionally unprotected " non-content " information about communications .
The latter category would include most of the " metadata " swept up by the data mining program , but the Justice Department 's own computer search manual defines e-mail subject lines as " content , " as they routinely convey something about the " meaning or purport " of the communication .
In a way , though , that 's beside the point , because as George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr observes , FISA defines " content " far more broadly than the Fourth Amendment does .
Not only is " metadata " clearly included in the FISA definition of " content " whose interception constitute " electronic surveillance , " but the statute spells out specific " pen register " and " trap and trace " procedures by which intelligence agencies are to seek judicial approval to acquire such information , subject to less stringent standards than must be met for full - blown wiretaps .
Even if some clever way were found to circumvent the requirements of FISA , there 's the Stored Communications
Act , which explicitly makes it a crime to " knowingly divulge a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service ... to any governmental entity . "
So how could Yoo — or anyone — conceivably have argued that Stellar Wind did n't trigger FISA ?
One possibility is a very strange argument offered by George Terwilliger , a former deputy attorney general under George Bush Sr. A 2006 article on the data mining program that appeared in the conservative National Review quotes Terwilliger as follows :
" I think it 's fair to say that the statutes contemplate the transfer of this generic type of data much more on a case - by - case rather than a wholesale basis , " he says , meaning that the statutes call for a court order only in cases when the government is making a targeted request for information .
But , he adds , " I do n't see anything in the statute that forbids such a wholesale turnover . "
Terwilliger also happens to be Alberto Gonzales ' attorney and has been a prominent defender of the administration 's surveillance policies .
It seems entirely possible that the odd argument Terwilliger offered National Review might echo the justifications that his fellow Federalist Society member John Yoo developed while at OLC .
How might such an argument have worked ?
Here it 's necessary to look a bit more closely at FISA 's complex , overlapping definitions of " electronic surveillance . "
One way to trigger the definition is by " intentionally targeting " a " particular , known United States person " — no problem there if data was swept up indiscriminately and en masse .
Two other prongs of the definition cover the live , realtime interception of communications contents as they 're moving on a wire or through the air .
There 's precious little wiggle - room here , but it 's conceivable that the kind of " metadata " gathered in the data mining program could have been obtained from telecom records or from databases of e-mails stored on servers .
Communications contents that are n't " in motion " on a wire or radio wave might still be covered under FISA 's fourth catch - all definition of " electronic surveillance , " which essentially applies to any other use of a surveillance device to collect communications .
But that definition only applies in circumstances where someone enjoys a " reasonable expectation of privacy " in the information — the Fourth Amendment standard that , according to precedent , does n't embrace non-content " metadata . "
( Though that still leaves those pesky e-mail subject lines . )
Even if we bought this slightly sophistic line of reasoning — it's hard to explain why FISA includes an explicit procedure for obtaining pen register or trap and trace records if Congress believed such records were n't covered by the statutory definition — there would still be the problem of the Stored Communications Act .
That 's where Terwilliger 's unorthodox reading might come in :
The language of that law contemplates disclosure of records " pertaining to a subscriber to or customer " ( emphasis added ) .
Parse with tweezers and a microscope , and you might make the case that this should be read along the lines of the ban on " intentionally targeting " in FISA — a barrier to investigating some particular person , not on crunching the data in bulk .
Again , this is all speculation — the government is still fighting to block the release of any of the internal legal justifications of the NSA program written up by the OLC .
But the legal theory laid out here at least seems to fit the known facts about the program , the law , and the handful of public statements made by attorneys in the know .
And if this was the theory on which the administration relied ?
One could charitably say it might pass for clever in a high school debate round .
It would be deeply unsettling if it had passed for anything more in the halls of power .
A former British ambassador has been fined £ 118,000 for insider trading after he bought shares in a mining company he chaired while negotiating in takeover talks .
Richard Ralph , the former executive chairman of Aim - listed mining company , Monterrico Metals , was fined £ 117,691.41 by the Financial Services Authority , and his friend , the Belgian businessman Filip Boyen , received a £ 81,982.95 penalty for dealing in Monterrico 's shares on the basis of inside information .
Ralph , a former ambassador to Peru and governor of the Falklands , was also involved in the Mittal steelgate affair when he served as Britain 's ambassador to Romania .
His fine is one of the biggest the FSA has imposed on an individual for market abuse .
The biggest was a £ 750,000 penalty imposed on Philippe Jabre , a former managing director of hedge fund GLG Partners , in 2006 .
This year , the financial watchdog has issued two other fines for market abuse .
In January 2007 , Monterrico , which operates the Rio Blanco copper mine in Peru , was known to be in takeover talks with a Chinese mining consortium , but the details were confidential .
On the 28th of that month , Ralph , who was involved in the takeover discussions , asked Boyen to buy £ 30,000 worth of Monterrico shares on his behalf .
Over the next five days , the Belgian businessman , acting on the inside information provided by Ralph , bought Monterrico shares worth £ 30,533.59 for Ralph , and £ 77,162.05 worth of shares for himself .
After the company 's takeover was announced on February 5 , 2007 , Boyen sold all the Monterrico shares making a profit of £ 12,691.41 for Ralph and a profit of £ 29,482.95 for himself .
Margaret Cole , director of enforcement at the FSA , said : " This sort of self - serving behaviour by experienced business professionals has the potential to damage confidence in financial markets . "
She said both men cooperated fully with the FSA 's investigation , " and as such we were more lenient .
But for that cooperation , we would have seriously considered taking criminal proceedings . "
Their fines were reduced by 30 % under the FSA settlement discount scheme , as the pair 's " extensive cooperation " meant the investigation was resolved at an early stage .
Six years ago , Ralph was drawn into the controversy surrounding the attempt by Labour party donor Lakshmi Mittal , the steel tycoon , to take over Sidex , a Romanian steel plant .
The row was over a letter drafted by Ralph and signed by Tony Blair on behalf of Mittal .
The FSA has been criticised in the past for not being tough enough .
Earlier this year , it launched a probe into HBOS share moves , which was later dropped .
The FSA failed to find evidence that short - sellers spreading false rumours had driven down the share price by 17 % on a single day in March .
In the 1980s and 1990s , Bjarne Stroustrup designed implemented , and popularised the C++ programming language , which introduced object - oriented programming to the mainstream , and influenced numerous other programming languages , including Java , C# and Fortran 99 .
C++ remains the archetypal ‘ high level ’ computer language – one that preserves the features of natural , human language – and it is still used by millions of programmers today .
Many of the systems and applications of the PC and Internet eras were written in C ++.
For all this , the language has its detractors .
It has the reputation for being difficult to learn and use because of its large feature - set , and because Dr Stroustrup ’s design chooses not to enforce a single paradigm on developers , serious programming errors can sometimes be made , but not detected .
Bjarne Stroustrup and his family now live in Texas .
He was , for many years , a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs , ( where he still retains a link ) is now the ‘ College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science Professor ’ at Texas A&M University , near Houston .
He was born in Aarhus in Jutland , Denmark in 1950 .
He studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Aarhus before moving to Churchill College , Cambridge University to obtain his PhD in 1979 , studying under David Wheeler and Roger Needham .
He remains a member of the college .
His book ‘ The C++ Programming Language ’ is the most widely read book of its type and has been translated into at least 19 languages .
His later book ‘ The Design and Evolution of C++ broke new ground in the description of the way a programming language was shaped by ideas , ideals , problems and practical constraints .
In addition to his five books , Stroustrup has published over a hundred academic papers and has contributed to a number of newspapers and magazines .
He has received a litany of honours including being named as one of ‘ America ’s twelve top young scientists ’ by Fortune Magazine in 1990 and was recognized as one of the 20 most influential people in the computer industry in the last 20 years by BYTE magazine in 1995 .
Recently Bjarne was awarded the Dr Dobb ’s ‘ Excellence in Programming award ’ for ‘ advancing the craft of computer programming ’ .
We now award him the Simple - Talk accolade of ‘ Geek of the Week ’ .
RM :
“ Bjarne , given that our technological civilization depends on software why is most of it so poor ? ”
BS :
“ Hmmm .
If software was as bad as its reputation , we ’ll all be dead by now .
It is always easy and entertaining to tell a story of a disaster .
People feel competent , comfortable , and superior when describing other people ’s failures .
On the other hand , spectacular success is often hard to understand , to appreciate , and can – as it should – make us feel humble .
I can understand a crashed disk or a simple ‘ silly ’ programming error but it is much harder to imagine a million disks not failing for a month and the software that did n’t fail to make that possible .
I look at the Mars Rovers , the human genome project , and Google with awe .
So , much software is not just ok .
It ’s good from the point of view of its users .
Unfortunately , part of that success comes from an increased ability to craft functioning systems out of failing parts through layers upon layers of – largely redundant – internal checking and huge amounts of testing .
I would strongly have preferred to get to this point through clean , logical , comprehensible , well - analyzed structure , through design and implementation by professionals .
That would be safer and cheaper in the long run and certainly avoid the huge bloat we see today .
We would also be able to use simpler and less power - hungry hardware .
There are examples of this today – often high - end , high - reliability embedded systems – but the PC / Web bloatware dominates in volume and in people ’s perception of software . ”
RM :
“ Do you think education is the answer to developing better software and that somehow we get out from the ‘ we must do it first no matter how buggy it is ’ way of thinking ? ”
BS :
“ Education is part the answer , an essential part , but ‘ education ’ itself is not a solution .
We need an education for software developers that combine principles from science and engineering with practical skills .
Most likely , we will need several specializations , hopefully with a common base .
Unfortunately , I am not at all sure that the fields of computer science , software engineering , IT , whatever , are mature enough to agree on such a principled common base and specialisations .
I also suspect that such a degree would be a master ’s rather than a bachelor’s .
Currently , we have another problem : students often leave educational establishments with a set of skills that are seriously misaligned to what the industry needs .
We can argue that maybe industry should ask for something different , but there is a lot of hasty re-training and un-learning going on at the handover from education to industry .
I think this is really bad for both sides .
It discourages industry from relying on more than basic skills and puts an emphasis on tools and techniques that can be used by relatively unskilled labour .
Students know that and therefore pay less attention to higher - level skills and some of the best students chose what they perceive as more challenging fields , such as physics and biology .
It discourages professors , who then concentrate on work that does not directly relate to industry or join the scramble to build tools and processes to develop and maintain software with semi-skilled labour I do n’t think you have to be first with a product in a given field .
In fact , I suspect that typically the first product in a field fails as a slightly later product comes along with facilities – or stability – that allows it to appeal to a larger group of users .
Think of Simula , WordPerfect , Netscape , and AltaVista ( do you even remember those ? ) .
However , I do not think that we can delay and delay until a product reaches “ perfection . ”
My ideal model is something basically sound and potentially beautiful , made available early ( warts and all ) and then gradually improved over the years under real - world pressures .
The real - world pressures will improve a fundamentally sound product and make it better adjusted to real needs than we could make it from first principles .
Shipping “ no matter how buggy ” is something else – that ’s unethical and irresponsible .
What you ship has to at least deliver what it promises and have a design that allows it to grow to meet future challenges . ”
RM :
“ Do you think you would ever design a new language from scratch ? ”
BS :
“ Sometimes , I ’m tempted , but designing a language for real use is a decade ’s worth of work .
It requires a firm idea of what problem is to be solved and stable funding .
It ’s not something that fits the academic model and it ’s not something that has an obvious commercial payoff .
I doubt it will happen . ”
RM :
“ How soon after you created C++ did you see it start to take over the industry ? ”
BS :
“ The first real use of ‘ C with Classes ’ ( C++ ’s direct ancestor ) started 6 months after I began the project and then I saw steady exponential growth for a decade .
The use of C++ doubled every 7.5 months from 1980 to 1991 .
After that , I lost count , but the current ‘ best guesses ’ are in the three million C++ programmers range .
For most of the early years , I was simply too busy ( designing , implementing , writing , and providing support ) to observe what was going on .
C++ was not a project with plans , marketing budgets , and consumer surveys . ”
RM :
“ What ’s your opinion about the Microsoft implementation of C++ ? ”
BS :
“ It ’s getting very good actually both in terms of standard conformance and in code quality .
I use that – and other C++ implementations – weekly , if not daily .
I do n’t care much about the proprietary extensions such as / CLI ) , but it ’s their OS and their system interfaces , so my opinion is not really relevant .
It would be hard to meet their design aims significantly better .
For a language to be a systems programming language , it has to deal with real systems , rather than idealized abstractions .
However , I do wish that they had interfaced ISO standard C++ to .
Net through interface libraries .
I do understand why they did not ( think : generating meta data ) , but once you rely heavily on /CLI features , you no longer write portable or easy to port standard C++ , you write for a specific proprietary system .
To be fair : just about every implementation provider tries to lock in its users .
Apple ’s Objective C++ GUI is a nasty lock - in and deep in GNU C++ you find quite a few non-standard features .
Whenever I can , I prefer to deal with ISO standard C++ and to access system - specific features through libraries with system - independent interfaces . ”
RM :
“ Do you think C++ has become too ‘ expert friendly ’ ? ”
BS :
“ Yes .
In fact , I think that it was me who stuck that label on it – reflecting the old saying “ Unix is expert friendly ” – I said it to alert people to my view that the experts were getting too complacent and were not sufficiently sensitive to the needs of novices ( of all kinds ) , casual and occasional programmers – whatever you want to call people who want to use C++ well before they could become experts – and the many who do n’t need to or want to become C++ experts ; they are often quite happy being experts in some other field and just want to use C++ in support of that .
I tried to do something about that with C++0 x and had some success – not at must as I would have liked , of course , but enough that there is a large and powerful subset of C++0 x that ’s easier to learn , to use , and to teach than I could carve out of C++98 .
In particular , I ca n’t wait to be able to use the simpler , safer , and more flexible initialization mechanisms .
For example : for ( auto p = v.begin ( ) ; p!=v.end ( ) ; ++p ) cout << * p << ‘
’;
The auto says that the type of p is to be that of its initializer ( v.begin ( ) ) , so that I do n’t have to remember how to write the type of v’s iterator , say , vector : : iterator .
That ’s actually the oldest C++0 x feature by far ; I first implemented it in 1983 , but was forced to take it out for C compatibility reasons .
Now , with “ implicit int ” banned in both C++ and C , we can have this convenient notation .
Another example is variable length ( homogenous ) initialize lists .
In C++0 x we can write : vector greats = { “ Newton ” , “ Darwin ” , “ Archimedes ” , “ Bohr ” } ; And get a suitably initialized vector of 4 strings .
The list of small new features is long ( e.g. , see my C++0x FAQ ) , but they are designed to work together and with all other features of the language so that I hope people get to see them as generalizations rather than complications .
In particular , the { } initialization syntax can be used for every form of initialization : void f( const vector > & v ) ;
f({ { “ Simula ” , 1967} , { “ BCPL ” , 1967} , { “ C ” , 1978} , { “ C++ ” ,1985} } ) ; struct Point {
int x , y ;
Point ( int xx , int yy ) : x{xx} , y{yy}
} ; Point * p = new Point{x , y} ;
If you feel this is not sufficiently advanced to warrant attention and need some really hard technical stuff , you can have a look at the C++0 x machine model .
If you feel that real language design needs a heavy dose of type theory , have a look at the concepts and concept_maps used to control template arguments .
The area where C++ is still not sufficiently supportive of novices is libraries .
There are lots of libraries for people who are experts , for people who can search out libraries on the web , and for people who can afford commercial quality libraries .
However , there is no one place to which a “ novice ” ( of any degree of previous experience ) can turn for a linear algebra library , a GUI library ( and builder ) , an XML manipulation and Web service toolset , a 3D graphics library , a computational geometry library , a concurrent programming support library , a set hard - real time programming facilities , etc .
All of these exist , but you have to search for them , chose among alternatives , download and install them , convince yourself about their quality , worry about the timescale of their support , etc .
Those are not tasks for which the average novice is well prepared .
My home pages are often a good place to start to look ( especially the C++ page and the applications page ) , but I can only feature links to a few collections of libraries , such as Boost , Poco , and Qt , and they do n’t all work together seamlessly .
C++0 x does provide a few new libraries , but not as many as I would have liked .
I particularly like to be able to use regular expressions ( the regex library ) and to use that library even when teaching my freshman ( first year ) students .
Finally getting standard and portable threads is a relief . ”
RM :
“ Why do you think C++ is so successful ? ”
BS :
“ It met its fairly modest design aims .
C++ was meant to be efficient in the hands of good programmers , capable of expressing elegant solutions to hard systems programming problems , suitable for work close to the hardware ( without compromises ) , to allow organization of code in the style of Simula ( object - oriented programming ) , to cope with the complexity of large systems , to fit into existing systems , to be portable across different hardware , operating systems , and linkers ( again in the hands of capable programmers ) , to be cheap ( no complicated run- time systems and fairly simple compilers ) , non-proprietary , and to be teachable on an industry wide scale .
That was actually not easy to achieve given the almost complete ignorance about object - oriented programming at the time and the extreme skepticism about the use of higher - level languages for systems programming .
When I started , it was less than 5 years since C and Unix had demolished the idea that an operating system had to be written in assembler for a particular piece of hardware . ”
RM :
“ In your well - read and well - written book The Design and Evolution of C++ , you claim that Kierkegaard was an influence on your conception of the language .
What do you mean by this ? ”
BS :
“ I wanted to say something about C++ ’s intellectual roots .
In particular , I wanted to state my opposition to the authoritarian system builders ( e.g. Plato and Hegel ) and emphasize my concern for the individual and the exceptional .
In that context , Kierkegaard fits right in .
Maybe referring to philosophers appears a bit pretentious , but I did read a fair bit of philosophy before I got too busy with computing and occasionally still do .
The human aspects of programming , software design , etc. are often overlooked – and when they are not , it is often by someone trying to shoehorn humans into an inhuman development process .
A “ process ” that does not recognize the enormous variations in human abilities is inhumane and suboptimal in that it fails to utilize the best in the people involved .
That does not imply that I ’m arguing for anarchistic “ cowboy programmers . ”
On the contrary , I ’d argue that a firmer foundation of programming addressing areas such as types , interfaces , resource management , invariants , underlying models , etc. is needed for less wasteful collaboration of many developers .
A rush to the lowest common denominator is not a great idea . ”
RM :
“ How do you think more programmers can write quality code ( as opposed to quantity ) and still keep their jobs ? ”
BS :
“ They have to be more effective than the popular million monkey approaches .
Worse , they have to be more productive over a variety of time spans : the first year , the first two years , the first five years , and the first ten years .
That means that it should be possible to replace the pioneers and not rely on exceptional talent and exceptional enthusiasm – in other words , the approach has to be a form of sustainable professionalism .
Where upper management sees it as a major aim to ensure that their software development and maintenance can be done primarily by semi-skilled and interchangeable individuals , getting to professionalism and quality code is an up - hill task ; where upper management is consistently supportive it ’s only difficult .
I think we have to base the necessary professionalism on classical computer science core areas such as algorithms , data structures , and machine architecture .
To this we have to add a notion of “ software architecture ” that must be more than simply showing off the features of a language or two .
We have to get into interface design , into invariants , applications of predicate logic , model checking , design for testing , systematic resource management and systematic error - handling strategies .
There is much material on these subjects , but not a coherent and widely accepted body of work supported by standard textbooks such as you find in other fundamental fields .
People are still stuck arguing language choice ( e.g. , C vs. functional vs. Java vs. domain specific vs. C++ vs. Python ) rather than techniques and principles .
I fear we have a lot of work still to do in this area – it is not easy to express and apply principles across languages .
What people have to do is to articulate principles for their languages of choice and try to see languages – any language – as an incomplete approximation to the ideals .
The old idea of re-use , of well - specified , well - tested components must be realized ( as far as our real - world constraints allow in a given situation ) .
Programming must come much closer to Math so that we can reason ( informally and formally ) about properties of a program .
There is hope , though .
We have come a long way since Doug McIlroy ’s original 1968 call for software components . ”

WEEKS after its own advisory board accused the Food and Drug Administration of failing to adequately consider research about the dangers of bisphenol - A , found in many plastic baby bottles , plastic food containers and metal can linings , the agency has agreed to reconsider the issue .
The F.D.A. ’s draft risk assessment in August , finding the chemical safe as it is now used , stood out against a tide of recent scientific opinion .
The National Toxicology Program , part of the Department of Health and Human Services , has said there was reason to be concerned that BPA , as the chemical is called , could harm the brain , behavior and the prostate gland in fetuses , infants and children .
Canada added the chemical to its list of toxic substances this year and has said it will ban BPA from polycarbonate baby bottles .
In September , a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that adults with high levels of BPA in their urine were more prone to heart and liver disease and diabetes .
More than 200 animal studies have linked ingesting minute amounts of the substance to a range of reproductive problems , brain damage , immune deficiencies , metabolic abnormalities , and behavioral oddities like hyperactivity , learning deficits and reduced maternal willingness to nurse offspring .

It 's not a dream or an imaginary story - The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan really is being sued by Batman over unauthorized use of the " Batman " name .
But before we all start celebrating the first proof that , as we all suspected all along , let 's face it , Bruce Wayne 's troubled crimefighter is actually real , I should explain : the " Batman " in question is actually a little - known a city in Turkey .
And they 're pissed .
You may never have heard of Batman , the city .
It 's in southeast Turkey , and the home to the country 's oldest oil refinery ( built in 1955 ) .
Despite that , though , they 're not having the greatest of times - Crime is up , as are suicides amongst women .
Also , like everywhere else in the world , they 're suffering from economic problems ... which is where Christopher Nolan comes in :
" The royalty of the name ‘ Batman ' belongs to us … There is only one Batman in the world .
The American producers used the name of our city without informing us , " [ Mayor of Batman city , Hüseyin ] Kalkan told the Doğan news agency ...
Mayor Kalkan , speaking to the Hürriyet Daily News and the Economic Review , said last year foreign media picked up on Batman and the city 's increasing suicide rates among women .
He said a columnist asked why Batman 's mayor did not sue the movie Batman for royalties while struggling with economic problems .
" We found this criticism right and started to look for legal possibilities of a case like that , " he said .

And so , Kalkan plans to sue not DC Comics , who own the character , nor Warner Bros. , who own DC Comics , but Christopher Nolan , director of The Dark Knight .
I 'd pretend that this would be a clash of the legal titans , but there 's no way that this is n't going to get laughed out of court immediately .
Which is almost a shame , really ; just imagine the " Holy Lawsuit ! Batman Goes To Court " we 'll miss .

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) was passed in 2000 to regulate the way that public bodies such as the police and the security services carry out surveillance .
Originally only a handful of authorities were able to use RIPA but its scope has been expanded enormously and now there are at least 792 organisations using it , including hundreds of local councils .
This has generated dozens of complaints about anti-terrorism legislation being used to spy on , for example , a nursery suspected of selling pot plants unlawfully , a family suspected of lying about living in a school catchment area , and paperboys suspected of not having the right paperwork .
Now those campaigning against the abuse of RIPA have got a new ally – Lady Manningham - Buller , the former head of MI5 .
In a speech in the House of Lords yesterday , she said she was " astonished " when she found out how many organisations were getting access to RIPA powers .
When RIPA was introduced … I assumed wrongly that the activities authorised by that legislation would be confined to the intelligence and security agencies , the police , and Customs and Excise .
The legislation was drafted at the urgent request of the intelligence and security community so that its techniques would be compatible with the Human Rights
Act when it came into force in 2000 .
I can remember being astonished to read that organisations such as the Milk Marketing Board , and whatever the equivalent is for eggs , would have access to some of the techniques .
On the principle governing the use of intrusive techniques which invade people 's privacy , there should be clarity in the law as to what is permitted and they should be used only in cases where the threat justified them and their use was proportionate .
Apparently she also raised a laugh when she told peers how to pronounce the acronym for the act .
" Those of us in the intelligence community call it ' Ripper ' , as in ' Jack the ' , and not ' Reaper ' , as in ' the Grim ' , " she said .
Artificial bone marrow that can continuously make red and white blood cells has been created in a University of Michigan lab .
This development could lead to simpler pharmaceutical drug testing , closer study of immune system defects and a continuous supply of blood for transfusions .
The substance grows on a 3 - D scaffold that mimics the tissues supporting bone marrow in the body , said Nicholas Kotov , a professor in the U - M departments of Chemical Engineering ; Materials Science and Engineering ; and Biomedical Engineering .
The marrow is not made to be implanted in the body , like most 3 - D biomedical scaffolds .
It is designed to function in a test tube .
Kotov , principal investigator , is an author of a paper about the research currently published online in the journal Biomaterials .
Joan Nichols , professor from the University of Texas Medical Branch , collaborated on many aspects of the project .
" This is the first successful artificial bone marrow , " Kotov said .
" It has two of the essential functions of bone marrow .
It can replicate blood stem cells and produce B cells .
The latter are the key immune cells producing antibodies that are important to fighting many diseases . "
Blood stem cells give rise to blood as well as several other types of cells .
B cells , a type of white blood cell , battle colds , bacterial infections , and other foreign or abnormal cells including some cancers .

Cancer - fighting chemotherapy drugs can strongly suppress bone marrow function , leaving the body more susceptible to infection .
The new artificial marrow could allow researchers to test how a new drug at certain potencies would affect bone marrow function , Kotov said .
This could assist in drug development and catch severe side effects before human drug trials .
Bone marrow is a complicated organ to replicate , Kotov said .
Vital to the success of this new development is the three - dimensional scaffold on which the artificial marrow grows .
This lattice had to have a high number of precisely - sized pores to stimulate cellular interaction .
The scaffolds are made out of a transparent polymer that nutrients can easily pass through .
To create the scaffolds , scientists molded the polymer with tiny spheres ordered like billiard balls .
Then , they dissolved the spheres to leave the perfect geometry of pores in the scaffold .
The scaffolds were then seeded with bone marrow stromal cells and osteoblasts , another type of bone marrow cell .
" The geometrical perfection of the polymer molded by spheres is very essential for reproducibility of the drug tests and evaluation of potential drug candidates , " Kotov said .
" The scaffold for this work had to be designed from scratch closely mimicking real bone marrow because there are no suitable commercially products .
" Certain stem cells that are essential for immunity and blood production are able to grow , divide and differentiate efficiently in these scaffolds due to the close similarity of the pores in the scaffold and the pores in actual bone marrow . "
The researchers demonstrated that the artificial marrow gives a human - like response to an infectious New Caledonia / 99 / H1N1 flu virus .
This is believed to be a first .
To determine whether the substance behaves like real bone marrow , the scientists implanted it in mice with immune deficiencies .
The mice produced human immune cells and blood vessels grew through the substance .

We know two things for certain .
One , that geeks / attention - seekers / psychos will misspend hours of their lives creating fake screenshots in an attempt to fool the internet and so give their otherwise pitiable lives purpose and meaning .
And two , that we 'll know these botched - up images are fake the second we see them .
Example A : Last week 's ridiculous Shadow of the Colossus 2 screenshot .
It reeked more of fabricated sham than the heartfelt sentiment spouted at a celebrity - packed awards ceremony .
And , predictably , despite it looking less authentic than a market - stall knock - off , the interwebs went mad over the shot , gifting its creator with the attention they so obviously crave .
Which is why we thought we'd gather together a bundle more of these gloriously false images , and wait for the rabid interest to come rolling effortlessly in our direction .
No , no , do n't thank us .
We 're just doing our job .

ASPEN , Colo . ( Fortune ) -- Palm Beach and New York may have been hardest hit by the Bernard Madoff scandal , but residents in Aspen , Colo. , are quietly tallying up massive losses .
The upscale resort community has a population base of under 6,000 , but reports over the past week reveal that dozens of residents have been undone by the $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme allegedly perpetrated by Madoff .
According to local asset managers and lawyers , these families have lost upwards of $ 1 billion .
Some have seen up to 95 % of their life savings disappear in the past few days -- both long - time locals and part - timers are affected .
Involved or not , residents of this wealthy community can talk of nothing else .
Everyone , it seems , knows multiple families who were crippled .
One very wealthy couple has already put their house on the market and moved in with their grown kids .
Then there 's the guy who smelled the recession coming , sold his expensive home here at the height of the market frenzy and , yes , invested it all with Madoff .
Today -- no home , no money .
Others speak with great pity of the widow who invested her husband 's life insurance money with Madoff only to find herself left without a penny .
Though no one was willing to divulge their name due to upcoming legal suits and the fear of being forced to return assets made through Madoff in earlier years , some did share their stories .
One couple who has lived in Aspen for 25 years was able to retire early with their small real estate business and their investments with Madoff .
Now , at ages 59 and 64 , they 'll have to go back to work and sell their home .
" It 's shocking , " admits the wife , who says they do n't have a real grip on things yet .
" The hardest part is this guilt feeling we can't shake .
But we 're tough and we 've been through a lot in our life .
We 'll hunker down and protect what we have . "
Selling their home will be no easy feat in a housing market that has grinded to a halt .
Home sales are down some 40 % , reports Chuck Frias of Frias Properties in Aspen .
The realtor says he is shocked by the number of residents who fell victim to the Madoff scandal - though he is hopeful that the fraud will have only a minor impact on local housing prices .
" Home prices have not dropped as much as you might think , " he said .
Another influential , full - time local family of 15 years , met Madoff on a week - long boat trip some 12 years ago and ultimately decided to invest millions .
The wife , who got skittish , pulled out her money years ago .
The husband will say only that he lost a " large sum of money . "
Fortunately the couple is wealthy enough that it wo n't change their lifestyle tremendously and they hope to salvage what they can through tax write - offs .
The biggest effect it will have on Aspen , they believe , is in the amounts given to local charities , already hit hard by the recession .
Barack Obama for President
Friday , October 17 , 2008 ; A24
THE NOMINATING process this year produced two unusually talented and qualified presidential candidates .
There are few public figures we have respected more over the years than Sen. John McCain .
Yet it is without ambivalence that we endorse Sen. Barack Obama for president .
The choice is made easy in part by Mr. McCain 's disappointing campaign , above all his irresponsible selection of a running mate who is not ready to be president .
It is made easy in larger part , though , because of our admiration for Mr. Obama and the impressive qualities he has shown during this long race .
Yes , we have reservations and concerns , almost inevitably , given Mr. Obama 's relatively brief experience in national politics .
But we also have enormous hopes .
Mr. Obama is a man of supple intelligence , with a nuanced grasp of complex issues and evident skill at conciliation and consensus - building .
At home , we believe , he would respond to the economic crisis with a healthy respect for markets tempered by justified dismay over rising inequality and an understanding of the need for focused regulation .
Abroad , the best evidence suggests that he would seek to maintain U.S. leadership and engagement , continue the fight against terrorists , and wage vigorous diplomacy on behalf of U.S. values and interests .
Mr. Obama has the potential to become a great president .
Given the enormous problems he would confront from his first day in office , and the damage wrought over the past eight years , we would settle for very good .
The first question , in fact , might be why either man wants the job .
Start with two ongoing wars , both far from being won ; an unstable , nuclear - armed Pakistan ; a resurgent Russia menacing its neighbors ; a terrorist - supporting Iran racing toward nuclear status ; a roiling Middle East ; a rising China seeking its place in the world .
Stir in the threat of nuclear or biological terrorism , the burdens of global poverty and disease , and accelerating climate change .
Domestically , wages have stagnated while public education is failing a generation of urban , mostly minority children .
Now add the possibility of the deepest economic trough since the Great Depression .
Not even his fiercest critics would blame President Bush for all of these problems , and we are far from being his fiercest critic .
But for the past eight years , his administration , while pursuing some worthy policies ( accountability in education , homeland security , the promotion of freedom abroad ) , has also championed some stunningly wrongheaded ones ( fiscal recklessness , torture , utter disregard for the planet 's ecological health ) and has acted too often with incompetence , arrogance or both .
A McCain presidency would not equal four more years , but outside of his inner circle , Mr. McCain would draw on many of the same policymakers who have brought us to our current state .
We believe they have richly earned , and might even benefit from , some years in the political wilderness .
OF COURSE , Mr. Obama offers a great deal more than being not a Republican .
There are two sets of issues that matter most in judging these candidacies .
The first has to do with restoring and promoting prosperity and sharing its fruits more evenly in a globalizing era that has suppressed wages and heightened inequality .
Here the choice is not a close call .
Mr. McCain has little interest in economics and no apparent feel for the topic .
His principal proposal , doubling down on the Bush tax cuts , would exacerbate the fiscal wreckage and the inequality simultaneously .
Mr. Obama 's economic plan contains its share of unaffordable promises , but it pushes more in the direction of fairness and fiscal health .
Both men have pledged to tackle climate change .
Mr. Obama also understands that the most important single counter to inequality , and the best way to maintain American competitiveness , is improved education , another subject of only modest interest to Mr. McCain .
Mr. Obama would focus attention on early education and on helping families so that another generation of poor children does n't lose out .
His budgets would be less likely to squeeze out important programs such as Head Start and Pell grants .
Though he has been less definitive than we would like , he supports accountability measures for public schools and providing parents choices by means of charter schools .
A better health - care system also is crucial to bolstering U.S. competitiveness and relieving worker insecurity .
Mr. McCain is right to advocate an end to the tax favoritism showed to employer plans .
This system works against lower - income people , and Mr. Obama has disparaged the McCain proposal in deceptive ways .
But Mr. McCain 's health plan does n't do enough to protect those who cannot afford health insurance .
Mr. Obama hopes to steer the country toward universal coverage by charting a course between government mandates and individual choice , though we question whether his plan is affordable or does enough to contain costs .
The next president is apt to have the chance to nominate one or more Supreme Court justices .
Given the court 's current precarious balance , we think Obama appointees could have a positive impact on issues from detention policy and executive power to privacy protections and civil rights .
Overshadowing all of these policy choices may be the financial crisis and the recession it is likely to spawn .
It is almost impossible to predict what policies will be called for by January , but certainly the country will want in its president a combination of nimbleness and steadfastness -- precisely the qualities Mr. Obama has displayed during the past few weeks .
When he might have been scoring political points against the incumbent , he instead responsibly urged fellow Democrats in Congress to back Mr. Bush 's financial rescue plan .
He has surrounded himself with top - notch , experienced , centrist economic advisers -- perhaps the best warranty that , unlike some past presidents of modest experience , Mr. Obama will not ride into town determined to reinvent every policy wheel .
Some have disparaged Mr. Obama as too cool , but his unflappability over the past few weeks -- indeed , over two years of campaigning -- strikes us as exactly what Americans might want in their president at a time of great uncertainty .
ON THE SECOND set of issues , having to do with keeping America safe in a dangerous world , it is a closer call .
Mr. McCain has deep knowledge and a longstanding commitment to promoting U.S. leadership and values .
But Mr. Obama , as anyone who reads his books can tell , also has a sophisticated understanding of the world and America 's place in it .
He , too , is committed to maintaining U.S. leadership and sticking up for democratic values , as his recent defense of tiny Georgia makes clear .
We hope he would navigate between the amoral realism of some in his party and the counterproductive cocksureness of the current administration , especially in its first term .
On most policies , such as the need to go after al - Qaeda , check Iran 's nuclear ambitions and fight HIV / AIDS abroad , he differs little from Mr. Bush or Mr. McCain .
But he promises defter diplomacy and greater commitment to allies .
His team overstates the likelihood that either of those can produce dramatically better results , but both are certainly worth trying .
Mr. Obama 's greatest deviation from current policy is also our biggest worry : his insistence on withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq on a fixed timeline .
Thanks to the surge that Mr. Obama opposed , it may be feasible to withdraw many troops during his first two years in office .
But if it is n't -- and U.S. generals have warned that the hard - won gains of the past 18 months could be lost by a precipitous withdrawal -- we can only hope and assume that Mr. Obama would recognize the strategic importance of success in Iraq and adjust his plans .
We also can only hope that the alarming anti-trade rhetoric we have heard from Mr. Obama during the campaign would give way to the understanding of the benefits of trade reflected in his writings .
A silver lining of the financial crisis may be the flexibility it gives Mr. Obama to override some of the interest groups and members of Congress in his own party who oppose open trade , as well as to pursue the entitlement reform that he surely understands is needed .
IT GIVES US no pleasure to oppose Mr. McCain .
Over the years , he has been a force for principle and bipartisanship .
He fought to recognize Vietnam , though some of his fellow ex-POWs vilified him for it .
He stood up for humane immigration reform , though he knew Republican primary voters would punish him for it .
He opposed torture and promoted campaign finance reform , a cause that Mr. Obama injured when he broke his promise to accept public financing in the general election campaign .
Mr. McCain staked his career on finding a strategy for success in Iraq when just about everyone else in Washington was ready to give up .
We think that he , too , might make a pretty good president .

Democratic presidential candidate , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , greets the crowd during a rally in Springfield , Mo. Saturday , Nov. 1 , 2008 .
Labor confronts race issue
Since Barack Obama gave a dramatic speech on the subject of race this spring , the issue has lingered over the election , a quiet , awkward factor that the candidates , their campaigns and their surrogates have brushed aside or would rather not talk about at all .
But there 's one place the " national conversation " Obama suggested in March is taking place : among white , Rust Belt union workers , who generally voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary .
Their leaders have led a large - scale , direct and under - the - radar conversation about some members ' discomfort with a black Democratic nominee .
Advertisement
" I think a lot of people expected when he made that speech about a national conversation about race that it would be formalized , " Gerald McEntee , president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , said in a telephone interview from Ohio .
" In the labor movements and unions and the way they are composed , it just became a reality .
“ Some of our own people had never experienced anything like this before , so the dialogue did take place , the conversation did take place , ” he said .
The older , largely industrial unions , members of the AFL - CIO , have emerged as key ambassadors for Obama to the parts of the country where he is weakest .
Those unions have , in the recent past , been dismissed by Democrats as fading powers — good for turning up some burly , white ethnic workers at campaign rallies , but shrinking and demoralized , and without the energy or organization of growing unions like the Service Employees International Union .
But for the first black nominee , white labor has proved a crucial bulwark of support .
The AFL - CIO unions have pressed a concerted and targeted effort that began in earnest in July , when Secretary - Treasurer Richard Trumka , a former Pennsylvania coal miner with a bushy mustache , delivered a speech to the United Steelworkers ' national convention in Las Vegas that many considered a key moment in the campaign to build cultural comfort with the Democratic nominee .
" A lot of good union people just can't get past the idea that there 's something wrong with voting for a black man .
Well , those of us who know better can't afford to look the other way , " Trumka told fellow labor leaders .
" I do n't think we should be out there pointing fingers in people 's faces and calling them racist .
Instead , we need to educate them that if they care about holding on to their jobs , their health care , their pensions and their homes ; if they care about creating good jobs with clean energy , child care , pay equity for women workers , there 's only going to be one candidate on the ballot this fall who 's on their side . "
The discussion Trumka opened has taken place in conversations between shop stewards and rank and file members , and in large - scale internal union campaigns .
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98 in Philadelphia , for instance , mailed out a plastic MP3 player to members that featured 60 minutes of local union workers and leaders offering testimonials on Obama 's commitment to labor .
" This election is not a personality contest , nor should it be about race .
So let 's talk about that and get it out of the way right now .
The fact that Sen. McCain is white and Sen. Obama is black should not matter .
Though I know for some of you it does .
You are not alone , " says Local 98 head John Dougherty , through a thick Philadelphia accent .
" Do n't let the color of a man 's skin prevent you from doing the right thing .
I know Barack Obama .
I know him to be a man of great character and conviction . "
Other unions have sent out DVDs to members with the same message .
" The last thing I 'm going to say to you is we can either have a black friend in the White House or a white enemy in the White House , " United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts , after laying out the case against John McCain ( opposition to " clean coal " ) says in a 17 - minute DVD mailed to 46,500 members in battleground states .
" Irrelevant side issues — whether race or some other diversionary concern — have nothing to do with our job security , workplace or work site rules , or the protection of Medicare and Social Security for our parents and loved ones , " Joseph J. Nigro , general secretary - treasurer of the Sheet Metal Workers International Association , wrote in his October newsletter , sent to every active and retired member , and accompanied by a DVD making the same case .
The umbrella federation , the AFL - CIO , can also reach millions of union voters — 2.1 million in Ohio alone — and their $ 250 million political operation has become increasingly sophisticated .
They ’ve focused on Ohio , Pennsylvania , Minnesota , Michigan and Wisconsin , AFL - CIO spokesman Steve Smith said .
“ The union programs for Obama are the firewall in those states , " said Smith .
" If we do our job , McCain does n't win any of those states .
If McCain does n't win any of those states , McCain does n't win the presidency . "
This cycle , they ’ve matched their member lists with other databases — “ microtargeting , ” it ’s called — to find the union veterans , retirees , and gun owners who might be skeptical of Obama , and sent them customized material and phone calls .
The mass mailings sent out by the AFL - CIO have dealt with cultural minefields by a two - pronged argument : affirm that Barack Obama is an American , and then point to the economy .
In late July , literature featuring pictures of union members and information on Obama 's belief in Jesus and America was mailed to 600,000 union households .
" Have questions about Barack Obama ?
See inside for answers , " it read .
The comfort campaign — along with Obama 's calm performance as the economy cratered — seems to have resonated .
In August , according to recently released AFL - CIO polling , Obama lead by 16 percentage points among Ohio union voters ; in October , he led by 29 points .
The media campaign has been supplemented by individual interactions .
The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers , for example , endorsed Obama during the primary .
First , the union president , Newton Jones , brought up the issue of race during a convention in April , which was spliced into a DVD that also featured Obama speaking to the union and was mailed to all the local lodges .
" Let 's be honest ; you look across this country and there are probably a lot of people that will support and vote for John McCain because he is simply a white male and that 's what we 've always done , " said Jones .
" There are many people across this country that will look at Barack Obama simply because he is a black male and this is historic .
" There are other factors and more important ones , in my view , that need to be considered , " he continued .
" I have to make decisions that are truly in the best interests of this union , our members , and this country with regard to what we see are the policies of the candidates .
" We then did 16 to 20 grass - roots training sessions where we went to key states , " said Bridget Martin , the director of government affairs .
Local leaders were given material and encouraged to talk with members concerned about Obama 's race .
" We then focused very heavily on one - to - one voter communication . "
Most of the union leaders Politico spoke to emphasized the economic message but acknowledged that they had to break through a cultural rift .
" Many voters have never voted for an African - American candidate for any position , " said AFL - CIO political director Karen Ackerman .
" It 's a proud moment in the labor moment in the last six months that there really has been discussion from the union presidents to local union officials to shop stewards on the floor . "

The Monday after Thanksgiving could be a bargain hunters ' heyday this year , and you do n't even have to leave the house .
Not to be outdone by the brick - and - mortar retailers '
Black Friday sales , online retailers will be offering deep discounts the following Monday , December 1 , a day that 's called " Cyber Monday . "
Last year , consumers spent $ 733 million on Cyber Monday , and it 's expected to be even bigger this year .
According to a survey by online shopping site Shopzilla for the National Retail Federation 's Shop.org , nearly 84 percent of online retailers plan to have a Cyber Monday promotion on December 1 .
That 's up from just 72 percent last year and zero percent in 2005 , says Shop.org executive director Scott Silverman .
( Silverman 's organization actually invented Cyber Monday in late 2005 as a gimmick to jump - start online sales in the holiday season .
The media soon hyped it , and while it's not the biggest online shopping day of the year , it has certainly caught on among e-tailers . )
And there is evidence to suggest that online retailers will be trotting out even sweeter deals this year to compete for their share of consumers ' 2008 holiday spending , although that spending is expected to be much smaller than last year , which set a record for online shopping .
" Retailers this year will be very aggressive pricing - wise and promotion - wise , " says TigerDirect VP of business development Bruce Matthews .
" Cyber Monday was the biggest day of the year for us last year - - bigger than Black Friday , " he adds .
I suggest visiting three types of sites -- Cyber Monday sites , tech retailer sites , and deal aggregation sites -- on December 1 to find the best prices .
Before Cyber Monday , check out GottaDeal.com , which posts " leaked " Black Friday and Cyber Monday ads from many online tech retailers .
Even better , you can also lurk at the site 's Forum to find out about newly announced Cyber Monday deals as they come in .
" I expect the online retailers to be sending an avalanche of info over the next 2 - 3 days and I 'll be adding everything to that forum for our members to discuss , " GottaDeal founder Brad Olson writes in an e-mail to PC World .
On the Big Day , stop by Shop.org 's CyberMonday.com which posts a load of information on , and links to , the day 's online deals .
Most Major Retailers Running Deals
You can also visit online retailers directly to get the deals straight from the horse 's mouth .
Here 's what we know so far about the discount plans of major online tech retailers for Cyber Monday :
NewEgg.com : A representative says NewEgg.com will indeed be running Cyber Monday deals , and that shoppers should sign up for the NewEgg newsletter to find out about the deals in advance .
Just type in your e-mail address at the site , and they 'll send you the tip sheet .
TigerDirect :
The company is not divulging brand names , but promises to have deals on HDTVs ( a 32 - inch HDTV for $ 450 , a 40 - incher for $ 700 ) , and on PCs , notebooks , GPS gear , cameras , printers , components , and more .
Tiger Direct 's
Matthews says customers will be saving anywhere from $ 100 to $ 300 on each deal .
BestBuy.com : A PR person tells me they 're planning a two - day Cyber Monday sale that begins Sunday .
Best Buy is n't divulging the details of the sale , saying only that it will offer free shipping " across several product categories . "
Overstock.com : A spokesperson says the company will be offering free shipping site - wide , special discounts on TVs , and an " extra 10 percent off " cameras and camcorders .
Dell.com : Dell will be holding a sale on home PCs and peripherals on December 1 , featuring PC's as low as $ 300 .
No further information is available until the day of the sale .
Staples.com :
The site will be offering deals on selected Envision HDTVs , Hewlett - Packard PCs , Xerox printers , Magellan GPS systems , Nikon digital SLR cameras , and numerous accessories .
Kmart.com : You 'll find TomTom and Magellan GPS navigation systems heavily discounted .
The site will offer free shipping on orders of more than $ 29 .
Target.com : A spokesperson says that Target.com will be offering free shipping on more than 60,000 products ( including some electronics ) , starting November 30 and ending December 13 .
Buy.com :
This site will have sales on at least one HDTV ( $ 1000 off one 52 - incher , brand unknown ) , and on GPS navigation systems and various PC peripherals , plus deep discounts on some printers .
For many of these items , it will throw in free shipping as well .
Check Out the Deal Sites
It 's a also good idea to check out a few deal aggregator sites on Cyber Monday .
Hundreds of these sites out are there now , but these are the ones I think do the best job with tech stuff :
Finally , A Little Advice
When bargain hunting on the Web for tech products ( or anything else ) , it 's very important to do your homework , not just to find the best prices out there , but to make sure that the " bargain price " you 're getting is based on a real -- and not an inflated -- list price .
Twenty - five percent off a list price that 's already been jacked up 25 percent is n't much of a deal .
For more information and tips on online tech shopping , see our Senior Editor Denny Arar 's take on the subject .
A lot of people will be getting up early and fighting the crowds at the mall for that special deal on Black Friday .
With everything you know now , you can spend Friday at home finishing off the turkey , and do your gadget shopping at work on ( Cyber ) Monday morning .
Click to viewWhen we listed The Dark Knight among the best science fiction films of 2008 , half of you asked why it was n't # 1 .
The other half wanted to know why it was science fiction .
Here 's why .

Batman exists in a universe full of science fictional elements .
Batman hangs out with aliens from the planet Krypton and Mars and the 30th century and the 5th dimension , and so on .
" But wait , " I hear you say , " that 's in the comics .
In the movies , Batman 's separated from that .
He 's a stand - alone character who 's never even heard of Beppo the Super - Monkey . "
It does n't matter .

Here 's the only question you need to ask yourself : is Batman a superhero ?
If the answer is yes , then he 's still connected to all that stuff .
Superheroes are more than capes and funny insignias - they 're part of a whole tradition of larger - than - life archetypes and tropes .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
You can't even look at Batman without seeing him as part of the superhero tradition .
You do n't question why he can jump off a tall building without going splat , even though he has no superpowers - because you 're used to superheroes .
( Yes , he 's got a sort of hang - glider thingy and a grappling hook line and stuff , but still .
It 's also just a convention of the superhero genre . )
Even when he's in a movie , Batman is still a comic - book character , and he 's still part of that fine comic - book tradition of mashing up noir vigilantes with aliens , wizards and giant robots .
It never occurred to comics writers to try and separate these genres .

The comics have frequently admitted as much - when Grant Morrison took over writing Batman , he had a scene where Batman opened up his " scifi closet " full of alien artifacts , weird future technology and other
toys .
You can strip all that away , but it creeps back in .
Okay , so you 're still not convinced ?
After all , Chris Nolan did such a great job of burning away all of the campy baggage that had glommed onto the Caped Crusader in the 1990s movies , and he explicitly tried to keep Bats more down to Earth .

The same thing happened in the comics , actually .
Starting in the late 1980s , then - editor Denny O'Neil decreed that Batman would exist in a slightly more realistic world than the rest of the DC Universe .
He kept Bats out of the Justice League , and even changed old stories to say that Batman had never been a Leaguer .
But the more grim and " realistic " Batman became , the more otherworldly elements found their way in .
Like the replacement Batman , Azrael , who turned out to be part genetically engineered monkey as well as part human .
( Please do n't ask me to explain Azrael 's origin .
It made my head hurt the first time . )
Or Dr. Shondra Kinsolving , who magically healed Bruce Wayne 's shattered spine with her mental powers .

Weirdly enough , one of the most grim and realistic - feeling Bat- comics from the O'Neil era is 1992's Batman Vs. Predator , written by Dave Gibbons and published in conjunction with Dark Horse .
It 's a harrowing story of Batman facing a superior foe he does n't know how to beat , and in the introduction to the trade , O'Neil explains how it fits in with his grittier , more grounded idea of Batman :
We generally put the planet - hopping variety of science fiction off - limits to Batman scripters ; Batman 's roots are in the dark myths — vampires , demons , were - creatures , ogres , all the shadow beings that creep from the nether side of the human psyche .
Rocket ships and Batman are not a good mix : our Caped Crusader may use technology — he has to , to be a credible crime - fighter in the twentieth century — but he is not of technology ; it has nothing to do with what he is .
And it has nothing to do with what the Predator is , either .
Take a look at him and then search your memory for predecessors .
Shiva , Satan , Grendel , the Fenris Wolf — the fiends , the devils , the devourers , the enemies of mercy and humanity — those are the Predator 's kinfolk .
Do we really care that he arrived by spacecraft instead of being belched up from a fiery pit ?
Not unless we 're very picky indeed ...
Batman should n't tangle with just any old bug - eyed monster who slides through the ozone , but the Predator was the right alien for him to fight .

So there ya go - the biggest opponent of " scifi Batman " is saying that Batman is about as science fictional as the Predator .
He uses tons of improbable gadgets - including his suit .
Okay , okay , so you want me to shut up about the comics .
Lots of people who saw TDK had never read a single comic book in their lives , so only the movies should count anyway .

Fine .
So let 's talk about the movie .
It 's full of Bat - toys that are either way beyond our current level of technology , or at the very least five minutes ahead .
In the same way that many of the James Bond films are science fictional to greater or lesser extents , Batman 's toys , in themselves , make him what Alan Moore would call a " science hero . "

Remember the Batpod , that awesome motorcycle ?
It violates just about every law of physics except for the Law Of Awesome .
Just ask Popular Science .
( Also , the Batmobile / Tumbler has a " stealth mode , " which works like a cloaking device . )
And then there 's the doodad that Lucius Fox comes up with , which allows Batman to jump out of an airborne plane - and then jump back into it when he 's done with his mission .
Oh , and did I mention the supercomputer that lets Batman turn every cellphone in the city into a listening device , and then listen in on all of them at once ?
I did n't ?
Well , I do n't think that 's within our current technology , despite what some conspiracy theorists might say .

Actually , go read the comments on that Popular Science piece on the physics of Batman .
They 're full of people saying " Batman is fantasy , you can't expect it to be realistic . "
Or : " Batman has an exoskeleton that gives him superstrength . "
Which reminds me : the Batsuit ?
Totally science fictional .
Nobody questions that Iron Man is scifi because he's in an obvious exoskeleton , and he has a reactor in his chest .
But Batman 's suit is only different from Iron Man 's by degrees , not type .
That 's where I disagree with Denny O'Neil .
These days , at least , Batman really is of technology .
He fights science fictional supervillains .
Still not convinced ?
Maybe you think Batman just gets a free pass on physics and plausibility the way Bourne does , or the Transporter or whatever .
So let 's talk about his villains .

Even if you ignore the comics , and all of the Burton and Schumacher movies , you still have to admit that The Dark Knight takes place in the same universe as Batman Begins , right ?
That 's not much of a leap , since they share the same stars and director ( except for Katie Holmes ) .
In Batman Begins , we meet Dr. Jonathan Crane , aka the Scarecrow , a psychopharmacologist who 's developed a powerful hallucinogenic that directly targets the fear centers of the brain .
This amazing substance can be delivered in an aerosolized form , at close range .
But it can also be dumped into the water supply of Gotham City , where it 'll be just as effective at driving the entire populace into a panic .
It ' s a pretty versatile substance , given how effective and fast - acting it is .
( Crane makes a very brief reappearance in The Dark Knight . )

There 's also Ra's Al - Ghul , of course , who 's a super - ninja pretending to be a French guy .
He 's not so much a science fictional figure , except for his whole supervillain - esque desire to " save the world "
through mass murder .
That 's the thing about Batman : he fights supervillains .
By contrast , the Punisher fights regular criminals ( except maybe Jigsaw . )
Even though some of the same arguments I 'm making could apply to the Punisher just as well as Batman , the Punisher clearly is n't a superhero and does n't belong to quite such a fantastical world , unless you put him in a room with the Avengers .

As for the main villains of The Dark Knight , there 's nothing overtly superhuman or high - tech about the Joker or Two - Face ... except that as badly destroyed as Harvey Dent 's face looks , he might not be running around quite so nimbly .
As for the Joker , he 's just barely a realistic figure , until you consider everything he gets up to in the film .
Which brings me to my last point .
Advertisement
The Dark Knight is either science fiction or urban fantasy
Some movies are works of strict , inescapable realism .
Off the top of my head , Sideways is such a film .
There are the Dogme 95 films , which adhere to a strict set of rules designed to remove anything artificial or fancy .
Advertisement
Needless to say , TDK is not one of these films .

I could be here all day listing all the unlikely stuff that happens in the movie , but a lot of it has to do with the Joker , who technically does n't have superpowers but possesses some fantastic luck .
As the Guardian puts it :
Wait , so the Joker really orchestrated that big truck chase just so that he could get caught and go to prison , then he could kidnap that guard and grab his phone to make the call to set off the bomb he'd previously sewn inside the henchman in the next cell ?
That would kill the guy who stole the mobsters ' money , thus enabling him to … er , what ?
Advertisement
Not bad for a guy who says , " Do I look like a guy with a plan ? "
He also manages to rob a bank , blow up a hospital , kidnap the district attorney , and set explosives on two big ferries , all without getting caught .
I know , I know - it 's just a movie .
But it 's a fantastical , larger - than - life movie , full of improbable technology , weird science and comic book characters .
To my mind , that makes it science fictional .
It has been known for awhile that Barack Obama is a Mac user , but now that he has been elected as our next president , what will this mean for the future of computing in this country ?
Will government and schools be more open to alternatives to Microsoft ?
Will the powerful Microsoft Lobbyists finally get put in their place ?
Will the trend continue towards open standards , instead of Microsoft ’s proprietary crap ?
From TUAW : The unnofficial Apple Weblog :
In what could be a sign of things to come , Hunter Biden was pictured on Election Night showing Vice President - Elect Joe Biden something on a MacBook Air .
Biden also appears to be holding an iPhone 3G with a sticker on the back .
Biden was apparently observing something on screen , while President - Elect Barack Obama celebrated in the background with another staffer .
The MacBook Air appeared to be connected to a USB 3G network adapter .
The Obama administration could become the most technologically - savvy presidency so far .
The President - Elect ’s transition team has already put up change.gov , a website developed by Blue State Digital , the same firm that created Obama ’s campaign website .
Obama ’s administration promises to be the first to include a Chief Technology Officer , and he supports net neutrality .
Obama has been photographed during his campaign using an iPhone .
A Newsweek article in Feburary noted that Michelle Obama bought then - Senator Obama and their children each a MacBook , so they could stay in touch during the long campaign .
Yes , we can add the team to the growing list of world leaders using Apple products .
From Wired.com :
Here ’s an interesting factoid you probably did n’t know about our tech - savvy president - elect :
He ’s a Mac user , according to Telegraph , who compiled a list of 50 facts you might not know about Barack Obama .
And knowing that Obama ’s a Mac user , it ’s highly likely that his chat client of choice is iChat .
Michelle Obama told People magazine that the one gadget her husband would never leave at home is a webcam , which he uses to stay in touch with her and the kids whenever he ’s traveling .
i Chat ’s the best Mac app for video chatting , and it ’s the easiest to use , too
And this older piece ( note the reference to Gore ) from Roughly Drafted Magazine :
Obama and Apple .
Barack Obama ’s campaign has casually referenced Apple directly or indirectly on a number of occasions .
Last year , supporter Phil de Vellis edited Apple ’s legendary 1984 Mac ad to portray opponent Hillary Clinton as Big Brother .
The Obama campaign did not sanction the video , but it did cast Obama as a challenger that “ thinks different . ”
In January , Obama appeared on David Letterman to recite a series of comical campaign promises including , “ I wo n’t let Apple release the new and improved iPod the day after you bought the previous model . ”
Again , Obama was merely referencing the popularity of the iPod rather than endorsing it , but more recently Fake Steve Jobs pointed out that Obama was captured on camera consulting his iPhone ( McCain has a Motorola RAZR ) .
More significantly , Obama said last fall that Apple board member Al Gore could play a key role in his administration if Gore were interested in doing so , and even left the door open to possibly naming Gore as his running mate .
Apple itself has remained relatively political neutral , with no campaign donations of record to either Obama or McCain , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
As a company , Apple has regularly presented presidential debates in iTunes without any political bias .
While CEO Steve Jobs served as an adviser to Democratic candidate John Kerry in 2004 , he has made few political donations recently .
Last year , Jobs described Gore as an ideal but reluctant candidate , telling Newsweek , “ We have dug ourselves into a 20 - foot hole , and we need somebody who knows how to build a ladder .
Al ’s the guy .
Like many others , I have tried my best to convince him .
So far , no luck . ”
Jobs has n’t made similar comments in support Obama .
Here is that appearance on Letterman :
What do you think ?
Will Obama ’s computing platform of choice have an impact on the country ?
In an age of sexual liberation , marriage between cousins remains taboo , at least in the United States — and from a scientific perspective , laws against the unions are a socially legitimized form of genetic and sexual discrimination .
That argument , raised Monday in an editorial in Public Library of Science Biology , may turn the stomachs of people raised to disapprove of any form of incest .
But dispassioned analysis suggests that cousin marriage is no more troubling than childbearing by middle - aged women .
" Women over the age of 40 are not prevented from childbearing , nor is anyone suggesting they should be , despite an equivalent risk of birth defects , " write zoologists Hamish Spencer and Diane Paul .
Bans against cousin marriage , they say , should be repealed , " because neither the scientific nor social assumptions that informed them are any longer defensible . "
Thirty - one states outlaw marriage between first cousins , making the United States the only developed country in which the practice is regularly banned .
Most were passed in the Civil War 's aftermath — not , say Spencer and Paul , to reduce the chance of defects caused by combinations of deleterious genes , but as part of a radical expansion of government authority over private lives .
" Unlike the situation in Britain and much of Europe , cousin marriage in the U.S. was associated not with the aristocracy and upper middle class but with much easier targets : immigrants and the rural poor , " they write .
But their argument is far from consensus : in Forbidden Relatives : The American Myth of Cousin Marriage ,
Kansas State University anthropologist Martin Ottenheimer argues that the bans were driven by now - discredited 19th century research on birth defects among children born to first cousins .
Whatever their motivations , the laws are not supported by science .
According to the
National Society of Genetic Counselors , birth defects are 2 to 3
percent more common in children born to first cousins than among the general population — a real risk , but not enough to justify the bans .
" It 's a form of discrimination that nobody talks about .
People worry about not getting health insurance — but saying that someone should n't marry based on how they 're related , when there 's no known harm , to me is a form of discrimination , " said Robin
Bennett , a University of Washington genetic counselor who led the NSGC
study .
Precise statistics on cousin-union frequency in the
United States are hard to come by , she said , but discrimination and ignorance have serious consequences .
" I'm aware of people who have been afraid to tell people that they 're in love with their cousins , who 've become pregnant and potentially terminated a pregnancy based on false information , " said Bennett .
" Or they did n't marry the person they loved because of their concerns . "
" The laws against cousin marriage are archaic , outdated and counterproductive , " said Ottenheimer .
Repealing these laws does n't seem likely in the near future : Gay marriage remains a more pressing issue .
But anyone who wants to fight for cousin marriage wo n't have to fight against science .
" Ultimately it 's a political question about what you allow individuals to do , and what that says about the structure of society , "
said Spencer .

Michael Malone , managing director iiNet , said he would sign up to be involved in the " ridiculous " trials , which are scheduled to commence by December 24 this year .
Optus and Telstra both said they were reviewing the Government 's documentation and would then decide whether to take part .
But Malone 's main purpose was to provide the Government with " hard numbers " demonstrating " how stupid it is " - specifically that the filtering system would not work , would be patently simple to bypass , would not filter peer - to - peer traffic and would significantly degrade network speeds .
" They 're not listening to the experts , they 're not listening to the industry , they 're not listening to consumers , so perhaps some hard numbers will actually help , " he said .
" Every time a kid manages to get through this filter , we 'll be publicising it and every time it blocks legitimate content , we 'll be publicising it . "
Malone concluded : " This is the worst Communications Minister we 've had in the 15 years since the [ internet ] industry has existed . "
The Government intends to introduce mandatory filtering of all " illegal material " and a second optional filter to block content deemed inappropriate for children , such as pornography .
Internet providers and the Government 's own lab tests have found that presently available filters are not capable of adequately distinguishing between legal and illegal content and can degrade internet speeds by up to 86 per cent .
Many ISPs already offer customers the option of switching on content filtering and the previous government provided free software filters for anyone to download from NetAlert.gov.au .
Much of the opposition to Senator Conroy 's plan revolves around the fact that , unlike his earlier promises , he now wants to make the filtering mandatory for all Australians - spurred on by support from vocal minorities such as the Australian Family Association and the Australian Christian Lobby .
Senator Nick Xenophon and Family First Senator Steve Fielding , both of whom the Government needs to pass legislation , have already said they want the mandatory filters broadened to include the blocking of hard - core pornography and online gambling sites .
Grilled by a Senate Estimates committee in October , Senator Conroy said Britain , Sweden , Canada and New Zealand had all implemented similar filtering systems .
However , in all cases , participation by ISPs was optional and the filtering was limited in scope to predominantly child pornography .
" It is happening in two other countries - China and Saudi Arabia , that 's who he 's lined himself up with , " said Malone .
In Senate question time today , Senator Ludlam asked the minister to explain those claims , but Senator Conroy dodged the question .
" We are aware of technical concerns with filtering technology , and that is why we are conducting a pilot , to put these claims to the test , " he said .
Senator Ludlam then asked Senator Conroy to retract the claims , as well as to explain what he meant by " unwanted content " and to " acknowledge the legitimate concerns by commentators and many members of the public that such a system will degrade internet performance , prove costly and inefficient , and do very little to achieve the Government 's policy objectives " .
Senator Conroy said he could not answer all of those questions in the time provided and would be " happy to come back and provide the Senator with further information " .

Thousands of people may go empty - handed after photography studio Olan Mills collapsed , raising fears that families will not get refunds for pre-paid photo shoots they received as Christmas presents .
The firm ceased trading on Boxing Day and will go into administration on Friday , putting hundreds of jobs at risk .
It has joined a growing list of retailers that have become casualties of the worsening economic downturn .
Olan Mills , which specialised in baby and family portraits , has closed all its 34 studios across England and Wales , 25 of which were based in Mothercare stores .
It said an administrator would be appointed shortly to handle the affairs of the business .
The Olan Mills studios within Mothercare employed 70 people .
It is the second time Olan Mills has collapsed during the Christmas period – two years ago it was rescued by a management buyout .
Several Facebook groups have sprung up to give staff a say on the company 's closure .
One staff member lamented : " What a nice Christmas gift .
I walk into work at 10.30 Boxing Day to find out again Olan Mills has gone into administration .
Thanks a lot , no info , no contact ...
What do I do next ?
RIP Olan Mills ! "
Another , who said she worked for Olan when it reopened in April last year , said she " saw it going down and got out quickly .
Sorry to all you guys that lost your jobs I recall it went down the same time last time .
I think they knew what was happening . "
Reports quoted disgruntled customers as saying the company closed just after getting its Christmas money in .
Family portrait gift boxes cost between £ 50 and £ 150 , while makeover experience gift boxes cost between £ 100 and £ 200 and a " Watch me grow " gift box – three photo sessions over a year for babies and toddlers – went for £ 30 .
Olan Mills said it was " endeavouring to fulfil all outstanding orders " and would post photographs already taken direct to customers ' homes during January .
However , people who have bought a gift box or voucher for studio sessions will be treated as unsecured creditors and have to apply to the administrator for refunds .
Customers who paid by credit card were urged to contact their credit card company for a refund , but those who paid by debit card , cash or cheque will have to join the queue of unsecured creditors .
Mothercare said it was " working to ensure that our customers get delivery of photographs they have purchased after a sitting with Olan Mills at our stores " but stressed that Olan Mills was a separate business .
The company , which is based in Irthlingborough , Northamptonshire , was founded by Olan Mills and his wife Mary in 1981 and at one stage operated from around 100 studios .
It also runs a studio business in the US .
It is believed the US group has not been affected by the closure of the UK business as the two have been run as separate companies , sharing only the name .
The US business has more than 125 studios , as well as concessions in retail chains .
A slew of high street names have collapsed into administration , unable to pay their quarterly rent bills after poor sales in the run-up to Christmas .
The list ranges from Woolworths to USC , the fashion chain owned by Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter .
The economic storm was set to claim more retail casualties , warned Bryan Jackson of PKF , the administrator of USC .
" Unfortunately I can't really see it finishing in the short term .
I would imagine that the casualties will increase at the turn of the year , " he told BBC Radio Scotland .
" To have casualties before you even make ( the turn of ) the year is unusual in the retail sector .
So I can only guess it will actually get worse in the new year .
And who knows when that will start to turn ?
I would certainly like to think and hope that by next Christmas things will be looking better rather than worse . "
The early start of the winter sales has led to a 12.8 % increase in the number of shoppers last week compared with a year ago , following weekly declines before Christmas , according to the latest footfall figures from Experian .
But the surge may not last , and heavy discounts will further hurt retailers ' profit margins .
" This recent surge in shoppers to the high street may be short - lived as reality kicks in for consumers who will face the first credit card bill of the year , together with job insecurities and recession worries impacting confidence , which may force consumers to tighten their purse strings , " said Anita Sharma Manan at Experian .
It also emerged that Debenhams was planning to raise more cash to reduce its debt levels .
The Financial Times reported today that the board of the private equity - owned department store chain would discuss its options at the next board meeting in January .
The retailer is due to give a trading update on 6 January .
Edythe Maa aka Jade Vixen Deadly Love Triangle ( PHOTOS )
, the S&M dominatrix alter ego of brunette Ivy Leaguer , was kidnapped by obsessed client , after he shot her boyfriend , attorney
Ottaviano , 40 , a lawyer at one of Manhattan 's most prestigious law firms , Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , had just returned with Maa to her Philadelphia home , when Krieg , 42 , shot him to death and then forced Maa into his car .
Ottaviano and Maa often attended New York City fetish parties , sometimes with him wearing lipstick , a garter belt , stockings and high heels .
Krieg , who gushed on a video on his MySpace page , " Jade Vixen - she 's the greatest fetish model since Betty Page ! " had been stalking Maa for months .
After gunning down Ottaviano , Krieg drove around with the dominatrix - who specializes in “ sensual teasing and denial , rope bondage , sissy - slut training , dog training , tickle torture , and corporal punishments of a traditional nature ” - for hours .
Maa convinced Krieg to let her go , and he dropped her off at his relatives ' house in West Chester , Pa. , shortly after 4 a.m. on Monday .
She immediately called police , who found Krieg and forced him to pull over in a restaurant parking lot , where he turned the gun on himself .

HOLLYWOOD , California ( CNN ) --
Reality television featuring law enforcement officers on the beat is nothing new .
A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects , however , is a new twist .
Maricopa Co. Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show , " Smile : You 're Under Arrest . "
Maricopa County , Arizona , Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose showy brand of justice has raised charges of discrimination and civil - rights abuses while making him a hero among fans of his tough - on - crime attitudes -- will star in " Smile : You 're Under Arrest . "
The show , which premiers this weekend on Fox Reality Channel , features Arpaio and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants .
In one , a suspect is invited to a fake fashion shoot and told he 's going to become a supermodel , according to Fox Reality 's Web site .
In another , a suspect is tricked into what he thinks is a job as a movie extra and , after a staged argument between the film's " director " and another actor , gets promoted to the starring role .
" It 's kind of fun to show how stupid they are and , as I say , the looks on their face , " Arpaio , 76 , said of the suspects wanted for DUIs , drug charges , missed court dates and other offenses .
Watch Arpaio explain his methods »
But Arpaio 's critics are n't amused .
They say they fear the show will give the controversial sheriff positive publicity , ignoring what they call a darker side to his 16 - year tenure as top lawman in the county that includes Phoenix .
" It 's going to celebrate a sheriff that 's frankly scaring this community , a sheriff that has seen violent crime increase significantly in his county , a sheriff that is racially profiling the Latino community , and I doubt that the show is going to reflect that , " said Paco Fabian , spokesman for the immigrant - rights group America 's Voice .
In a statement on the group 's Web site , Fabian calls Arpaio a " modern day Bull Connor , " comparing him to the public safety commissioner in 1960s Birmingham , Alabama , whose use of attack dogs and firehoses on civil rights demonstrators made him a symbol of racial intolerance .
Dubbed " America 's Toughest Sheriff , " Arpaio makes many of his county 's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents .
He reinstituted chain gangs -- including crews for women and juveniles -- banned smoking , coffee and movies in his jails and , most recently , moved to require all inmates with money in their jail accounts to pay for their own meals .
And then , of course , there 's the pink underwear .
" They were stealing the white underwear , smuggling the underwear out of the jail , " Arpaio told CNN .
" So you know what ?
Give them pink .
The other reason is they hate pink .
Why would you give the 10,000 inmates the color they like ? "
Earlier this year , the mayor of Phoenix wrote a letter to the U.S. attorney general 's office , asking the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department 's civil rights division to investigate Arpaio 's aggressive illegal immigration crackdowns .
Mayor Phil Brown wrote that Arpaio 's sweeps show " a pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment , improper stops , searches and arrests . "
The letter came after Arpaio , who had already been the target of hundreds of lawsuits , launched a series of what he calls crime - suppression patrols in largely Latino neighborhoods .
Critics say the patrols use racial profiling to unfairly target Hispanic drivers and pedestrians , while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants , including some with criminal records .
" We are the only ones cracking down on the state 's human smuggling law , " Arpaio said .
Fabian said America 's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio 's show .
Either way , the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a lawman who has never shied away from it .
" I 'm not going to brag , " Arpaio said , " but there is n't anybody in the world who does n't know who this sheriff is . "

On January 8 , the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported Obama has decided to add two more dubious insiders to his “ change ” ( for the worse ) team .
One is an avowed neocon warmonger , the other yet another CFR member and pro-Israel zealot .
From the JTA website :
An official close to the transition team told JTA on Thursday that [ Dan ] Shapiro , a former senior U.S. Senate staffer and the Obama official who handled outreach to the Jewish community , and [ Dennis ] Ross , President Clinton ’s top Middle East envoy , are “ likely to have jobs with the administration . ”
The official commented after JTA called to confirm reports that Ross was slated to be the chief Middle East adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama ’s secretary of state - designate , and that Shapiro would head the Middle East desk at the National Security Council .
The official could not confirm those reports .
Dennis Ross is nothing if not a neocon , albeit of the Democrat stripe .
He is in bed with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Project for the New American Century , the organization that brought us the invasion of Iraq and so far more than a million dead Iraqis .
He also haunts the American Enterprise Institute , the think tank where Bush once bragged he selected the “ minds ” that have run his foreign policy over the last eight years .
Ross is an advisor for United Against Nuclear Iran , the self - proclaimed “ broad - based coalition ” determined to breathe life into the fantasy that Iran has nukes and will use them against the U.S. and Israel .
United Against Nuclear Iran is run by the raving lunatic John Bolton .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
As noted by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt in their controversial 2006 paper for Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government , Ross helped shape Middle East policy during the Clinton years .
Other advisors on Middle East policy included Martin Indyk , the former deputy director of research at AIPAC , and and Aaron Miller , who has lived in Israel and often visits there .
In other words , during the Clinton era Middle East policy was largely shaped by officials with close ties to Israel or to prominent pro-Israel organizations .
It will be the same under Obama as he recycles Clintonites and Hillary Clinton will lord over the State Department .
Dan Shapiro worked for the NSC during the Clinton administration under Sandy Berger , the Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs who was roundly criticized for failing to promptly inform Clinton of his knowledge that the People ’s Republic of China had managed to acquire the designs of a number of U.S. nuclear warheads .
Shapiro worked Obama ’s “ Jewish outreach , ” that is to say he was tapped to convince pro-Israel voters that Obama would allow Israel to dictate U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East , a policy now horrifically on display in the Gaza Strip .
For the “ progressive ” Democrats out there , Shapiro should be a particularly frustrating selection , as he worked for senator Bill Nelson , considered a right - winger by folks who have a vested interest in the false right - left paradigm .
Shapiro worked closely with Nelson on the Syria Accountability Act of 2003 and the 2007 prohibition on US contacts with the Palestinian leadership .
Nelson was gently nudged into the AIPAC camp by Mr. Shapiro .
In addition to working for Nelson , Shapiro is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations , thus demonstrating that even Democrat neocons are interested in global government and the destruction of U.S. sovereignty .
Obama continues to do what some us predicted well in advance of the election : push more of the same under the phony and putrid guise of “ change . ”
In the months ahead , we can expect the Bush legacy to continue and the Clinton legacy to be refurbished .
In fact , they are nearly identical .

Welcome , Matt and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts .
For the benefit of the readers , could you tell us something about your self ?
Matt >>
Hi Satish , thank you for giving me the opportunity .
I wish I could tell you that I have been programming in lisp since I was 4 .
Unfortunately I can’t .
However , I learnt English thanks to my dad who was an accountant and put his work computer in my bedroom .
I believe the first English word I saw was : “ ready ” .
I ’m 100 % Mediterranean , born and raised in France with Italian , Spanish and North African roots .
I have travelled a lot and lived in different countries .
I ’m now located in San Diego , CA where I live with my wife .
But I guess your readers are more interested in the “ Ruby - esque ” aspect of my life .
I ’m part of the Merb core team and have been a contributor to many Ruby open source projects , from Rails to DataMapper without forgetting a legion or gems and plugins more or less interesting / useful .
I fell in love with Ruby when I evaluated Rails for a previous employer .
Since then , I have setup my own consulting company offering development and training .
I ’m also leading a new project that I ’m particularly fond of : The Merb Open Source Book .
It ’s pretty exciting to work with great people from all around the world .
We all have the same passion ; we have people who just started using Merb , some experts and some with editorial experience .

Recently , there has been a lot of talk about Merb .
What ’s Merb and why is it becoming so popular in the Ruby world ?
Merb – Ruby web framework for the enterprise
Matt >>
Merb is a Ruby framework to build web applications and web services .
Merb started being developed in 2006 .
Merb is getting popular inside and outside reasons because of some of these factors :
Merb reached the 1.0 cap
Merb has a guaranteed public API
Merb is truly modular and agnostic
Merb is fast and cares about performances
Merb tries to be closer to the Ruby language
Merb is new and different
Merb has a different philosophy
Merb learnt from Rails
Of course different people are attracted to Merb for different reasons .
I have started a new interview series called Meet the Merbists .
I hope to interview a lot of different people and let them explain why they like Merb .
RL >>
If I wanted to learn and start using Merb , how do I do that ?
Can you talk about what all is being done for Merb in terms of documentation , books , tutorials and training ?
Matt >>
In all honesty , even though the Ruby community do a lot of things right , we really are n’t good at documentation .
If you look at other languages like Python and other frameworks like Code Igniter or Django , you will see a different level of documentation .
The good news is that we are aware of that problem and are working on it .
To answer your question , I would say that if you want to learn Merb , you need to start with Ruby .
I heard a lot of good things about “ Beginning Ruby ” even though I have not read it .
My personal favorite Ruby books are : “ The Ruby Programming Language ” and
“ The Ruby Way “ .
You can also find a lot of great resources online .
Once you feel ready to start with Merb , you can look at a few things :
And on top of that you have the training sessions .
RubyLearning.org has a great introduction to Merb class which is really affordable .
My company , m|a agile offers a 3 - day training given by Yehuda and myself .
At the moment we only have classes scheduled in the USA , but if there are enough requests we might try to go overseas .
RL >>
What are the advantages of Merb over similar web frameworks ?
Any drawbacks ?
Matt >>
It ’s always a hard question to answer .
I ’m not going to try to convince people to switch to Merb if they are happy with the framework they use .
Instead I will give you my personal and therefore a biased opinion .
People have different needs and different ways of approaching problems .
Merb is strongly inspired by Rails but has a different approach on how the framework should work and how it relates to people .
I believe this is the key difference between Merb and Rails .
During an interview for InfoQ.com , David Heinemeier Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails said :
I ’m not in this world to create Rails for you .
I ’m in this world to create Rails for me and if you happen to like that version of Rails that I ’m creating for me , than you are going to have a great time . [… ]
I do n’t really care whether you use Rails or not .
I think it ’s great that we have critical mass , and I care about that ; but I do n’t care about you as a single individual customer .
It ’s not a scoop .
Rails is very opinionated and that ’s why it ’s so successful .
Merb ’s philosophy is different : let people choose and build around a solid and small core .
Merb is built around 1 single gem called merb - core .
merb - core is built around Rack to allow more flexibility , it has a powerful router and knows how to deal with requests / sessions .
It ’s up to the developer to build his own stack based on his needs .
We offer some default settings to get you started :
a very flat stack : 1 file app “ A la Sinatra ” ( great for web services )
a flat stack : keeps the logic in a single file , but has separate files for configuration and views ( great for very simple apps )
a core stack : MVC structure but without any dependencies or ORM setup .
It ’s up to you to define what you want to use ( great for custom apps using couchdb , sequel , JRuby etc … )
a full stack : MVC structure with DataMapper , merb auth , helpers , assets , mailer , cache , action - args , param - protection ( Rich Web Applications )
You can always add or remove dependencies to your app making sure you only use what you need and keep your performance to the maximum .
The reason is that Merb came to the world because some people were frustrated by some limitations in Rails .
It was designed for performance and to fulfill the needs of various types of developers .
Merb can be really opinionated but also knows it has to deal with really opinionated developers who might disagree .
It ’s therefore designed to let you design your own opinionated stack .
To sum - up : Merb is great when you need a custom solution and / or when you care about performance .
It shines when dealing with legacy / custom / enterprise type applications or small and efficient systems like web services .
However , because it ’s so flexible it requires you to know and understand the various moving parts .
That ’s why you might not get up and running as fast as with Rails .
RL >>
We have so many Ruby based web frameworks .
On what type of projects would you use Merb ?
Matt >>
That ’s a very good question .
As a consultant that ’s something I ’m being asked a lot .
Recently I ’ve been involved with some projects where CouchDB seemed to be really the way to go because of the complexity of the architecture and the fact that Couch was offering a very elegant solution .
I did not need a full - fledge ORM like ActiveRecord , DataMapper or Sequel and I did n’t feel like fighting with the framework to get it just the way I needed it .
Merb was a perfect choice to adjust to the custom needs of this project .
Another project uses Merb slices ( standalone apps which can be mounted in another app ) for different reusable parts of the application .
The slices can be customized and reused on various applications .
The client saw that this had a real benefit .
Another project was getting 7 - 10 million requests per day .
The first version of the application was written in Rails but we had to customize / optimize it so much that it was hard to support / maintain .
We ended up rewriting the application with Merb ( using ActiveRecord ) .
We still had to optimize it to deal with the load but it was easier to just pick and choose what we needed .
Being able to easily read the source code was also a great benefit .
Finally the merb - book is an excellent example of how to use merb without all the fluff .
The book deals with different languages , including Arabic ( right to left ) and renders markdown content using maruku ( a markdown to html / latex / pdf gem ) .
It ’s simple , efficient and was written in less than 2 hours .
Ultimately , the book will be exported to static HTML ( using a plugin written by topfunky ) and PDF ( using a jruby / flying saucer plugin ) .
RL >>
How do you plan to support Merb over JRuby ?
Matt >>
As a team , the merb team works pretty closely with the JRuby team .
We micro-benchmarked JRuby and Merb on a 8 core machine and got 14,000 requests per second .
That ’s pretty impressive !
Of course , I would not expect to get these kinds of results in a production app , but that proves the potential of such a combo .
JRuby ’s threading system has some great advantages and that ’s something Merb always valued .
Of course things are not perfect yet but we do our best to fix bugs when they are reported to us .
We are also planning on further optimizing Merb specifically for JRuby .
We believe this is a great choice for the enterprise and we want to fully support people choosing JRuby and Merb .
Expect a lot of improvements and even better support and performance .
RL >>
Are there any IDE ’s for Merb ?
Matt >>
Any IDE ’s for Ruby will work with Merb .
However , the core team has been working with Sun ’s Netbeans team to add custom Merb support to their next version .
Even though none of the Merb core team member use an IDE , we recognize that a lot of people , especially coming from a different background are used to IDEs and we should do our best to make their transition easier .
I personally really like profiling and re-factoring tools so I would n’t mind a light yet powerful IDE .
RL >>
Talking about Merb without talking about DataMapper , Mongrel or Erb is difficult .
How much “ decoupling ” exists between Merb and DataMapper and the DataObject adapters and if in the near future whether there will be an adapter for JDBC ?
Matt >>
Very good question .
DataMapper is an Object Relational Mapper ( ORM ) .
The goal of an ORM is to convert scalar values from a data store ( a database for instance ) to objects in your programming language .
People with a Rails background are familiar with another ORM : ActiveRecord .
DataMapper has a unified API / inteface to access adapters .
MySQL , Postgres and SQLite3 adapters use DataObjects drivers .
These drivers were rewritten from scratch in C to match the DataMapper API .
By using this unified API , DataMapper does n’t need to hold all the logic and therefore stays simpler and easier to maintain .
The problem is that people need to write adapters .
The good news is that it ’s really easy since you have an API already defined for you .
You can look at examples like my google video adapter or Yehuda ’s Salesforce adapter which were written in very few lines of code .
As the Database adapters rely on C drivers , they do n’t run on JRuby yet .
That ’s why the DataMapper team is working on a JDBC adapter .
Now that I have explained a bit more about DataMapper , let me address the question of decoupling .
DataMapper ( DM ) is a separate project and even though the Merb team is often involved with DM , it is not managed by us .
Merb does n’t rely on DataMapper and only the “ opinionated stack ” uses DataMapper by default .
As a matter of fact , Merb supports a lot of adapters : DataMapper , Sequel , ActiveRecord , RelaxDB and can support new ones as they will be released .
Once again , people have different needs and we believe they should make a choice which ORM they prefer to use .
Take YellowPages.com for instance , Lori and Jacob use and love Sequel .
Lori did a presentation at MerbCamp and is actively supporting Sequel ’s integration in Merb .
They are both also working on the Sequel section of the merb - book .
Because of my involvement with CouchDB , I use CouchRest quite a lot .
CouchRest is just not really an ORM per say and it works great with Merb .
So really , if you do n’t want to , you do n’t have to use DataMapper .
RL >>
Is there a Merb ( community ) support for Windows , Linux and MacOS ?
Or is the framework development currently focused on just a specific operating system ?
Matt >>
In all honestly , I wish I could tell you that there is full support for all the platforms .
Unfortunately the reality is slightly different .
While we do want to support Windows , none of us use Windows daily .
And if you ever tried , you know that using Ruby on Windows is painful .
It ’s slow and not really optimized .
However , thanks to people like Luis Lavena things are easier .
We are working with Luis to make sure that we do n’t leave the Windows users behind .
I really hope that soon , we will have an overall better Ruby support on windows .
Apple shipping its OSX with Ruby obviously makes things easier , the core team uses MacOSX and Linux to develop and we all deploy to linux servers .
RL >>
Will Merb work as well as Rails under passenger , or will there be plans for moving forward with mod_rails ?
In essence , how do you expect the hosting support in the very near future to unfold for Merb ?
Rails took quite a while to be supported as much as it is right now , and even so it does n’t reach the same base as PHP or ASP or even Python support for hosting services .
Matt >>
This is another question we get quite often .
Phusion Passenger is a great project which changed the way you deploy Ruby apps .
Passenger is an apache module which simplified the life of many people and opened the door to shared hosting ( it makes it easier to manage accounts according to locaweb.com.br ) .
But it ’s more than that , the Phusion guys also worked on Ruby Enterprise Edition ( REE ) , a patched version of Ruby designed to optimize memory usage .
Merb is already setup to take advantage of the REE optimizations if you decide to use REE instead of the standard MRI .
Passenger is also designed to serve all Rack based applications and therefore support Merb but also Sinatra , Ramaze , Mack etc …
However , it is true that Passenger is specifically optimized for Rails and does stuff it wo n’t do with Merb and the other Rack based frameworks .
I know of a few people deploying their merb apps on passenger and being really cool about it .
However , we really hope to be able to work with the Phusion guys and specially optimize Merb for passenger .
It ’s very important to keep things simple and I can assure you we are going to do our best to make sure Merb and Passenger work together in an optimized way .
RL >>
Any comments about Mack , Ramaze and Sinatra – or any of the “ new ” MVC players in Ruby for web applications ?
Matt >>
I ’m actually really excited to see so many new frameworks .
Some are not so new but people are probably a bit more open nowadays .
I need to spend more time studying what they do , how they do it and why .
As a team , we have spent some time looking at other frameworks , including outside the Ruby world .
We learnt a lot from Django for instance .
Our concept of slices is really close to their concept of “ applications ” .
But what is exciting about all these frameworks is that we are all using Rack .
And now Rails has joined the party .
The great advantage of Rack is that we can share adapters and we can share middlewares .
The other day I was chatting with Bitsweat from the Rails core team about some really cool middleware they ’ve been working on .
I ’m really happy to see that we will all be able to work on some common piece of code which we all be able to share .
I ’m also interested in frameworks with a different perspective like Waves .
I do n’t fully understand it yet but I ’m sure it will enrich our community .
RL >>
Is Merb being used by companies ?
Can you name a few ?
Matt >>
We have a list of people using Merb on the wiki .
The best thing to do is to check there .
Some names I have in mind would be of course Apple via Sproutcore which is used for MobileMe.
Yellow Pages which now uses Merb for their service tier .
I heard Wikipedia is using Merb on a small project lead by Hampton Catlin ( the Haml guy ) .
Microsoft / powerset is using Merb .
I believe hulu.com used to use Merb a long time ago , but I ’m not sure whether they are still using it .
Some other companies prefer not to mention these kind of things , but if you look for job offers you will find companies like Adobe looking for Merbists .
RL >>
What ’s the future of Merb ?
Matt >>
The best person to ask would be Yehuda Katz , Merb lead developer .
Right now we are in “ community support mode ” .
Now that we have released a stable API and have a solid code base , people have started using Merb and we are listening to their feedback .
We are building the framework for the developers and we need to know what they need .
We ’ve been focusing on trying to fix all the little annoyances .
We are monitoring IRC and twitter to see what people complain about and we work on it .
The immediate future top priorities are : Documentation and Gem dependencies .
That ’s why I started the merb - book and Yehuda worked on a documentation app and a new optimized bundler ( he also worked on RubyGems and hopefully his changes will be available in the next release ) .
Once this is solved we will be able to focus on Merb 1.1 .
Merb 1.1 will focus on a few things , mainly :
improving the concept of slices by making any application a namespaced mountable application
increase the interaction with Rack to allow more flexibility and performance
push the concept of resources even further reducing duplication in your code
significantly improve the performance of large route sets
In the long term we are also focusing on two categories of people , a bit left behind at the moment :
the enterprise users
Rapid Prototypes designers needing the simplicity of PHP and sexiness of Ruby
On the way to 2.0 we are also planning on working on cool Merb slices like an admin slice , a slice administrator etc . .
RL >>
Matt , thank you for your time .
Anything else you would like to add ?
Matt >>
I would like to thank the rest of the core team and all the contributors , including all the translators working on the merb book .
A big thanks to Matz and the Ruby core team for an awesome language , thanks to DHH and the Rails core team for pushing Ruby and creating Rails .
And of course thanks to RubyLearning for supporting the project and offering an exclusive opportunity to learn more about Merb .

YEARS ago , on one of my first assignments for New Scientist , I was sent to London ’s Dorchester Hotel to interview Carl Sagan , the American astronomer .
Sagan was famous for his popular science books , the blockbuster TV series Cosmos , and his science fiction novel Contact , which was turned into a film starring Jodie Foster .
Rather overawed by Sagan ’s palatial suite and by meeting the man himself , I asked him which he preferred – science or science fiction ?
“ Science , ” he replied without hesitation .
“ Because science is stranger than science fiction . ”
That was two decades ago .
Since then , we have discovered that 73 per …
A federal jury convicted five Muslim men Monday of plotting to kill soldiers at an Army base in New Jersey in a case that showed an aggressive FBI effort to infiltrate suspected homegrown terrorist cells .
The five men , all Muslim immigrants who have lived in the United States for some time , were acquitted of the related charge of attempted murder , but could face life in prison for their conviction on conspiracy to kill American soldiers .
Sentencing is scheduled for April .
Critics of the government ’s anti-terrorism approach said the case amounted to entrapment of angry young men and that if not for the actions of the FBI ’s informants , the group of immigrants would have done nothing more than talk about an attack .
However , security experts praised the convictions and the FBI investigation that led to them , arguing that the probe stopped a group of amateur terrorists before they could become experts , execute a plot and possibly spawn other cells .
Advertisement
The case sparked widespread concern because it involved an apparently homegrown group of angry immigrants who had no contact with foreign terrorist organizations and instead found motivation from jihadist propaganda culled from the Internet .
During the 12 - week trial in Camden , federal prosecutors argued that the men , some legal residents and some in the U.S. illegally , had planned to attack Ft. Dix , where one of the defendants had made pizza deliveries .
Together they watched anti-American jihadist videos , talked about attacking soldiers and ultimately tried to buy assault weapons through a government informant .
Still , the trial made clear that the five were not professional terrorists .
A video showed the accused men shooting assault weapons at a firing range , but revealed that they had little knowledge about how to organize an attack .
Advertisement
James Lewis , a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank , said that without foreign expertise , the men were amateurs with few skills .
“ These guys were clearly at sea when it came to staging an attack , ” Lewis said .
Local Muslim groups echoed defense lawyers ’ criticism of the government ’s use of informants .
The two main informants in the case worked to stave off deportation and were paid thousands of dollars .
One informant told the men about someone in Baltimore who could sell them weapons , and the first arrests in the case took place at that informant ’s apartment .
Advertisement
Ian S. Lustick , a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania , argued that the federal government has repeatedly overreached when investigating and prosecuting terrorism plots .
“ We see a pattern across the country of almost no evidence of anything being done that is actually dangerous , but enormous amounts of evidence of the energy and resources put into entrapment , ” said Lustick , author of a book on domestic terrorism cases .
In addition to Monday ’s guilty verdicts , federal prosecutors won terrorism - related convictions against Richard Reid , the attempted shoe bomber , in 2003 ; six Yemeni American men arrested in Lackawanna , N.Y. , in 2003 ; and Zacarias Moussaoui , an accused Sept. 11 conspirator , in 2005 .
Other cases have been more troublesome .
A case against four men in Michigan was thrown out in 2004 after accusations of prosecutorial misconduct .
The government was forced to drop charges that Jose Padilla planned to detonate a “ dirty bomb , ” obtaining a conviction on lesser charges in 2007 .
Advertisement
And charges that seven people plotted to blow up the Sears Tower have resulted in two mistrials and an acquittal .
Six of the men will go on trial a third time in January .
During the Ft. Dix trial , at which the accused men did not testify , defense lawyers argued that so - called terrorist training was nothing more than a vacation that featured horseback riding , video games , movies and pillow fights .
But prosecutors argued that the men were talking about a potential attack before the informant infiltrated their group .
The accused included three brothers from Cherry Hill , N.J. : Dritan Duka , 30 , Shain Duka , 27 , and Eljvir Duka , 25 .
The two older brothers , who agreed to buy the weapons through the informant , were also convicted of charges related to the possession of machine guns .
Another Cherry Hill man , Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer , 23 , was convicted of conspiracy and attempted possession of AK - 47 assault weapons .
The fifth man , Serdar Tatar of Philadelphia , was convicted only on the conspiracy charge .
Advertisement
In addition to the five men convicted Monday , a sixth man , Agron Abdullahu , 26 , pleaded guilty in October 2007 to abetting the illegal possession of weapons , receiving a 20 - month sentence .
After the verdict , defense attorneys expressed disappointment and said they may appeal .
Prosecutors said the verdicts show the need for “ continued vigilance ” against the threat of homegrown Islamic radicals .
“ The word should go out to any other would - be terrorists of the homegrown variety that the United States will find you , infiltrate your group , prosecute you and send you to prison for a very long time , ” Ralph J. Marra Jr. , the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey , said in a statement .
Lustick , the critic of the prosecution , said he was worried the New Jersey case could encourage more such trials unless the Obama administration takes steps to rein in the federal investigators in cases involving small - time groups .
Advertisement
“ This is the same story we have seen many times , ” he said .
“ These are hucksters , big talkers and adolescents . ”
Lewis , the security expert , praised the FBI for its proactive approach .
“ It is a very aggressive counter - terrorism effort and it seems to be working , ” he said .

On November 11th , Argentinian President Cristina Fernández vetoed a previously passed bill aimed at protecting Argentina ’s glaciers .
The bill , entitled The Law of Minimum Budgets for the Protection of Glaciers and Periglacial Environment , had been passed overwhelmingly despite concerns from governors of affected provinces and Argentina ’s Secretariat of Mines that the bill ’s provisions would prevent mining development .
The glacier protection bill would have :
Established basic standards to preserve glaciers as strategic reserves of hydric resources and water supplies ; and Prohibited activities that would prevent the glaciers from acting as water supplies .
Some of the activities that would have been severely curtailed in glacial environments would have been mining ( including gold , copper , aluminum , iron and steel , and others ) , oil and gas exploration and exploitation , general construction activities , and the release of any substances that would have a detrimental effect on glaciers .
Environmental groups had applauded the passage of this bill ; according to Daniel Filmus , president of the Commission of Environment and Sustainable Development :
There is no question that the protection and value of glaciers , as ecosystems that are a fundamental part of the natural environment of our country and represent one of the most important freshwater reserves for the Patagonian region , [ and ] should be recognized and promoted by a national law .
However , President Fernández was concerned that “ the prohibition is excessive ” and gives “ preeminence to environmental aspects over activities that could be developed in perfect care of the environment . ”
Specifically , there was governmental concern that the bill “ would have negative repercussions in the economic development and investment ” .
One mining project , Canadian gold mining company Barrick Gold ’s $ 2.4 billion Pascua Lama project would have been affected by the implementation of this law .
While Barrick had publicly stated that there would be extensive environmental and glacial protections implemented , there was still extensive controversy surrounding the project .
Pascua Lama critics contend that the bill was vetoed to prevent it from delaying or cancelling Barrick ’s mega-project .

America 's Second Great Depression Has Started
Martin Wiess writes :
On this first weekday after Thanksgiving , it 's time to take a moment , look at the changes swirling all around us and think about the tasks we must achieve together in the weeks ahead .
After more than six decades of growth , America is sinking into its Second Great Depression of modern times .
The place is every home , business , and community .
The time is now .
America 's Second Great Depression is not a typical 20th century recession that happens to strike a bit harder or linger somewhat longer .
Nor is it merely a fictional scenario conjured up by economists with a murky crystal ball .
America 's Second Great Depression is the probable consequence of a great housing bust , a massive mortgage meltdown and the biggest financial crisis in history .
It promises to bring the worst wave of bankruptcies , job losses and wealth destruction any citizen under 90 has ever experienced .
It challenges the smartest minds in Washington , defies the deepest pockets on Wall Street and threatens to rip through our life with the force of a Cat - 5 hurricane .
And yet , among all those making the decisions that could forever change our future , no one has personal experience with a similar episode .
I do n't either .
I was born in 1946 , just as we were leaving the final vestiges of America 's First Great Depression behind .
I 've studied that historic period with books , charts and numbers , but that 's not the same thing .
I 've lived in Brazil and Japan during tough times , but that , too , was different .
What brings me closer to a visceral understanding of this crisis is the half century I shared with my father , J. Irving Weiss , one of the few economists who not only advised investors during the First Great Depression , but actually predicted it .
Dad was so proud of that unusual feat , he began telling me stories about it when I was just five years old .
Vicariously , I lived through the Roaring Twenties , the Crash of ‘ 29 , the massive bank failures of the 1930s , and the many years of human suffering that ensued .
Through Dad 's teachings , I felt as though I was there with him when investors lost fortunes , when we hit rock bottom in 1933 , when we eventually recovered and brand new fortunes were made .
Dad was not only a loving father , but also my mentor , partner and best friend .
I wish he could be here today to write to you directly and help you get through these tough times personally .
But as soon as I was old enough , I helped him write his investment reports ; and in 1971 , soon after I founded Weiss Research , he helped me write mine .
Although he 's gone , I can feel his vibrant energy and calming spirit beside me ; and from time to time , I will let him speak to you posthumously here in Money and Markets .
Think of this message you get from me each Monday as co-authored by the two of us .
He will tell you about his experiences and analysis during America 's First Great Depression ; I will tell you what it means for America 's Second Great Depression and what you can do about it .
A lot has changed since then .
What has n't changed is my family 's passionate desire to help you through it .
This entire effort is the culmination of eighty - four years of research , beginning when Dad first went to Wall Street in 1924 to learn everything he could about money .
Five years later , when the great crash struck , he did not own any stocks .
His parents were recent immigrants from Eastern Europe with barely enough to keep food on the table .
He had to save everything he earned , bring it home and give it to his mother .
He knew how real estate had collapsed in Florida , and he saw how America 's farms were in disarray .
He did n't want to gamble his hard - earned savings on another bubble .
After the crash , the stock market rallied for almost six months , and nearly everyone on Wall Street thought the crisis was over .
But Dad persuaded his clients and friends to sell everything , get the heck out of the market , and pile up as much cash as they could .
He was so convinced the market would fall again , he even borrowed $ 500 from his mother to sell short — to take a crack at profiting from the market 's decline .
Sure enough , the Crash of ‘ 29 was just the opening act of the great bear market .
All told , from its peak in 1929 , the Dow Jones Industrials Average fell 89 % .
Compared to the Dow 's peak in 2007 , that would be tantamount to a plunge of more than 12,600 points — to a low of approximately 1500 .
Dad explains it this way :
“ In the 1930s , at each step down the slippery slope of the market 's decline , Washington would periodically announce some new initiative to turn things around .
President Hoover would give a new pep talk promising ‘ prosperity around the corner . '
And often , the Dow staged dramatic rallies — up 30 % on the first round , 48 % on the second , 23 % on the third , and more .
Each time , I sought to use the rallies as selling opportunities .
I persuaded more of my clients to get rid of their stocks and pile up cash .
I even told them to take their money out of shaky banks .
“ On the surface , it might have appeared that just sitting out the crisis got you nowhere .
Actually , though , it was a great strategy for building wealth .
Prices were falling — on homes , on automobiles , on almost everything .
So the more prices fell , the more your money was worth .
Just by saving money , stashing the cash , keeping your job and going about your daily life , you were building wealth .
You did n't have to know about investing .
All you needed to figure out was how to protect yourself from the bad times .
Then , when we hit rock bottom — that was the time to start buying real estate , stocks or bonds .
“ The end of the entire decline came with two events :
The inauguration of our new president , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and the national banking holiday he declared on his third day in office .
But after three years of panics and crashes , most people greeted those events with dread .
They thought it would be the beginning of another , even steeper slide .
Some people even said it was the final chapter of capitalism itself .
As it turned out , that was precisely the right time to pick up some of the greatest bargains of the century and make a lot of money . ”
Helping people make money was Dad 's profession , but his passion in life went far beyond money ; he was a man of deep empathy and feeling for his fellow man .
When others suffered , he suffered along side them .
He gave them jobs , bought them meals and offered an abundance of free advice
Most of all , he did not want to see America go through another depression ever again .
His vision for accomplishing that goal , however , was different from that of most economists in the post - Depression era .
Their strategy was to yank the economy out of nearly every slump and slumber , forever seeking to keep the economy growing , always bailing out major institutions that failed .
His philosophy was moderation in both directions .
“ The only way to avoid the pain of a great bust , ” he wrote , “ is to refrain from the excesses of a great boom . ”
I agree , and in the coming weeks , I 'll explain why .
Plus , I 'll show you how you can use a similarly moderate approach to secure your own future .
A better future was also something Dad sought to secure for the country as a whole , in his own personal way .
In 1955 , for example , a Florida junk dealer sought to take over one of America 's largest cash - rich companies to force it to borrow money and grow more quickly .
In response , Dad mobilized like - minded executives from all over the country and , in one of the greatest corporate battles of that era , successfully blocked the takeover .
Similarly , in 1959 , when the U.S. federal deficit seemed to be growing out of control , he formed the Sound Dollar Committee , organized a grassroots movement of an estimated 11 million citizens , and helped President Eisenhower give America its last truly balanced budget .
Today , I am Chairman of the Sound Dollar Committee ; and separately , I am the cofounder of the Financial Publishers Association , representing over 14 million investors .
My primary goal , like Dad's , is to do my small part to help head off the avoidable consequences of another depression .
Right now , our country 's finances have deteriorated too far to balance the federal budget anytime soon .
But it 's not too late to avoid some major financial blunders that could seriously weaken our country for the rest of the century .
Even in the worst - case scenario , it is certainly not too late for you to protect your savings , boost your income and grow your wealth .
How long could the depression last ?
How much further can home prices fall ?
How far down will the stock market go ?
Will it be as bad as the 1930s ?
At this juncture , you can count on your fingers the number of serious analysts who believe that 's even a remote possibility .
And yet , stranger things have already happened , including the largest bank and insurance company collapses of all time .
Before he passed away , Dad expressed it this way :
“ Most Americans — especially the youngsters who manage billions of dollars on Wall Street — have no concept of the power and speed of a great stock market crash .
They 've never lived through one .
So it 's hard for them to visualize it .
In 1929 , people were jumping out of windows and one - time wealthy people were selling apples on street corners .
The shock waves reached into almost every office and every home in the country and in the world .
Next time , it could be just as bad , or even worse . ”
Trouble is , there are no historical precedents for what 's happening in this era .
Any forecasts I make today , no matter how well researched , are not nearly as valuable as the awareness you will have of current events as they unfold in real time .
So rather than pick a number for the bottom in the Dow or guess the low price of an average home , my primary purpose is to help give you the understanding you need to make some major decisions right now and then adjust them as the crisis unfolds .
Your immediate task , which may seem hard , is actually very simple — get your money to safety .
Your second task , which may seem easy , could actually be more difficult — wait patiently .
But it 's the last step that will be the most rewarding — when real estate , stocks and bonds are near a true bottom , reinvest in America and greatly improve your life for years to come .
Over the next few weeks , I will show you how .
I will give you the warning signs to watch out for while things are still falling ; I will describe the kinds of conditions that are likely to prevail when we 're near a bottom ; and I will provide step - by - step instructions on precisely what to do .
Surviving the crisis on Wall Street and Main Street is not rocket science .
You do n't have to forecast the future .
You do n't even need investing experience .
All you need is the courage to get out of its way and the patience to stay out of its way for the duration .
The simple secret is to throw out your prejudices , start with a clean slate and then follow your own common sense .
Right now , that means taking a cold , hard look at the events swirling around you and recognizing that your money could be in grave danger .
It means accepting the reality that the value of your home , your 401k , and even some of your supposedly “ safe ” investments CAN fall a lot further .
And most important , it requires the realization that you have the power to stop the bloodletting .
There 's no law , rule or ethic that requires you to sit quietly and accept financial punishment passively .
You have every right — and every mechanism — to get your money to safety without remorse .
I have warned about this crisis repeatedly .
I have nagged , cajoled and shouted this message from the rooftops .
But it gives me no pleasure to see my dire warnings come true .
I have dreaded this day as often as I have predicted it .
I prayed it would not come to pass .
But now that it 's here , I have a new prayer :
That you are , or soon will be , out of danger and ready for the worst …
That the worst will strike swiftly and end swiftly …
That , once we hit bottom , no matter how ugly the future may appear , you , me and many others will have the fortitude to reinvest , help get our country back on its feet , and move on to better times .
Just promise me one thing :
No matter how dark this tunnel may seem , never forget it is not the end of the world .
Our country has been through worse before , and we survived .
We will survive this crisis too .
You hold your future in your hands .
At this landmark turning point in our history , it 's the choices you make today that will determine your fate — and the destiny of everyone that depends on you — for decades to come .
Your decisions now could make the difference between a successful career or a lifetime of struggle … retiring in dignity or becoming a ward of the state … enjoying wealth and health or risking poverty - stricken illness .
Whatever your choices may be , do not procrastinate .
And whenever you take action , do n't do so in haste .
Your response to the current crisis — or any new crisis that may ensue — should be both prompt and planned ; both bold and prudent .
I write to you each week to help you make that possible .
Here are your tasks in a nutshell :
Your first and most urgent priority is to survive the depression , while building the biggest pile of CASH you can .
Whether it's a molehill of pennies that you pinch from daily sacrifices or a mountain of dollars you squeeze out of asset sales , the more cash you can accumulate now , the better .
Your second priority is to make sure your cash is in the safest place possible .
That may not be the nearest bank or the biggest insurance company .
Short - term Treasury securities , despite their low yield , must be the primary vehicle .
Third , for the duration of this crisis , plus any new ones that may strike , your best friend and companion will be patience .
Do n't yield to the temptation of so - called “ bargains ” and “ big discounts ” from peak prices .
Many of those peak prices were a fiction from a bygone era that may never be seen again in my lifetime or yours .
Do n't jump in too soon .
You can afford to wait .
Indeed , just by waiting patiently , you can build wealth tremendously .
Fourth , I recognize that not everyone is able to follow all my instructions to the letter .
You may have real estate you cannot sell or a pension fund beyond you cannot control .
You may have bonds that have no market or a business that continues to provide income .
All could be assets that you must keep ; and yet , at the same time , all are assets that could be vulnerable to big losses in a continuing decline .
To untie that knotty dilemma , you may need a hedge — a protective shield that can help offset your losses .
Alternatively , if you are a risk - taker , those same hedges can be turned into pure profit opportunities during a market decline .
I hope you have already read and acted on the guide to hedging I sent you a while ago .
If not , the latest rally in the market gives you a great time to start .
( Click here to download the pdf file . )
Last , the big pay - off will come when we hit rock bottom and it's time to buy the greatest bargains of the century .
So recognizing the bottom can unlock the opportunity to boost your income , allowing you to buy some of the best assets in the world for a pittance and stake out the high ground for yourself , your children and generations to come .
I will do my utmost to alert you when the time comes .
Just remember that nothing is predetermined .
Right now , the tsunami of crisis seems unstoppable .
But in the foreseeable future , there will also come a singular moment in time when the worst of the storm has passed and the tides of history have ebbed , opening a window for you , me and our leaders to choose our own destiny .
Before then , let 's have a serious discussion about what the best — and worst — choices may be .
Good luck and God bless !

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
" There 's no doubt " that the deadly attack on India 's financial capital last month was planned inside Pakistan , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Sunday .
People in New Delhi , India , take part in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Mumbai attacks on Sunday .
Her comments to CNN's " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer " were the most definitive made by a top- ranking U.S. official regarding Pakistan 's connection to the November 26 - 29 attack on Mumbai , in which more than 170 were killed and hundreds of others were wounded .
" Well , I think there 's no doubt that Pakistani territory was used by probably non-state actors , " Rice said .
" I do n't think that there is compelling evidence of involvement of Pakistani officials .
But I do think that Pakistan has a responsibility to act , and it does n't matter that they 're non-state actors . "
Last week , Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan , both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States .
While in New Delhi , India , she called on Pakistan to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said " stateless actors " carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis , specifically blaming Lashkar - e- Tayyiba ( LeT ) , an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan .
U.S. counterterrorism officials say signs point to LeT , and they have n't seen anything to rule it out .
However , they have not definitively said the group is responsible .
U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said during an appearance Tuesday at Harvard University that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in Mumbai in 2006 -- though he did n't specifically name LeT .
LeT has denied any responsibility for the attacks , but a suspect in custody -- whom India has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by LeT , Indian authorities said .
India said its forces killed nine gunmen .
On Sunday , Rice said LeT and al Qaeda " tend to travel in the same circles , " though she declined to directly link either group to the Mumbai attack .
But she stressed that Pakistan is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders .
" Well , I do n't want to go into too much detail here because , obviously , in counterterrorism no one wants to tip the hand of what has happened here and what may happen in the future , " Rice said .
" The important thing now is to get these perpetrators and to prevent follow - on attacks .
And Pakistan 's cooperation , Pakistan 's action , is absolutely essential to doing that . "
Asked about possible ties between Pakistan 's government and LeT , Rice acknowledged " there have been historic ties -- there 's no doubt about that . "
" But Pakistan is a different place now with a civilian government and an army leadership that is working in concert to try to bring an end to extremism within Pakistan , " she said .
" We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism .
So whatever the history here , and there is a history , the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks . "

Obama 's positive press sets record ( I am not insane ! )
The Washington Times ^ | December 8 , 2008 | Jennifer Harper
Posted on by wac3rd
President - elect Barack Obama has received the most positive campaign news coverage on the main network news shows in the 20 - year history of such studies by the Center for Media and Public Affairs ( CMPA ) .
Mr. Obama received 68 percent positive evaluations from the four major networks , according to the study released Friday .
" Obama 's positive press is the strongest showing CMPA has ever recorded for a presidential candidate since we began monitoring election news in 1988 , " said Robert Lichter , director of the nonpartisan research group affiliated with George Mason University .
By contrast , his Republican rival almost set the record for hostile press coverage .
Just 33 percent of the stories on Sen. John McCain were positive in nature -- " the worst showing " since former President George H.W. Bush received only 29 percent positive press in 1988 , Mr. Lichter said .
The study analyzed 1,197 election stories from Aug. 23 to Nov. 4 on " ABC World News Tonight , " " NBC Nightly News , " " CBS Evening News " and the first half - hour of " Fox Special Report . "

They ’ve figured out to go highly positive on the socialist they always favor , and to relentlessly attack the Republican and the GOP VP candidate at the same time .
Their nitwit got elected but the MSM is as vapid and corrupt as he is .

Indeed , in much the same way a previous generation used phone trees and megaphones , Amy Balliet used Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about protests on Nov. 15 that drew tens of thousands of people in scores of cities and towns across the nation .
Ms. Balliet said the skills she used had been learned in her work at a search - engine marketing firm in Seattle .
“ I ’m good at driving traffic to Web sites ; that ’s what I do , ” said Ms. Balliet , 26 , who with a friend , Willow Witte , founded a group called Join the Impact last month .
She added that their impatience with the status quo had played a part .
“ We said : ‘ Why are we going to wait for the organizations to have a protest ?
They ’re going to have to go through all their bureaucracies to get approval .
Why do n’t we just do it ? ’ ”
The sudden burst of energy has drawn some comparisons to demonstrations during the early days of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s .
But Larry Kramer , the playwright and founder of ACT UP , which used confrontational tactics to fight for money for AIDS treatment and research , said advances in treating the disease had , somewhat incongruously , robbed the gay rights movement of broader political momentum .
“ For activism to work , you have to be scared and you have to be angry , ” Mr. Kramer said .
“ Nobody ’s frightened anymore .
The drugs have taken care of that . ”
Still , many current activists seem to be enrolled in crash courses in protest politics , with almost daily organizational meetings in cities across California .
Some also study the arc of the gay rights movement , which custom dates from the riots at the Stonewall Inn , a gay bar in Greenwich Village , in 1969 .
“ I see a lot more people reading history books now , ” Mr. Palazzolo said .
Quite a few activists said they had also been inspired by the acclaimed film “ Milk , ” which chronicles the fight by a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors , Harvey Milk ( played by Sean Penn ) , to beat back a 1978 ballot measure that would have barred gay teachers from California ’s public schools .
The " Rule of Thumb for Wife - Beating " Hoax Robert Sheaffer
Feminists often make that claim that the " rule of thumb " used to mean that it was legal to beat your wife with a rod , so long as that rod were no thicker than the husband 's thumb .
Thus , one constantly runs into assertions like this :
someone might want to be careful using " rule of thumb " in a sarcastic way .
my criminal law teacher at UCLA noted that rule of thumb started in England for punishing wives who cheated on their husbands .
the rule was that the rod used to beat them could not be thicker than one 's thumb ( ! ) .
However , Christina Hoff Sommers documents how the link between the phrase
" rule of thumb " and wifebeating is a feminist - inspired myth of recent vintage .
In her book " Who Stole Feminism " ( NY : Simon & Schuster , 1994 , p. 203 ) Sommers writes :
... The 'rule of thumb ' story is an example of revisionist history that feminists happily fell into believing .
It reinforces their perspective on society , and they tell it as a way of winning converts to their angry creed ...
The ' rule of thumb ' , however , turns out to be an excellent example of what may be called a feminist fiction .
Is is not to be found in William Blackstone 's treatise on English common law .
On the contrary , British law since the 1700s and our American laws predating the Revolution prohibit wife beating , though there have been periods and places in which the prohibition was only indifferently enforced .
That the phrase did not even originate in legal practice could have been ascertained by any fact - checker who took the trouble to look it up in the Oxford English Dictionary , which notes that the term has been used metaphorically for at least three hundred years to refer to any method of measurement or technique of estimation derived from experience rather than science .
According to Canadian folklorist Philip Hiscock , " The real explanation of ' rule of thumb ' is that it derives from wood workers ... who knew their trade so well they rarely or never fell back on the use of such things as rulers .
instead , they would measure things by , for example , the length of their thumbs . "
Hiscock adds that the phrase came into metaphorical use by the late seventeenth century .
Hiscock could not track the source of the idea that the term derives from a principle governing wife beating , but he believes it is an example of ' modern folklore ' and compares it to other ' back - formed explanations . ' such as the claim asparagus comes from ' sparrow - grass ' or that ' ring around the rosy ' is about the plague .
We shall see that Hiscock 's hunch was correct , but we must begin by exonerating William Blackstone ( 1723 -1780 ) , the Englishman who codified centuries of legal customs and practices into the elegant and clearly organized tome known as Commentaries on the Laws of England .
The Commentaries , a classic of legal literature , became the basis for the development of American law .
The so - called rule of thumb as a guideline for wife - beating does not occur in Blackstone 's compendium , although he does refer to an ancient law that permitted " domestic chastisement " ....
In America , there have been laws against wife beating since before the Revolution .
By 1870 , it was illegal in almost every state ; but even before then , wife - beaters were arrested and punished for assault and battery .
The historian and feminist Elizabeth Pleck observes in a scholarly article entitled " Wife - Battering in Nineteenth - Century America " :
It has often been claimed that wife - beating in nineteenth - century America was legal ...
Actually , though , several states passed statutes legally prohibiting wife - beating ; and at least one statute even predates the American Revolution .
The Massachusetts Bay Colony prohibited wife - beating as early as 1655 .
The edict states : " No man shall strike his wife nor any woman her husband on penalty of such fine not exceeding ten pounds for one offense , or such corporal punishment as the County shall determine . "
[ Pleck ] points out that punishments for wife - beaters could be severe : according to an 1882 Maryland statute , the culprit could receive forty lashes at the whipping post ; in Delaware , the number was thirty .
In New Mexico , fines ranging from $ 225 to $ 1000 were levied , or sentences of one to five years in prison imposed .
For most of our history , in fact , wife - beating has been considered a sin comparable to to thievery or adultery .
Religious groups -- especially Protestant groups such as Quakers , Methodists , and Baptists -- punished , shunned , and excommunicated wife - beaters .
Husbands , brothers , and neighbors often took vengence against the batterer .
Vigilante parties sometimes abducted wife - beaters and whipped them .
Just how did the false account originate , and how did it achieve authority and currency ?
As with many myths , there is a small core of fact surrounded by an accretion of error .
In the course of rendering rulings on cases before them , two Southern judges had alluded to an ' ancient law ' according to which a man could beat his wife as long as the implement was not wider than his thumb .
The judges , one from North Carolina and one from Mississippi , did not accept the authority of the ' ancient law . '
The North Carolina judge refered to it as ' barbarism , ' and both judges found the husband in the case in question guilty of wife abuse .
Nevertheless , their rulings seemed to tolerate the notion that men had a measure of latitude in physically chastising their wives .
Fortunately , as Pleck takes pains to remind us , they were not representative of judicial opinion in the rest of the country .
In 1976 , Del Martin , a coordinator of the N.O.W .
Task Force on Battered Women , came across a reference to the two judges and their remarks .
Neither judge had used the phrase " rule of thumb , " but a thumb had been mentioned , and Ms. Martin took note of it :
Our law , based upon the old English common - law doctrines , explicitly permitted wife - beating for correctional purposes .
However , certain restrictions did exist ...
For instance , the common - law doctrine had been modified to allow the husband " the right to whip his wife , provided that he used a switch no bigger than his thumb " -- a rule of thumb , so to speak .
Ms. Martin had not claimed that the term " rule of thumb " originated from common law .
Before long , however , the " ancient law " alluded to by two obscure Southern judges was being treated as an unchallenged principle of both British and American law , and journalists and academics alike were bandying the notion about .
Feminist Terry Davidson , in an article entitled " Wife Beating : A Recurring Phenomenon Throughout History , " claims that " one of the reasons nineteenth century British wives were dealt with so harshly by their husbands and by their legal system was the ' rule of thumb ' " and castigates Blackstone himself .
" Blackstone saw nothing unreasonable about the wife - beating law .
In fact , he believed it to be quite moderate . "
These interpretive errors were given added authority by a group of scholars and lawyers who , in 1982 , prepared a report on wife abuse for the United States Commission on Civil Rights , Under the Rule of Thumb : Battered Women and the Administration of Justice -- A Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights _.
On the second page , they note : " American law is built upon the British common law that condoned wife beating and even prescribed the weapon to be used .
This ' rule of thumb ' stipulated that a man could only beat his wife with a 'rod not thicker than his thumb . ' "
It went on to speak of Blackstone as the jurist who " greatly influenced the making of the law in the American colonies [ and who ] commented on the ' rule of thumb , ' " justifying the rule by noting that " the law thought it reasonable to intrust [ the husband ] with this power of ... chastisement , in the same moderation that a man is allowed to correct his apprentices or children . "
The publication of the report established the feminist fable about the origins of the term in popular lore , and the misogyny of Blackstone and " our law " as " fact . "
Misstatements about the " rule of thumb " still appear in the popular press .
The man who ran the servers for both the GOP candidate and the official Ohio election returns during the 2004 election has died hours ago in a plane crash outside of Akron - Canton Airport in Ohio .
Michael L. Connell was under subpoena and set to testify about alleged tampering of the 2004 election , according to a piece by Larisa Alexandrovna at rawstory.com .
Further , there are copies of what are represented as communications from Connell ’s attorneys claiming that GOP strategist Karl Rove had recently threatened Connell .
At post time , there is no mainstream pickup of the story and fewer than 1000 Diggs .
The tale of the Tundra and the San Antonio plant is part of a larger story of unprecedented juggling for Toyota , the biggest foreign car producer in the United States by far and a company long known for its skill in planning and execution .
Until recently , the company had been struggling to keep up with demand in North America .
But only a year and a half after the plant opened in late 2006 , gas prices soared to such heights that the pickup truck market crashed .
As inventories of Tundras ballooned this summer , Toyota suspended production at the plant for three months .
Now Tundras have begun rolling off the assembly line again , but with the economy reeling , even low gas prices have not revived sales .
Image Employees attended an exercise class at the plant .
Credit ... Michael Stravato for The New York Times
The Tundra was originally meant to be made here and at a plant in Indiana .
But as the truck market collapsed , Toyota decided to consolidate all its Tundra production in San Antonio and produce the Highlander S.U.V. at the Indiana plant .
Toyota further changed course with a plant under construction outside Tupelo , Miss. , that was supposed to build Highlanders , deciding to produce the Prius hybrid there instead .
But last week , with sales of even the Prius falling in the face of the economic downturn , Toyota decided to delay completion of the Mississippi plant indefinitely .
“ It tells you how drastic the change is in the economy and the auto industry , ” said Kirk Kohler , the San Antonio plant ’s general manager for administration and production control .
“ Even Toyota , which typically is very conservative and deliberative and makes decisions for the long term , even we did not see the change that was coming in the market . ”
Toyota executives say that the planning for the Texas and Mississippi plants happened at a time when sales of vehicles in the United States were 16 million a year .
That number is falling and may drop below 12 million in 2009 , meaning most of the big carmakers have too much production capacity .
The Palin revisionism continues in earnest from Robert Stacy McCain :
Yet somewhere between Bush ’s historic triumph in November 2004 ( when he became the first president since 1988 to be elected by a popular - vote majority ) and November 2006 , the wheels fell off the Permanent Republican Majority .
Suddenly , as if awakened from fairy - tale slumbers , conservative intellectuals began to regret that George W. Bush was not one of them .
Think about it .
Peggy Noonan , Christopher Buckley , David Frum — what is the thread that connects them ?
All worked as speechwriters : Noonan for Reagan , Buckley for Bush 41 , Frum for Bush 43 .
While these Republican wordsmiths had all praised Dubya ’s machismo magnificence when he was contrasted with such pompous rivals as Al Gore and John Kerry , the bloom fell off that rose after 2006 .
That born - again , down - to - earth , drawling Texas thing — somehow , it had once made Bush seem like Gary Cooper in High Noon .
But as the disasters mounted and the poll numbers headed southward , that Gary Cooper glow faded and these conservative intellectuals turned on their TVs to behold , with unspeakable horror , President Jethro Bodine .
Thus their reaction to Sarah Palin .
While the Republican Party grassroots looked at Palin and saw an American Margaret Thatcher ( except much sexier ) , the conservative intellectuals looked at her and saw . . . Vice President Ellie Mae Clampett .
Look , I voted for Bush twice , and quickly came to regret it , so I am not going to pick on people who are belatedly figuring out Bush was and is a disaster .
After all , what would be the point of picking on someone who is only a marginally slower learner than me ?
But the Palin revisionism has got to stop .
Palin ’s problems were HER fault , not the fault of her handlers , not the fault of a liberal media , and most certainly not the fault of George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals . ”
The reason folks saw VP Ellie Mae Clampett was not because of residual Bush hatred or because they were projecting Bush ’s failures onto Palin , but because of Palin ’s own actions .
To my knowledge , George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t force her to lie on the stump for several weeks straight with her “ thanks , but no thanks ” line about the Bridge to Nowhere .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t take part in the prep work before her disastrous Gibson interview , and Bush probably could have been counted on to give a marginally better description of the Bush doctrine ( and , in fact , “ conservative intellectuals ” actually prostituted themselves out to provide Palin cover for her gaffe ) .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t tell Palin to say all the stupid things she said to Katie Couric .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t buy her two hundred grand worth of clothing and force her to wear it .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t tell her to ignore every question at the debate and instead ramble on inanely about whatever her talking points were .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” did n’t get Palin to whip up McCain / Palin crowds into something that resembled a modern day Triumph of the Will .
George Bush and the “ conservative intellectuals ” are n’t responsible for Palin ’s muddled answer about Hamas .
And on and on .
One person is responsible for all that , and her name is Sarah Palin .
Maybe you could ding George Bush for being such a disaster that people are no longer going to put up with this kind of idiocy , and maybe you could ding George Bush for creating a political climate that is inhospitable for incoherent rambling redneck know - nothings .
But you ca n’t blame George Bush or the “ conservative intellectuals ” for Sarah Palin being , well , Sarah Palin .
Vice President Ellie Mae Clampett is a product of one person , and that person is Sarah Palin .
Moving along , McCain moves from the merely silly to the absurd :
Just as the conservative intellectuals once projected their hopes onto Dubya , now they project their disappointments onto Sarah .
But the fault is theirs , not hers .
And Sarah has something the intellectuals do n’t have — an army .
Brother , I ’ve seen that army .
So you can take your David Frums and your David Brookses , and let Sarah take that army and , by God , we ’ll see whose Republican Party this is .
We know full well whose party it is , and that is why it is President - elect Obama and moderates and independents fled to the Democratic party in 2008 .
And please stop with the Reagan comparisons .
Reagan , for whatever faults he may have had , spent the better part of several decades repeatedly enunciating his beliefs .
You may not have agreed with his vision for America , but he had one .
Sarah Palin , by contrast , ran Wasilla into debt , sent a load of checks to Alaskans as governor while creating several scandals , and then spent three months on the trail winkin ’ and not blinkin’ while mumbling something about “ socialists ” and “ thanks but no thanks ” and “ pals around with terrorists . ”
You guys keep running with that .
We ’ll see how that works out .
*** Update ***
This :
Now Palin is hiring her own handlers , making her own decisions , speaking freely .
And if anything , the results are even worse than they were in 2008 .
Watch the Ziegler interview yourself , and you will see what I mean .
Ziegler represented a new and subtle kind of danger for Palin , the overly friendly interview .
Ziegler ’s questions were all traps , no less dangerous for being set unwittingly .
Palin stumbled into every one .
Again and again , Ziegler invited Palin to engage in self - pity and self - excuse – and again and again she accepted .
I wonder who they will blame for her decisions now ?

Oh no !!!
You ca n't get on Facebook at school !!
As we speak , I 'm mobilizing all of my techs to search for an answer for you .
We 'll be sure to make it free , otherwise you 'd have to lose more points by asking how to get a crack , serial number or keygen for it .
After all , if something takes my time up and works well , it 's kind of selfish of me to charge for it .
We 'll have the answer for you shortly , so do n't despair !
I mean , why should you bore yourself with learning and studying and real life social interaction while you 're at school ???
The thought of that is absurd .
Seriously , do n't bother .
Thanks to places like Myspace , Facebook , etc we seem to have an upcoming generation that does nothing in school but spend time talking to online friends .
Thusly , their education level will be soooo far below my own that I virtually never have to worry about a smarter , younger replacement taking my job .
And that just plain ROCKS .

MADISON --
There are many ways to die , but amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease must be one of the worst .
By the time a patient notices muscle weakness , the neurons that control the muscles have already begun dying , in an untreatable process that brings death within two to five years .
In a series of experiments reported today in the Journal of Neuroscience , a University of Wisconsin - Madison pharmacy researcher was able to prolong life and slow nerve deterioration in a mouse with a genetic form of ALS , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .
Marcelo Vargas , a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Jeff Johnson , professor in the School of Pharmacy , tested mice that carried an extra gene that pushed support cells for the neurons into overdrive , causing them to pump out extra quantities of the anti- oxidant glutathione .
The gene in question , called Nrf2 , has long been a research focus for Johnson , who is also a Waisman Center investigator .
Although oxidation is a major cause of cell death in Parkinson 's disease and Alzheimer 's disease as well as ALS , antioxidant treatments have failed to slow these diseases .
But the mice with extra copies of Nrf2 produced glutathione right alongside the vulnerable neurons , and that made all the difference , says Johnson .
These special mice were engineered in collaboration with Albee Messing , a professor in the UW - Madison School of Veterinary Medicine and also an investigator at the Waisman Center .
" It 's extremely difficult to increase glutathione in the central nervous system , " Johnson says .
" You ca n't just shoot it into people or animals .
But we found a 25 percent increase in the molecule in the spinal cords . "
Although the mice did eventually die of ALS , they lived longer , and the disease appeared 17 days later than in mice that lacked the extra Nrf2 gene , Johnson says .
" This was a very aggressive model of ALS , so a life extension of 21 days is thought to be pretty significant , roughly equivalent to five to 10 years in human patients . "
The inserted Nrf2 gene was only active in support cells called astrocytes , which promote health among the neurons that actually carry nerve signals , Johnson explains .
" We have taken this normal function of producing antioxidants and added to it .
It 's like putting the astrocytes on steroids . "
Experiments performed on mouse astrocytes and nerve cells in a dish confirmed the source of the protection , Johnson adds .
" We can completely reverse the toxicity of the sick astrocytes .
The mutated protein that causes ALS is still there , but Nrf2 makes glutathione that completely blocks it . "
Although the mice that Johnson tested carried the inherited form of ALS , most patients do not have an inherited disease .
However , Johnson says the mice are still a good testbed for ALS treatments .
" The endpoints that we are blocking , including death of neurons and separation of neurons from the muscle , are seen in all forms of ALS ; that 's what makes this so exciting .
We are not targeting the mutant protein that causes the disease ; we are targeting the astrocytes ' mechanism that preserves the neurons .
The mutant protein is still in all cells of the spinal cord ; we are just over - expressing the Nrf2 gene -- causing it to make more glutathione -- and that provides the protection . "
Nrf2 activates a system , or pathway , that is also attracting interest from researchers working on Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , Huntington 's disease and stroke , says Johnson .
" It 's been exciting .
This hypothesis came to me when I was in graduate school in 1990 , and this year it seems to be coming to fruition " as a possible treatment for several neurodegenerative diseases .
The results may be promising , but inserting genes , or gene therapy , has had few successes to date .
Yet by positively identifying the chemical pathway that keeps neurons healthy in ALS , Johnson is in a position to search for a drug that can enter the brain and activate the Nrf2 system .
That quest is already under way at an automated screening facility at UW - Madison , where more than 50,000 molecules are being tested for their ability to activate Nrf2 .
Years of research will be needed before today 's results can be translated into a treatment for patients , however .
" If everything worked perfectly , we probably could have something in two to three years , but the odds of that happening are pretty low , " says Johnson .
" But in five to eight years , I hope to have something can get through all the regulatory hoops . "
Finding that one mechanism is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases is significant , Johnson says , because it attracts a broader group of scientists and funders to the work .
" Something seems to be going wrong with the neurons because the astrocyte does not function right .
Now , it looks like we have the potential to fix the astrocyte , so it can preserve the neurons for a longer period . "

[ Please sign the petition HERE against the attack on freedom of speech in Thailand , which the use of lese majeste represents . ]
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
January 20 , 2009 -- Today , the police informed me that I have been charged with lese majeste because of eight paragraphs in Chapter 1 of my book A Coup for the Rich .
The paragraphs are listed below .
According to the police charge sheet , the charges arise from the fact that the director of Chulalongkorn University bookshop decided to inform the police Special Branch that my book " insulted the Monarchy " .
The bookshop is managed by the academic management of the university .
So much for academic freedom !
Paragraphs from A Coup for the Rich that are deemed to have " insulted the Monarchy " :
(1) The major forces behind the 19th September coup were anti-democratic groups in the military and civilian elite , disgruntled business leaders and neo-liberal intellectuals and politicians .
The coup was also supported by the Monarchy .
What all these groups have in common is contempt and hatred for the poor .
For them , " too much democracy " gives " too much " power to the poor electorate and encourages governments to " over - spend " on welfare .
For them , Thailand is divided between the " enlightened middle - classes who understand democracy " and the " ignorant rural and urban poor " .
In fact , the reverse is the case .
It is the poor who understand and are committed to democracy while the so - called middle classes are determined to hang on to their privileges by any means possible .
(2) The junta claimed that they had appointed a " civilian " Prime Minister .
Commentators rushed to suck up to the new Prime Minister , General Surayud , by saying that he was a " good and moral man " .
In fact , Surayud , while he was serving in the armed forces in 1992 , was partly responsible for the blood bath against unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators [ 1 ] .
He personally led a group of 16 soldiers into the Royal Hotel which was a temporary field hospital .
Here , his soldiers beat and kicked people [ 2 ] .
News reports from the BBC and CNN at the time show soldiers walking on top of those who were made to lie on the floor .
Three months after the 2006 coup , on the 4th December , the King praised Prime Minister Surayud in his annual birthday speech .
(3) The members of the military appointed parliament received monthly salaries and benefits of almost 140,000 baht while workers on the minimum wage receive under 5000 baht per month and many poor farmers in villages live on even less .
These parliamentarians often drew on multiple salaries .
The government claimed to be following the King 's philosophy of " Sufficiency " and the importance of not being greedy .
Apparently everyone must be content with their own level of Sufficiency , but as Orwell might have put it , some are more " Sufficient " than others .
For the Palace , " Sufficiency " means owning a string of palaces and large capitalist conglomerates like the Siam Commercial Bank .
For the military junta it means receiving multiple fat cat salaries and for a poor farmer it means scratching a living without modern investment in agriculture .
The Finance Minister explained that Sufficiency Economics meant " not too much and not too little " : in other words , getting it just right .
No wonder Paul Handley described Sufficiency Economics as " pseudo-economics " [ 3 ] !
In addition to this , the junta closed the Taksin government 's Poverty Reduction Centre , transferring it to the office of the Internal Security Operations Command and transforming it into a rural development agency using Sufficiency Economics [ 4 ] .
(4) It should not be taken for granted that the anti-Taksin military - bureaucratic network is a network led by or under the control of the Monarchy , despite any Royal connections that it might have .
Paul Handley argues that the Monarchy is all powerful in Thai society and that its aim is to be a just ( Thammaracha ) and Absolute Monarch [ 5 ] .
For Handley , Taksin was challenging the Monarchy and seeking to establish himself as " president " .
There is little evidence to support the suggestion that Taksin is a republican .
There is also ample evidence in Handley 's own book that there are limitations to the Monarchy 's power .
Never the less , Handley 's suggestion that the 19th September coup was a Royal Coup , reflects a substantial body of opinion in Thai society .
(5) The Monarchy over the last 150 years has shown itself to be remarkably adaptable to all circumstances and able to gain in stature by making alliances with all sorts of groups , whether they be military dictatorships or elected governments .
The Monarchy may have made mild criticisms of the Taksin government , but this did not stop the Siam Commercial Bank , which is the Royal bank , from providing funds for the sale of Taksin 's Shin Corporation to Temasek holdings [ 6 ] .
Nor should it be assumed that Taksin and Thai Rak Thai were somehow " anti-Royalist " .
For over 300 years the capitalist classes in many countries have learnt that conservative Constitutional Monarchies help protect the status quo under capitalism and hence their class interests .
However , it is also clear that the Thai King is more comfortable with military dictatorships than with elected governments .
This explains why the Monarchy backed the 19 September coup .
(6) In April 2006 the present Thai Monarch stated on the issue of the use of Section 7 [ 7 ] that : " I wish to reaffirm that section 7 does not mean giving unlimited power to the Monarch to do as he wishes …
Section 7 does not state that the Monarch can make decisions on everything … if that was done people would say that the Monarch had exceeded his duties .
I have never asked for this nor exceeded my duties .
If this was done it would not be Democracy . " [ 8 ]
However , by September and certainly by December , the King publicly supported the coup .
(7) For this reason there is a very important question to ask about the 19th September 2006 coup .
Did the Thai Head of State try to defend Democracy from the military coup which destroyed the 1997 Constitution on the 19th September ?
Was the Head of State forced to support the military junta ?
Did he willingly support those who staged the coup ?
Did he even plan it himself , as some believe ?
These are important questions because the military junta who staged the coup and destroyed Democracy have constantly claimed legitimacy from the Head of State .
Starting in the early days of the coup they showed pictures of the Monarchy on TV , they tied yellow Royalist ribbons on their guns and uniforms and asked the Head of State to send his representative to open their military appointed parliament .
Later in his annual birthday speech in December , the King praised the military Prime Minister .
We need the truth in order to have transparency and in order that Civil Society can make all public institutions accountable .
What we must never forget is that any institution or organisation which refuses to build transparency can only have conflicts of interest which it wishes to hide .
(8) In the early part of his reign the Monarch was young and unprepared for the job .
He only became King because of an accident which happened to his elder brother .
More than that , the Thai government at the time was headed by General Pibun who was an anti-Royalist .
Therefore the Monarchy faced many problems in performing its duties as Head of State .
This helps perhaps to explain why the Monarchy supported the military dictatorship of Field Marshall Sarit .
It is Sarit who was partly responsible for promoting and increasing respect for the Monarchy [ 9 ] .
But many years have passed .
The status and experience of the Thai Head of State have changed .
The Monarch has much political experience , more than any politician , due to the length of time on the Throne .
Therefore the Monarch today exhibits the confidence of one who has now gained much experience .
For example , he chastised elected governments , like that of Prime Minister Taksin .
The important question for today therefore is : if the Monarch can chastise the Taksin government over the human rights abuses in the War on Drugs [ 10 ] , why can not the Monarch chastise the military for staging a coup and abusing all democratic rights ?
Our worst financial crisis in living memory was the asset price boom of the late 1980s and its bursting in the early 1990s .
Two significant banks failed , as did the second biggest building society , the biggest credit union , three merchant banks , a mortgage trust and a friendly society .
You have to go back to the 1890s to find a worse period of financial failure in Australia .
On this occasion , our banks remain well - capitalised , profitable and not exposed to subprime mortgages .
Mortgage arrears in Australia are miniscule by world standards .
That does not mean we will not suffer from world events , nor that some businesses will not get into difficulty .
Returning to the international scene , a number of explanations have been put forward for the severity of this crisis , starting with greed .
But greed has always been with us , like original sin .
My approach is to identify an observable excess and see what forces produced it .
The two clear candidates are the degree of leverage in the financial system and the extent of bad loans .
To my mind it is the former which was the main culprit , though the latter was also important .
It is now apparent the degree of leverage ( also known as gearing ) in the system was grossly excessive , not , for the most part , in the non-financial corporate sector or the plain vanilla commercial banks .
But there were few , if any , constraints on investment banks , hedge funds , investment banking arms of large commercial banks ( think Citi and UBS ) , private equity , derivative instruments and other parts of " the shadow banking system " .
Increasing leverage is the easiest way to increase returns in a rising market , and there were incentives to chase these returns and to ignore or downplay the risks .
The biggest misdirected incentive was the performance - based pay which awarded massive bonuses to management of financial institutions on the basis of short - term profit results .
Annual bonuses in the millions of dollars were not returnable when the short - term profits were lost in subsequent years .
Highly - geared entities ignored or downplayed the risks .
It was easy to do so because there appeared to be an unlimited amount of credit available , and it would always be easy to roll over maturing debt .
But once doubts emerged about whether a highly leveraged illiquid asset was a going concern , the funding quickly dried up .
If I have doubts about your solvency , I will not lend to you no matter how high the apparent rate of return .
Another factor behind the excessive risk taking was the mistaken belief you should be able to achieve double digit rates of return on an investment portfolio .
It is true in the most buoyant periods of the 1980s and 1990s , those sort of nominal returns seemed to be effortlessly achieved , but they should be viewed as the exception rather than the rule .
In more normal times such returns can only be achieved by taking very large risks , and then generally only for short periods .
The average return on a diversified investment portfolio should be closely tied to the growth rate of nominal gross domestic product .
In Australian terms , at present this means an average return of about 6 per cent .
We will just have to get used tolong - run returns being a lot lower than was expected , based on the buoyant years of the 1980s and 1990s .
The task of regulatory reform will be made easier by the fact that some of the worst excesses of the recent past are being taken care of by the market and the passage of time .
The class of institution known as an investment bank is now extinct , the hedge fund industry will probably shrink to a quarter of its former size and the off balance sheet vehicles of commercial banks have disappeared .
We have to concede there was also regulatory failure , particularly in the US .
Partly this is a result of their very fragmented regulatory framework , but partly it is also a result of insufficient scepticism on the part of regulators about what was going on .
They placed too much faith in " science " and not enough in history .

Desmond Tutu : " Homophobia equals apartheid "
Archbishop Desmond Tutu :
« We treat them as pariahs . » © Graeme Williams / Tutu Trust / afrol News
Desmond Tutu , the former Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Price winner , has lent his name to the fight against homophobia in Africa and around the world .
The prominent South African says homophobia is a " crime against humanity " and " every bit unjust " as apartheid .
The former head of the Anglican Church in Southern Africa made these statements at the launching of the book " Sex , Love & Homophobia " , published last week by Amnesty International UK .
Mr Tutu has written the foreword to the human rights group 's book .
- We struggled against apartheid in South Africa , supported by people the world over , because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about ; our very skins , wrote the prominent Church leader .
" It is the same with sexual orientation .
It is a given , " he added .
Mr Tutu says he could not have fought against the discrimination of apartheid and not also fight against the discrimination which homosexuals endure .
" And I am proud that in South Africa , when we won the chance to build our own new constitution , the human rights of all have been explicitly enshrined in our laws , " he said , adding that he hoped this soon would also be the case in other countries .
South Africa is so far the only country in the world where the constitution guarantees equal rights non-regarding sexual orientation .
This is in stark contrast to most of South Africa 's neighbour countries , where homosexulality often is punished by the penal code .
Only recenty , a Botswana High Court ruling reaffirmed this legal practice .
- Yet , all over the world , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people are persecuted , writes Archbishop Tutu .
" We treat them as pariahs and push them outside our communities .
We make them doubt that they too are children of God - and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy .
We blame them for what they are , " he adds .
He also regrets the dominant view among his church colleagues .
" Churches say that the expression of love in a heterosexual monogamous relationship includes the physical , the touching , embracing , kissing , the genital act - the totality of our love makes each of us grow to become increasingly godlike and compassionate .
If this is so for the heterosexual , what earthly reason have we to say that it is not the case with the homosexual ? "
Mr Tutu asks .
Also within the Anglican Church , homosexuality is highly controversial and an ongoing conflict has threatened to split the global Anglican Communion .
The current head of the Anglican Church in Southern Africa , Njongonkulu Ndungane , has been an outspoken supporter of including homosexuals in the Church community , putting himself in a strong - worded conflict with other African Church leaders .
In its new book , Amnesty reports on the life stories of gay and lesbian people around the world .
These include Poliyana Mangwiro who was a leading member of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe despite President Robert Mugabe 's protestations that homosexuality is " against African traditions " .
The book also includes the story of Simon Nkoli , a South African ANC activist who after spending four years in prison under apartheid went on to be the face of the struggle for gay rights in the new South Africa .
Further , stories of hate , fear and persecution are reported from Nigeria , Egypt and other countries , in addition to reports from the states where homosexuality punishable by death ; including Sudan , Mauritania and some Northern Nigerian states .
For Archishop Tutu , these " destructive forces " of " hatred and prejudice " are an evil .
" A parent who brings up a child to be a racist damages that child , damages the community in which they live , damages our hopes for a better world .
A parent who teaches a child that there is only one sexual orientation and that anything else is evil denies our humanity and their own too , " Mr Tutu concludes .

Taking A Shower Improves Moral Judgment - Study
The next time you have to make a difficult moral decision , you might think twice about mulling it over in the bath or shower .
New research in Psychological Science has found that the physical notion of cleanliness significantly reduces the severity of moral judgments showing that intuition , rather than deliberate reasoning , can influence our perception of what is right and wrong .
Lead researcher , Simone Schnall , University of Plymouth , explains the relevance of the findings to everyday life ; “ When we exercise moral judgment , we believe we are making a conscious , rational decision , but this research shows that we are subconsciously influenced by how clean or ‘ pure ’ we feel .
“ Take for example the situation of a jury member or voting in an election - if the jury member had washes their hands prior to delivering their verdict , they may judge the crime less harshly . ”
Similarly , someone may find it easier to overlook a political misdemeanor had they performed an action that made them feel ‘ clean ’ prior to casting their vote . ”
The research was conducted through two experiments with university students .
In the first , they were asked to complete a scrambled sentence task involving 40 sets of four words each .
By underlining any three words , a sentence could be formed .
For the neutral condition , the task contained 40 sets of neutral words , but for the cleanliness condition , half of the sets contained words such as ‘ pure , washed , clean , immaculate , and pristine ’ .
The participants were then asked to rate a series of moral dilemmas including keeping money found inside a wallet , putting false information on a resume and killing a terminally ill plane crash survivor in order to avoid starvation .
The second experiment saw the students watch a ‘ disgusting ’ film clip before rating the same moral dilemmas .
However , half the group were asked to first wash their hands .
The findings from both experiments demonstrated that those who were subject to the cognitive feeling of cleanliness exercised less severe moral judgment than their counterparts .
Scores 's menu of nudity and sex has not always guaranteed its financial success , at least not accounting for the under - the - table cost of forking out for mafia " protection " .
Scores , which opened on East 60th Street in 1991 , sought to trade out of bankruptcy a decade ago after making pay - offs to the Gambino crime family of $ 1.6 million .
An FBI probe into the extortion resulted in a prison term for John " Junior " Gotti , and the club 's original owners being admitted to a witness protection program until they , too , were jailed on fraud charges .
But until this week Scores had survived the police raids , rezoning attempts to curtail adult entertainment and the killings of a waiter and a bouncer during an early morning party in 1996 , when the club was widely regarded as a Mafia hangout .
The club is still promoting its " diamond dollars " , which are used in - house to buy lap dances , but the end is near , a co-owner , Elliot Osher , has told US media .
Even if it was always on the periphery of prostitution and touched by violence , Scores managed to glamorise and even normalise tabletop dancing with a publicity campaign of gossip column sightings of celebrities .
The actors Russell Crowe , Colin Farrell and Lindsay Lohan were reported as regulars in the self - proclaimed " man 's paradise " of juicy steaks , fat cigars and naked women .
George Clooney had a birthday party there .
Madonna was a regular in its early days .
Rudd was introduced to this masculine fantasy by the Australian editor of the New York Post , Col Allan , in 2003 .
Rudd was the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs at the time .
News of the visit briefly threw Labor 's election campaign last year , although Osher said Rudd left soon after realising the sort of club he was visiting .
Explaining his attendance , Rudd said he had had too much to drink when Allan suggested visiting the club .
" With the benefit of hindsight , I should not have gone on for a further drink , " he said .
While Rudd escaped unscathed from his brush with Scores , others who stayed longer were not so lucky .
The club has been hit with writs from customers who woke the morning after with six - figure credit card bills .
A Missouri businessman , Robert McCormick , ran up a bill of $ 370,000 on his corporate charge card in one drunken splurge at Scores .
While he did have the help of three friends , McCormick claimed he spent a mere $ 30,000 and his company claimed he was a victim of fraud .
American Express , which paid out on the bill , then sued McCormick for the money .
A Bangladeshi diplomat to the United Nations was recalled home after her husband , Tauhidul Chaudhury , ran up a bill of almost $ 200,000 at Scores East .
For his money , Chaudhury bought bottles of Dom Perignon and Krug and lap dances from a harem of more than a dozen strippers .
And he tipped lavishly .
That , supposedly , is an every night occurrence , according to a club spokesman who justified such hefty bills with the claim that high rollers tipped up to $ 15,000 for dances .
But Chaudhury regretted his generosity and sued the club over the bill , claiming it had taken advantage of his drunkenness .
Still another customer sued Scores over a bill of almost $ 40,000 .
Dozens of staff , including a barman and strippers , have also sued the club because management was allegedly raking off a percentage of their tips .
Maybe it is something about Scores 's somewhat seedy location , under the grimy steel stanchions of the Queensboro Bridge , but new owners , without the liquor licence problems confronting Scores management , are already in place to take over the site .
CEO ’s see the benefit so early they never even notice it .
For the very successful , the key date may have been in May or June .
But for most very successful Americans , when the cool weather rolls in and the Christmas music starts , they have another reason to celebrate : their pay increases .
Their employers have n’t decided to be extra generous in November or December , but their pay will step up by over 6 % for a few weeks or months .
The more you make , the longer your pay increases .
Why does this happen ?
They exceed the Federal Insurance Corporation of America ( Social Security ) tax threshold .
For those not familiar with how Social Security payroll taxes work , workers pay 6.2 % of their salary in FICA taxes up to an indexed threshold ( $ 102,000 in 2008 ) .
Their employers pay a matching tax .
When your salary exceeds that value , you and your employer do n’t have to pay anymore .
For the average American worker with a 2006 median salary of $ 33,634 this is n’t much of a concern , but for the best paid workers in our society , it ’s a great benefit .
Making $ 10 K a month before taxes ?
Expect your pay to go up $ 600 / month in November and December .
Of course if you make that kind of money , an additional $ 1,200 might not mean much , but still it ’s nice that the government is thinking of you .
The reality is that Social Security tax is tremendously regressive .
There are no reductions to salary for Social Security tax purposes .
No personal exemptions , no childcare deductions , no way to claim business expenses .
A household with $ 65 K / yr in salary and $ 20 K in tax deductions can expect to pay more in Social Security taxes than income taxes .
For the working poor , Social Security taxes may be the only payroll taxes they pay , but they pay at the same rate as someone making $ 100 K / yr and at a higher rate than someone making more than that since the tax stops after the first $ 100,000 .
You ca n’t even combine incomes .
Two income households may make more than the threshold combined , but the Social Security tax is levied on each salary .
On the other hand , if you get your income from non-salary activities , you pay nothing .
Flip houses for a living ?
No 6.2 % tax on long or short term capital gains .
Work in a factory ?
Pay up .
Raking in the dividends ?
No Social Security taxes required .
Independent operator like a contractor or physical therapist ?
Pay up twice since you have to make both your contribution and the employer contribution .
This system was justified by saying that the benefit you eventually receive from Social Security is somewhat proportional to the amount contributed .
Those with higher incomes will receive more when they retire , but since the benefit is capped , the contribution should be capped as well .
The fallacy in that argument is that Social Security is not a retirement program .
It is an integral part of our social safety net that ensures that Americans who spent their lives contributing to our country will not be completely destitute in their declining years .
There has been a lot of talk over the last few years about when Social Security will “ run out of money . ”
Social Security funds have been commingled with general Treasury funds for years and the government will not let such a successful system fail , but there is an opportunity to reconfigure the Social Security tax system to improve fairness and ensure it is self funding .
First , get rid of the income cap .
This is not a retirement system , so stop treating it like it is .
Second , move to a more progressive system on the tax rate .
A fixed percentage may have been the best solution in 1935 , but our existing pay systems can easily handle a slightly more complicated scheme that takes some of the burden off of our lowest paid citizens .
The Social Security program has been one of the most successful programs ever to be implemented in the United States .
It has n’t eliminated elderly poverty , but it has ensured that the majority of elderly Americans have some fallback position .
That does n’t mean it ca n’t be improved , but plans like Bush ’s retirement savings accounts are the wrong way to go .
Rather than pretending that Social Security is like a 401K , let ’s admit that Social Security is a vital part of our national safety net and improve it from that standpoint to ensure that it remains well funded and operating for a long time to come .
New York —
The UN General Assembly on October 29 approved by an overwhelming majority the resolution demanding an end of the US blockade of Cuba , a vote passed by the assembly for the 17th consecutive year , news agencies report .
Of the 192 UN member states , 185 voted in favour of the resolution , while three voted against ( the United States , Israel and Palau ) and two abstained ( Marshall Islands and Micronesia ) .
With this result , Cuba gained another vote this year compared to 2007 , when 184 voted in favour , four against ( the United States , Israel , Palau and the Marshall Islands ) and Micronesia abstained .
The resolution calling for an end to the blockade has been approved on 16 occasions with backing that has grown from 59 votes in 1992 to the 185 today .
Before the vote , Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Pérez Roque spoke before the General Assembly and noted the special situation in which this resolution is taking place , an economic crisis that is being internationally felt and above all , the imminent US elections which , he observed , will produce a new president who " will have to decide whether the blockade is a failed policy . "
" You are alone , isolated , " said the foreign minister , addressing President George W. Bush .
Pérez ’ speech was loudly applauded by the General Assembly .

Sixty - third General Assembly
Plenary
33rd Meeting ( AM )
FOR SEVENTEENTH CONSECUTIVE
YEAR , GENERAL ASSEMBLY OVERWHELMINGLY CALLS FOR END TO UNITED STATES ECONOMIC , TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA
Vote on Resolution 185 in Favour to 3 Against , with 2 Abstentions ;
Cuba ’s Foreign Minister Says Embargo Breaches ‘ Elemental ’ Rules International Law
The United Nations General Assembly once again today adopted a resolution calling on the United States to end its 46 - year - old trade embargo against Cuba , following a debate , during which many delegates emphasized how the measure had only intensified the human suffering created by successive hurricanes that struck the island nation and wider Caribbean region earlier this year .
By the resolution , adopted in a recorded vote of 185 in favour to 3 against ( Israel , Palau , United States ) , with 2 abstentions ( Federated States of Micronesia , Marshall Islands ) , the 192 - member Assembly urged the lifting of the stiff commercial , financial and economic sanctions that were slapped on Cuba in the aftermath of the Cold War .
This marked the seventeenth year the Assembly had adopted similar resolution on this issue .
A burst of applause greeted the Assembly ’s passage of text that again reaffirmed the sovereign equality of States , the non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs , and the freedom of international trade and navigation .
The resolution reiterated its call upon all States to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures such as that promulgated in the 1996 “ Helms - Burton Act ” .
That would be in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law .
Further , the text once again urged States that continued to apply such laws and measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible , in accordance with their legal regime .
As he introduced the resolution , Felipe Pérez Roque , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba , said the Assembly ’s consideration took place under very special circumstances : barely a few months after successive powerful hurricanes had buffeted Cuba ; amid global economic and financial crises ; and just six days before the United States voters headed to the polls to elect a new President .
In contrast to the ample solidarity received in the Assembly , the United States Government had responded with its customary cynicism and hypocrisy .
“ The Bush Administration has lied , yet again , to the international community , ” said Mr. Roque .
If the United States Government was truly concerned about the Cuban people ’s well - being , the only moral and ethical behaviour would be to lift the blockade , which it had imposed in violation of the most elemental regulations of international law and the United Nations Charter .
Openly contemptuous of the international community ’s will and 16 consecutive Assembly resolutions , the United States adopted new and tougher economic sanctions against Cuba over the past year , Mr. Roque charged .
It had unleashed a “ mad hunt ” against Cuba ’s international financial transactions , for example , and its viciousness even reached to the blocking of Internet sites with ties to Cuba .
At the same time , the United States had increased its financial and material support for actions to overthrow the Cuban constitutional order .
Speaking before the Cuban Foreign Minster , the representative of the United States said each Member State had the sovereign right to conduct trade with another country as it saw fit , subject only to its treaty obligations .
That was a bilateral issue stemming from the United States ’ efforts to mitigate the impact of the Cuban government ’s repressive policies against its own people .
The United States believed it was highly inappropriate for the Assembly to consider this resolution .
There was no doubt that the Member States gathered here today would vigorously defend their right to determine their own national trade policy if it was questioned , he added .
In addition , United States trade policy towards Cuba was carefully designed to give Cubans access to food and humanitarian goods , as it limited the ability of Cuba ’s repressive Government to consolidate power through its authoritarian control over the Cuban economy .
In response to the numerous statements concerning the impact of the recent hurricanes on a country already suffering economically under the embargo , he said that the United States had been especially sensitive to the plight of the Cuban people .
The Government had offered , on four separate occasions , to provide the Cuban people with up to $ 5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance .
The Cuban Government had rejected the offers , he said .
He also noted that United States law permitted the sale of medicine , medical supplies and agricultural products to Cuba , and the United States was Cuba ’s top supplier of food .
South Africa ’s delegate said 2009 would mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Cuban revolution .
He recognized Cuba ’s notable work around the world in the health , education and biotechnology fields .
In addition , the island nation had helped developing countries , including South Africa , correct their skills shortages with bilateral cooperation projects .
In its explanation of vote , the French delegate spoke on behalf of the European Union and said United States trade policy towards Cuba was a bilateral issue .
Yet , his delegation had clearly opposed the extraterritorial extension of the embargo , as contained in the Cuban Democracy Act and the Helms - Burton Act .
The goal of the European Union ’s policy towards Cuba , outlined in a 1996 Common Position , was to encourage a peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy , with respect for human rights and improved living standards .
Last June , the European Union had decided to lift restrictive measures against Cuba and had proposed a dialogue , without preconditions , to authorities in Havana .
The Cuban Government accepted this offer and a 16 October ministerial meeting addressed all issues of common interest , including human rights .
The European Union expected concrete action from Cuban authorities in this area .
The representative of Venezuela said the United States Government had repeatedly disdained the majority will of the Assembly and had refused to heed worldwide clamour against its embargo .
That showed the need to reform the United Nations so Assembly resolutions were welcomed and respected by all States .
The enduring embargo ran counter to “ the spirit of our times ” , and the measures were “ undeniably a criminal mechanism ” , meant to force a country and a people to submit through hunger and disease , he added .
For more than four decades , the imperialist Government had flagrantly violated the rights of the people , and the rights and norms of international law that governed relations among States .
This was the seventeenth year that the United Nations had considered the issues in this resolution , the representative of St. Vincent and the Grenadines said .
When the debate began in 1992 , it had seemed an apt postscript to a troubling chapter in world history , as the Berlin Wall had fallen two years earlier , the Soviet Union had disbanded , and the so - called “ Iron Curtain ” had been lifted .
The developments over the past 17 years begged the question :
Why was Cuba still the subject of a Cold War embargo , when the Cold War itself had long ended ?
Seldom had a more ill - conceived , illogical and illegal measure been applied so punitively , and for so long , to a people so wholly undeserving of such punishment , he said .
The Member States of the Caribbean Community and Common Market , all staunch friends of the United States , had suffered from the embargo as it impacted Cuba ’s ability to act as an economic engine for the region .
Also speaking today was the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Republic of Tanzania , as well as the representatives of Antigua and Barbuda ( on behalf of the “ Group of 77 ” and China ) , Egypt ( on behalf of the Non- Aligned Movement ) , Guyana ( on behalf of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) ) , Mexico , Viet Nam , Sudan , China , Algeria , Iran , India , Russian Federation , Angola , Zambia and Nicaragua .
Speaking in explanation were the representatives of Brazil ( on behalf of the Southern Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) ) , Lao People ’s Democratic Republic , Indonesia , Myanmar , Belarus , Ecuador , Syria , Norway and Uganda .
The General Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. on 30 October to take up the reports of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court .
Background
For the seventeenth consecutive year , the General Assembly met today to debate “ the necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba ” , and was expected , as has been the world body ’s tradition , to take up a similarly titled draft resolution .
Member States had before them the Secretary - General ’s report on the implementation of last year ’s resolution , 62/3 , Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba ( document A/63/93 ) , which includes information offered by 118 Governments , as well as 22 organs and agencies of the United Nations system , on implementation of the text “ in light of the purposes and principles of the Charter ” .
According to the submission by the Government of Cuba , the embargo has not only accumulated direct economic damage to the Cuban economy of more than $ 93 billion , but it also is the biggest impediment to Cuba ’s social , health , economic , energy , and technological development and advancement .
Indicative of the spirit of the embargo , among many examples , was the denial of technical assistance and parts to Hola Airlines by Boeing , unless Hola Airlines ended its relationship with Cuba .
This would result in the termination of its flights for Operation Miracle , a humanitarian programme for low - income patients .
There has also been economic damage , such as the cancellation of 270 tons of sugar from the Cuban - Canadian joint venture Coracan by the Brazilian exporter Cosan S.A. , when Cosan went public on the New York Stock Exchange and , thus , could no longer trade with Cuba .
The industry was paralyzed for a week and thousands upon thousands of dollars lost .
The 100 - page response also reviewed the myriad of issues and areas of concern facing Cuba that resulted from the embargo , the opposition within the United States to end the embargo , and the impact on international agencies and organizations .
Statements
JOHN W. ASHE ( Antigua and Barbuda ) , speaking on behalf of the “ Group of 77 ” developing countries and China , said his delegation had repeatedly condemned the use of coercive measures preventing countries from deciding their own economic , political and social systems .
He called on all nations to not recognize unilateral extraterritorial laws that imposed sanctions on other States and foreign companies .
The Group of 77 also recognized that the embargo continued to cause economic and financial damage against Cubans , and reiterated its call for the United States to end the measures .
The promulgation of such acts undermined the United Nations Charter and international law , and severely threatened the freedom of trade and investment .
He urged the United States to effect change with Cuba by ending the embargo .
His delegation was committed to working towards a better world , in which all nations would coexist peacefully , he said , which required adherence to the rule of law , including international law .
The embargo contravened international law , international humanitarian law and the norms governing peaceful State relations .
The replacement of the embargo with diplomatic dialogue and cooperation would promote meaningful exchange among countries .
As the embargo had impacted lives of Cubans , the overwhelming majority of States were here today to end the embargo .
In closing , he said the Group of 77 would again support the resolution .
MAGED A. ABDELAZIZ ( Egypt ) , speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement , said his delegation stood against the embargo against Cuba , and did not support the recognition , adoption or implementation of such extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws .
Such measures included unilateral economic sanctions , arbitrary travel restrictions and other “ intimidating ” measures , which sought to pressure Non-Aligned Countries by threatening their sovereignty and independence , freedom of trade , and right to decide on their own political , economic and social systems .
Because such measures or laws were “ flagrant violations ” of the Charter , international law and the multilateral trading system , the Non-Aligned Movement opposed and condemned those measures and their continued application .
Therefore , he urged other States to take action to reverse or fully revoke such laws .
Stating continued imposition of such laws hindering the well - being of the Cuban population and its full realization of their human rights , he supported the claim of affected States to compensation for damages of such measures .
He also called on the United States Government to end the economic , commercial and financial embargo , since it was a unilateral action taken against international law , the United Nations Charter and the principle of “ neighbourliness ” , which has caused substantial material losses and economic damages .
He also expressed concern about the widening of the extraterritorial nature of the embargo against Cuba , and rejected the reinforcement of such measures aiming to tighten the embargo .
In conclusion , he called for strict compliance with various General Assembly resolutions related to the embargo .
GEORGE WILFRED TALBOT ( Guyana ) , speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) , expressed his concern for and solidarity with the people of Cuba , as they struggled to rebuild their communities after successive Hurricanes Gustav , Hanna and Ike .
The punitive embargo particularly concerned CARICOM , which shared a history , culture and brotherhood with the people of Cuba .
The region ’s development relied on the collective advancement and progress of all countries , and in that context , CARICOM viewed the embargo as a punitive act against Cuba and an impediment to shared regional development .
CARICOM Member States reiterated their unequivocal opposition to the imposition of the embargo , which had been repudiated by the overwhelming majority of the international community for the past 16 years .
The unilateral imposition of extraterritorial laws on third States was contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Charter .
The embargo ran counter to the principles of multilateralism , international law , sovereignty and free trade that the Assembly traditionally championed .
States of the Caribbean reaffirmed the positions of the Group of 77 and China , as well as the Non-Aligned Movement , in opposing such unilateral actions .
Constructive engagement and peaceful negotiations were the only acceptable means for advancing long - term peace and stability , he said .
The economic impact of the embargo was of great concern to CARICOM , and the humanitarian impact on the Cuban people , especially in the area of health care and food , was saddening .
It was remarkable , he said , that Cuba continued to assist other developing nations even as it struggled with its recent unfortunate natural disasters .
Given Cuba ’s peaceful , generous and cooperative international stance , the country should not be isolated or excluded from participation in the regional and hemispheric process .
The embargo was increasingly anachronistic and served no useful purpose in the twenty - first century .
He called for a new beginning between the Governments of Cuba and the United States , akin to similar initiatives taken for negotiations of far more difficult international issues between Member States of the United Nations .
In that context , the CARICOM States supported the draft resolution before the Assembly .
JORGE VALERO BRICEÑO ( Venezuela ) said that , this time last year , 184 Member States had voted in favour of the draft resolution calling for the lifting of the embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba .
That had showed that nearly all of the international community rejected the interventionist policy against the brotherly people of Cuba .
Ever since the first resolution on the topic , the Assembly had systemically adopted , with an overwhelming majority , resolutions that demanded that the Government of the United States end its hostile policy against Cuba .
Nevertheless , that Government had repeatedly disdained the majority will of the Assembly and had refused to heed worldwide clamour against the embargo .
That showed the need to reform the United Nations so the Assembly ’s resolutions were welcomed and respected by all States .
The enduring embargo ran counter to “ the spirit of our times ” .
The measures , “ undeniably a criminal mechanism ” , were designed to force a country and a people to submit through hunger and disease , he said .
For more than four decades , the imperialist Government had flagrantly violated the rights of the people , and the rights and norms of international law that governed relations among states .
Over the past year , the embargo had intensified .
The economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba was a criminal punishment imposed systematically against the Cuban people .
It was rejected by the Cuban people and by a majority of world public opinion , including people in the United States .
He was happy to see an approach of a constructive dialogue initiated by the European Union , with no conditions .
He appealed for the embargo to be lifted .
He aligned his statement with the Group of 77 and China , the Non-Aligned Movement and the upcoming statement of the Southern Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) .
He hoped that today the overwhelming majority of countries would raise their voices against a measure that was an aggression against a people .
CLAUDE HELLER ( Mexico ) , noting that his country had disapproved of the embargo against Cuba for 17 years , reiterated opposition to the use of coercive actions that were not supported by the United Nations Charter .
Since 1992 , Mexico had restated its vote in favour of General Assembly resolutions adopted on the matter , and also expressed its full opposition to the exercise of national norms that ran counter to international law in other countries .
Reiterating his strong opposition to the embargo , which had affected its population in a “ silent ” and cumulative manner , he said the overwhelming “ international outcry ” reminded Member States that any sanctions could only derive from the Assembly or the Security Council .
Several United Nations agencies and entities had addressed the negative impacts of the embargo on the economic and social development of Cuba , which also had consequences on other countries that could not interact with the island .
He reiterated Mexico ’s opposition to the exercise of national norms that violated international laws in other countries , noting that Mexico had supported Cuba ’s integration into all regional mechanisms to encourage economic and commercial exchange .
Mexico published a law that prohibited individuals or organizations from participating in any act that affected commerce , if those acts bore on the application of laws in foreign countries .
Mexico also promoted economic and commercial contacts with Cuba , and , by focusing on dialogue , the two countries had strengthened their ties , as exemplified by an instrument to restructure debt , he said .
A Memorandum of Understanding had been signed on 20 October to secure the legal and safe migration between the countries .
The relationship had been ratified with the visit of Cuba ’s Minister of Foreign Affairs .
His Government supported bilateral and multilateral cooperation , in line with international principles regulating civilized coexistence among sovereign States , he said .
Observance of international law , and respect for rules governing States ’ coexistence was needed to overcome differences and ensure a climate of international peace .
In closing , he said Mexico would again support the resolution .
LE LUONG MINH ( Viet Nam ) , fully aligning himself with the Group of 77 developing countries and China , and the Non-Aligned Movement , said the United States ’ unilateral commercial and financial embargo was a violation of international law , and ran counter to universally recognized norms governing relations among sovereign countries .
The prolonged embargo had wrought serious economic and trade damage , worth “ scores of billions of dollars ” , on Cuba , as well as on other countries that wished to conduct normal trade relations with that peace - loving island nation .
The “ unjustifiable ” embargo was affecting Cuba ’s efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , he said , explaining that Viet Nam was against the imposition of any coercive unilateral and extraterritorial embargo by one State against another .
Disputes should be resolved through peaceful dialogue on the basis of equality , and he demanded that the United States end its embargo , the continuation of which served no other purpose than to increase tension between the two neighbours .
Reaffirming Viet Nam ’s support for Cuba , he said his Government would once again vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Assembly today .
ABDALMAHMOOD ABDALHALEEM
MOHAMAD ( Sudan ) stressed that the Assembly was debating the embargo against Cuba , and said there was a growing awareness in the international community that such unilateral measures and other “ unjustifiable ” sanctions must be rejected .
Noting the long - standing suffering of the Cuban people , which cries out to the international community for actions against “ unfair ” sanctions which threaten international legitimacy , he said that such unilateral measures severely impacted people by depriving them of basic needs .
Further , as a country also suffering from the impact of the embargo , and on behalf of other States adversely affected , Sudan expressed full solidarity with Cuba and called on all States to stand “ against this policy of hegemony ” .
He also urged the international community to reaffirm the Charter ’s humanitarian principles by rejecting the embargo and similar unilateral measures .
Such repudiation would send an important message about the international community ’s attitude towards the unjust use of force .
DUMISANI SHADRACK KUMALO ( South Africa ) said 2009 would mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Cuban revolution .
Yet , three years after that victory , Cuba was hit by a commercial , economic and financial embargo imposed by the United States ; meaning that Cubans had known no life other than one under coercive measures .
Throughout the unilateral embargo , Cubans had responded by “ extending a hand of friendship ” to other peoples around the world , and it was not unusual to find Cuban doctors and nurses throughout Latin America , he said .
Cuba ’s work in the areas of health , education and biotechnology was internationally recognized , and through bilateral cooperation projects , Cuba had assisted developing countries , including his own , in addressing skills shortages .
More importantly , Cuba had supported struggles for freedom around the world , and Southern Africa recognized Cuba ’s contribution to the subregion .
Cuba ’s role in South Africa ’s own liberation history had been recognized this year in celebration of the anniversary of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale , a decisive turning point in the struggle against apartheid .
South Africa consistently opposed all aspects of the embargo , he said , explaining that his country was committed to working towards a better world for all .
Achievement of peaceful coexistence among nations required adherence by all to the rule of law and respect for territorial integrity .
South Africa had repeatedly expressed its opposition to all aspects of the embargo and believed that constructive dialogue could foster mutual trust .
Expressing South Africa ’s firm opposition to coercive economic measures as a means of exerting pressure on developing countries , he said his delegation would join the majority in supporting the draft resolution , as such a “ relentless and unilateral action ” had caused untold suffering to Cubans .
LIU ZHENMIN ( China ) said the embargo had had an extensive impact on Cuba , particularly by compromising the right to survival and development of vulnerable groups , such as women and children , which had , in turn , evoked “ broad sympathy ” and drawn equally broad attention to the matter .
Though the Assembly had adopted a resolution annually for the past 16 years , by an overwhelming majority , to repeal or invalidate all laws and measures with extraterritorial effect compromising the sovereignty of other States and affecting their freedom of trade and navigation , he said the long - term economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba still remained in place .
Here , he stressed the importance of dialogue , communication and harmonious coexistence as the mainstream of international relations , along with mutual respect and equality among countries .
Not only did it harm the interests of Cuba and other affected countries , the embargo also contravened the principles of democracy , freedom , the rule of law and human rights .
Attempting to force another country to give up its right to decide its path of development –- even to “ overthrow its Government ” -– constituted a serious violation of the purposes of the Charter .
The extraterritorial nature of the sanctions violated international law , as well as the principle of trade liberalization .
The measures also stood in the way of the Cuban people in achieving their Millennium Development Goals , in areas such as the eradication of poverty , improvement of living standards , and pursuit of economic and social development .
He also highlighted the worsening problems of hunger and malnutrition , resulting from the current global food crisis , which made the embargo and sanctions more “ unreasonable ” than ever .
In closing , he said , the Chinese Government supported the resolution submitted by Cuba , and requested the ending of the embargo at an early date , through dialogue versus confrontation , and engagement and exchanges in lieu of the sanctions .
MOURAD BENMEHIDI ( Algeria ) expressed , once again , his country ’s profound concern at the continuation of the unilateral embargo against Cuba and reiterated that it be lifted .
His delegation believed that such a blockade violated sovereign equality among States , and the right of people to development and sovereignty .
The extraterritoriality of that action denied Charter principles and ran counter to international law .
Reiterating Algeria ’s position , which rejected coercive economic measures , he requested lifting the embargo .
Indeed , an overwhelming majority of States were in favour of lifting it , and Algeria would vote in favour of the resolution .
ESHAGH AL HABIB ( Iran ) said the resolution , supported by 184 votes last year , clearly reflected the global community ’s position on the United States ’ embargo against Cuba .
The embargo ran counter to principles of international law governing States ’ relations and the spirit of the Charter , which called for friendly relations among nations .
Such measures adversely impacted Cubans ’ human rights , and hampered Government efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and therefore , to eradicate poverty and promote health .
Citing paragraphs 101 and 102 of the 2002 Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to support an open global economic system , he said resorting to unjustifiable coercive measures against other States on the basis of “ political observations ” was not acceptable .
The extraterritorial application of such internal laws as the Helms - Burton Act created an “ antagonistic environment ” and affected world security .
The blockade violated internationally agreed principles , such as non-intervention in internal affairs , and his delegation had repeatedly stressed that such coercive policies be regarded as major impediments to pursuing common interests .
The Assembly ’s adoption of 17 resolutions was a wise reaction to such unacceptable measures .
In closing , he sincerely hoped that States that continued to apply unilateral coercive measures would take steps to repeal them at the earliest opportunity .
RAJEEV SHUKLA ( India ) noted that though it was the seventeenth year the General Assembly was debating the 46 - year - old economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , its resolutions on the matter remained unimplemented in contravention of world opinion , and the embargo , particularly its extraterritorial aspects , continued to remain in force .
In particular , he said , domestic United States laws such as the Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms - Burton Act of 1996 had enhanced the extraterritorial reach of the embargo , encompassing foreign companies , as well as foreign subsidiaries of United States companies doing business with Cuba or Cuban entities .
India backed the international community ’s categorical rejection of such domestic laws , which had extraterritorial impact , because they adversely affected the Cuban people and the country ’s development efforts .
Further , the embargo seriously affected the implementation of the United Nations projects and programmes in Cuba , including travel of United Nations staff .
Despite the embargo , the United States continued to be a major source of imports for Cuba , insofar as permitted by the United States Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement
Act of 2000 , he observed .
That only served to confirm the potential for trade , commerce and investment between the two countries .
The embargo also had significant detrimental impact on United States trade and business opportunities , he said , adding that various efforts in the United States to relax or lift the ban indicated the substantial interest , particularly in the business sector , for unhindered access to the Cuban market or contact with the Caribbean island nation .
VITALY I. CHURKIN ( Russian Federation ) said his delegation agreed with the overwhelming majority of Member States , who had absolutely condemned the embargo against Cuba and called for its end .
Since 1994 , Russia had supported the resolution at successive Assembly sessions .
In an appeal to parliaments of Member States and international parliamentary organizations , that was adopted on 17 October by the Russian Parliament , Russia emphasized that the “ continuing economic blockade against the Republic of Cuba is an act of crude pressure by the United States of America against a sovereign State . ”
The continuing commercial , economic and financial blockade of Cuba was counterproductive and out of step with the spirit of the times , he continued .
It was also a remnant from the Cold War and prevented the creation of a new , just world order in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law .
The continuation of the blockade was also incompatible with efforts to reform the United Nations , because it ignored the unanimous view of Member States , regarding the need to work together to implement the principles that underpinned collective efforts to abandon confrontation and embrace cooperation .
That was based on respect for the rights of nations to choose , for themselves , their political , economic and social systems .
The Russian Federation would continue its policy to vote in favour of the draft resolution calling for an end to the blockade .
ISMAEL ABRAÃO GASPAR MARTINS ( Angola ) said that , in the current era of economic globalization , exchanges and cooperation , along with global economic , commercial and financial ties among countries , were in the interest of all countries .
Yet , there had been no improvement towards ending the embargo after many years , and existing sanctions had been applied “ with vigour ” .
In Cuba , that had resulted in enormous social and material loss , economic damage , hunger and disease , and had affected third countries ’ relations with the island nation .
The sovereignty of States and legitimate interests of persons , entities and institutions , under their jurisdiction , were threatened by the extraterritorial policy of the embargo .
In addition , he said , the freedom to establish economic , commercial , financial or scientific - technical relations with Cuba were also being pressured .
Therefore , the issue of the embargo was not important just to Cuba but to everyone in the international community .
“ The embargo has gone on for far too long , ” he said , adding that it did not benefit either the United States or Cuba , but had only served to maintain a high level of tension in the region .
It had caused severe suffering of the Cuban people , whose situation was exacerbated by the recent intense hurricane season .
For those reasons , and because the embargo went against the “ very core ” of the Charter and other similar , pertinent decisions and resolutions already adopted by the Assembly , Angola supported Cuba ’s draft resolution to end the embargo .
LAZAROUS KAPAMBWE ( Zambia ) said that , last year , his country was among those in the overwhelming majority that had voted in favour of the Assembly resolution calling for lifting the embargo on Cuba .
Zambia had consistently expressed concern at that embargo , not only as it was unjust to Cubans , but because its unilateral extraterritorial effects breached international principles of free trade espoused by the United Nations .
He said Zambia would again vote in favour of the draft , based on its firm commitment to strengthen universal respect for international law , in the conduct of relations among sovereign States and its belief in the sanctity of the United Nations Charter .
Indeed , differences between the United States and Cuba should be solved through dialogue .
In closing , he reiterated Zambia ’s appeal for the immediate lifting of the United States embargo on Cuba .
RONALD GODARD ( United States ) said his country ’s position on the resolution was well known , and recalled that each Member State had the sovereign right to conduct its trade with another country as it saw fit , subject only to the treaty obligations it had freely undertaken .
As a bilateral issue relating to the United States ’ efforts to mitigate the impact of the Cuban Government ’s repressive policies towards its own people , the United States believed it was highly inappropriate that the Assembly consider the resolution .
“ There is no doubt that Member States here today would vigorously defend their right to determine their own national trade policy if it were called into question , ” he added .
As the United States had conclusively demonstrated since the Assembly first debated the text in 1992 , its trade policy towards Cuba was carefully designed to permit the Cuban people access to food and humanitarian goods , even as it limited the ability of Cuba ’s “ repressive Government ” to benefit and consolidate power through its authoritarian control over the Cuban economy .
He said the United States trade policy sought to prevent Cuban leaders from having access to resources that they could use to strengthen their repressive political and economic system .
He went on to say , the American people remained the largest providers of humanitarian aid to the Cuban people and last year had provided some $ 240.5 million in private humanitarian assistance .
That had been in the form of gift parcels filled with food and other basic necessities ( $ 179.4 million ) , non-agricultural humanitarian donations ( $ 20.6 million ) , and medical donations ( $ 40.5 million ) .
Referring to the devastation wrought by successive Caribbean hurricanes this year , he said the United States had been especially sensitive to the plight of the Cuban people .
The Government had offered -- on four separate occasions -- to provide the Cuban people with up to $ 5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance .
The Cuban Government had rejected the offers , he said .
United States law permitted the sale of medicine , medical supplies and agricultural products to Cuba , and the United States was Cuba ’s top supplier of food .
He said United States agricultural producers had sent $ 446 million in agricultural products to Cuba in 2007 .
Despite clear demonstrations of United States interest in the welfare of the Cuban people , Cuban officials continued to make outrageous statements about the nature of United States sanctions .
It revealed the Castro regime ’s lack of interest in the well - being of its own people , that it would refuse sincere offers of assistance , choosing instead to prolong the people ’s suffering as a pretext for proposing resolutions “ such as this one before us today . ”
He reminded the Assembly that the real reason that the Cuban economy was in terrible condition and so many Cubans were mired in poverty was that Cuba ’s regime continued to deny its people their basic human and economic rights .
He invited Member States to reject the false arguments of the Cuban Government and focus on effecting a transition in Cuba that would restore its people ’s fundamental rights .
Calling the United States embargo an “ imperialist need ” of North America to impose its will against the “ heroic and generous ” people of Cuba , MARÍA RUBIALES DE CHAMORRO ( Nicaragua ) voiced support for the adoption of the resolution to end the “ criminal and inhuman ” embargo against the island nation .
Noting that “ no other country in the world ” supported the measures and recalling the usual generosity of the United States , she expressed regret that its government could be “ so small - minded and stingy ” in its attempt to repress the “ spirit of solidarity ” present in Cuba .
She called on the international community to end the suffering caused by these policies , and to end the continued manipulation of international law and the United Nations Charter .
Cases such as the one under consideration today highlighted the imperative need to make General Assembly resolutions mandatory and binding , to protect and deepen democracy around the world , she said .
Nicaragua had been a victim of the United States too , in terms of an embargo and in past military aggressions , and therefore , felt solidarity with Cuba .
She called for the immediate lifting of the embargo , and all embargos , stating that differences must be dealt with thorough dialogue without prerequisites .
In conclusion , she noted the generous assistance of Cuban physicians to people worldwide in times of need and distress , and said Fidel Castro was one of the “ greatest fighters ” for peace and solidarity .
CAMILLO GONSALVES ( St. Vincent and the Grenadines ) said 2008 marked the seventeenth year that the United Nations was considering the subject matter of the resolution .
At the time the debate had begun in 1992 , it had seemed to be an apt postscript to a troubling chapter in world history .
The Berlin Wall had come down two years earlier , the Soviet Union had disbanded , and the so - called “ Iron Curtain ” had been lifted .
The Cold War logic of dividing the world in competing spheres , and separating ideological foes and friends through blockades , walls and embargoes was giving way to an understanding of the interconnectedness of the world , and a commitment to link society and markets through globalization , trade and tighter coordination .
The developments over the past 17 years begged the question :
Why was Cuba still the subject of a Cold War embargo , when the Cold War itself had long ended ?
Seldom had a more ill - conceived , illogical and illegal measure been applied so punitively , and for so long , to a people so wholly undeserving of such punishment , he said .
The extraterritorial application of domestic law was a violation of the Charter , and a contravention of the underpinnings of the modern notions of global trade and international relations .
It also violated the rights of self - determination and sovereign equality .
The Member States of the Caribbean Community and Common Market , all staunch friends of the United States , had suffered from the embargo , as it impacted Cuba ’s ability to act as an economic engine for the region .
The necessity of ending the embargo was a fair idea , and he asked the Assembly to agree collectively to “ move on and look to the future with hope , and correct this historical travesty ” .
SEIF ALI IDD , Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of United Republic of Tanzania , said the Assembly had , for years , called for an end to the embargo against Cuba , and today , for the seventeenth time , his country would join others to appeal for its lifting .
Aligning himself with the Group of 77 developing countries and China , and the Non-Aligned Movement , he said the Secretary - General ’s report clearly showed that the global community did not support the embargo against Cuba .
He was seriously concerned at the embargo ’s effects on the economic , social and human development of Cuba , particularly as it impacted the most vulnerable groups , who had also suffered most from the devastating recent hurricanes Gustav and Ike .
Further , he was seriously concerned about the measure ’s impact on United Nations projects in Cuba , particularly at a time when the world sought to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
Ending the embargo should be seen on moral and humanitarian grounds , as it would help alleviate suffering , and promote development , peace and security .
“ The Assembly cannot afford to remain indifferent to the people of Cuba , ” he stressed , explaining that there was a need for dialogue between the United States and Cuba .
In addition , approaches , other than passing resolutions , should be explored to end the embargo .
In closing , he reiterated his country ’s sympathy with Cuba , and would join others in calling for an end to the embargo .
Action on Draft Resolution
FELIPE PÉREZ ROQUE , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba , said the upcoming vote was taking place under very special circumstances : barely a few months after the devastating passage of two powerful hurricanes through Cuba , just six days before the United States elections and in the midst of profound international economic crisis .
In contrast to the ample solidarity received in the Assembly , the Government of the United States had responded with its customary cynicism and hypocrisy .
It had refused to accede to Cuba ’s request to buy food and essential materials for reconstruction with private credits , even for six months , from American companies .
On the other hand , it had attempted to orchestrate a blatant propaganda campaign , with which it tried to accuse Cuba ’s Government of not looking after its people .
Cuba had acted according to its traditional principles and could not accept alleged assistance from those who had intensified the blockade , sanctions and hostility against its people .
Cuba had not asked the United States Government for any gifts , but had asked to make purchases , he stressed .
“ The Bush Administration has lied , yet again , to the international community , ” he went on .
If the United States Government was truly concerned about the well - being of the Cuban people , the only moral and ethical behaviour would be to lift the blockade it had imposed on Cuba , in violation of the most elemental regulations of international law and the Charter .
In open contempt of the express will of the international community and 16 consecutive Assembly resolutions , the United States had adopted new and tougher economic sanctions against Cuba over the past year .
He said Washington had also intensified persecution against the activities of Cuban companies and those companies of other countries .
It had unleashed a “ mad hunt ” against Cuba ’s international financial transactions , including its attempts to pay United Nations bodies .
Its viciousness had reached such lengths that it had blocked Internet sites that had ties to Cuba .
On the other hand , the United States had increased its financial and material support for actions to overthrow the Cuban constitutional order .
He said the new President of the United States should decide whether he would admit that the blockade was a failed policy had that created greater isolation and discrediting for his country .
Continuing , he rejected , word for word , the statement made by the representative of the United States , “ who should feel a sense of shame ” .
The United States was completely and deeply isolated .
The entire world supported Cuba ’s small , rebellious island .
Cuba was not anti-American ; it was anti-imperialist .
And the American people were a victim of the absurd and illegal policy implemented by their own .
He said the United States had the strength , but Cuba had the resolve , and was right .
Every year ,
The United States repeated the same set of disconnected arguments , but the valid arguments were on Cuba ’s side .
The President leaving office would be the tenth United States leader who was a proponent of the illegal and failed policy .
The United States needed change and the world needed change .
He said the United States cannot sue its own businessmen and other businesses in order to keep them from doing business with Cuba .
The Assembly needed to consider this resolution for everybody ’s sake , not just Cuba’s .
He respectfully called upon the Assembly to support Cuba and its rights and vote in favour of the resolution .
The General Assembly then adopted draft resolution on the “ necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba ” ( document A/63/L.4 ) by a recorded vote of 185 in favour to 3 against ( Israel , Palau , United States ) , with 2 abstentions ( Marshall Islands , Federated States of Micronesia ) .
( See Annex for voting results ) .
The representative of France , speaking after the vote , on behalf of the European Union and candidate countries , said the United States ’ trade policy towards Cuba was a bilateral issue .
Notwithstanding that , his delegation had clearly opposed the extraterritorial extension of the embargo , as contained in the Cuban Democracy Act and the Helms - Burton Act .
He could not accept that unilateral United States measures limited the Union ’s economic and commercial relations with third countries , in this case , Cuba .
As such , the European Union Council of Ministers adopted , in 1996 , a joint action to protect natural or legal residents in the European Union against the extraterritorial effects of that legislation .
Moreover , at a 1998 United States - European Union Summit , a package was agreed covering waivers to titles III and IV of the Helms - Burton Act , and he urged the United States to implement its side of that understanding .
Noting that the European Union ’s policy towards Cuba was outlined in a 1996 Common Position , he said the goal was to encourage a peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy , with respect for human rights and improved living standards .
While reaffirming that position , the European Union , last June , had decided to lift restrictive measures against Cuba , and had proposed a dialogue without preconditions to authorities in Havana -- an offer which the Cuban Government accepted .
A 16 October ministerial meeting addressed all issues of common interest , including human rights , an area in which Europeans expected concrete action from Cuban authorities .
While human rights in Cuba had seen positive developments -- including Cuba ’s signing of the United Nations Covenants on Civil and Political Rights , and Economic , Social and Cultural Rights -- the situation had not fundamentally changed , he said .
The Government continued to deny its citizens globally recognized civil , political and economic rights , he said , urging again the unconditional release of all political prisoners .
To the United States , he rejected all unilateral measures against Cuba , which were contrary to commonly accepted rules of trade .
Despite criticism of Cuba ’s human rights record , the European Union had voted in favour of the draft resolution .
Speaking on behalf of the Southern Common Market ( MERCOSUR ) , in explanation of the vote , MARIA LUIZA RIBEIRO VIOTTI ( Brazil ) stated that her delegation had voted in favour of the resolution , because it believed the embargo was in violation of international law and contrary to the United Nations Charter .
The embargo ’s condemnation by the General Assembly , as well as by other international forums , served as an indication that multilateralism and peaceful settlements to disputes were preferable to the imposition of unilateral measures .
Further , the embargo was not in keeping with the World Trade Organization ’s ( WTO ) international trade laws and its binding agreements .
This unilateral course of measures had caused irreparable damage to the Cuban people ’s welfare , she stressed , along with damage to the process of integration in the region .
She concluded by reiterating continued commitment to the utilization of multilateralism as an effective tool in dispute settlements between States , and for the advancement of human rights and understanding amongst peoples .
Also speaking after the vote , the representative of the Lao People ’s Democratic Republic said her delegation opposed the continued unilateral embargo against Cuba .
The embargo directly violated the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter .
It also continued to cause undue suffering and hardship to the Cuban people , and hindered their socio-economic development .
Noting the overwhelming support for the resolution by the Assembly , over many consecutive years , including its adoption today , she said such support confirmed the friendship and solidarity of the international community with the Cuban people , and the call for an immediate , unconditional lifting of the embargo against Cuba .
The representative of Indonesia recognized the importance of adopting the draft resolution , and aligned herself with the Group of 77 developing countries and China , and the Non-Aligned Movement .
Indonesia had voted in favour of the draft resolution , and strongly believed that actions outlined in the draft ran counter to the Charter principles , and the rights to life , well - being and development .
Fully agreeing with the global community on the issue , she urged an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba .
Next , Myanmar ’s representative , recalling the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence ; a cornerstone of Myanmar ’s foreign policy ; said it was his country ’s belief that peace , security and stability could be promoted only through mutual respect , peaceful coexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries .
The Cuban embargo , which went against the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , also violated the fundamental principle of sovereignty , equality and the rights of all nations to development , as well as international law .
He called on the United States to heed the call from the international community and immediately end its embargo against Cuba .
As the unilateral measures did not promote peace and stability in the region , and had severe negative impacts on the social , political and economic development of the Cuban people , Myanmar had voted in favour of the resolution calling for the embargo ’s end .
The representative of Belarus said that once again , the Assembly had expressed a virtually unanimous view on the need to lift the embargo against Cuba .
Belarus opposed sanctions and coercive measures .
Sanctions were especially inappropriate in a time of financial crisis , slowing economic development , and interdependence in such areas as international trade and climate change .
In that new global context , there was no place for unilateral sanctions , and Belarus , by its vote , called on the United States to end its embargo .
The representative of Ecuador , supporting the Group of 77 developing countries and China , and the Non-Aligned Movement , had voted in favour of the resolution to end the embargo against Cuba , in keeping with international law .
She condemned the use of coercive measures and threats to solve disputes , and affirmed such principles as non-intervention .
Expressing solidarity with the people of Cuba , whose basic rights had been violated , she called for an end to the blockade .
The representative of Syria said that , despite the Assembly ’s past appeals over 16 years , the United States had not taken any measures to meet its wishes .
It had persisted in its “ erroneous position ” , and had introduced new measures to tighten the blockade against the sovereign State of Cuba , in direct threat to regional stability .
He called for ending “ antagonistic American policies against its neighbours ” , and an end to all forms of blockades imposed by the United States , both against Cuba , and his own country .
As such , he had voted in favour of the resolution .
It was striking to note Israel ’s anomalous vote against the overwhelming majority , which included it in an isolated minority of the global community .
Consecutive American policies had violated international law , he said , and history would not “ turn a blind eye ” to the military invasion of States , the changing of Governments by force , the arming of aggressors and the imposition of unjust blockades .
The question was : were such erroneous American practices in line with the noble principles of the United States ’ founding fathers , including Abraham Lincoln ?
That answer could only be given by American officials .
The representative of Norway said the embargo was fundamentally a bilateral issue .
While Norway supported sanctions adopted through the United Nations , it could not accept that unilateral United States measures should undermine Norway ’s relations with Cuba .
She was encouraged by human rights developments , including Cuba ’s signing of the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights , and on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .
However , she reiterated the call for Cuba to unconditionally release all political prisoners .
Isolation was not the appropriate response to developments in Cuba .
For such reasons , Norway had voted for the draft resolution , as in past years .
Uganda ’s representative said his country opposed the embargo and had consistently voted in favour of the resolution .
The embargo was unjustified and had had an adverse impact on the Cuban people for far too long .
Uganda did not support unilateral measures with extraterritorial application , which it believed were inconsistent with the United Nations Charter , international law and humanitarian law .
Closing Remarks
In concluding remarks , General Assembly President MIGUEL D’ESCOTO BROCKMANN , of Nicaragua , pointed out that once again the international community had rejected the “ illegal , criminal ” embargo imposed on Cuba , calling the island nation a “ heroic country of unfailing solidarity ” .
To ensure that the overwhelming opinion expressed in the vote was no longer flouted , the embargo , which had been unanimously repudiated and condemned , must be ended forthwith , “ once and for all ” .
Calling the embargo against Cuba an “ act of cruelty ” , especially after recent hurricane damage , President d’Escoto expressed his unwavering solidarity to all Cuban people and to Cuban President , Fidel Castro , as a “ hero of international solidarity ” .
“ Viva Cuba , ” he exclaimed , to the applause of the Assembly .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Acai has only recently become an internationally popular super food .
Yet it has been cherished by the native people of the Amazon for hundreds of years as a healing fruit .
Modern Brazilians eat the acai berry because it tastes nice and is highly nutritious .
The famous Gracie Jiu-Jitsu family recommended eating acai before workouts , and soccer players have been using the fruit as a natural energy booster .
With its popularity skyrocketing , acai 's anti cancer potential is being researched .
Acai berries grow on palm trees in floodplain areas of the Amazon River .
The berries are dark purple and about the size of a blueberry .
Like blueberries , they are potent antioxidants .
Free radicals are harmful molecules caused by everything from pesticides and cigarette smoke to exercising .
They can damage cells and even DNA .
Free radical damage has been shown to be associated with a range of diseases such as arthritis , Alzheimer 's disease , and Cancer .
Nature 's antidote to free radicals come in the form of fruits and vegetables known as antioxidants , which strengthen cells and defends against free radicals .
The amount of antioxidant power that a food has is known as its ORAC ( Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity score ) .
The Acai berry is one of the highest .
Its ORAC score is 167 , compared with 32 for blueberries and 14 for apples .
The increase in high antioxidant foods is essential to combating the skyrocketing rate of cancer and other diseases .
A study at The University of Florida discovered that acai berries caused human cancer cells to self destruct 86 % of the time in a culture .
While this research has only been shown in a cell culture model , it is likely that it will have the same effect on human beings .
The researchers plan to continue identifying how acai berries can prevent cancer .
The assistant professor Talcott says " We are just beginning to understand the complexity of the acai berry and its health - promoting effects . "
Studies at the University of Florida are also underway to determine the acai berry 's benefits on blood pressure , cholesterol levels , heart health and related health indicators .
While the acai berry has n't been proven to cure cancer , the research certainly looks promising and at the very least it is helpful in preventing cancer and other illnesses .
Plus , it tastes delicious .

A Victim Treats His Mugger Right
“ If you ’re going to be robbing people for the rest of the night , you might as well take my coat to keep you warm … ”
From NPR Morning Edition
Julio Diaz has a daily routine .
Every night , the 31 - year - old social worker ends his hour - long subway commute to the Bronx one stop early , just so he can eat at his favorite diner .
But one night last month , as Diaz stepped off the No. 6 train and onto a nearly empty platform , his evening took an unexpected turn .
He was walking toward the stairs when a teenage boy approached and pulled out a knife .
“ He wants my money , so I just gave him my wallet and told him , ‘ Here you go , ' ” Diaz says .
As the teen began to walk away , Diaz told him , “ Hey , wait a minute .
You forgot something .
If you ’re going to be robbing people for the rest of the night , you might as well take my coat to keep you warm . ”
The would - be robber looked at his would - be victim , “ like what ’s going on here ? ” Diaz says .
“ He asked me , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ' ”
Diaz replied : “ If you ’re willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars , then I guess you must really need the money .
I mean , all I wanted to do was get dinner and if you really want to join me … hey , you ’re more than welcome .
“ You know , I just felt maybe he really needs help , ” Diaz says .
Diaz says he and the teen went into the diner and sat in a booth .
“ The manager comes by , the dishwashers come by , the waiters come by to say hi , ” Diaz says .
“ The kid was like , ‘ You know everybody here .
Do you own this place ? ' ”
“ No , I just eat here a lot , ” Diaz says he told the teen .
“ He says , ‘ But you ’re even nice to the dishwasher . ' ”
Diaz replied , “ Well , have n’t you been taught you should be nice to everybody ? ”
“ Yea , but I did n’t think people actually behaved that way , ” the teen said .
Diaz asked him what he wanted out of life .
“ He just had almost a sad face , ” Diaz says .
The teen could n’t answer Diaz — or he did n’t want to .
When the bill arrived , Diaz told the teen , “ Look , I guess you ’re going to have to pay for this bill ’ cause you have my money and I can’t pay for this .
So if you give me my wallet back , I ’ll gladly treat you . ”
The teen “ did n’t even think about it ” and returned the wallet , Diaz says .
“ I gave him $ 20 … I figure maybe it ’ll help him .
I do n’t know . ”
Diaz says he asked for something in return — the teen ’s knife — “ and he gave it to me . ”
Afterward , when Diaz told his mother what happened , she said , “ You ’re the type of kid that if someone asked you for the time , you gave them your watch . ”
“ I figure , you know , if you treat people right , you can only hope that they treat you right .
It ’s as simple as it gets in this complicated world . ”
Nonviolent Communication : A Language of Life
by Marshall B. Rosenberg
Julio Diaz in the article above demonstrated exceptional communication skills .
In Nonviolent Communication , Marshall Rosenberg shows how such skills can be learned in a systematic way , illustrated by many examples .
In essence :
I learn to honestly express how I am , without blaming or criticizing
I also empathically receive how you are , without hearing blame or criticism
Summary from the book : “ Nonviolent Communication ( NVC ) helps us connect with ourselves and each other in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish .
It guides us to re-frame the way we express ourselves and listen to others by focusing our consciousness on four areas : what we are observing , feeling , and needing and what we are requesting to enrich our lives .
NVC fosters deep listening , respect , and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart .
Some people use NVC to respond compassionately to themselves , some to create greater depth in their personal relationships , and still others to build effective relationships at work or in the political arena .
World - wide , NVC is used to mediate disputes and conflicts at all levels . ”
“ how the kindness of strangers got me to be more helpful to people … ”
“ So a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you , me , and just about everyone else on that stretch of road , working on a seasonal basis where time is money , took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by .
Wow … ”
A formatting fubar involving an Excel spreadsheet has left Barclays Capital with contracts involving collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers than it never meant to acquire .
Working to a tight deadline , a junior law associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP converted an Excel file into a PDF format document .
The doc was to be posted on a bankruptcy court 's website before a midnight purchase offer deadline on 18 September , just four hours after Barclays sent the spreadsheet to the lawyers .
The Excel file contained 1,000 rows of data and 24,000 cells .
Some of these details on various trading contracts were marked as hidden because they were not intended to form part of Barclays ' proposed deal .
However , this " hidden " distinction was ignored during the reformatting process so that Barclays ended up offering to take on an additional 179 contracts as part of its bankruptcy buyout deal , Finextra reports .
The error was discovered on 1 October , after US Bankruptcy Judge James Peck approved the deal , prompting a legal motion ( pdf ) from Barclays to amend the deal , excluding the scores of contracts it states were mistakingly included in the agreement .
The story was broken by legal tabloid Above The Law .
Lehman Brothers sought bankruptcy protection on 15 September , a move that set off a chain of events that have shaken confidence in global financial institutions and the collapse of stock markets across the globe that has only been partially reversed by unprecedented government bail - outs to the banking sector .
Barclays first offered to buy a " stripped clean " portion of Lehman for around $ 1.75 bn on 16 September .
A revised version of the deal was eventually agreed on 18 September , largely focusing on the New York arm of Lehman 's business ( including its $ 910 m - valued headquarters ) and responsibility for 9,000 former employees .
Barclays paid $ 1.35 bn for these assets as well as taking on responsibility for some of Lehman 's trading positions which , because of the formatting error , became more numerous than it intended .
It 's unclear what the financial ramifications of the formatting error might be .
Excel spreadsheets might seem a fairly unsophisticated method of logging multi-billion pound trading positions , but they are quick to produce and easy to understand - vital consideration in a financial market - which makes them widely used .
A hearing on Barclays Capital 's attempts to extricate itself from the mess created by the dodgy Excel conversion is pencilled in for 5 November . ®

Nearly 40 years after the U.S. flag was planted on the moon , a global rush to the final frontier has some ponderingproperty rights out there .
India , Japanand Chinaare now circling the moon with their respective spacecraft ? to be joined nextyear by NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Then there 's the GoogleLunar X Prize , a $ 30 million competition for the first privately fundedteam to send a robot to the moon , travel some 1,640 feet ( 500 meters ) andtransmit video , images and data back to Earth .
The legal profession sees a brief inthe making .
Extraterrestrial real estate
Laws tend to build on precedent .
Since there 's little precedent for lunarlaws , some look to the sea for suggestions .
That is , the use of ocean floorminerals beyond the limits of national jurisdiction .
Such valuable resourcesare designated by some as a Common Heritage of mankind , not subject to nationalappropriation .
Could the Common Heritage conceptwork as the basis for a Moon Treaty ?
Virgiliu Pop is a researchspecialist at the Romanian Space Agency .
He has for years been keeping a legaleye on the area of space property rights , and his new book , " Who Owns the Moon ? - Extraterrestrial Aspects of Land and Mineral Resources Ownership " ( Springer , 2008 ) was published this month .
Pop has been delving into what hasshaped the law of extraterrestrial real estate , and the norms which expressthis law .
And in his view , the norms and rules regarding property rights in thecelestial realm are rather limited , even failing to define basic concepts suchas what is a celestial body .
Pop favors property rights overgroup hugs .
" Despite the noble ideals ofequity and care for the have - nots , the Common Heritage paradigm of the MoonTreaty has more faults than merits , " Pop told SPACE.com .
" A refutation of the CommonHeritage principle does not mean , however , that the developing world will , orshould , be left behind in the space era , " he said .
" China , India and Brazil are living proofs that a developing country can , through its own effort , join the spacefaring club .
Instead of freeloading on the efforts of the older spacefarers , the have - nots should pool their meager financial resources into a common spaceagency or into regional ones , and proceed at exploiting the riches of outerspace for themselves . "
Frontier paradigm
The Frontier Paradigm , on the otherhand , has proven its worth on our planet , Pop adds , and it most likely will doso in the extraterrestrial realms .
" Homesteading is likely totransform the lunar desert in the same manner as it transformed the 19thCentury United States , " he said .
" Space is indeed a new frontiercalling for individualism rather than collectivism , and its challenges need tobe addressed with a legal regime favorable to property rights . "

The long - cherished dream of creating nearly limitless clean energy from nuclear fusion -- the same process that powers our sun-- is looking slightly more possible thanks to a new series of experiments .
Researchers working with a reactor at MIT 's Plasma Science and Fusion Center have managed to control the motion of million - degree plasma using high - power radio waves .
" Ours is the first definitive result showing that high - power radio waves can significantly affect the flow of the plasma , " said physicist Earl Marmar [ EE Times ] .
The radio waves successfully propelled the plasma inside the dount - shaped chamber without hitting the cooler vessel walls , which would halt the fusion reaction , and also prevented the plasma from causing turbulence , which can interfere with reactions .
Fusion is thought to have enormous potential for future power generation , because fusion plant operation would produce no emissions , fuel sources are potentially abundant , and it produces relatively little ( and short - lived ) radioactive waste .
That 's unlike nuclear fission ( the splitting apart of a heavy atom to release energy ) , the process that powers all existing nuclear plants [ LiveScience ] .
However , researchers stress that commercial fusion power plants are still a long way off .
Physicists still do n't know how to make a reactor that generates more power than it consumes , a rather large problem for a potential energy source .
This incremental breakthrough by physicists John Rice and Yijun Lin will nevertheless come in handy almost immediately , in the enormous International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) that is now under construction in France
.
Lack of a controllable mechanism for propelling the plasma around the reactor " is potentially a showstopper , " Rice says , and the ITER team is a " very concerned about this . " ...
Given that the ITER project , which will take 10 years to build , is already underway , " our results are just in time for this , " Lin says [ ZDNet ] .
The results , reported in the journal Physical Review Letters [ subscription required ] , will also give hope to the few investors bold enough to place their bets on fusion energy .
A small group of startups – General Fusion , Tri-Alpha Energy – have received venture funds in the past few years to see if fusion power will be possible on a commercial scale .
General Fusion hopes to one day build 50 megawatt plants for $ 100 million ....
Still , there 's that problem of actually getting this stuff to work outside of the rarefied atmosphere of a lab [ Greentech Media ] .

Singapore 's Policy Secret : Economic Literacy , Deference , or Resignation ?
By Bryan Caplan
Here ’s a question that got a big laugh around a Singaporean lunch table : “ So , do most people here support Electronic Road Pricing ? ”
Not on your life !
If you want to see how S’poreans really feel about ERP , check out this hilarious Youtube video .
Like people all around the world , they want to drive free of charge .
And like people all over the world , they ignore the connection between unpriced roads and congestion .
Never mind that over the border on the unmetered streets of Kuala Lumpur , people can easily sit in traffic for an hour .
This ERP question inspired a deeper discussion – and one of the highlights of my trip .
I spoke before an audience of about fifteen young S’porean civil servants .
During the Q&A , my host , Donald Low , turned the tables on the audience .
He quoted this post :
My biggest ( and potentially most sensitive ) question : Do Singaporeans
actually support their uniquely efficient policies ?
An earlier study
found that Hong Kongers are statist at heart ;
are Singaporeans any different ?
My suspicion is that the source of
Singapore ’s success is not the public ’s unusually high economic
literacy , but its unusual deference to economically literate elites .
Will experience confirm my suspicions ?
Donald then asked each attendant to answer my question .
To be more precise , he asked them to choose between three explanations :
a. Unusually high economic literacy .
b. Deference to elites – the belief that S’porean elites know what they ’re doing and deserve support .
c. Resignation – the belief that regular S’poreans can’t affect policy , so there ’s no use trying .
When I was planning my trip to S’pore , several people told me that S’poreans would n’t want to discuss this issue .
They were dead wrong .
Every attendant answered the question – and none of the answers were sugarcoated .
Most attendants said “ A mix of deference and resignation , ” with slightly more emphasis on deference .
Only one or two people said that the public ’s economic literacy mattered – and even they put it last in importance .
Admittedly , this informal survey suffers from potentially severe selection bias .
Perhaps civil servants exaggerate the incompetence of the public to make themselves feel important .
But I suspect that if selection bias plays a role , it goes in the opposite direction : Civil servants are more likely to exaggerate the popularity of their policies to make themselves feel well - liked .
The fact that “ resignation ” remains a popular answer is telling :
The architects of policies like ERP might like to fantasize that the public loves their work , but daily experience gets in the way .
Thanks , IO9 .
Thanks for reminding me that I do n't have to wait tomorrow for the premiere , I 'm an American with a high - speed connection .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Bankrupt electronics retailer Circuit City Inc. said Friday it will close its remaining 567 U.S. stores and sell all its merchandise .
The company said it has 34,000 employees .
" We are extremely disappointed by this outcome , " James Marcum , acting CEO for Circuit City , said in a statement .
" We were unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and lenders to structure a going - concern transaction in the limited timeframe available , and so this is the only possible path for our company . "
In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , which a judge approved late Friday , Circuit City - the No. 2 electronics retailer after Best Buy ( BBY , Fortune 500 ) - said it had reached an agreement with four companies to start the liquidation process .
The company said the sale would begin Saturday and run until March 31 , pending court approval .
The retailer 's Web site and call center will cease to operate after Jan. 18 .
Circuit City said employees will receive 60 days ' notice of the termination .
Employees who are laid off earlier will get pay and benefits for the 60 - day period beginning Friday , the retailer said .
Those who remain with the company to assist with the liquidation , will receive pay and benefits .
Circuit City also operates about 765 retail stores and dealer outlets in Canada .
The company said its Canadian operations , which employ 3,000 workers , will continue to operate .
The company said it will redeem its gift cards through the liquidation sale , but the cards will have no value once the stores are closed .
" This is very significant .
It shows you how bad things are for the retail industry , " said George Whalin , president and CEO of Retail Management Consultants .
Whalin said management mistakes over the past few years combined with the recession brought down Circuit City .
" This company made massive mistakes , " he said , citing a decision to get rid of sales people and other mismanagement .
What 's more , given the credit market freeze , Whalin added that no manufacturer wants to sell to any retailer who does n't have money to pay for the merchandise .
At the same time , Whalin said there 's still a very slim chance that one or more firms that have expressed an interest in buying Circuit City could still buy it out of bankruptcy over the next few days .
" I would n't say it 's completely over yet for Circuit City , but it 's almost over , " Whalin said .
Love Goel , CEO of Growth Ventures Group , a private equity firm focused on retailers , agreed with Whalin .
" Circuit City is n't a viable business in its old incarnation when half of electronics sales have moved online , " Goel said .
" CompUSA and Tweeter also did n't make it for the same reason , " referring to two stores forced to close most or all of their locations .
However , Goel speculated that Circuit City could still find a lifeline if Golden Gate Capital , one of the reported lead bidders for the merchant , bought the company and restructured it primarily as an online business with very few physical stores .
" This would eliminate overhead costs , vendor conflicts and other issues , " he said .
" Circuit City has an almost $ 1 billion online business .
So there is a future for it in that regard . "
NPD Group 's retail analyst Marshal Cohen warned that no retailer is " sacred " in this environment unless " you have a service model that differentiates you from the competition and keeps pace with changing needs of the consumer . "
He said Circuit City was late to the game with its Firedog customer service business , and it did n't resonate with customers as well as Best Buy 's Geek Squad was business .
What 's more , Cohen said Circuit City found itself in the unfortunate position of becoming the " monkey in the middle " as Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) aggressively moved into the electronics market with its low prices model , and Best Buy continued to widen the gap with its competitors and dominate as the industry leader .
" Circuit City just got stuck in the middle for too long , " said Cohen .

Mind - numbed parents lead to drugged children
The ugly truth about the War on Drugs
The skeptics are quacks
( Natural News )
New research published in the journalreveals that the ADHD drugs prescribed to millions of children are causing them to experience frightening hallucinations .
Children on these drugs hallucinated that snakes and bugs were crawling all over them , says , and some kids taking the drugs experience other bizarre psychotic side effects such as thinking they ran into a wall and falling to the ground even when no wall was present .
ADHD drugs , of course , are powerful psychotropic mind - altering chemicals that are often molecularly identical to street drugs .
The industry of psychiatry is virtually owned by Big Pharma , which hopes to drug every child , teenager and adult with at least one mind - altering medication .
The drugs reviewed in this study include : Ritalin and Focalin XR ( Novartis ) , Adderall XR and Daytrana patch ( Shire ) , Concerta ( Johnson & Johnson ) , Strattera ( Eli Lilly ) , Metadate CD ( Celltech Pharmaceuticals ) and Provigil ( Cephalon ) .
Researchers noticed that .
Those taking placebo had no hallucinations , and the children who stopped taking ADHD drugs saw their hallucinations cease .
Reuters reports that " FDA researchers urged doctors to discuss the potential side effects with parents and children to help ease their anxiety if such symptoms should occur . "
So instead of getting their kids off these drugs , the FDA thinks parents and kids just need to " talk about the hallucinations " to ease their anxiety .
And if that 's not enough , I suppose , there are anti-anxiety drugs they can both take in order to avoid getting too uptight about the fact that their children are on hallucinogenic drugs .
I 'm just going to come right out and say the obvious : .
This is n't " treatment " for some genuine health problem ; it 's a legalized mass - drugging campaign that 's permanently harming the brains of children while earning sick profits for Big Pharma .
The psychiatric pill pushers have managed to turn a generation of children into druggies who are now demonstrating the same symptoms as a street junkie burnout .
And rather than trying to get kids OFF these drugs , the FDA , Big Pharma and modern psychiatrists are doing everything in their power to put MORE kids on these dangerous , hallucinogenic drugs !
That this continues in America today is outrageous .
In a nation that spends billions of dollars on the so - called " War on Drugs " -- see the Drug War Clock at http://www.drugsense.org/wodclock.htm -- to ignore the mass drugging of its own children with hallucinogenic street drugs relabeled as " medication " is unconscionable .
If there 's really a War on Drugs , why does n't that war target the biggest drug pushers of all ?
Big Pharma has put more kids on drugs than any street corner crack dealer could ever hope to achieve .
In fact , the entire industry of psychiatric medicine is little more than a legalized drug dealing network that hides behind the jargon of " medicine " and " therapy .
"
It 's not just the industry that 's to blame on all this , either : Parents who allow their children to be drugged with these hallucinogenic ADHD drugs are just as much a part of the problem .
In the same households where parents are adamantly restricting their child 's use of pot or alcohol , they will literally feed that same kid dose after dose of hallucinogenic street drugs on the advice of a psychiatric medicine quack who's on the take from Big Pharma .
What are they thinking ?
Say no to drugs , but say yes to hallucinogenic psychotropic drugs if a corrupt psychiatrist tells you your kid needs them ?
Somehow , when speed is labeled under Big Pharma 's brand names , it eludes all rational thinking by parents , doctors , pharmacists and drug war zealots .
It is one of the largest sectors of the hallucinogenic drug trade in America , and yet it goes completely unnoticed by virtually everyone .
My latest hip - hop song takes a shot at mind - altering medications with some disturbing , uncensored lyrics .
Listen to " SSRIs - S.S.R.Lies " here : https://www.naturalnews.com/SSRIs_S_S_R_Lies....
The War on Drugs , of course , was never really about ending drug use in the first place .
It was about , making sure kids get off generic black market drugs and get onto brand - name Big Pharma drugs .
To legitimize this mass drugging of children , the industry of modern psychiatry was created , with all its imaginary ( hallucinated ? ) disorders and dysfunctions used to befuddle the public with seemingly intelligent - sounding technical jargon .
It 's all just drug - pushing psychobabble , of course .
Disorders like ADHD are purely fictional , having no basis in reality whatsoever , and the brain shrinkage pointed to by psychiatrists who claim ADHD causes stunted growth is actually the result of the amphetamine drugs they put the kids on .
It is well documented that drugs like Ritalin cause stunted grown and reduced brain size ( https://www.naturalnews.com/021944.html ) .
The degree of quackery present in the psychiatric industry today is simply staggering .
And to think that mainstream doctors defend this quackery is yet more evidence that modern medicine has nothing whatsoever to do with actual science ; it 's all based on awhere all drugs are considered good and necessary , regardless of the mountain of evidence showing them to be dangerous and medically useless .
This is where I have to challenge all the so - called " skeptics " out there who attack natural medicine .
These skeptics and self - proclaimed quack observers are , in fact , among the greatest quacks of all .
Why ?
Where is the skepticism about this home - grown brand of legalized drug pushing ?
Where are all the intelligent questions demanding proof that ADHD is a genuine disease and not just something made up to sell more drugs ?
The skeptics are silent when it comes to psychiatric medicine , andLogic , reason and scientific evidence are all thrown out the window on the subject of psychiatric disorders .
The most rational - sounding skeptics are instantly transformed into psychobabble - spouting quacks who defend the indefensible -- the mass drugging of children with powerful hallucinogenic street drugs as " treatment " for some imaginary disease .
Sure , the skeptics will attack meditation , crystals , prayer , intention , chiropractic care and even herbal medicine ( all of which can be healing , by the way ) , but when it comes to the loopy loose logic of psychiatric medicine inventing diseases and drugging up the children with hallucinogenic amphetamines , So much for the credibility of the so - called skeptics and quack busters .
It turns out they 're quacks themselves .
They 've simply subscribed to their own form of quackery : Drugs and surgery for all !
The quacks are on crack , and they 're supporting an industry that hands outto the children .
Meanwhile , the War on Drugs fills the prisons with people who smoked a little weed while completely ignoring the psychiatric pill pushers .
Crazy , huh ?
I 'm beginning to thinking everybody 's on drugs !
Just remember , folks :
If you want to sell drugs to kids , just get FDA approval first .
It keeps the DEA off your back and fools parents into thinking your hallucinogenic drugs are " medicine . "
Way back in Napoleonic Paris , a Monsieur Girard had a novel idea about energy : power from the sea .
In 1799 , Girard obtained a patent for a machine he and his son had designed to mechanically capture the energy in ocean waves .
Wave power could be used , they figured , to run pumps and sawmills and the like .
These inventors would disappear into the mists of history , and fossil fuel would instead provide an industrializing world with almost all its energy for the next two centuries .
But Girard et fils were onto something , say a growing number of modern - day inventors , engineers , and researchers .
The heave of waves and the tug of tides , they say , are about to begin playing a significant role in the world 's energy future .
In the first commercial - scale signal of that , last October a trio of articulated , cylinder - shaped electricity generators began undulating in the waves off the coast of Portugal .
The devices look like mechanical sea snakes .
( In fact , their manufacturer , Scotland 's Pelamis Wave Power Ltd. , takes its name from a mythical ancient Greek sea serpent . )
Each Pelamis device consists of four independently hinged segments .
The segments capture wave energy like the handle of an old fashioned water pump captures the energy of a human arm : as waves rock the segments to and fro , they pump a hydraulic fluid ( biodegradable , in case of spills ) powerfully through a turbine , spinning it to generate up to 750,000 watts of electricity per unit .
Assuming the devices continue to perform well , Portuguese utility Energis expects to soon purchase another 28 more of the generators .
The completed " wave farm " would feed its collective power onto a single high voltage sea- floor cable , adding to the Portuguese grid about 21 megawatts of electricity .
That 's enough to power about 15,000 homes .
In a world where a single major coal or nuclear plant can produce more than 1,000 megawatts of electricity , it 's a modest start .
But from New York 's East River to the offshore waters of South Korea , a host of other projects are in earlier stages of testing .
Some , like Pelamis , rely on the motion of waves .
Others operate like underwater windmills , tapping the power of the tides .
Ocean - powered technologies are in their infancy , still technologically well behind such energy alternatives as wind and solar .
Necessarily designed to operate in an inherently harsh environment , the technologies remain largely unproven and — unless subsidized by governments — expensive .
( Portugal is heavily subsidizing the Pelamis project , with an eye to becoming a major European exporter of clean green power in the future . )
Little is known about the effects that large wave or tide farms might have on marine ecosystems in general .
Despite the uncertainties , however , proponents say the potential advantages are too striking to ignore .
Eight hundred times denser than air , moving water packs a huge energy wallop .
Like solar and wind , power from moving seas is free and clean .
But sea power is more predictable than either wind or solar .
Waves begin forming thousands of miles from coastlines and days in advance ; tides rise and fall as dependably as the cycles of the moon .
That predictability makes it easier to match supply with demand .
Roger Bedard , who leads ocean energy research at the U.S. utility - funded Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) in Palo Alto , says there 's plenty of reason for optimism about the future of what he calls " hydrodynamic " power .
Within a decade , he says , the U.S. could realistically meet as much as 10 percent of its electricity needs from hydrodynamic power .
As a point of reference , that 's about half of the electricity the U.S. produces with nuclear power today .
Although he acknowledges that initial sea-powered generation projects are going to be expensive , Bedard believes that as experience grows and economies of manufacturing scale kick in , hydrodynamic power will follow the same path toward falling costs and improving technologies as other alternatives .
" Look at wind , " he says .
" A kilowatt hour from wind cost fifty cents in the 1980s .
Now it 's about seven cents . "
( That 's about the same as producing electricity with natural gas , and only about three cents more than coal , the cheapest — and dirtiest — U.S. energy choice .
Any future tax on carbon emissions could narrow that gap even more , as would additional clean - power subsidies . )
For some nations , wave and tide power could pack an even bigger punch .
Estimates suggest , for instance , that the choppy seas surrounding the United Kingdom could deliver as much as 25 percent of its electricity .
British alternative energy analyst Thomas W. Thorpe believes that on a worldwide basis , waves alone could produce as much as 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity , as much as all the planet 's major hydroelectric plants generate today .
Although none are as far along as Pelamis , most competing wave - power technologies rely not on the undulations of mechanical serpents , but instead on the power captured by the vertical bobbing of large buoys in sea swells .
Ocean Power Technologies ( OPT ) , based in New Jersey , drives the generators in its PowerBuoy ® with a straightforward mechanical piston .
A stationary section of the mostly submerged , 90 - foot buoy is anchored to the ocean floor ; a second section simply moves up and down with the movement of sea swells , driving pistons that in turn drive an electrical generator .
The Archimedes Wave Swing , a buoy - based system developed by Scotland 's AWS Ocean Energy , harnesses the up - and - down energy of waves by pumping air to spin its turbines .
Vancouver - based Finavera Renewables uses seawater as its turbine - driving hydraulic fluid .
Although Pelamis beat all of these companies out of the commercialization gate , OPT appears to be right behind , with plans to install North America 's first commercial - scale wave power array of buoys off the coast of Oregon as early as next year .
That array — occupying one square - mile of ocean and , like other wave power installations , located far from shipping lanes — would initially produce 2 megawatts of power .
OPT also announced last September an agreement to install a 1.4 - megawatt array off the coast of Spain .
An Australian subsidiary is in a joint venture to develop a 10 - megawatt wave farm off the coast of Australia .
Meanwhile , Pelamis Wave Power plans to install more of its mechanical serpents — three megawatts of generating capacity off the coast of northwest Scotland , and another five - megawatt array off Britain 's Cornwall coast .
The Cornwall installation will be one of four wave power facilities plugged into a single , 20 - megawatt underwater transformer at a site called " Wave Hub . "
Essentially a giant , underwater version of a socket that each developer can plug into , Wave Hub — which will be connected by undersea cable to the land - based grid — was designed as a tryout site for competing technologies .
OPT has won another of the four Wave Hub berths for its buoy - based system .
Other innovators are trying to harness the power of ocean or estuarine tides .
Notably , in 2007 , Virginia 's Verdant Power installed on the floor of New York 's East River six turbines that look , and function , much like stubby , submerged windmills , their blades — which are 16 feet in diameter — turning at a peak rate of 32 revolutions per minute .
The East River is actually a salty and powerful tidal straight that connects Long Island Sound with the Atlantic Ocean .
Although the " underwater windmills " began pumping out electricity immediately , the trial has been a halting one .
The strong tides quickly broke apart the turbines ' first - ( fiberglass and steel ) and second - ( aluminum and magnesium ) generation blades , dislodging mounting bolts for good measure .
Undeterred , in September Verdant Power began testing new blades made of a stronger aluminum alloy .
If it can overcome the equipment - durability problems , the company hopes to install as many as 300 of its turbines in the East River , enough to power 10,000 New York homes .
A scattering of similar prototype " underwater windmill " projects have been installed at tidal sites in Norway , Northern Ireland , and South Korea .
( In addition , interest in moving into freshwater sites is growing .
Verdant itself hopes to install its turbines on the St. Lawrence River .
At least one other company , Free Flow Power of Massachusetts , has obtained Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permits to conduct preliminary studies on an array of sites on the Mississippi River south of St. Louis . )
The environmental benefits of hydrodynamic power seem obvious : no carbon dioxide or any other emissions associated with fossil - fuel - based generation .
No oil spills or nuclear waste .
And for those who object to wind farms for aesthetic reasons , low - profile wave farms are invisible from distant land ; tidal windmill - style turbines operate submerged until raised for maintenance .
There are , however , environmental risks associated with these technologies .
New York state regulators required Verdant Power to monitor effects of their its turbines on fish and wildlife .
So far , sensors show that fish and water birds are having no trouble avoiding the blades , which rotate at a relatively leisurely 32 maximum revolutions per minute .
In fact the company 's sensors have shown that fish tend to seek shelter behind rocks around the channel 's banks and stay out of the central channel entirely when tides are strongest .
But a host of other questions about environment effects remain unanswered .
Will high - voltage cables stretching across the sea from wave farms somehow harm marine ecosystems ?
Will arrays of hundreds of buoys or mechanical serpents interfere with ocean fish movement or whale migrations ?
What effect will soaking up large amounts of wave energy have on shoreline organisms and ecosystems ?
" Environmental effects are the greatest questions right now , " EPRI 's Bedard says , " because there just are n't any big hydrodynamic projects in the world . "
Projects will probably have to be limited in size and number to protect the environment , he says – that 's a big part of the reason he limits his " realistic " U.S. estimate to 10 percent of current generation capacity .
But the only way to get definitive answers on environmental impact might be to run the actual experiment — that is , to begin building the water - powered facilities , and then monitor the environment for effects .
Bedard suggests that the way to get definitive answers will be to build carefully on a model like Verdant's : " Start very small .
Monitor carefully .
Build it a little bigger and monitor some more .
I 'd like to see it developed in an adaptive way . "

Canadian model Liskula Cohen is demanding Google reveal the identity of the Blogger.com user whose Skanks in NYC blog is entirely dedicated to calling her a " skank " , an " old hag " and other flattering descriptions .
According to the New York Daily News , 36 - year - old Cohen has filed a defamation suit in Manhattan Supreme Court in the hope she can find out exactly who believes she 's a " psychotic , lying , whoring , still going to clubs at her age , skank " .
Cohen said of the blog : " It 's petty , it 's stupid and it 's pathetic .
And when I do find out who did this , at least I 'll know who my enemies are . "
She added : " I 'm tall , I 'm blond , I 've been modeling for many years , and people get jealous .
If I had to deal with everyone who is jealous , I would n't have time to do anything else . "

Kucinich Calls for UN Investigation into Israeli Attacks on Gaza
Cleveland congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) is now calling for a United Nations investigation to attacks on Gaza by Israel .
Kucinich also criticized Israel for what he deems a disproportionate response to Hamas rocket attacks , standing in stark contrast to other House Democrats that have offered nearly unanimous support for Israel .
Leading Democrats , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - California ) , have blamed Hamas for the most recent violence in the Middle East that has left more than 300 dead in Gaza .
Meanwhile , just one individual in Israel has been killed by a Hamas rocket .
Kucinich likens Israel ’s attacks on Gaza to its 2006 war with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon .
Kucinich said that in both cases civilian populations were attacked and “ countless innocents ” were injured or killed .
In a statement Kucinich said :
“ All this was , and is , disproportionate , indiscriminate mass violence in violation of international law .
Israel is not exempt from international law and must be held accountable . ”
Kucinich continues stating that the perpetrators of attacks against Israel should be brought to justice , but that Israel “ cannot create a ware against and entire people in order to attempt to bring justice to the few who are responsible . ”
In his statement Kucinich said that he sent a letter to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon requesting an independent inquiry into the situation , stating that attacks on civilians represented collective punishment , a violation a Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
Pelosi and Reid , meanwhile , have remained steadfast in their support of Israel .
President - elect Barack Obama has not yet weighed in on the violence , although his advisor , David Axelrod , noted Sunday evening that statements Obama made over the summer supported Israel ’s right to defend itself .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Gov. Sarah Palin took questions from reporters who travel with her campaign Thursday for the first time since being tapped as John McCain 's running mate .
Gov. Sarah Palin speaks with a handful of reporters in Manhattan on Thursday .
Reporters were told 20 minutes ahead of time that , after a visit to ground zero in lower Manhattan , Palin would make a statement and then there would be an opportunity for questions .
In her first media availability of the campaign , Palin spoke only to a few reporters , not her full press corps .
After her statement , she answered four questions about the war on terrorism , the re-election bids of Alaska 's Sen .
Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young , and the bailout legislation in front of Congress .
Read the transcript
The Q&A session followed weeks of criticism about her lack of access to the media .
On Wednesday , the Republican vice presidential candidate gave her third network interview , this time with CBS ' Katie Couric .
In comparison , Sen . Joe Biden has given 89 national and local interviews , according to the campaign .
" I have never seen a presidential or vice presidential nominee , in my lifetime , be so inaccessible to the national media , " said Howard Kurtz , a Washington Post and CNN media critic .
Watch why some say Palin is avoiding the media »
This week , Palin met with international leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations ' General Assembly meetings in New York , but once again , she was largely shielded from reporters .
At first , the campaign said Tuesday that no reporters would be allowed in on the meetings , only a photographer and camera crew .
McCain - Palin campaign officials shifted course after being informed by television news organizations that they would not broadcast footage of her meeting with Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan , if a reporter was not allowed in to observe the pair .
CNN , which was the pool network for the event , was told that a CNN producer would be allowed in the room to act as a media representative just minutes before the photo op was scheduled to take place .
However , print reporters and wire services were not allowed to observe the meeting , as they have been able to do at similar McCain events in the past .
The press caught only a brief glimpse of the vice presidential nominee ; CNN 's producer and other photographers were allowed in the room for just 29 seconds .
McCain - Palin press representatives later chalked up the restrictions to a " mixup , a miscommunication among staff . "
The full pool -- a print and wires reporter and a television producer -- was then allowed in to observe Palin 's meeting with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe for about 20 seconds .
Palin 's supporters say she does n't need to field questions from a number of reporters .
" Are the media going to continue to put pressure on her ?
Yes , but they 're the ones that seem to be frustrated , not the folks in the states that she 's visiting , " said Leslie Sanchez , a Republican strategist .
Michael Carey , a columnist for the Anchorage Daily News who has been covering Palin for two years , said things have changed since she became the VP nominee .
" She had a good relationship with the press here .
Reporters got access to her when they needed to , " he said .
" The Anchorage Daily News has not talked to her since August 30 , and we 're the hometown newspaper .
That ought to tell you something . "
But what it 's telling some media observers is that the McCain campaign is being very cautious .
" The McCain campaign says that she is entirely qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency .
If that 's the case , surely she can handle some questions from mere journalists , " Kurtz said .
CNN 's Jason Carroll and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .

Somalia : A Symbol of the Decaying World Order
The piracy off the coast of Somalia is similar to the decay in world financial and political order .
For nearly two decades , world media has described Somalia using a litany of adjectives .
Some have been accurate , others have been politically expedient and nearly all have been uniformly negative .
This nation of 10 million has been called " the worst humanitarian crisis in the world . "
A " war - torn nation " that is the " poster child of failed states . "
It has been dismissed as " a basket case , " accused of being " a haven for terrorists " and attacked as " the third front in the War on Terror . "
More recently , it has come to be known as the piracy capital of the world .
It came as no surprise , then , when the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) unanimously adopted resolution 1846 on December 16th , 2008 , authorizing any nation the use of " all necessary means " to combat piracy in Somalia .
To the casual observer , this resolution seems like a triumph of international law and order .
Indeed , it shows that cooperation between nations may finally bring an end to the criminal enterprise whose victims are not only foreign seafarers but innocent Somalis as well .
Alas , closer inspection of the resolution in light of others that came before it reveals otherwise .
Somalia 's current infamy began when a humanitarian intervention by the world community led by the United States went terribly wrong in 1993 .
That intervention was in response to UNSC resolution 774 of 1992 , adopted when the world watched in horror how a raging civil war caused the violent death of thousands , the displacement of millions and placed nearly the entire population of the country on the verge of starvation .
Caught in a firefight with Somali warlords who , among other criminal activities , got rich selling donated food aid , the United States lost 18 of its soldiers and shortly after withdrew all its forces from the country .
Article Continues
By 1994 , Somali civilians were left to fend for themselves against warring factions and armed criminal gangs .
In the decade that followed , the UNSC would issue more resolutions on Somalia .
Yet , the more it tried , the worse things got in Somalia , it seemed .
Meanwhile , and in violation of numerous UNSC resolutions , neighboring countries actively armed their favorite warlords in an effort to gain a foothold in any future Somali government .
Warlords were sought and often coveted for their brutality .
Next door Ethiopia , in particular , was most active in keeping the warlords violently engaged with one another .
It was all too happy that Somali warlords kept feeding on the civilian population as long as it had its horse in the race .
Fast forward to Christmas Eve 2006 when Ethiopian troops poured into Somalia and raced to Mogadishu , the bullet - ridden capital of the country .
Leading up to the invasion , the Islamic Courts , a union of local religious groups , defeated a coalition of warlords clandestinely financed by the United States .
This ill - fated victory brought to an end a decade and a half of lawlessness and warlord rule .
But while Somalis besieged by warlords celebrated , the Islamic Courts ' victory was largely seen as a take - over by fundamentalists ready to launch attacks on Ethiopia and may be even the West .
Occupied with its own invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States financed an Ethiopian invasion of Somalia with military training , logistical aid and the occasional aerial bombardment .
The aim was to overthrow the Islamic Courts and install the wildly unpopular Transitional Federal Government .
A government largely made up of the very same warlords and criminals that fed on the population for decades .
The illegality of Ethiopia 's invasion under international law aside , what followed was the violent death of nearly 10,000 civilians and the largest displacement of people in modern history as Mogadishu , a city of 2 million , was nearly emptied of its residents .
And today , as in 1993 , Somalia is yet again on the verge of a massive famine .
Ethiopia , for its part , has benefited enormously from the War on Terror .
A poor nation by any standard , it is ruled with an iron fist by a dictator whose abysmal record on human rights places him in a special category even among African dictators .
Flush now with cash and military aid , Ethiopia not only has the muscle to violently suppress dissent within its borders , it also has the means and , more importantly , the political cover to commit its widely documented war crimes and crimes against humanity with impunity .
Among the most flagrant of these unlawful acts are the repeated and wanton bombardments of civilian populated areas in Somalia and its own Ogaden region .
And despite its brazen violation of human rights , Ethiopia continues to receive financial , military and political aid from the West .
Which brings us back to UNSC resolution 1846 .
The United Nations Secretary General only a few days ago said that Somalia 's problems were beyond the capabilities of United Nations peace keepers and that no volunteers had been found for a coalition .
Yet , the UNSC unanimously approved resolution 1846 virtually authorizing any nation to fight pirates in Somalia , even on land .
Never mind that piracy is a direct consequence of lawlessness in Somalia that was ignored or actively agitated for decades , the UNSC and the international community at large wish now to cure the symptom rather than the disease .
The piracy off the coast of Somalia is similar to the decay in world financial and political order .
All require remedies to their root causes and not band aid solutions .
Have you ever heard a preacher say that the odds against Jesus accurately fulfilling so many prophecies is essentially statistically impossible ?
They will happily tell you about as many supposedly fulfilled prophecies as they can remember , and they will probably expect you to take them at face value .
One of the most common sources used in this argument is from Peter Stoner who claimed in “ Science Speaks ” in 1963 that the probability of one man ( Jesus ) fulfilling 48 Biblical prophecies was 1 in 10157 , and they make it sound even more impressive by stating that it is more than the number of electrons in the universe ( estimated at 1079 ) .
The main reason for this astounding number is that the believers are assuming from the start that these prophecies were all made and fulfilled perfectly .
When we look at them in more depth though , how accurate and amazing do the prophecies really seem ?
To consider a prophecy made and fulfilled , we should first prove that it at least meets these three criteria :
The prophecy was made before the event happened .
This is a simple demand , but difficult to prove .
Unless manuscripts have been found which predate the supposed fulfillment of a prophecy , we can not know that the prophecy was written before the event .
In cases where we do not have the original manuscripts and can not absolutely date their writing , it is also insufficient evidence to prove that a prophecy was not made prior to the event , but this should not lead us to just assume greater antiquity and credibility .
Prophecies which can not be verified to have been written before the events they foretell must be viewed as suspect .
The event actually did happen , in the manner specified , and at the time specified ( if such was given ) .
Again this can be difficult to prove or disprove in the cases of many Biblical prophecies , but the astonishing lack of evidence for even such monumental events as “ the massacre of the innocents ” and many other prophecy - fulfilling elements of Jesus ’s life leads to the conclusion that these events are unlikely to have happened .
If we have no evidence of the fulfillment of a prophecy other than the uncorroborated word of someone who has ulterior motives for saying that it happened , as the Bible ’s authors and editors did , we are unwise to take it as definitively true .
When there is no supporting evidence of an event , it can only be taken on faith .
When evidence is expected but not found , or when contrary evidence is found , then belief in the event even pushes the limits of faith .
The supposed prophecy was actually intended to be a prophecy of this future event .
Strangely some New Testament authors inappropriately used certain Old Testament passages as if they were prophecies when they were never intended to be .
Some of the best examples are the from Psalms where at least a dozen different supposed prophecies are made and later fulfilled by Jesus .
Psalms is a book of songs , similar to a modern hymn book , and the songs included in it were never meant to be used as prophecy .
Therefore , not being prophecies at all , they could not be fulfilled and the supposed fulfillment of these non-prophecies is only more evidence to support the idea that the New Testament authors were embellishing the truth or completely making things up .
Already the probability that Biblical prophecies are true and accurate is dropping rapidly , and the foundation of the “ 1 in 10157 ” chance is looking pretty shaky .
Tomorrow in Part II we will add the basic requirements for an impressive prophecy , and then finally in Part III we will examine a specific prophecy and then attempt to draw some conclusions .
Skip to : Part I , Part II , Part III , Part IV .
With six days till plans are formalized for Obama ’s inaugural parade , a group called “ In the Parade ” is seeking representation by the LGBT community in the event .
Started by “ several dedicated members of the San Francisco bay area LGBTQI community ” ( What does the ‘ I ’ stand for ?
Seriously ) , the group is calling on people to contact members of the 2009 Inaugural Committee and their representatives and make the case that LGBT people ought to be included in the parade .
Since this is the 21st Century , the site provides you with easy forms allowing you to do just that .
We ’re sort of surprised that no LGBT group has ever marched in a parade .
In ’92 and ’96 Clinton allowed gays and lesbians to form a separate group on the sidewalk , but this would be the first time an LGBT group marched in the actual parade , despite the fact that many citizen ’s groups usually do .
When anyone thinks of Russian food , they probably think of potatoes and pot roast , carrots and the simple rustic foods .
However , Russian foods have actually become part of the American diet .
We just do n't realize their origin .
Think of beef Stroganoff , blintzes , caviar , kasha or pyrohi-- all Russian dishes that most of us have eaten or heard of before .
There are many variations of Russian foods because of its large land mass and the many smaller countries that line its borders .

Features
1 History Tracing back through Russian history will bring you ultimately to the mention of the Slavs who spread across the region .
They were the original settlers of the land and are the ancestors of the Russians , Croatians , Bulgarians , Belorussians and Ukrainians , and the other Russian cultures surrounding the area .
Much of the food and cuisines of these different societies have their basis from this early civilization .
2 Identification
Sit down to a tasting of different Russian foods and you will quickly realize that meats , cheeses and other dairy products are the roots of their cooking .
Their culture was basically one main meal a day and the food was very high in calories and heavy , probably so it would last them through the day .
Meats were relatively cheap and easy to purchase .
If their food groups were listed as we do here in the United States , they would be potatoes , bread , eggs , meat and butter , and in that order of importance .
Since Russia has so many rivers and lakes , almost everyone has access to fish , which is also very popular in their cuisine as part of the meat category .
3 Benefits Eat a Russian meal and you will be filled with enough calories for a week .
The reason for their high - calorie content is simple -- it is usually very cold and windy in Russia .
Most of Russia has only two seasons , winter and summer , with some areas that never thaw out .
Their foods are the hearty foods that would stay with you and cause you to have a layer of fat to protect you from the bitter cold .
4 Considerations Growing crops in Russia takes special considerations .
Most of the land has no precipitational influence from the oceans and therefore does not get a considerable amount of rain .
There are small areas in the south along the Pacific Ocean that are almost subtropical , but most of the land is very dry and windblown .
Vegetables that are grown to be used in their cuisine are hardy vegetables that can withstand some cold temperatures , like cabbage , onions , beets and turnips , as well as quick - growing leafy crops like spinach and kale .
Of course , with modern transportation , most any kind of vegetable can be purchased today .
HIROSHIMA , Japan , Dec. 30 ( UPI ) -- Students in Hiroshima , Japan , asked U.S. President - elect Barack Obama to visit their city , saying he would be an advocate of a nuclear weapons - free world .
In a project organized by a Hiroshima newspaper , about 250 teenagers wrote letters to Obama in Japanese which are being translated into English by more than 100 students in the United States , Kyodo News reported Tuesday .

No sitting U.S. president has visited Hiroshima , where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 at the end of World War II , despite repeated calls from the city 's government .
" I hope that a visit by Mr. Obama to Hiroshima would encourage people all over the world to change their views " on stockpiling nuclear weapons , one junior high school student said in her letter .
" If Mr. Obama visits the Peace Memorial Park ( in Hiroshima ) , more people around the world will become interested in issues to do with achieving peace , " another student wrote .
The students ' letters were among around 350 letters sent to Chugoku Shimbun , the daily newspaper promoting an invitation to Obama to visit Hiroshima .
Last week , CNN 's attempt to display the future of TV news ended up making 3D look like the gimmick that it is .
Yep , 3D is a gimmick , most associated ( outside of CNN ) with those stupid glasses designed to fit Blockheads from Venus .
But as you know , there are many different scientific approaches dedicated to tricking you into thinking bullets — or other deadly projectiles such as children — are popping out of the screen and coming right at you .
Here 's a quick and dirty guide to 3D magic .
Most 3D operates on a single basic principle — tricking our dumb , binocular brain into interpreting a 2D image into one with depth .
The most basic way to do this is stereoscopy , which is essentially showing a slightly different image to each eye which the brain mashes together into a 3D image .
We 've broken up the million different ways to do 3D in a few broad categories .
Stupid Glasses
It 's easiest to do stereoscopic images with glasses or other nerdtastic eyewear to change how you see stuff — hence there are a lot of variations in 3D glasses tech .

• An anaglyph image is the old school 3D we all know and got headaches from :
An image has two different color layers , one for each eye , with slightly different perspectives and when we look at them through those awesome plastic glasses ( usually with red and blue lenses ) that block one layer in each eye , our dumb brain takes the resulting separate image from each eye and mashes them together to make a 3D scene in our head .

• Polarized 3D glasses are the more modern choice for cheap 3D for the masses — you 've worn them at IMAX if you 've caught a 3D movie there , or at Disney World , since the big thing they allow over an anaglyph is full color .
They work kind of the same way as the red / blue glasses though — two synced projectors throw images with slightly different perspectives up simultaneously , but at different polarizations .
The polarized glasses only allow a single corresponding polarized image into each eye , and the brain does the hard work again , combining two separate images into a single 3D one .

• The Pulfrich effect is a brain bug where side - to - side motion is interpreted to have some depth when there 's a slight sync lag between your eyes .
A set of glasses with a dark lens over one eye will make this happen , so when something moves from left to right , it 'll look like it 's moving back or forward — you know , in 3D .
It 's been used for the Super Bowl and Married with Children , since the glasses are so cheap .
[ Thanks David ! ]
• ChromaDepth is perhaps the fanciest glasses tech using micro-prisms and whatnot ( hello red and blue again ) , but all it essentially does is slightly shift the way colors are perceived in each eye , so they see different things and boom , 3D .
The major limitation of the tech is that if you change the color of an object , you also change how its depth is perceived , since it 's all based on color .
( Check out the video above , done in ChromaDepth , to see what I mean . )
[ Thanks David ! ] ﻿﻿﻿

• LCD shutter glasses are excellent because they 're so ridiculous .
They actually block vision alternately in each eye in time with the refresh rate on the display by rapidly darkening each lens , while the display alternately shows images with a slightly different perspective ( this is called alternate frame sequencing ) .
It 's essentially the " show different stuff to each eye " principle taken to its logically absurd conclusion — literally blocking the sight of the unwanted eye .
Yes , these complicated puppies usually run over $ 100 ( or way more , even ) , and can give you a headache on a monitor without a high enough refresh rate .
No Glasses Required Okay , so you do n't wanna wear glasses .
No problem — you just move the one - image - per - eye dance to the display itself .

• A parallax barrier is one of the more popular ways for swinging 3D without glasses — you see it in Sharp TVs for instance .
It actually works a lot like polarized glasses , it just moves where the obstruction magic happens to the front of the TV .
Instead of having glasses filter the image for each eye , the screen 's parallax barrier — think of it is a very finely grated fence with precisely angled holes — directs different light into each eye , and your brain turns the mixed signals into a 3D image .
The bad part ?
With a normal parallax barrier , the screen is permanently in 3D mode and you do n't have exactly have a wide viewing angle .
Sharp 's trick for 3D in LCD displays is fancier — there 's a second LCD that creates the parallax barrier with a polarized grid of lines , which is nice because you can turn it off and go back to regular 3D viewing .

• Integral Imaging is a form of parallax actually .
You 've got a bunch of supertiny micro-images that you actually peep through an array of spherical convex lenses , one per micro-image .
All these micro-images come together when you look at them to form a 3D image .
•
Another form of parallax is continuous - motion parallax .
Here , HoloVizio's system dumps pixels in favor of voxels , which can project multiple light beams in multiple directions simultaneously .
3D in 3D
So far , we 've just talked about 2D images on a flat screen , which your brain is fooled into thinking are three - dimensional .
The other side is creating images in real 3D — you know , meatspace .
Still , most of them make use of lighting and projection tricks too .
Advertisement
• The Graphics Lab at the University of Southern California has come up with a cheap way to create images in 3D space ( as opposed to planar space ) by using a spinning mirror called a light - field display .
Basically high speed video is projected onto a quickly spinning mirror , which then " reflects a different and accurate image to each potential viewer . "
The system uses an algorithm to figure out the correct shading and occlusion for the image .

• Japanese researchers ' new plasma - laser hologrammy device takes advantage of the " plasma emission phenomenon near the focal point of focused laser light . "
By manipulating the laser 's focal point , along the x , y and z axes , they can display real 3D images in mid-air .
• Heliodisplay actually creates a surface in mid-air to project an image onto , which allows you to do the " Help me Obi-wan Kenobi " type of floating holograms that look 3 Dish , though they 're actually planar ( 2D ) images .
Yep , it 's expensive .
FAKE FAKE FAKE
There are lots of suggested 3D images out there that are n't any kind of real 3D — videogames are of course the most obvious .
But why pick on them when you can pick on CNN ?
• Sorry Wolf , but we gotta hit people with the truth : CNN's " holograms " are totally fake .
We already explained this before , but no one was projected in front of Wolf Blitzer .
He was looking at a wall .
What we saw at home as computer - generated : A bunch of HD cameras filmed the hologramee from all sides , computers crunched that data and delivered whatever angle the studio camera needed at the time .
As long as the source angle was synced to the studio angle , it looked , to viewers at least , like a 3D " hologram . "
Nice try , Wolfie .

Apple fritters are quick and easy to make and can be eaten warm or cold .
They are healthy sweet treats for lunchboxes , a desert that never fails to please surprise visitors .
My late grandma made apple fritters very often in autumn .
She had several apple trees with big brownish , slightly tart apples .
The smell and the taste of warm apple fritters bring back wonderful memories of my grandma and days spent with her .
For this recipe , I use Granny Smith apples as they are slightly tart and stay firm after frying , but you can use any apples you have .
If the apples are organic or otherwise you are sure they have n’t been sprayed or coated with wax , no need to peel them .
The batter can be made with or without eggs .
Ingredients :
1 cup self raising flour ( or 1 cup plain flour with 1/2 teaspoon bicarb soda )
½ cup milk
pinch of salt
2 - 3 Granny Smith apples
oil for frying
icing ( confectionery ) sugar , cinnamon
Apple fritters pictured above are fried in batter without egg .
Egg batter will be puffier : use 1 egg to 1 cup of flour and reduce the milk quantity to 1/3 cup .
Also , I do n’t add any sugar to the butter as it burns easily , but rather dust it after frying .
How To Make Apple Fritters
To make batter , mix flour ( and bicarb soda if using plain flour ) , salt and half the quantity of milk required .
Using whisker , mix into thick batter and then add remaining milk .
This way batter will be smooth , free of clumps and it ’s easier to control the thickness .
Set aside .
Wash and dry the apples , then core and slice them into 1 cm ( 1/3 inch ) thick slices .
Heat a heavy based pan with oil 1 cm deep .
Dip apple slices into batter , shake the excess and fry till golden brown , approx .
2 - 3 min .
Turn carefully and fry the other side .
When cooked , drain on the paper towel and dust liberally with icing ( confectionery ) sugar and cinnamon .
Serve warm or cold if you prefer .
Enjoy !

This week , the World Economic Forum rated Canada as having the soundest banking system in the world .
The US was rated # 40 .
Even Switzerland , which is known for their banks , ranked # 16 .
According to Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty , “ We ’re a relative rock of stability in this situation , but of course we ’re vulnerable to spillovers from what ’s happening elsewhere . ”
Why is Canada managing to avoid the financial meltdown that is affecting the US , Europe , and much of the rest of the world ?
Because of “ strict regulation “ .
That ’s right , their government regulates banks much more than most countries .
And rather than hurt their economy , it has protected it .
Canada has some of the strictest capitalization requirements in the world — the amount of money a bank has to hang onto to be able to deal with bad loans or other financial problems .
Canada has also refused to approve the merger of any of Canada ’s big banks .
And finally , banking regulations kept Canadian banks from catching the fever for subprime mortgages that spread like a plague across the rest of the world .
Compare this to the US , where deregulation , mergers , and subprime mortgages have been all the rage , but are leading to the end of American capitalism .
So the next time someone says that there was n’t anything the government could have done to prevent the current financial crisis , or claims that government regulation of business is always bad , all you have to do is point next door .
Hey there ,
Today we 're going to take a look at a part of Perl that a lot of folks shy away from ; mostly because ( from my experience ) they feel it 's too abstract a notion or too complicated to understand .
For today , I 'm referring to Perl references ;)
And here 's the thing ; nothing could be farther from the truth .
It 's just about as simple as the sentence preceding the last .
When I referred to Perl references I was , for the most part , laying the foundation for easily understanding the entire concept .
If you attack the problem semantically , and try not to think of it as a bunch of backslashes and arrows and symbols , it makes perfect sense :)
If I 'm wrong , and this post leaves you reeling in confusion and pain , please let me know so I 'll stop being so cavalier with my prose :)
So , let 's take a look at Perl references and how they can be used , most basically , in a step - by - step fashion ; from the simplest of beginnings to the not - so - complex middle ( We 'll leave references to hashes of arrays of references to other hashes for some other day ;)
For all of these examples , we 'll use command line examples , so you can cut and paste them to try them out , rather than pretend that we 're inside a Perl script .
1 . A simple way to look at Perl References :
The basis of any Perl reference is the variable , or value that you 're referring to .
At the most basic level , any variable assignment is a reference .
For instance , look at these basic statements :
host # perl -e ' $a = " bob " ; '
host # perl -e ' @a = qw( bob joe ) ; '
host # perl -e ' % a = ( bob => joe ) ;
These are all just simple variable assignments ( with $ indicating a scalar variable , @ representing an array and % representing a hash ) .
However , you can think of them as references ( which will make the transition to understanding textbook references much more smooth .
The variable $ a , for example , has an assigned value of the string " bob . "
So , if you look at that in a different way , the $ a variable refers to the string " bob , " or ( another way ) the variable $ a is NOT the string " bob , " but a reference to that string ( or scalar ) value .
BTW , if this part of the post is beyond where you 're at with Perl , take a look back at some of our older posts on simple arithmetic and simple variables in Perl that deal with these more basic principles .
There should be enough links on those two pages to connect you to all the other ones on this site .
If not , the blog search feature ( although it 's very generous in its interpretations -- search for the letter " a " to see what I mean ;) should help you find what you need .
2. Looking at actual Perl References : A textbook Perl reference is the same thing as we discussed in point 1 , except taken up ( or out ) one meta - level .
So instead of having the relationship of reference ( $ a ) and referent ( " bob " ) that we had before , we 're going to assign one scalar variable a reference to any of the three variables from before , rather than from the variables directly to the values .
So , to reference any of these three we could do the following ( note that for this basic lesson , the Perl reference will always be a scalar since , at its core , it always is ; even if that scalar value is a part of a larger array or hash ) .
The symbol that denotes that you 're setting your variable 's value to a reference is the backslash ( \ ) character :
host # perl -e ' $ a_ref1 = \ $a ; '
host # perl -e ' $ a_ref2 = \@a ; '
host # perl -e ' $ a_ref3 = \ %a ; '
So now we have three very simple Perl references .
$ a_ref1 has the value of a reference to the $ a scalar variable , $ a_ref2 has the value of a reference to the @a array and $ a_ref3 has the value of a reference to the %a hash .
( Note that you can have a Perl variable refer to itself , although the uses for this are somewhat limited and generally not necessary for basic Perl scripting .
Ex : $ a_ref4 = \ $a_ref4 <-- $ a_ref4 has the value of a reference to itself .
3. Extracting values from Perl References :
This is just as easy as extracting values from regular variables , except , as before , you have think one more hop .
Whereas , with a regular variable , you would extract the value of that variable directly , with a Perl reference , you need to extract the value of the variable that is being referenced by your reference .
It sounds worse than it is ;)
For instance , if we accept that the scalar variable $ a is equal to " bob , " we know that we can extract the value of $ a by doing the following ( as before ) :
host # perl -e ' $ a = " bob " ; print " $a
" ;'
Whereas , if we create a reference ( another scalar variable ) to the variable $ a , and call that $ a_ref1 , we need to extract the value from the variable that we are referencing .
A simple and comfortable approach to extracting this value would be the following :
host # perl -e ' $ a = " bob " ; $ a_ref1 = \$a ; print " ${$a_ref1}
" ;'
In this instance we 've simply peeled the onion , so to speak ( insert your favorite peelable vegetable or fruit here ; ) .
In order to extract the variable of $ a from the Perl reference $ a_ref1 variable , we just stripped it layer by layer .
To deconstruct the print statement above , we 'll go backward from the statement we used to print the value of the $ a_ref1 Perl reference :
a. $ {$a_ref1} is what we call to print the value of the variable $a .
b. $ {$a_ref1} is actually equal to $ { \$a} since $ a_ref1 's value is a reference to $ a ( as denoted by " $ a_ref1 = \ $a ; " )
c. $ { \$a} is equal to $ {a} since the we 're dealing directly with the referent .
$ a_ref1 ( the variable with the value of the reference actually points to a hex address in memory ( usually associated with a Perl file type ) .
You can see the difference in the output of the two commands below :
host # # perl -e ' $ a = " bob " ; $ a_ref1 = \$a ; print " $ a_ref1
" ;'
SCALAR ( 0x2e250 ) <--
This is the hexadecimal memory space that the $ a_ref1 reference refers to .
Your results may vary :)
perl -e ' $ a = " bob " ; $ a_ref1 = \$a ; print " $ {\$a}
" ;'
bob <--
This is the value of the referenced variable $ a , which we know ( from before ) is equal to " bob " ( $a = " bob " from what seems like so far up the page ;)
d. And , even though we do n't need to tell you this , just for completeness ' sake : $ {a} ( or $ a - same thing ) equals " bob " .
4. Extracting values from Perl References that are n't scalar : Finally , some good news :)
The principles above apply to all sorts of variable dereferencing .
So , for instance , if you wanted to extract the value of the array reference $ a_ref2 , you could get it by doing :
host # perl -e ' @a = qw( bob joe ) ; $ a_ref2 = \@a ; print " @{$a_ref2}
" ;'
bob joe <--
The whole thing
host # perl -e ' @a = qw( bob joe ) ; $ a_ref2 = \@a ; print " @{$a_ref2} [ 0 ]
" ;'
bob <-- array index 0
host # perl -e ' @a = qw( bob joe ) ; $ a_ref2 = \@a ; print " @{$a_ref2} [ 1 ]
" ;'
joe <-- array index1
and the same basic principle applies to hashes ( % {$ a_ref3} would get you all those values ) .
Basically , all you need to do to extract the value of a one - level - deep Perl Reference is to wrap the reference - variable in a curly brackets and preface that with the appropriate symbol ( $ for scalar , @ for array , % for hash , etc ) .
5 . What to do if you have no idea what kind of Perl Reference you 're dealing with : Fortunately , there exists - in the very heart of Perl - a function to deal with just this sort of predicament .
It 's called , for some strange reason , " ref " ;)
On many systems , doing something like this :
host # perl -e ' @a = qw( bob joe ) ; $ ref_type = ref( \@a ) ; print " $ref_type

ARRAY
is all you need to do to get back the type of reference you 're dealing with ( Obviously , we knew it was an array since we 're doing these self - contained command line scripts , but you could use the ref function against any Perl Reference and get the value from it .
One thing to note about the ref function is that it does n't always work as expected .
For instance , if you call the function ref on a straight - up scalar , array or hash variable , it should return " undefined . "
This is normal , since those straight - up variables are " not " references .
However , sometimes , even when you are dealing with a reference , you wo n't get any feedback on your command line .
This is n't to say that ref does n't know what kind of reference you 're working with ; just that it 's not in the mood to tell you ;)
You can get around this little hassle pretty simply by just writing a simple type - check .
So if you run the following :
host # perl -e ' % a = ( bob => joe ) ; $ ref_type = ref ( \ %a ) ; print " $ref_type
" ;'
and you do n't get the return of
HASH
as you would expect to , you can figure out what the return from ref was anyway .
The two most basic ways to do this range from cowboy to academic ;)
a. Cowboy : Just print the variable that points to the reference , like we did above , to get the hexadecimal address ( instead of the value of the referenced variable ) , since this is accompanied by the reference type :
host # perl -e ' % a = ( bob => joe ) ; $ ref_type = \ %a ; print " $ref_type
" ;'
HASH ( 0x2e26 c )
b. Academic :
Use a simple if - condition to test and see what kind of output ref returns
host # perl -e ' % a = ( bob => joe ) ; $ ref_type = ref ( \ %a ) ; if ( $ ref_type eq " HASH " ) {print " HaSH FOUND !
" } ;'
HaSH FOUND !
Of course , you could check just to see if the value is even " defined , " since , if it is n't , you 're not dealing with a reference .
99 % of the time , Perl will do the right thing and tell you what the ref function returns .
For all I know , the 1 % of the time it does n't work for me is because I completely screwed up ;)
Perl also deals with references to a lot of different file and object types to which these same basic principles apply .
So , if you 're dealing with a pipe or another type of file or variable , you can still use the principles above to help you out .
And , for simplicity 's sake ( until you get used to being utterly confused while in a state of mostly - understanding ; ) , for every level of referencing that gets added on , you just need to derefence that many times backward ( as shown above ) to make your way back to the original value of the original variable (s ) !
And that wraps up that :)
Hope that helps shed some light on basic Perl References and , again , I 'd love to hear what you think about this post ; especially with regards to how you felt about it ( Was it too simplistic ?
Too Complicated ?
Hard to understand ?
Easy Peasy ? ;)

An Israeli cabinet minister stepped into a row with the Vatican today , saying it was " unacceptable " to consider canonising Pius XII , who was pope during the second world war and has been criticised by some for not publicly opposing the Holocaust .
In an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz , Isaac Herzog , Israel 's social affairs minister , who is responsible for relations with Christian communities , said efforts to turn Pius into a saint were " an exploitation of forgetfulness and lack of awareness " .
He accused Pius of having kept silent during the war .
" Throughout the period of the Holocaust , the Vatican knew very well what was happening in Europe , " Herzog told the paper .
" Yet there is no evidence of any step being taken by the pope , as the stature of the Holy See should have mandated ...
Instead of acting according to the biblical verse ' thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour ' the pope kept silent - and perhaps even worse . "
His comments come at a time when some in the Vatican have been pressing for the current pope , Benedict XVI , to take the next step towards making Pius a saint by approving a decree recognising his " heroic virtues " .
Earlier this month the pope paid tribute to his wartime predecessor , but a Vatican spokesman said Benedict was now in a period of reflection about Pius .
" It is n't right to submit him to pressures on one side or another , " the spokesman , Father Federico Lombardi , said in Rome .
Benedict has defended Pius , saying he worked " secretly and silently " during the war and saved thousands by ordering churches and convents in Italy to hide Jews and by giving them false passports to escape .
Others have been more critical .
One regular source of contention between Israel and the Vatican is a brief photo caption at Yad Vashem , Israel 's Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem , which challenges Pius ' wartime actions .
The caption states that Pius , who was pope between 1939 and 1958 , abstained from signing a 1942 Allied declaration condemning the extermination of Jews , and that he did not intervene when Jews were deported from Rome to Auschwitz .
" Even when reports about the murder of Jews reached the Vatican , the Pope did not protest either verbally or in writing , " it says .
" His silence and the absence of guidelines obliged churchmen throughout Europe to decide on their own how to react . "
Earlier this month the Vatican called on Yad Vashem to conduct a " new , objective and in - depth review " of the caption .
However , although the Vatican has opened its archives to researchers for the period shortly before the war , the archives of Pius ' papacy remain closed .
Yad Vashem defended its caption saying it represented " the best research regarding this topic " and called for the Vatican archives to be opened .
Some of those in the Vatican who are pushing for Pius ' beatification say the current pope should not visit Israel until the caption has been changed .
" How can he go there knowing these captions are absolutely historically untrue ? "
Father Peter Gumpel , a German Jesuit who is leading the campaign for sainthood for Pius , said in an interview with the Associated Press in the Vatican City last week .
" Catholics would be mortally offended . "
Israel and the Vatican only established full diplomatic relations in 1993 and since then there have been other disagreements , over issues including the taxing of church property in and around Jerusalem and permits for Arab Christian clergy to travel through the occupied West Bank .
Pope John Paul II visited Israel in 2000 , the first pope to do so , but Pope Benedict XVI appears to have no plans to visit in the near future .
On Sunday , the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , said the row over the photo caption should not prevent a papal visit , though he too was critical of Pius .
" We have reason to believe that Pius XII did n't do enough to save Jewish life .
I do n't want to pass judgement , " Peres said .
" If there is evidence then it should be checked carefully .
The visit to the holy country is nothing to do with anger or disputes .
It 's holy all the time .
It is holy for all of us . "
Richard Wolff is professor of economics at UMass Amherst .
He talks about the underlying cause of the current capitalist crisis ( NOT ``financial ' ' crisis ) and capitalism in general .
Socialism and workers ' democracy is presented as the alternative .
The talk was presented by the Association for Economic and Social Analysis and the journal Rethinking Marxism in early October 2008 .
The health institutes in both Britain and Germany may soon suggest prices for drugs , a strategy intended to deflect political pressure back on the companies and shorten negotiations that now often take months .
“ We have been told that the price is the price , but the worm is turning now , ” Dr. Barnett said .
Company executives acknowledge that they are increasingly acceding to British demands to slash prices .
But the most pressing question for the industry is what influence the British institute will have in the United States .
The United States already spends more than twice as much per capita on health care as the average of other industrialized nations , while getting generally poorer health outcomes .
Michael O. Leavitt , the Bush administration ’s secretary of health and human services , said in a September speech that , at its present growth rate , health care spending “ could potentially drag our nation into a financial crisis that makes our major subprime mortgage crisis look like a warm summer rain . ”
And while there is fierce disagreement about how and whether to control drug and device expenses as part of a broader reform of the health system , many say some cost controls are inevitable .
At a September device industry conference in Washington , a seminar on the issue was standing - room only and half of the questioners mentioned NICE .
John R. Dwyer Jr. , a Washington lawyer who represents device makers , said that many in the industry have believed that major changes to control costs in the federal Medicare program were inevitable , and “ people see NICE as the only workable paradigm . ”
Meanwhile , Mr. Hardy waits .
In recent weeks his growing tumor has pressed on a nerve that governs his voice .
He can barely speak and is increasingly out of breath .
The Hardys are hoping that in January NICE will approve the use of Sutent , allowing Mr. Hardy further treatment .
" It ’s hard to know that there is something out there that could help but they ’re saying you ca n’t have it because of cost , ” said Ms. Hardy , who now speaks for her husband of 45 years .
“ What price is life ? ”

The Economy of the Federation
Gene Roddenberry always wanted Star Trek to depict a future of humanity without war , without hunger , without disease and without poverty :
" In the 24th century there will be no hunger , there will be no greed , and all the children will know how to read . "
( Gene Roddenberry )
Even more than that , he envisioned a world in which not just the circumstances have improved but humanity itself has evolved :
" Perhaps one of the primary features of Star Trek that made it different from other shows was , it believed that humans are improving - they will vastly improve in the 23rd century . "
( Gene Roddenberry )
There are hints or statements in several episodes that particularly the economy of the future , or at least that of the Federation , works differently than today , and that something like a currency may not exist any longer .
The evidence of the possible existence of money , however , is contradictory , and the question is discussed accordingly controversially .
This article strives to outline a half - way plausible solution based on canon evidence .

Contra money

We need to get some . "
In the same movie , when Kirk is unable to pay in the restaurant , Gillian asks sarcastically , " Do n't tell me they do n't use money in the 23rd century , " and Kirk tells her " Well , we do n't . " ( " Star Trek IV " )
In the same movie , when Kirk is unable to pay in the restaurant , Gillian asks sarcastically , and Kirk tells her ( " Star Trek IV " ) Picard tries to explain to Ralph Offenhouse from the 20th century that there would be no need for his law firm any longer : " A lot has changed in three hundred years .
People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of ' things ' .
We have eliminated hunger , want , the need for possessions . "

The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force in our lives .
We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity . "

Paris says about the significance of Fort Knox : " Well , uh , when the New World Economy took shape in the late 22nd century and money went the way of the dinosaur , Fort Knox was turned into a museum . "
( VOY : " Dark Frontier " )
Discussion
There are numerous pieces of evidence in favor of money , in the 23rd as well as in the 24th century .
Money seems to play a role in many cases in which single individuals or the Federation or Starfleet as a whole are dealing with aliens , and if they only have to pay for their drinks .
There must be some sort of compensation .
Regarding the statements that suggest there is no money any longer , we are allowed to discount Kirk 's mention of money in the 20th century , since this would not preclude that some other form of currency may be used in the 23rd century .
Still , the few statements suggesting that currency and companies wo n't exist any longer , at least in the 24th century , are so definite that they may prevail .
Side note
On an interesting note , DS9 : " In the Cards " was produced just after " First Contact " , and Jake 's reply to Nog exactly mirrors Picard 's words to Lily .
Although DS9 is otherwise full of evidence supporting the existence of money , this episode pays tribute to the movie .
Picard 's two statements from " The Neutral Zone " and " First Contact " as well as Jake 's stance in " In the Cards " may have been meant to be subjective .
As seen from the outside or with they eyes of someone from the 20th / 21st century , Federation economy may largely work like Picard suggested .
At least within an idealistic organization like Starfleet .
But there must be some sort of monetary system , and if only for internal accounts .
After all , building a Sovereign - class starship consumes far more energy , material and man power than a Type - 6 shuttlecraft .
This must be accounted for in some way .
Still , we would n't expect Picard to lie when he says , " there is no money " .
He may be right in that the cost for ship may not be correlated in any way to the cost of living .
Most likely because there is nothing like cost of living any longer , in which case he would have better said something like " money is n't used any longer in every - day life " .
In the 24th century , there may be plenty of energy for everyone to get whatever he needs from the replicator .
Industry , power generation and infrastructure is highly automated .
There is so much of everything that no one would need to work .
Maybe there is a high unemployment rate , and the few people working in industry , transportation and public services are quite respectable .
Either that , or there are also many " fun " jobs besides that .
Either way , the social position is still determined by the reputation of the job , only that payment seems to play a minor role .
But money or Federation credits may still be necessary to purchase goods or services that are not ubiquitous .
Clearly anything handmade or any service like Sisko's Restaurant would belong into this category .
The loss of cultural values would be too sad if all this did not exist any longer .
Still , including all of humanity to his statements ( " We work to better ourselves ... " ) seems quite pretentious of Picard .
We may presuppose that social problems will have been largely solved , once there is enough of everything for everyone .
One particular statement always goes along with the absence of poverty from 24th century Earth , and this is the absence of crime .
But Picard clearly goes much further , because he suggests that the whole human nature has changed because the circumstances of human life are better .
The universality of his statement is in Gene Roddenberry 's sense but it hence feels like Picard breaks the fourth wall .
It is not a realistic assumption that the human nature would generally change , even if the captain and most of Starfleet are idealistic enough and fit with a new view of a humanity that does not strive to accumulate wealth any longer .
Not everyone would be content with a decent apartment and maybe a small private hovercar .
As long as there are human beings , there will be still greed and envy .
What would the Federation government or local authorities do about individuals who live their lives at the expense of others ?
Who strive to purchase large estates and build palaces for themselves ?
Yet , we may excuse Picard in that he expresses a personal interpretation of how 24th century Federation economy should work .
This view may be the one officially endorsed by the Federation and by Starfleet , but probably would n't be imposed on billions of individuals .
In this light , there may be some niches for companies like Dytallix or Yanas Tigan 's mine , regardless whether they reside in Federation territory or on neutral ground .
The Federation is a free society , and we would not expect private entrepreneurs to be outlawed .
The reason why they do not have a major part is because they are only required to provide certain raw materials and goods that are not available anywhere and in any quantity .
And such goods are likely to be traded with alien cultures .
Even if the Federation economy somehow managed to go without a currency , an equivalent would be needed to trade goods with other civilizations .
It is possible that the Federation credit is not much different than gold - pressed latinum in this field .
We cannot and we should not compare the economy of the Federation to 20th century communism , even if there are certain parallels in the ultimate goals ( that were never close to be reached in any implementation of communism ) .
Communism was an ideology to liberate exploited workers by expropriating the capital owners in an act of revolution .
Quite contrary to that , the Federation economy may have developed in a slow process , owing to a tendency in which money became unable to keep up productivity any longer .
The reasons may be twofold .
Firstly , it is already visible now that Western industrial ( secondary ) societies are turning into service ( tertiary ) economies and ultimately into financial ( quaternary ) economies .
Automation has largely replaced human power .
Hardly anyone is still " productive " , in a way that his workforce would be needed to produce new values .
The quaternary economy we are facing would just shift around assets , which would gradually lose its equivalent in the form of industrial goods .
Secondly , the availability of plenty of energy may give the death blow to the idea of money as a driving force .
There is clearly no money equivalent to something ubiquitous .
Yet , everything seems to change towards the end of the 24th century .
In accordance with Patrick Stewart 's announcement that the benevolent world of Starfleet does n't exist any longer in Star Trek Picard , money seems to rule the world again in his series .
This looks like a dramatic paradigm shift not only in the in-universe history of the Federation but also in the depiction of the world of the future , especially since the re-commercialization is only one of several aspects in which the society is not utopian any longer .
Yet , as unrealistic as it already seems that humanity would abandon the accumulation of wealth in the course of some 200 years , what are the odds that the society would return to a money - driven economy in only 20 years ?
Just as TNG may have shown us a very idealistic view of the 24th century , PIC perhaps focuses on the flip side of the coin , that businesses still exists and that , though not omnipresent any longer , money can still accomplish a lot .
In fact , the first three episodes of Picard show more places on Earth than seven seasons of TNG , with accordingly more chances to see some sort of advertising .
And Stardust City on Freecloud may even pass as the exception that proves the rule .
We already know from other series that humans still do have something like money in the 24th century , but they would n't be able to buy every kind of goods or services they desire in the Federation .
So this is what Space Las Vegas was likely created for , in a clear analogy to the original one in Nevada .
Summarizing , not all may be lost about the utopian world of the Federation in Picard , it may just be shown from a different , less pleasant perspective in Picard .
Here 's hoping that the old spirit of Star Trek will be in the focus again in future episodes .

を読んでふと思った事。最近せっかく大学院へ行ってもろくな仕事に就けない！という話をよく耳にします。企業の採用戦略自体は市場原理の結果なので仕方ないです。でももうちょっと学生さんもポジティブに考えられないだろうかと思います。
不本意にも修士や博士に進学出来ず、就職せざるを得なかった人はどこか心の底で引け目を感じていると思います。一方で、進学してしまったばかりに就職が遅れ、結局専門を行かせなかった人は半分騙されたとの思いでしょう。
自分の事しか知らないので、自分と美大の事を書きます。私が院を出る頃にうちの大学にも新しく博士過程が生まれ、正直心が惹かれました。もしどうにかして続けていたら、人生変わっていたかも知れないと今でも思う時があります。とはいえ当時は経済的負担を考えると全く非現実な話だったので、進学は全く選択肢にありませんでした。
それから職を探すわけですが、世の中に美大彫刻科の院卒に最適な専門職というのがそう簡単に転がっているわけでもなく、せめてデザイン系の職を探すも全滅で、流れ着いたのはウェブデザインの時給1000円のバイト(すげー高！とその時は思った)。その面接の時に、プログラムを組めるなら雇っても良いと言われました。
これって当時はかなーり深刻な問題でした。そりゃプログラムも面白そうだけど、汗水流してやっと学費を稼ぎ、苦労して得た六年間が全く自分に意味が無かった事を認めてしまう事になるからです。とはいえ、迷いは全くありませんでした。貧乏が便利なのは選択肢が無い事です。選択肢の無い所では迷いようがありません。
そこが私のコンピュータ業界への入り口でした。入って分かった事は、ここでは学歴という物が全く問題視されないという事です。美大卒という怪しい経歴にも関わらず、すぐに給料は倍に増えましたし、大学の話が会話に登る事すらありません。やっぱり若い業界って素晴らしい。
しかしふと思うのは、もしもここが学歴に重きを置くような業界だったら、私のような者には活躍の場は無かっただろうなと言う事です。皮肉にも、美大の大学院が役に立たなかった事を恨んだ私が、コンピュータサイエンスの学歴が役に立たない事に救われたのです。
それから十年。面白い事に自分の仕事内容が年々アート寄りになって来ている事に気づかされます。経験を積むと自分の裁量が広がるので段々地が出てくるのです。そうなると次第に、自分の学生時代は無駄だった！と後悔する事が減ってきました。
進学出来ない人は悔やむ必要ないです。進学出来るかどうかは経済的な問題で、あなたの能力の問題では無いという事を社会は分かっています。
学歴があるのに専門職に就けなかった人は悔やむ必要ないです。どんな業界でも経験を積むと段々好きな事が出来るようになるので、いずれあなたの知識は役に立ちます。

Entropy and evolution November 10 , 2008 11:16 MST
One of the oldest canards in the creationists ' book is the claim that evolution must be false because it violates the second law of thermodynamics , or the principle that , as they put it , everything must go from order to disorder .
One of the more persistent perpetrators of this kind of sloppy thinking is Henry Morris , and few creationists today seem able to get beyond this error .
Remember this tendency from order to disorder applies to all real processes .
Real processes include , of course , biological and geological processes , as well as chemical and physical processes .
The interesting question is : " How does a real biological process , which goes from order to disorder , result in evolution .
which goes from disorder to order ? "
Perhaps the evolutionist can ultimately find an answer to this question , but he at least should not ignore it , as most evolutionists do .
Especially is such a question vital , when we are thinking of evolution as a growth process on the grand scale from atom to Adam and from particle to people .
This represents in absolutely gigantic increase in order and complexity , and is clearly out of place altogether in the context of the Second Law .
As most biologists get a fair amount of training in chemistry , I 'm afraid he 's wrong on one bit of slander there : we do not ignore entropy , and are in fact better informed on it than most creationists , as is clearly shown by their continued use of this bad argument .
I usually rebut this claim about the second law in a qualitative way , and by example — it 's obvious that the second law does not state that nothing can ever increase in order , but only that an decrease in one part must be accompanied by a greater increase in entropy in another .
Two gametes , for instance , can fuse and begin a complicated process in development that represents a long - term local decrease in entropy , but at the same time that embryo is pumping heat out into its environment and increasing the entropy of the surrounding bit of the world .
It 's a very bad argument they are making , but let 's consider just the last sentence of the quote above .
This represents in absolutely gigantic increase in order and complexity , and is clearly out of place altogether in the context of the Second Law .
A " gigantic increase in order and complexity " … how interesting .
How much of an increase ?
Can we get some numbers for that ?
Daniel Styer has published an eminently useful article on " Entropy and Evolution " that does exactly that — he makes some quantitative estimates of how much entropy might be decreased by the process of evolution .
I knew we kept physicists around for something ; they are so useful for filling in the tricky details .
The article nicely summarizes the general problems with the creationist claim .
They confuse the metaphor of ' disorder ' for the actual phenomenon of entropy ; they seem to have an absolutist notion that the second law prohibits all decreases in entropy ; and they generally lack any quantitative notion of how entropy actually works .
The cool part of this particular article , though , is that he makes an estimate of exactly how much entropy is decreased by the process of evolution .
First he estimates , very generously , how much entropy is decreased per individual .
If we assume each individual is 1000 times " more improbable " than its ancestor one century ago , that is , that we are specified a thousand times more precisely than our great - grandparents ( obviously a ludicrously high over - estimate , but he 's trying to give every advantage to the creationists here ) , then we can describe the reduction in the number of microstates in the modern organism as :
Now I 'm strolling into dangerous ground for us poor biologists , since this is a mathematical argument , but really , this is simple enough for me to understand .
We know the statistical definition of entropy :
In the formula above , k B is the Boltzmann constant .
We can just plug in our estimated ( grossly overestimated ! ) value for Ω , have fun with a little algebra , and presto , a measure of the change in entropy per individual per century emerges .
Centuries are awkward units , so Styer converts that to something more conventional : the entropy change per second is - 3.02 x 10-30 J/ K .
There are , of course , a lot of individual organisms on the planet , so that number needs to be multiplied by the total number of evolving organism , which , again , we charitably overestimate at 1032 , most of which are prokaryotes , of course .
The final result is a number that tells us the total change in entropy of the planet caused by evolution each second :
-302 J/K
What does that number mean ?
We need a context .
Styer also estimates the Earth 's total entropy throughput per second , that is , the total flux involved from absorption of the sun 's energy and re-radiation of heat out into space .
It 's a slightly bigger number :
420 x 1012 J/K
To spell it out , there 's about a trillion times more entropy flux available than is required for evolution .
The degree by which earth 's entropy is reduced by the action of evolutionary processes is miniscule relative to the amount that the entropy of the cosmic microwave background is increased .
This is very cool and very clear .
I 'm folding up my copy of Styer 's paper and tucking it into my copy of The Counter - Creationism Handbook , where it will come in handy .

Motivation
A singly linked list is a common data structure familiar to all computer scientists .
A singly linked list is made of nodes where each node has a pointer to the next node ( or null to end the list ) .
A singly linked list is often used as a stack ( or last in first out queue ( LIFO ) ) because adding a new first element , removing the existing first element , and examining the first element are very fast O ( 1 ) operations .
When working with singly linked list , you are typically given a link to the first node .
Common operations on a singly linked list are iterating through all the nodes , adding to the list , or deleting from the list .
Algorithms for these operations generally require a well formed linked list .
That is a linked list without loops or cycles in it .
If a linked list has a cycle :
The malformed linked list has no end ( no node ever has a null next_node pointer )
The malformed linked list contains two links to some node
Iterating through the malformed linked list will yield all nodes in the loop multiple times
A malformed linked list with a loop causes iteration over the list to fail because the iteration will never reach the end of the list .
Therefore , it is desirable to be able to detect that a linked list is malformed before trying an iteration .
This article is a discussion of various algorithms to detect a loop in a singly linked list .
Incorrect " Solutions "
Traverse the List Until the End
Just look at the entire list to see if it has and end .
When it ends , return .
// Incorrect ' solution ' function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
The problem with this solution is that if the linked list does have a loop , the program will never terminate .
There is no way for this algorithm to return true when the linked list does have a loop .
Mark Each Node
Traverse the list and mark each node as having been seen .
If you come to a node that has already been marked , then you know that the list has a loop .
// Incorrect ' solution ' function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; do { if ( currentNode.seen ) return true ; currentNode . seen = true ; } while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
The problem with this solution is ensuring that " seen " is marked as false for all the nodes before you start .
If the linked list has a loop , it is n't possible to iterate over each node to set " seen " to " false " as an initial value for each node .
It might be possible to overcome some of this by using a big integer rather than a boolean and using a random integer as your marker .
In that case there is is a good chance that no node will have your inital value , but a small chance that one would and your algorithm would fail .
Even if you are able to solve the initial value problem , each node in a linked list may not have a field to use for this purpose .
Requiring such a field in each node would mean that this is not a generic solution .
As we will see later , this field is not needed for a perfectly correct and efficient solution anyway .
Detect Only Full Loops
When asked to come up with a solution , a common pitfall is not detecting all loops , but just a loop where the last node links to the first .
A loop could still occur ( and not be detected ) if the last element linked to ( for example ) the second element .
// Incorrect ' solution ' function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) { if ( currentNode == startNode ) return true ; } return false ; }
Inefficient Solutions
Keep a hash set of all nodes seen so far
O (n ) time complexity , O( n ) space complexity
Keeping a set of all the nodes have seen so far and testing to see if the next node is in that set would be a perfectly correct solution .
It would run fast as well .
However it would use enough extra space to make a copy of the linked list .
Allocating that much memory is prohibitively expensive for large lists .
// Inefficient solution function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) { HashSet nodesSeen = new HashSet ( ) ; Node currentNode = startNode ; do { if ( nodesSeen.contains ( currentNode ) ) return true ; nodesSeen.add( currentNode ) ; } while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
Use a doubly linked list
O(n ) time complexity
Doubly linked lists make it easy to tell if there is a loop .
If you encounter any node that does n't link to the last node you visited , you know that there are two nodes linking to that node .
Because the back links could be initially messed up in some other way , this algorithm is only correct if you can trust the back links .
Otherwise it is just a malformed doubly linked list finder .
The singly linked list can even be converted into a doubly linked list with little additional work .
Again this will require that we change the structure of the Node to accomodate a second link .
Something that may not be possible in all cases .
Usually a singly linked list is used because the amount of space to allocate for each node is at a premium .
// Inefficient solution function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; Node previousNode = null ; do { if ( previousNode & & currentNode.prev( ) && previousNode != currentNode.prev( ) ) return true ; if ( !currentNode.prev( ) ) currentNode.setPrev(previousNode ) ; previousNode = currentNode ; } while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
Check the Entire List So Far
O( n ^2 ) time complexity
For each node , assume that the portion of the list examined so for has no loops and check to see if the next node creates a loop by iterating again over the entire list up to that point .
// Inefficient solution function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) { Node currentNode = startNode.next ( ) ; int i=0 ; do { Node checkNode = startNode ; int j=0 ; do { if ( checkNode == currentNode ) return true ; j++ ; } while ( j < i && check Node = checkNode.next ( ) ) ; i++ ; } while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
Reverse the list
O(n ) time complexity
If you reverse the list , and remember the inital node , you will know that there is a cycle if you get back to the first node .
While efficient , this solution changes the list .
Reversing the list twice would put the list back in its initial state , however this solution is not appropriate for multi- threaded applications .
In some cases there may not be a way to modify nodes .
Since changing the nodes is not needed to get the answer , this solution is not recommended .
// Solution modifies the list function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node previousNode = null ; Node currentNode = startNode ; Node nextNode ; if ( !currentNode.next ( ) ) return false ; while ( currentNode ) { nextNode = currentNode.next ( ) ; currentNode.setNext( previousNode ) ; previousNode = currentNode ; currentNode = nextNode ; } return ( previousNode == startNode ) ; }
Credit for this solution goes to Piyush Srivastava .
Use Memory Allocation Information
O(n ) time complexity in the amount of memory on the computer
Some programming languages allow you to see meta information about each node -- the memory address at which it is allocated .
Because each node has a unique numeric address , it is possible to use this information to detect cycles .
For this algorithm , keep track of the minimum memory address seen , the maximum memory address seen , and the number of nodes seen .
If more nodes have been seen than can fit in the address space then some node must have been seen twice and there is a cycle .
// Depends on size of available computer memory rather than size of list function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; int minAddress , int maxAddress = ¤tNode ; int nodesSeen = 0 ; while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) { nodesSeen ++ ; if ( ¤tNode < minAddress ) minAddress = ¤tNode ; if ( ¤tNode > maxAddress ) maxAddress = ¤tNode ; if ( maxAddress - minAddress < nodesSeen ) return true ; } return false ; }
This algorithm relies on being able to see memory address information .
This is not possible to implement in some programming languages such as Java that do not make this information available .
It is likely that the entire list will be allocated close together in memory .
In such a case the implementation will run close to the running time of the length of the list .
However , if the nodes in the list are allocated over a large memory space , the runtime of this algorithm could be much greater than some of the best solutions .
Best Solutions
Catch Larger and Larger Loops
O(n ) time complexity
Always store some node to check .
Occasionally reset this node to avoid the " Detect Only Full Loops " problem .
When resetting it , double the amount of time before resetting it again .
// Good solution function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node currentNode = startNode ; Node checkNode = null ; int since = 0 ; int sinceScale = 2 ; do { if ( checkNode == currentNode ) return true ; if ( since >= since Scale ) { checkNode = currentNode ; since = 0 ; sinceScale = 2 * sinceScale ; } since ++ ; } while ( currentNode = currentNode.next ( ) ) ; return false ; }
This solution is O ( n ) because sinceScale grows linearly with the number of calls to next ( ) .
Once sinceScale is greater than the size of the loop , another n calls to next ( ) may be required to detect the loop .
This solution requires up to 3 traversals of the list .
This solution was devised by Stephen Ostermiller and proven O( n ) by Daniel Martin .
Catch Loops in Two Passes
O(n ) time complexity
Simultaneously go through the list by ones ( slow iterator ) and by twos ( fast iterator ) .
If there is a loop the fast iterator will go around that loop twice as fast as the slow iterator .
The fast iterator will lap the slow iterator within a single pass through the cycle .
Detecting a loop is then just detecting that the slow iterator has been lapped by the fast iterator .
// Best solution function boolean hasLoop ( Node startNode ) {
Node slowNode = Node fastNode1 = Node fastNode2 = startNode ; while ( slowNode && fastNode1 = fastNode2.next ( ) && fastNode2 = fastNode1.next ( ) ) { if ( slowNode == fastNode1 || slowNode == fastNode2 ) return true ; slowNode = slowNode.next ( ) ; } return false ; }
This solution is " Floyd's Cycle - Finding Algorithm " as published in " Non-deterministic Algorithms " by Robert W. Floyd in 1967 .
It is also called " The Tortoise and the Hare Algorithm " .
Drew Westen is a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
His research focuses on personality and personality - related disorders , which special focus on the cognitive and emotional processes that are essential to interpersonal relationships .
Together with his collaborator Jonathan Shedler , Westen has developed the Shedler - Westen Assessment Procedure to help fellow practitioners diagnose and analyze personality types and disorders .
In conducting an experiment on people ’s mental processes when discussing their political beliefs , Westen discovered that it was , in fact , the ’ emotional ’ portions of the brain were activated , instead of the “ reasoning ” portion .
His upcoming book , The Political Brain : The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of a Nation , discusses those findings .
Michael Tomasky recently discussed this new book in his article for the New York Review of Books entitled “ How Democrats Should Talk ” excerpted below .
* * *
What [ Frank ] Luntz [ ed .
Republican ‘ spin doctor ’] does understand that many Democratic consultants do not is that language used by a politician sets off a network of associations in voters ’ minds .
These associations , even for people who follow current events closely , are more likely to be emotional than rational , and voters “ reason ” their way toward emotionally biased conclusions .
This is “ the political brain ” of Drew Westen ’s new book , The Political Brain : The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of a Nation , and Westen , a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University , has set out to show Democrats how to connect to it .
Westen ’s central insight is both obvious and simple : Democrats , he writes , have generally assumed that voters make their choices based on reason , and this leads to failure because “ the political brain is an emotional brain . ”
The Democrats ’ belief in “ the dispassionate vision of the mind ” has an honorable lineage going back to the Age of Reason and is useful for other purposes in life .
But Westen suggests that electorally , it ’s a total loser :
Republicans understand what the philosopher David Hume recognized three centuries ago : that reason is a slave to emotion , not the other way around .
With the exception of the Clinton era , Democratic strategists for the last three decades have instead clung tenaciously to the dispassionate view of the mind and to the campaign strategy that logically follows from it , namely one that focuses on facts , figures , policy statements , costs , and benefits , and appeals to intellect and expertise .
In his early chapters Westen discusses the physiology of the brain and the different ways in which we respond to rational and emotional stimuli .
Whatever the views of other experts on these neurological matters may be , I can say that , for electoral politics , Westen ’s analyses almost always seem to me correct and something that Democrats need desperately to hear .
Their devotion to the rational mind has prevented Democrats from doing two main things : presenting their own affirmative case in the most convincing way and responding to conservative attacks .
On the first matter , Westen ( a liberal himself ) cites numerous examples of the disastrous ways Al Gore and John Kerry each relied excessively , indeed pedantically , on pending legislation , empirical data , and the like instead of simple and forceful language in making their case .
To a question in a 2000 debate about gay and lesbian rights , Gore began his answer by citing “ a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act . ”
In another debate , Gore muffed a question about “ character ” after Bush cited the attack on Gore during the Clinton presidency for allegedly fishy campaign - finance practices , including the famous fund - raising event at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles .
In response , Gore did no more than pledge his support for the McCain - Feingold campaign - finance bill .
Gore also explicitly refused to respond directly to Bush ’s other attacks .
It ’s the Democrats ’ fear of a fight , and their constant appeals to “ get back to discussing the issues ” and such talk , that really get under Westen ’s skin .
In a perceptive section on terrorism and the Bush administration ’s manipulation of fear after September 11 , Westen draws on research showing that intimations of mortality shift most people ’s reactions to the right politically , and he demonstrates how Demo- crats , in trying to sound as “ tough ” as Bush , were unwittingly reinforcing Bush ’s worldview .
His discussion of the Kerry camp ’s response to the Swift - Boaters is especially sharp .
He describes a weak , and entirely rational , letter — sent three weeks after the attacks — by Kerry ’s campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill to Ken Mehlman , her Bush - campaign counterpart , urging Mehlman to persuade Bush to denounce the attacks and return to the issues .
Westen writes :
If the letter had n’t been signed by Cahill , I would have wondered if it had been written by Rove himself .
It sent virtually every message you would n’t want to send under these circumstances .
First , from a symbolic standpoint , you do n’t send your mother out to fight for you when another boy bullies you in the schoolyard .
Kerry ’s response should have been man to man , and it should have been live , on the air , not in print .
Second , the form and goal of the letter had a groveling , beseeching quality , which gave Bush the power to do with it what he wanted … .
Third , instead of making the entire incident a condemnation of the president ’s character , it gave Bush the opportunity to look magnanimous … .

What should Democrats do differently ?
This is where the fun starts .
Usually , books like these end with one somewhat perfunctory prescriptive chapter .
But The Political Brain has many examples , filling chapter after chapter after chapter , describing how Democrats could have made in the past , and could make in the future , strong emotional appeals that are rooted in truth .
Westen ’s recommended language — on issues ranging from abortion to gay rights to terrorism to taxes to race to the nature of modern conservatism — is at least an improvement over what the Democrats say currently and at best exhilarating to imagine .
For example , he thinks that the Democrats could have reframed the debate over the Iraq war resolution in 2002 by gathering en masse on the steps of the Capitol and issuing a statement along the following lines :
The Republicans are demanding that we vote for this resolution without discussion , without knowing whether a deployment of troops to Iraq would prevent us from finishing the job in Afghan - istan where Osama bin Laden is still at large , and without knowing whether fighting a war on two fronts will require reinstatement of the draft .
The resolution we are being asked to vote for demands that we abridge the Constitution that our founding fathers so artfully crafted , which gave Congress the sacred duty to provide oversight over the executive branch , not only in times of peace but also in times of war , when American lives are most at stake .
And the reason we are being asked to sign this resolution now — the reason it cannot wait until the facts are more clear — is not national security .
This resolution is designed for no other purpose than the partisan interests of the Republican Party … .
I recall no more than a small handful of Democrats who said anything remotely like this .
It would have altered the tenor of the debate considerably if more had done so .
Nor have either Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi since adopted similar language .
In recent years , a small number of experts on language and rhetoric have been touted as the Democrats ’ savior .
None of these panned out .
The cognitive linguist George Lakoff was supposed to lead the Democrats in from the wilderness , and Lakoff produced good insights into the contrasting approaches to moral questions of liberals and conservatives ; but when he engaged in actual political work , as he did with House Democrats in 2004 , the result could n’t have been more banal because his descriptions of conservatives ’ and liberals ’ moral systems did not lead to clear strategic conclusions .
Many people are therefore skittish about anyone being heralded as the next source of advice .
But Westen ’s analyses and suggestions speak precisely to Democrats ’ greatest tactical failures of the last quarter - century , and they do so without descending to the level of “ Mission Accomplished ” banners and the “ death tax . ”
It will be fascinating to see how The Political Brain is received among the Democratic political professionals , who are for the most part insular and arrogant and have an explanation for everything .
But Westen ’s explanations sound better than the ones that have long been circulating in Washington .

City manager says utility followed policy on limiting man 's electricity
A pathologist said a 93 - year - old Bay City man froze to death inside his home - his body found days after city workers said they limited electricity flowing to the house .
Marvin E. Schur suffered " a slow , painful death " inside his home at 1600 S. Chilson St. on Bay City 's southwest side , said Dr. Kanu Virani , who performed an autopsy on the body .
UPDATE : Bay City raises electric rates as Marvin Schur 's death spurs anger
ALSO : Marvin Schur 's death was preventable , Lansing officials say
" Hypothermia shuts the whole system down , slowly , " Virani said .
" It 's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they 're burning . "
Funeral services for Schur , a retired pattern - maker who lived alone , are at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Gephart Funeral Home , 201 W. Midland St. Schur 's wife , retired elementary - school teacher Marian I. ( Meisel ) Schur , died several years ago , and the couple had no children .
Virani , Oakland County 's deputy chief medical examiner , performs autopsies for Bay County and numerous other Michigan counties .
Of about 15,000 autopsies Virani has conducted , he said Marvin Schur 's autopsy " is the first one I can remember doing on someone who froze to death indoors . "
Virani said the temperature inside Schur 's home was less than 32 degrees when neighbors George A. Pauwels Jr. and his wife , Shannon , found Schur 's body Jan. 17 .
George Pauwels Jr. said Schur owed almost $ 1,100 in electricity bills to the city of Bay City , though Pauwels said he noticed money clipped to those bills on Schur 's kitchen table the day he found Schur 's body .
Bay City Manager Robert V. Belleman said a worker with Bay City Electric Light & Power placed a " limiter " device outside Schur 's home , between Schur 's electricity meter and electrical service , on Jan. 13 .
The device restricts the amount of electricity reaching the home and if a homeowner tries to draw more electricity than the limiter allows , " it blows the limiter , just like blowing a fuse , and then you go outside and reset it , " Belleman said .
Belleman said he does n't know if a city worker made one - on - one contact with Schur to explain the limiter 's operation .
Virani said he does n't know if Schur suffered from dementia , which could have interfered with his ability to know how to reset a limiter .
Pauwels said Schur could n't hear well , and said he believed Schur " had a little bit " of dementia .
Belleman said city workers keep the limiter on a residence for 10 days , at which point the city shuts off all electricity if the homeowner has n't paid his utility bill or arranged to do so .
Jim Hernden , 41 , a neighbor of Marvin Schur , said Bay City Electric Light & Power workers should insist on meeting face to face with a homeowner , or a homeowner 's neighbors , before installing a limiter or shutting off power .
" We 're a small enough town where someone like Marvin should get a little bit extra care , " he said .
Bay City Police Department officers investigated Schur 's death , but declined comment , referring all questions to Belleman .
Pauwels said he blames the city for Marvin Schur 's death .
" His furnace was not running - the insides of his windows were full of ice the morning we found him , " Pauwels said .
" This ( limiter ) is supposed to regulate the amount of electricity he was using , but still allow enough power to run the furnace .
Obviously , it did n't work . "
Belleman said city officials will review Electric Light & Power policies in the wake of Schur 's death .
Belleman said he does n't believe the city did anything wrong .
" I 've said this before and some of my colleagues have said this : Neighbors need to keep an eye on neighbors , " Belleman said .
" When they think there 's something wrong , they should contact the appropriate agency or city department . "

Lawyers critical of the decision to prosecute protesters arrested on the first night of the Democratic National Convention say Denver ’s city attorneys are trying to shut them up .
They say the city has twice asked a Denver County judge to issue a gag order to keep defense lawyers quiet about the validity of the Aug. 25 arrests .
Judge Karen Bowers has denied the requests .
“ They want to stop me from criticizing them and telling the public about this , ” said Robert Corry , an attorney representing several DNC defendants .
“ I thought it was remarkable they would try this in a First Amendment case . ”
The judge ’s order says city prosecutors accused the American Civil Liberties Union and lawyers for the People ’s Law Project of trying to poison the jury pool by publicly criticizing the cases .
“ Despite apparent efforts by third parties to influence these cases , the court believes that the juries have been honest in the selection process and able to listen fairly to the evidence presented , ” the order says .
The order also says that the ACLU is not representing any of the clients and that she cannot gag that entity .
The record says there was no evidence that any individual lawyer associated with a DNC case is responsible for the release of information .
City Attorney David Fine said no motion for a gag order was made .
“ We did not move for a gag order and , in fact , deliberately decided not to , ” he said .
“ I cannot understand why the order is written that way . ”
Fine did say attorneys who have entered appearances on behalf of their clients have an ethical obligation not to talk about the case .
“ Anyone can speak freely as to their opinion about whether or not these cases should be prosecuted , but the problem here is when attorneys who have entered appearances in cases give opinions about the guilt or innocence of the defendants , ” he said .
Corry and other lawyers from the People ’s Law Project are representing about 60 people who were arrested on 15th Street and Court Place during a mass protest that occurred on the first night of the DNC .
The lawyers say that their clients were merely bystanders or students who were documenting the protests and got caught up in the crowd and could n’t leave before police blocked the exit routes .
One hundred and six people were arrested .
Police have testified that they blocked off the streets because they had heard anarchists planned to move from Civic Center park toward the 16th Street Mall to cause trouble at delegate hotels and other businesses .
The Aug. 25 incident was the only time during the DNC that mass arrests took place .
In contrast , police did not arrest anyone during an unplanned and unpermitted protest held by Iraq Veterans Against the War that snaked through Denver .
Defendants represented by the People ’s Law Project have been charged with a municipal - code violation of obstructing the street and face a $ 141 fine .
Of the 18 cases that have gone to trial , the city has won a conviction in one .
Another 13 people will go on trial next week , and there are another 30 cases coming up , said Brian Vicente , director of the People ’s Law Project .
The lawyers have questioned why the city would pursue the cases , given the cost of prosecution .
Vicente says the cases are circumstantial and there is no direct evidence that any of their clients broke the law .
Vicente said he filed a request under the Colorado Open Records
Act with the city on Nov. 10 for a breakdown of what it is costing the city to prosecute his clients .
Vicente has not received a response .

Ever since Musharraf launched the first incursions into Waziristan in 2002 , the military offensives have been controversial , heavy - handed , and extralegal .
The recent operations in Bajaur and Swat raise new concerns .
Instead of risking loss of ground troops , the top military brass has shifted focus to aerial bombing .
Entire villages have been uprooted , creating the largest IDP crisis in our history .
As our State bombs Pukhtunwa to a pulp , it relies on our unwillingness to object–to stay silent as our leaders exploit our fear of “ Talibanization ” to legitimize an illegal and cruel war .
[ poll id = ” 3 ″ ]
While we recognize the danger and threat of these militants , we do not believe this war will bring peace .
The War on Terror has become a war of terror–a war of destruction , and loss of blood of the rural poor of the Northwest .
We must remember that militant insurgencies arise in specific historical and social context .
During and after the Afghan - Soviet War in the 1980s , money , arms , and training were thrown at the region by the United States .
Violence became normalized .
A pattern that was instituted then – intelligence agencies ’ funded proxies jostling for regional control remains in effect today .
Presently , Central Asia is geo-strategically invaluable .
American and NATO planners have been publicly casting their eyes over these areas with the intention of checking China and India ’s impending rise , as well as Russia ’s reassertiveness .
Internally , we must analyse the poverty and desperation in FATA and the state ’s repressive and colonial legal control of the region .
This dialectic — the importance of understanding local militancy as a consequence of both internal devastation and external interference — should expose the inanity of expecting a War on Terror to expunge the “ forces of reaction ” , the Taliban , from FATA and NWFP .

According to Wikipedia “ In 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared December 15 to be Bill of Rights Day , commemorating the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights . ”
I have to wonder what Franklin D. Roosevelt would think of what has become of the Bill of Rights over the last eight years …
Here is what Keith Olbermann had to say regarding the Bill of Rights ( or what was left of them .. ) , and the death of Habeas Corpus two years ago in a Special Comment :

WICOMICO CHURCH , Va. ( AP )  A 6 - year - old Virginia boy who missed his bus tried to drive to school in his family 's sedan — and crashed .
His parents were charged with child endangerment .
State police said the boy suffered only minor injuries and authorities drove him to school after he was evaluated at a local hospital for a bump on his head .
He arrived shortly after lunch , Sgt. Tom Cunningham said .
It happened around 7:40 a.m. Monday on Route 360 , about 61 miles east of Richmond .
The boy , whose name was n't released , missed the bus , took the keys to his family 's 2005 Ford Taurus and drove nearly six miles toward school while his mother was asleep , police said .
He made at least two 90 - degree turns , passed several cars and ran off the rural two - lane road several times before hitting an embankment and utility pole about a mile and a half from school .
The boy told police he learned to drive playing Grand Theft Auto and Monster Truck Jam video games .
" He was very intent on getting to school , " said Northumberland County Sheriff Chuck Wilkins .
" When he got out of the car , he started walking to school .
He did not want to miss breakfast and PE . "
His parents , Jacqulyn Deana Waltman , 26 , and David Eugene Dodson , 40 , are each charged with child endangerment , Wilkins said .
Waltman is being held without bond .
Dodson was released on a $ 5,000 bond .
It was not clear if they had attorneys .
The boy and his 4 - year - old brother were placed in protective custody .
" This really is a story of miracles , " Wilkins said .
" The Lord was with him , along with everybody else on the highway . "

SARAJEVO ( Reuters ) -
An Algerian man who spent nearly seven years in Guantanamo Bay says his U.S. interrogators never questioned him on the main terrorism allegation against him .
Mustafa Ait Idir , one of three Algerians released this week from the U.S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , shows Reuters the documentation and letters that he had received from his family at his Sarajevo home on December 17 , 2008 .
The trio returned to their adopted homeland of Bosnia the day before as the first prisoners released under court order from the U.S. military base , where they said they went through the worst kinds of torture .
REUTERS / Danilo Krstanovic
Mustafa Ait Idir , who was freed this week and returned to his adopted homeland of Bosnia , was accused of planning to go to Afghanistan to fight against U.S. forces .
“ They ’ve never asked anything about charges which were brought against us .
They ’ve never asked about Afghanistan , ” he told Reuters in an interview .
“ They only questioned me about Islamic organizations working in Bosnia ... I ’ve spent many years in the worst place on earth for doing nothing . ”
Opponents of Guantanamo -- the U.S. prison camp on Cuba which President - elect Barack Obama has vowed to close -- say hundreds of inmates have been held there for years on flimsy legal pretexts .
Only 22 have been charged : one pleaded guilty , two were convicted at trial and 19 cases are still pending .
Ait Idir was one of six men arrested in Bosnia in October 2001 and sent three months later to Guantanamo -- despite having being freed by a Bosnian court for lack of evidence .
U.S. President George W. Bush said in 2002 that the group had been plotting a bomb attack on the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo .
But a Justice Department attorney later dropped those accusations and said instead that the men had planned to go to Afghanistan to join the insurgency against U.S. forces .
Held as “ enemy combatants , ” they were never formally charged .
Last month , a federal judge ruled that five of the men should be released “ forthwith ” because the U.S. government had failed to prove the Afghan allegation .
Ait Idir and two of the others were sent back to Bosnia this week .

TORTURE ALLEGATION
Looking frail after his years in detention , Ait Idir said he had been denied medication he needed in prison .
The 38 - year - old displayed a broken finger he said he had suffered there .
He said he was kept for four months , lightly dressed , in a very cold refrigerated container .
For short periods of the day he was taken outside , where it was very hot .
Other prisoners were subjected to long periods in total darkness or very bright light , he said .
“ There was torture every minute , ” Ait Idir said .
“ It did not matter to them if we were terrorists or not . ”
A devout believer , the former inmate said the gravest offence for Muslim prisoners was when soldiers threw around Korans , swore at Allah or abused them during prayers .
A Pentagon spokesman rejected the allegations .
“ We treat all detainees humanely , ” said Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon .
“ There have been 12 major reviews conducted of detention operations over the past several years , none of which found there was any policy that ever condoned abuse . ”
The official also said that an al Qaeda manual found in 2000 found that operatives were instructed to complain they had been tortured while in detention .
Set up only months into the “ war on terrorism ” that President George W. Bush declared after the September 11 attacks of 2001 , Guantanamo has been widely condemned around the world as a stain on the United States ’ human rights record .
Ait Idir , a computer science engineer who saw his son Abdulah for the first time this week as he was born after his detention , alleged he was often beaten .
He said he saw instances when U.S. medical personnel advised military staff where to hit prisoners in sensitive spots .
But speaking as his three sons by his Bosnian wife played outside the room , he said he did not blame the army or hate Americans .
“ They only did what they ’ve been ordered to do .
They did not hate us but had to obey their superiors . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It may be possible to predict which breast cancer patients will be helped by tamoxifen based on changes in so - called breast density , researchers reported on Saturday .
Women with dense breasts -- a term meaning they have more non-fatty tissue -- are known to have a higher risk of breast cancer and the study suggests that lowering density using tamoxifen also lowers the chances tumors will come back .
Women whose breasts became noticeably less dense after a year or so of taking tamoxifen had a 63 percent reduced risk of breast cancer , the team of British researchers told a breast cancer meeting in San Antonio , Texas .
“ It is important to find a way to predict who will respond to tamoxifen , and changes in breast density may constitute an early indicator of benefit , ” said Jack Cuzick of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London .
He said about 10 percent of women have dense breasts .
Such breasts are harder to read on mammograms but there is evidence the tissue in their breasts may be more cancer - prone .
“ Women with dense breasts are typically at four to five times the risk of developing breast cancer than women without dense breasts , ” Cuzick told reporters in a telephone briefing .
Cuzick ’s team had conducted one of many studies that showed high - risk women who took tamoxifen were at least 40 percent less likely to either develop breast cancer , or to have it come back .
They went back and looked at all the mammograms of the more than 1,000 women who took part in the study .
If a woman ’s breast density did not change during the treatment , she was much more likely to develop cancer despite taking tamoxifen , Cuzick told the meeting .
TWO - THIRDS REDUCTION
“ Women who lost 10 percent or more in breast density -- 40 percent of the women getting tamoxifen -- had a 63 percent , almost a two - thirds , reduction in all breast cancer , ” he told the briefing .
Cuzick stressed the study only looked at tamoxifen and not at other treatments , such as the newer drugs known as aromatase inhibitors .
But he said it validated the idea of using breast density as a way of telling whether a treatment is working , whether tamoxifen or something else .
“ If a woman does n’t show breast density dropping within a year or so , you might want to consider other therapy , ” Cuzick said .
In another report , a team at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota said they found some clues as to why dense breast tissue is more likely to develop tumors .
Dense breast tissue contains more cells believed to give rise to breast cancer , Dr. Karthik Ghosh told the meeting .
Dr. Celine Vachon and colleagues found that dense breast tissue has more aromatase enzyme than non-dense tissue .
This is significant because aromatase helps convert hormones into estrogen , which can fuel breast cancer development .
“ If aromatase is differentially expressed in dense and non-dense breast tissue , this could provide one mechanism by which density may increase breast cancer risk , ” Vachon said in a statement .
Some would like to see novel approaches to treating systemic problems that often work against women ’s scientific ambitions .
Mary Ann Mason and Marc Goulden of the University of California , Berkeley , have gathered extensive data showing stark male - female differences in the family structure and personal lives of academic researchers at the top tiers of the profession .
Surveying outcomes for 160,000 Ph.D. recipients across the United States , the researchers determined that 70 percent of male tenured professors were married with children , compared with only 44 percent of their tenured female colleagues .
Twelve years or more after receiving their doctorates , tenured women were more than twice as likely as tenured men to be single and significantly more likely to be divorced .
And lest all of this look like “ personal choice , ” when the researchers asked 8,700 faculty members in the University of California system about family and work issues , nearly 40 percent of the women agreed with the statement , “ I had fewer children than I wanted , ” compared with less than 20 percent of the men .
The take - home message , Dr. Mason said in a telephone interview , is , “ Men can have it all , but women can ’t . ”
From a purely Darwinian point of view , expecting a young woman to sacrifice her reproductive fitness for the sake of career advancement is simply too much , and yet the structure of academic research , in which one must spend one ’s 20s and early 30s as a poorly compensated and minimally empowered graduate student and postdoctoral fellow , and the remainder of one ’s 30s and into the low 40s working madly to earn tenure , can demand exactly that .
Nor do all young men in science accept the notion that their lab bench must double as a sleeping cot while their wives take care of the kids .
In a new survey of 19,000 doctoral students at the University of California , Dr. Mason and her colleagues found that while two - thirds of the respondents either had or planned to have children , 84 percent of the women and 74 percent of the men expressed worry about the family - unfriendliness of their intended profession , and many had changed their plans accordingly .
While 40 percent of the male science graduate students and 31 percent of the women said they had begun their Ph.D. programs intent on pursuing an academic career — still considered the premier path to science glory — a year or more into their studies , only 28 percent of the men and 20 percent of the women still hoped to become research scientists at a university .
Dr. Mason and other legal experts suggest that President Obama might be able to change things significantly for young women in science — and young men — by signing an executive order that would provide added family leave and parental benefits to the recipients of federal grants , a huge pool of people that includes many research scientists .
LONDON 
The advertisement on the bus was fairly mild , just a passage from the Bible and the address of a Christian Web site .
But when Ariane Sherine , a comedy writer , looked on the Web site in June , she was startled to learn that she and her nonbelieving friends were headed straight to hell , to “ spend all eternity in torment . ”
That ’s a bit extreme , she thought , as well as hard to prove .
“ If I wanted to run a bus ad saying ‘ Beware  there is a giant lion from London Zoo on the loose ! ’ or ‘ The “ bits ” in orange juice are n’t orange but plastic  do n’t drink them or you ’ll die ! ’
I think I might be asked to show my working and back up my claims , ” Ms. Sherine wrote in a commentary on the Web site of The Guardian .
And then she thought , how about putting some atheist messages on the bus , as a corrective to the religious ones ?
And so were planted the seeds of the Atheist Bus Campaign , an effort to disseminate a godless message to the greater public .
When the organizers announced the effort in October , they said they hoped to raise a modest $ 8,000 or so .
Enlarge By Seth Perlman , AP Attorney Ed Genson , representing Gov. Rod Blagojevich , dismisses transcripts .
Lawyer : Ill. governor wiretaps illegally obtained SPRINGFIELD , Ill . ( AP ) 
A lawyer for Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich told state lawmakers Thursday that the federal wiretaps at the heart of the pay - to - play allegations against his client were illegally obtained , and therefore should be kept out of any impeachment proceedings .
The wiretaps are crucial to the federal charges filed against Blagojevich last week .
Prosecutors say they caught the Democratic governor discussing efforts to auction off Barack Obama 's U.S. Senate seat and pressure a hospital executive for campaign donations .
ILLINOIS LATEST : Court rejects attempts to remove governor Genson told the impeachment committee that it should n't consider any material from the wiretaps , saying the evidence was " illegally obtained . "
Earlier on MSNBC , Genson said the governor maintains his innocence : " He 's telling me that he 's not guilty , he 's telling me that he wants to fight . "
The panel was expected to hear later Thursday from the state 's top internal watchdog , who says his own past probes of the Blagojevich administration have turned up improper contracts , incomplete records and sloppy handling of tax money .
Meanwhile , Attorney General Lisa Madigan denied a request by Genson to have the state pay for Blagojevich 's impeachment defense .
The move was all the more significant because Genson said federal officials are seeking to freeze the governor 's campaign fund — $ 3.6 million as of June — a source Blagojevich could tap to pay his legal bills .
Madigan 's office said the impeachment review is a case against Blagojevich 's capacity as governor and is n't a court action — a classification that does n't entitle the governor to taxpayer - funded legal representation .
Genson also appeared before the House panel Wednesday and challenged it on multiple fronts .
He said three members should be removed , the committee 's rules should be changed and it should not consider accusations in a criminal complaint against the governor .
Blagojevich , who left his home Thursday morning without speaking to reporters , has been under siege since his arrest last week .
He got some good news Wednesday when the court rejected Madigan 's claim that the governor 's legal troubles made him unfit to serve .
The court 's decision renewed calls from Republicans for a special election to choose Obama 's successor in the Senate .
They argue that neither Blagojevich nor Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn — who would take over if Blagojevich goes — should be allowed to make the appointment .
Genson said he does n't expect Blagojevich will make an appointment .
" Harry Reid said that they 're not going to accept anybody he picks , " said Genson , referring to the Senate majority leader .
" Why would he do that ?
"
Blagojevich spokesman Lucio Guerrero said he did n't know if Genson was correct about the governor 's intentions .
The Illinois House has appointed a 21 - member committee to review the possibility of impeachment .
The panel , divided 12 - 9 between Democrats and Republicans , will recommend whether the full House should move to impeach Blagojevich .
If that happened , the state Senate would then decide whether the governor is guilty .

We could begin with Peter Sastawnyuk .
The 53 - year - old businessman filled his £ 370,000 detached home with petrol canisters , sealed the locks , set tripwires and threatened to set the place alight .
More than 40 of his neighbours were evacuated from the posh cul - de-sac on the edge of the Pennines from which Sastawnyuk sent his children to be educated at private school .
But the cradle of his dreams imploded , in the end , as the scene of a five - hour police siege .
The trigger for it all , a court in Rochdale was told last month , was that he had lost his job , got into debt and had had his home repossessed .
Or we could start with Karl Harrison .
The father - of - two was found hanging in his garden shed in Anglesey .
The 40 - year - old surveyor had lost his job when the housing market began to turn down .
He fell behind with his payments on his home loan and was being harassed by a firm called Oakwood Homeloans to pay the arrears , the inquest was recently .
His widow has now put the house on the market .

It was an ordinary Thursday morning in early October when Jackie Horn , a 43 - year - old IT worker , left her neat little Edwardian town house behind Stockport Grammar School to make the short journey to work .
Her destination was the Vauxhall Industrial Estate in which the largest site was occupied by the company for which she had worked for the last 16 years - Chemix Ltd , which manufactured the compounds from which u-PVC window frames and cladding are made .
She looked back casually at the house , with its handsome stained glass windows , and got in her car , a small silver Peugeot .
She had bought the house 12 years ago and , though she lived alone , her mortgage was nicely manageable .
She had had the car for two years and it was all paid for .
At Chemix she had risen over the years from being a receptionist to a computer programmer .
She was better paid now .
Hers was a settled life .
She had had an inkling that things were not quite right at work .
She noticed from her IT processing that orders for resin , Chemix 's incoming raw material , had been down for a while .
So were orders for the compounds the firm produced as the nation 's door - to - door salesmen found ever - larger numbers of people saying
No to the idea of having their windows replaced .
Then , about four week 's earlier , the management had told the workforce that it might have to move to just 3 or 4 days working each week .
The workers had rejected the idea in a ballot and a couple of weeks later were told there might have to be selective redundancies .
But letters had gone a few days before saying that jobs in sales and IT were safe .
When she arrived at the little factory " a lot of blokes in suits " had appeared .
A meeting of the whole workforce was called .
The firm was in administration , the bankruptcy accountants told them .
They had all lost their jobs .
They should leave immediately .
" It was a real shock , " she says .
" One day I was receiving a letter telling me my job was safe ; the next it had gone .
The mood was bad .
Everyone was saying goodbye .
They were hugging and shaking hands . "
She was told she would be kept on for an extra two weeks to help with the shutdown .
" I could n't look the men in the eye . "
Now she , too , sits idle at home .

The chain of events - which began with salesmen on commission wildly dishing out sub - prime mortgages ( to poor people the United States who did not even have to prove they had the earnings to repay them ) and ended with Jackie Horn losing her job - is a long one .
I have spent the past few weeks tracing each link in that chain through the stories of a series of people :
* The fall - off in demand for Chemix 's products was the result of decisions like the one made by a Birmingham newsagent whose domestic economizing including not having his windows replaced with uPVC frames because his cigarette sales were down .
* Cigarette sales at the newsagent 's had fallen because staff at the nearby Range Rover production plant had had their hours cut .
* Range Rover sales are down because a wide variety of businesses are now tightening their belts ; not replacing company cars is an obvious money saver .
* Among the businesses not replacing company cars as part of general cost cutting are those like the shop - fitting , sign - writing and advertising firms employed by retail giant Marks & Spencer , which has had two - thirds wiped from the value of its shares this year .
* Trade in shops is down because consumer confidence has fallen in line with catastrophic drops in the price of shares .
* Share market volatility was provoked by the sudden refusal of the banks to lend money to anyone , including each other .
* The crisis of confidence within the banks was fed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers , which was the biggest bankruptcy the world has ever seen .
To make sense of this saga I set out to travel the United Kingdom speak to individuals who had played a key part in each stage of the tumbling of the dominoes .
There were repeated surprises along the way .
Encounters with the real world are like that .
Not everything turns out as you might expect .
Northern Rock - Panic Begins
The giant tower of the new Northern Rock building stands empty , like a monument to the folly of the years of reckless capitalism .
It has never been occupied .
Out at Gosforth , on the northern edge of Newcastle , it is the place where the first rumblings of the seismic shakeout which is now gripping the globe were first detected in the UK .
Today the yellow brick buildings which surround it are still staffed , but by managers and employees humbled by the events of the past twelvemonths which have turned them from freebooting buccaneers of a banking world - in which the possibilities of growth seemed unlimited - to servants of a nationalised service industry .
Even the bricks seem symbolic , for the yellow brick road in the Wizard of Oz lead to a gleaming city with a giant fraud at it heart .
The man who is driving me round the once mighty complex is Dennis Grainger .
He was once a senior employee of the firm and is now the leading light in the Northern Rock Shareholders Action Group .
The combination makes him uniquely placed to tell the story of the building society which turned bank after Margaret Thatcher 's deregulation of the financial sector and which last year provoked the first run on a British bank since the Victorian era .
" Northern Rock was not involved in dodgy sub - prime lending , " says Grainger , 61 , of Cramlington , Northumberland .
" Our loans were good safe lending to people who could afford to repay .
The Rock was very strict in asking whether people could afford to borrow that amount . "
He knows because it one of his jobs was to manage the people checking the paperwork .
" After the crisis broke the media said that the problem was that Northern Rock lent people more than they needed to buy their homes .
And it is true that we did offer 125 per cent loans , to cover the house purchase and additional expenses .
But the rates of default on those were just half the national average . "
What did for Northern Rock was that so much of the money it lent did not come from depositors but was borrowed by the bank on the international money markets .
That is what had turned a little provincial building society into the UK 's fifth largest mortgage lender - and a FTSE 100 company .
" Some 80 per cent of the mortgages we gave out had been borrowed in this way , " Dennis Grainger says . " I know I used to sign the documents for millions of transfers each month . "
The problem came when , on 9 August 2007 , one of France 's three biggest banks , BNP Paribas , told investors that they could not take money out of two of its funds because it was unable to value the assets in them .
This was because the financial world had created complex financial packages out of the sub - prime debt and sold them on to other investors .
It was like pass the parcel ; investors had , in effect , bought blind because the deals had so many layers that no - one knew what lay at their heart .
The crunch came when some investors wanted their money back and Parisbas realised it did not know whether it had the money to pay out .
It was , in the words of Northern Rock 's former chief executive , Adam Applegarth , " the day the world changed ' ' .
Money markets across the globe shut down because they did not know which banks would remove the final wrapper from the " credit default swaps " - and find they were holding a booby prize .
When the money stopped flowing banks like Northern Rock - which had , in the jargon , " borrowed short - term to lend long - term " - could not get hold of the cash to finance their next day 's business .
On 13 September 2007 the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston revealed that Northern Rock had asked for emergency support from the Bank of England .
But there was no danger of the bank going bust , he added , so customers need not panic .
" It had the same effect that Corporal Jones does in Dad's Army , " observes Dennis Grainger wryly .
" When you shout ' Do n't panic !
Do n't panic !! " people do exactly the opposite .
Peston should have known that . "
Outside Northern Rock 's branches massive queues formed of savers demanding to withdraw their money .
But , if there was compassion for the savers , there was scant sympathy for those running Northern Rock whose chairman was a non-banker - the local oddball free - market environmentalist aristocrat , Matt Ridley - and whose risk committee was chaired by Sir Derek Wanless , who had previously been ousted from NatWest with a reportedly £ 3 m payoff .
It was they who had endorsed the aggressive growth strategy of the bullish chief executive Adam Applegarth and , in the words of the financial journalist Alex Brummer , author of The Crunch : the scandal of Northern Rock , " allowed him to run riot , without checks and balances " .
The people most often forgotten in all this are the shareholders .
" People assume all the shares were held by big institutions and greedy hedge - funds , " says Grainger , " but a quarter of the shares are held by little folk . "
Again he knows because he has met 2,000 of them in the streets where he sets up his Shareholders Action Group stall .
Another 4,000 have been in touch with him by email .
" These people are not speculators or gamblers .
They are people in their 70s , 80s and 90s living on very small incomes who received a few hundred shares in the original demutualisation .
Many are old ladies keeping their shares to pay for their funeral arrangements and who I 've seen crying in the streets , saying that they will now be a burden to their family .
They are Mr & Mrs Shipyardworker who put their savings , with pride , into the local bank . "
Again this is not academic to Dennis Grainger .
Every month for 10 years he put £ 250 of his salary into the Northern Rock employees ' Share and Save scheme .
It was to be his retirement savings .
At one point they were worth £ 114,000 .
Today they are utterly worthless .
" The real losers in all this are the small investors who worked for Northern Rock or savers who bought shares and remained loyal to the bank , " he concludes .
" The treatment they have suffered is very unfair . "
What compounds the sense of injustice , says Roger Lawson , Chairman of the UK Shareholders ' Association , is that the Government , by nationalising Northern Rock , has effectively confiscated all the shares - " even though there was a good private sector solution on the table " that would have enabled the company to recover and to repay the debts it owed to the Bank of England .
Much of this debt has already been repaid and yet , he says , " there is no commitment to give back to former shareholders any interest in the company when it is subsequently sold " .
It is not the only consequence .
In order to accelerate the payback to the taxpayer the new management at the now - nationalised company are pursuing an aggressive policy of repossessing the homes of borrowers who get into arrears .
Northern Rock 's rate of repossessions is currently running at around double the industry average .
And leaked documents from inside Northern Rock reveal that the bank is set to double numbers in its debt collection arm .
There is a quiet indignation in Dennis Grainger 's conclusion .
" We have been treated very badly by the government , " he says .
" Northern Rock was illiquid , not insolvent .
When there was a run on the bank they would n't lend us £ 2.7 b n but they 've had to stump up £ 400 bn to prop up other banks since .
We should have been given the same terms as other banks were subsequently given . "
But there was one other bank not included in the rescue deal .
When Lehman Brothers investment bank folded it provoked the biggest corporate bankruptcy ever seen .
Lehman - The Untouchables ?
Until recently Andrew Gowers had an office on the 30th floor of a tower in Canary Wharf which offered a stunning panorama of the City of London .
It seemed an appropriate location for the UK arm of an investment bank which was one of the big five beasts of Wall Street .
If there was any institution whose members might fall prey to the hubris of believing that they truly were Masters of the Universe - as top City traders described themselves with an irony which depreciated with the passing years - then the men at the top of Lehman Brothers might be among their number .
The air indeed seemed rarefied at that height .
The shame was that nobody bothered to pack the oxygen .
For the past month Mr Gowers , a former editor of the Financial Times - and now a former director of communications at the 150 - year - old US investment bank which had begun life in the 1850s as a cotton - trading partnership - has sequestered himself away in a far less public place , having quit the bank just before it collapsed .
He has had a month " watching the autumn go by " in the south of France .
Northern Rock was the prequel to the concatenation of events which has seen £ 3,000,000,000,000 wiped off the value of the world 's shares .
It has also seen taxpayers across the globe spend double that amount to prop up the world 's banks .
But it was the collapse of Lehman Brothers - and the sight of well - paid bankers carrying their belongings from their Canary Wharf offices in black sacks and cardboard boxes - which first suggested that something was going on which might have ripples that moved beyond the United States , or indeed , the Northumbrian fastness of Northern Rock .
But for Andrew Gowers the writing had been on the Wharf for a good deal longer .
" There was a general awareness of difficulties , " he says , " from August 2007 onwards " .
Lehman was a very large borrower , with , according to some estimates , around $ 130bn in debt , much of it in subprime .
" But the feeling was that we were n't as badly exposed as some and there appeared to be some good and clever hedging strategies in place , Gowers says .
2007 ended as a record year with bumper revenues and the balance sheet grew in the first quarter of 2008 - " which a lot of people , after the fact , found pretty incomprehensible . "
There was no excuse for this complacency .
In March a smaller investment bank , Bear Stearns , had collapsed .
In response Lehmans ' share price fell 48 pc in less than a morning .
" But the Lehman management told itself that we were different from Bear Stearns , " Gowers recalls , " because we were n't so reliant on short - term borrowing and we had large amounts of liquidity . "
Anyway , the US Federal Reserve - America 's equivalent of the Bank of England - had stepped in to save Bear Stearns .
Perhaps the top people at Lehman - a far bigger bank - believed they would have a state safety net too .
Even so , says Andrew Gowers , " it all scared the living daylights out of the top management and some major effort was made to shrink the balance sheet , to cut the borrowing and get rid of some of the problem assets " .
The trouble was that other banks were doing the same thing at exactly the same time .
As a result the prices of the assets they wanted to sell fell at a shockingly fast pace .
Lehmans began to run out of time .
They could not offload enough of the dodgy sub - prime debts .
To make matters worse the " good and clever hedging strategies " began to come unstuck .
Indeed instead of offsetting losses some of the hedges magnified them .
" From April I became aware of quite a sizeable loss accumulating .
Nobody was quite sure how big it was going to be . "
In June executives at Lehmans ' money management subsidiary , Neuberger Berman , sent emails to the top managers at Lehmans suggesting that they forgo bonuses - to " send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance . "
Lehmans ' executive committee dismissed the idea out of hand .
When the news of the first loss ever in Lehmans ' independent history came out the market was shocked .
Senior managers , including the chief executive , Dick Fuld , did n't seem to get the measure of the problem .
Gowers recalls : " They just thought : we 're not in a catastrophic place , we 've suffered some buffeting from abnormal developments in the market , but we have a plan to get out of it " .
The market did not agree and the Lehman share price continued to plummet .
" That caused jaws to drop , says Gowers .
" The share price started going south with a momentum that no - one had an explanation for . "
The bank 's chief financial officer Erin Callan and its president Joe Gregory , who had been Dick Fuld 's right - hand man for 34 years , resigned .
But it was not enough .
Lehman 's managers had for some time been focussing on the wrong things , blaming short - selling and the media for the problems .
" It was a measure of the bunker mentality that had developed , " Gowers says .
" Eventually , at one minute before midnight , they came out with an explanation of what had gone wrong and what they planned to do , " Gowers recalls .
" But it was too late " .
In the end , what did for Lehmans was that its executives failed to understand that the politics had changed .
On 7 September America 's biggest mortgage providers , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , had to be rescued by the US government .
It was one of the largest bailouts in US history .
" A feeling grew in Congress that there had to be a limit , " Gowers says .
Lehman Brothers became that limit .
" At quite a few points in the downward spiral Lehamns could have been bought but Dick Fuld was too proud to accept that , " Gowers adjudges .
The result was the largest corporate bankruptcy in world history , much larger even than Enron .
The unwinding of the company is so complex it will take years to complete .
Andrew Gowers got out just before the collapse having concluded that his job had become untenable .
The evening that I interviewed him he just returned from a relaxed day at the market in Cahors .
There would be sea bream for dinner that night .
But things looked a little more bleak for some of his former colleagues .
Investment bankers rank fairly low on the public sympathy index .
Gowers acknowledges that , yet warns against broadbrush judgements .
" There were a lot of people in Lehmans who took 80 pc of their pay in shares which were deferred for five years and a relatively low salary , " he says .
Many borrowed against those shares and are now hiding away and licking their wounds .
" It had been rolling along in a fantastic way for so long that everybody really did began to think there was no way it was going end .
They applied that to their own personal finances , as well as the way they ran the firms , borrowing against tomorrow . "
But now , grimly , tomorrow has become today .
Heading north
Follow the money .
The trail from Canary Wharf pointed north .
I took the train to Edinburgh and then a taxi out to one of those anonymous low - rise country park hotels which could have been anywhere .
In this case it was halfway between two of the many meetings which Jim Spowart was dashing between that morning .
Spowart does not look like a high - powered banker .
He is a relaxed looking character with sandy hair and a casual jacket whom the other guests in the hotel foyer might take for a headmaster who had taken early retirement .
But Spowart is the banking wizard who took Direct Line into savings and mortgages , pioneered the flexible home - loan at Standard Life and founded Intelligent Finance - the telephone and internet banking arm of the banking giant HBOS which is Britain 's biggest mortgage provider .
He orders coffee and some shortbread biscuits which he does not eat .
" They disregarded the risks to go for aggressive growth , " he says of his former colleagues in the world of banking .
" The City set them targets and put them on the treadmill to their big fat bonuses .
The folly of it was obvious at the time to many bankers .
But those who put their foot on the brake were told to move aside because they were old - fashioned . "
It is five years since Jim Spowart ceased to be an executive with HBOS , the bank formed in 2001 by a merger between Britain 's oldest commercial bank and the former Halifax building society .
The event turned Britain 's Big Four high street banks into a Big Five .
Only a few months ago it would have been unthinkable that it would have been anything other than safe as houses .
But that was in the days when we thought that house prices were safe .
The weeks following the collapse of Lehman 's saw a succession of crises at individual banks .
Institutional providers of funds withdrew their cash from banks which they feared , rationally or irrationally , were hiding some monstrous horror in their balance sheets .
In September it seemed that the entire banking system was on the brink of total meltdown .
Almost no bank seemed safe from going bust .
They began to topple like dominoes .
In the United States , in the outright panic after Lehman Brothers collapsed , the big investment bank Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America ; then AIG , America 's biggest insurance company , was rescued by the Washington government .
In the UK one major bank , Alliance and Leicester , fell to an opportunistic bid from the Spanish bank Santander .
Another , Bradford & Bingley , was nationalised .
And then it was disclosed that three of Britain 's biggest banks - including HBOS , the largest retail mortgage provider in the UK - had gone cap - in - hand to the Bank of England seeking a bail out .
Despite the insistence of the financial authorities that HBOS was still solvent its share prices began to fluctuate wildly .
In an attempt to save HBOS without the need to inject government money Gordon Brown brokered a deal that it should be taken over by another banking giant Lloyd TSB .
The government announced that competition rules would be waived to allow the merger to proceed .
It was not enough .
Days later the British government launched a massive $ 400 billion bail - out - and the US Treasury followed with a $ 700 bn rescue fund to buy back much of the bad debt held by banks and attempt to calm the market .
" Gordon Brown 's recapitalisation was a stroke of genius , " says Spowart , " but the government have now pumped in sufficient capital that we do n't need the merger . "
The meetings Spowart is shuttling between that morning are designed to put together a bid to foil the merger with Lloyds and hive off the Bank of Scotland so that it becomes a separate company again .
" The Lloyds merger will be bad for customers , shareholders and staff , " he says .
" The corporate headquarters will no longer be in Edinburgh ; 40,000 jobs could go , a third of them in Scotland , up to 1,000 branches could be shut ; and the new bank would end up with 30 per cent of the mortgage market , with the government controlling 50 pc , leaving just 20 per cent for the rest of the market . "
That would not be all .
" Lloyds will move abroad the HBOS call centres currently in Scotland .
And there will be a knock - on in the insurance industry and among the lawyers and accountants in the city who service the financial industry , not to mention the cleaners , sandwich shops , taxi drivers and all the rest .
Scotland could lose between 80,000 and 100,000 jobs .
It could be a definitive moment for the Union .
Northern Rock will be privatised at some point and something will rise from the ashes ;
Here , if the merger goes ahead , there will be no ashes . "
There is , in all this , more than a touch of Scots romanticism .
" But it is not just sentiment , " suggests Professor Gavin McCrone , who was chief economic adviser at the Scottish Office between 1970 and 1992 .
" The Bank of Scotland is the oldest surviving commercial bank in the UK .
It was founded in 1695 .
And it is hard to say how much the loss of an autonomous bank would knock - on to other financial institutions in Scotland . "
Scotland is the second biggest financial sector in the UK .
It is also a leading international centre for banking , insurance , investment management and asset servicing .
Some £ 500 billion of funds are now managed directly from Scotland .
All this contributes more than six per cent of Scotland 's total annual income and provides one in ten of the nation 's workforce .
It is also the fastest growing area ; financial services has expanded by 35 per cent in the last five years while the rest of the economy grew by just 8 per cent servicing .
" How important its own banks are to that is hard to say , " says Professor McCrone .
" I certainly would n't want to try the experiment [ of moving the Bank of Scotland 's HQ from Edinburgh ] .
If you did that you would n't be able to reverse it . "
The eminent economist is sceptical too of the value of the HBOS - Lloyds merger which he suspects may prove to be a deal conceived in haste .
" Now we have a public sector solution do we need a private sector one ? "
Such a question may be vital to large numbers of bank workers .
But whatever the answer it would not explain the mechanism by which as the shockwaves of the credit crunch rippled through into the real economy .
I had to look elsewhere .
Blame it on the young guns
The seats are of the kind of red plush velvet that speaks not of your local Indian restaurant but of discreet wealth .
The menu offers seared Isle of Skye scallops with pork belly squares and cauliflower purée .
With the chateaubriand of Aberdeen Angus , served with a béarnaise sauce , I suspect that Duncan Glassey 's eye might alight at a £ 58 bottle of 1975 Château Cantenac Brown .
But I am wrong .
He is happy , he says , with an Australian shiraz , the cheapest on the list of bin ends in the smart Circus Bar & Grill in the austere Georgian elegance of Edinburgh 's New Town .
" How did the world 's cleverest financiers get into this almighty mess ? " I ask him .
There is a lot about Duncan Glassey which is not what you might expect .
The former child prodigy turned professional chess player runs a wealth planning consultancy for the mediumly - rich .
It grew out of his experience working with lottery winners at the accountants Ernst & Young in the mid-nineties .
His firm Wealthflow LLP now specialises in clients with between £ 1 m and £ 5 m to invest .
For all that , he is modest in his own lifestyle .
So much so that in the past he has been told that he lost business from new clients after turning up for the initial interview in a car which they decided was insufficiently grand .
There is something about him of the solidity of old money .
His client list includes aristocrats as well as advocates .
Like those whose money he manages his bias is towards the conservative and away from the febrile psychology of " active management " where , he insists , over - activity can sometimes substitute for solid long - term investment .
Glassey has some interesting thoughts on the generational conflicts which have tipped the world into financial crisis and to the brink of recession :
" The people who made the strategy in the banks are of the baby - boomer generation born from 1945 onwards .
They are a generation of grand visions , optimism and high ideals about combining individual empowerment with social values .
They are the Big Talkers and the people with the Vision and Mission Statements . "
By contrast the generation who have managed us into the present situation have a very different set of attitudes and values .
Generation X are the children of the Thatcher era .
" They are at home with globalisation and the Information Revolution , " he says .
" Change is normal , as is the idea of life - long learning .
They are not scared of failure .
What 's important to them is individualism , choice , self - reliance and immediate gratification .
They are Thrill Seekers " .
They can be pessimists , cynics and selfish .
But the younger generation who created sophisticated financial products which have so dramatically imploded - the " masters of the universe " - are different again , Glassey says .
" They are Generation Y , born from 1985 onwards .
They are the generation who have not known a world without the internet .
They are highly techno - savvy and street smart but information overload has made them hugely naïve in many other ways .
They are the Facebook and Bebo generation - networkers who live in a world where divorce and geographical dispersion has broken down the family .
They are self - obsessed and close - focused .
" The belief systems of the three groups - the strategists , the managers and the traders - are entirely different , " concludes Glassey " They do n't really understand one another at all .
And they did n't know what each other really wanted or expected out of the complex financial architecture they created .
Everybody was locked into the Nick Leeson scenario ; no - one asked questions so long as everyone was making money . "
The shaven - headed Glassey , aged 39 , characterises himself as on the cusp between Generations X and Y but his values hark back to what he calls " the old days when banks were trustworthy and on your side , before they became out - and - out sales organizations . "
His approach is to keep his clients away from financial fads and fashions and " commission - based products which are deliberately made so complex that clients can't understand them " .
Glassey was always suspicious of the world of credit swap derivates which he saw as a parade of Emperor 's New Clothes .
" I view all that as speculation .
I 'm not paid to make huge money for my clients ; I 'm paid to diversify risk . "
As long ago as 2004 he wrote a book , Financial Freedom , unfashionably warning that it was time for us to look at our expenditure , asking people to keep diaries on where they were spending money .
He even told one wealthy client who was a compulsive shopper that next time she saw a £ 3,000 watch she could not resist she should tell herself she could have it but not until the following day - by which time the shopping urge had evaporated .
" She saved herself huge amounts after she adopted the strategy , " he recalls .
The book was seen , four years ago , " as a bit quirky and left - field , " he says , " but I had a sense that things were getting out of control , and that there would be a market correction , though I did n't anticipate anything on this scale .
I thought it would be a far softer landing .
But maybe we need all this pain before people will learn the lessons . "
But his clients , he acknowledges , will not be the ones to suffer .
" Their portfolios may be down 15 pc where others are down 35 pc or more .
But their homes and jobs are not as risk . "
So whose jobs and homes are in peril ?
And why ?
The trail pointed away from the world of pure finance and into that of the Stock Market .
The trillion - dollar wipeout
They are still selling oysters and champagne in the great courtyard of the Royal Exchange which was founded in 1565 as the centre of commerce for the City of London .
In the 17th century , stockbrokers were not allowed within its elegant portals because of their rude manners but today it is no longer a Stock Market .
Instead it is a luxury shopping centre whose pillared and marbled atrium is lined with discreet boutiques bearing names like De Beers , Hermès , Tiffany , Bulgari and Cartier .
A couple of lattés in its magnificent courtyard will set you back the price on an entire lunch for two in Bury market , of which more later .
I was there to meet Richard Hunter , head of British equities at the fund manager Hargreaves Lansdown - which manages £ 11 billion in shares for its small investor clients .
I wanted to find out why the alarm over bank shares which gripped the Stock Market then infected other areas .
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers it was not just banking shares that fell ; they plummeted in a wide range of companies which had no connections with financial service industry .
" Credit is the oil in the machinery of the business world , " he says .
Every business needs to borrow to finance the gap between buying its raw materials and the income arriving for what it sells .
" The money that used to be available to do that just is n't there any more because the banks have stopped lending to one another .
All that has been impacted by the credit squeeze .
That 's why share prices fell first in certain sectors - the banks and financial services companies - but soon spread to other areas . "
But there were a collection of other forces in the real economy which accelerated the speed with which prices fell .
" It was a cocktail of factors " he says .
" After the sub - prime crisis broke in the US and after the collapse of Northern Rock here some people became more cautious and started to spend less . "
Then came the global rise in food prices which raised the cost of bread , rice and other staples in the supermarkets ; in April rice prices were double what they had been seven months earlier .
Next followed the international hike in the price of oil - it rose as high as $ 147 in July , almost treble what it had been a couple of years earlier .
And that massively increased both domestic fuel bills and petrol prices .
" If it costs you an extra £ 10 a week to fill your car and you 're on a budget , " he says , " you have to find that £ 10 by cutting back somewhere .
If you 're paying more for your gas and electricity you have to cut back on something else . "
Then , on top of all that , house prices had started to fall .
The fall - off began slowly , last November .
By April this year house prices were actually lower than they had been a year before .
It was the first time an annual drop had been recorded for 12 years .
The number of new houses being built fell to the lowest level for 60 years .
The building industry , after 13 years of unprecedented growth , faced a major slump ; in July the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey asked shareholders for an extra £ 500 m and failed to raise it .
Mortgage lending crawled to a near standstill in August as approvals for new home hit a record low .
By September house prices across the country had fallen by about 10 per cent .
Repossessions rose to triple their previous level .
In the worst hit areas , like the centre of Manchester where thousands of buy - to - let apartments had been made in converted inner city warehouses , prices fell by more than 20 per cent .
Half the flats in one prestigious block , Albion Mill - a converted Victorian biscuit factory with double - height living rooms and stunning views across to the Pennines - were repossessed .
One woman , Jeanette Leach , 31 , got off the plane at Manchester Airport after a holiday in Tenerife and received a text message saying her home had been repossessed ; she went straight into the toilets at Terminal Two and hanged herself with the cord from her tracksuit bottoms .
The majority of those in difficulties as result of the credit crunch were not driven to such extremes .
But , says Richard Hunter , " the Stock Market tries to discount the falls in value which will come over the next 9 to 12 months . "
As soon as the banking system was pulled back from what the head of the International Monetary Fund called " brink of systemic meltdown " investors began to consider what might be the short - to - medium term implications for the real economy .
House prices were a key indicator .
And further contraction was obviously on the cards .
Some 1.2 million homeowners in the UK are now faced with the prospect of negative equity because prices have fallen below what they had paid for them .
Another 1.4 m households are due to come off short - term fixed rate mortgage deals by the end of 2008 .
The credit crunch on the wholesale markets was making mortgages harder to come by .
It was contributed to a growing ' feel - bad ' factor on the markets .
" With shares and house prices you do n't crystallise your loss till you sell , but you feel poorer because of all the bad news , " says Richard Hunter , " and so your behaviour begins to change .
Everyone cuts back . "
Some people do more than that .
They panic .
" People who have been in the city 40 years are telling me that they 've never seen this degree of volatility before , " Hunter says .
" Panic overtakes logic .
Just a few people running round like headless chickens can infect others because people look at the headless chickens and say :
What do they know that I do n't ?
In the past they used to say that the market was driven by one prevailing emotion - greed or fear ; this time it 's a cocktail of both . "
The result was an orgy of frenzied selling in which £ 2.7 trillion was wiped off the value of shares globally in a single week of extraordinary financial mayhem in October .
This was when a crisis that had for months seemed confined to the world of banking began to ripple out into the real world .
When the pain came
Dennis and June Wallworth are the stuff of Sir Stuart Rose 's nightmares .
The middle - aged middle - class couple are just coming out of Marks & Spencer into the shopping mall in the centre of Bury in Lancashire .
" Oh , we have n't bought anything , " says Dennis , now retired from the construction business , " we were just taking a shortcut through the shop from the car park . "
M&S would still be , they say , their first choice for clothes , but they did n't need any just now .
" And we do our food shopping now in Asda . "
M&S is the largest clothing retailer in the UK .
Its fortunes have long been regarded as a barometer for the state of the British retail economy .
After a patch in the doldrums its chief executive , Sir Stuart Rose , had turned around its fortunes with more fashionable ranges of clothing and a high - quality benchmark in luxury food sales .
But the economic downturn has hit M&S with a double whammy .
Shoppers - the front line
For nine months Marks and Spencer 's sales have been falling .
The wild volatility in the share market has hit it badly .
Last month , when it announced its worst sales figures and business performance for more than three years , its share price had plummeted to less than half their value of twelve months before .
Its profits , Sir Stuart Rose announced , are expected to fall from £ 1bn last year to around £ 675 m this year .
I had asked for an interview with Sir Stuart or some other M&S luminary but the store 's communications department was in No Comment mode .
None of its 70,000 employees were available to speak to me , it appeared , so I set off for a typical store to talk to their customers .
Bury seems a good place because the town also has a market , its website informed me , with 200,000 square feet of selling space and 50,000 product lines on 370 stalls and 250,000 shoppers every week .
Since it is regularly voted into the Top Ten UK Food Markets - because of Chadwick 's celebrated Bury black puddings , a great array of fine Lancashire cheeses - it is clearly a place with a ready alternative to Marks .
It is not all bad news for Sir Stuart .
Shoppers like Celia Bartholomew , 61 , a retired housing benefits manager from Bolton on what she describes as " a decent pension " leave the store happy shoppers .
" I like the Per Una range , " she says .
And 37 - year - old Michelle George , a business consultant pushing her 18 - month - old son in a buggy , insists : " It 's false economy to go to Primark .
I 'd rather just buy less of the good stuff " .
But most shoppers are making economies .
" There is no more impulse shopping on clothes , " says Zoe Kelly , a woman in her late forties .
" We 're going to the market more now , looking for bargains , " adds her friend Karen Anderson .
" We 're not feeling the pinch yet , we 're just being prudent . "
They are not the only ones .
That much is obvious from the massive market a few hundred yards across the square .
It seems to sell everything from rare foodie delicacies , like cow heel pieces and black tripe , to brand new DVD players retailing at an extraordinary £ 29 .
At a stall selling hosiery and women 's underwear two market traders , Colin and Lisa Parkinson , look surprised to be asked about the impact of the economic downturn on shopping .
" We 're definitely doing alright at the moment , are n't we love ? " says Colin .
" We 're holding our own .
In fact we 're a touch better . "
The stall sells seconds from big name stores and trade is brisk from shoppers now neglecting those high street names .
It is the same story at a nearby butcher 's stall .
" People are changing the way they shop , " says the meat merchant , Steve Maloney , who has been in the trade for over 20 years , and whose Dad passed on to him the recession - tested advice : ' They 've always got to eat , son ' .
" Shoppers are looking for their money to go a little bit further . "
He is offering a " two - meal deal " involving a ham shank and a chicken .
And one of his staff is drumming up trade by shouting : " Two chicken breasts for £ 1 " .
An elderly shopper hesitates .
" Come on love , " he cries to her , " we 're desperate ! "
All too many people literally are .
The jewellery stall opposite has been doing a steady trade all week with people coming in and pawning their precious objects .
Four new pawnshops , or " cash generators " as they have been rebranded , have opened in the past few months .
But the market is not just an alternative to the high street it is a microcosm of the economy in its own right .
It has its winners and losers too .
Down the alleyway Eric Bevens , who chucked in being a travel agent in 2001 and opened a couple of stalls selling lamps , lights and small pieces of furniture , is having a bad time .
" People are being much more cautious .
We 're 20 per cent down , " he says .
" The few who are buying are paying cash where once two - thirds of them used credit cards .
And suppliers are cutting back on what they hold .
I rang the other day to see something I 'd seen on display at trade fair at G - Mex two months ago and they told me it had been discontinued . "
He has just closed one of his two stalls .
" That saves us £ 1,000 a month on rent , " he says , uncheered by the saving .
By the market entrance Mohammed Arshid , 58 , a trader there for 30 years , sits on a stool nursing a mug of tea .
His stall area is utterly deserted .
" I sell teenage fashions but Matalan and Primark are open longer hours now , " he says .
" Tesco and Asda sell clothes now .
And they have free parking . "
Teenagers are just not coming to the market so much these days and those who do do n't have much money .
He is 30 pc down on last year .
" I do n't think it will pick up , " he says gloomily .
" For Christmas I may get out of fashions and try something else . "
Retail - the bigger picture
In a pub not far from Mornington Crescent underground station in London four men are talking shop , literally .
Bryan Roberts and his colleagues are having a drink on the way home from their work as retail analysts at Planet Retail , the research group with offices in London , Frankfurt and Tokyo that provides the latest business intelligence on the world 's shopping trends to the retail industry .
It is not a job for half measures .
These men are on pints .
" There are very mixed messages on the global picture , says Roberts , who is the firm 's Global Research Director .
" A lot of retailers are going to go under , especially in , furniture , DIY and the smaller electrical chains .
Electricals are the worst hit at present : TVs , fridges , washing machines are all down 7 per cent and computers are down 11 pc . "
The trade is being hit from two sides .
It is losing sales on the big items that people buy after moving house , which they are n't doing much at present .
And hard times are making people postpone decisions to upgrade .
" The electrical market is driven by new product development , " says Greg Hodge , Planet Retail 's non-food research manager , " but everyone who wants one has now got a mobile , PC , laptop , widescreen TV and huge US ice - cube making fridge .
Over the last two years people have stopped upgrading their phones because the old one does pretty much everything they want and the improvements on the new models are marginal .
Firms like Dixons could be under pressure to close a lot of stores over the next 18 months , especially since supermarkets like Asda and Tesco have made heavy incursions into their territory . "
" Everywhere people are trading down , " says Roberts , " both in what they buy and where they buy it . "
People are eating out less so alternatives to restaurant fare are selling better .
" Gresingham duck breasts are up 110 per cent in Waitrose " .
On staples they are shifting from Finest ranges to Basics ones .
Sainsbury 's is playing on this with a ' Switch And Save ' labelling scheme which places own - label alternatives next to top brand products - with a sign pointing out the saving to be made .
Tesco have begun printing ' Discount brands at Tesco ' on some products to create the impression that they are matching the products of discount supermarkets like Aldi , Lidl and Netto .
" Own - label products are getting much bigger .
And supermarkets like Aldi and Tesco are creating phantom brands which are in fact exclusively for that one supermarket but which have a name like Daisy which implies they are an independent brand " .
The other way in which people are trading down is by switching supermarkets .
" Loyalty is a thing of the past , " says Greg Hodge .
Sales may be down at M&S but there has been a surge in discount food stores ; Aldi is up 21 per cent and Lidl 13 per cent on last year .
It is the same story on clothing , which is worse news for M&S .
" They are essentially a womenswear retailer , " says Hodge .
" On that they are losing market share to H&M , Zara and Matalan as well as Tesco and Asda . "
Profits at Marks & Spencer fell by a third over the last three months ; by contrast those at its discount clothing rival Primark were up 17 per cent .
That is far more serious than a drift a way from M&S 's luxury food .
" They make 5 per cent profit on food but 30 per cent or more on clothes . "
So what will the knock - on effect of that be ?
Those who are feeling the pain , says Bryan Roberts ordering another pint , are the firms who supply and service chains like M&S .
" When supermarkets do " buy two get one free " offers they expect the suppliers to supply at half price , so they bear the brunt of the cost , " he reveals .
" Similarly when they place products at the end of the display gondolas , where most people pass - in the trade it 's called Action Alley - they charge suppliers for their products to be given such prominence .
Sometimes they even demand retrospective discounts from suppliers saying : ' Your product sold so well that we want you to knock half a per cent off your invoice ' . "
But it is not just those who supply the food and clothing to big stores who are hit .
M&S recently there will be cuts in the £ 1bn it planned to spend smartening up its shops .
They will spend £ 700 m this year and just £ 400 m next year .
That will hit a variety of people from shopfitters and signmakers to advertising agencies and tv stations and magazines that carry the ads .
Shopfitters , says the trade paper Retail Week , " are hitting hard times as they start to bear the brunt of retailers ' attempts to cut costs " .
The trouble was that firms who worked for M&S did not want to talk .
" I can't comment on any of that , " said Ida Rezvani who manages the M&S account for the ad agency Rainey Kelly .
A spokeswoman at Berkeley Projects , which has in the past fitted out kitchens for M&S , said : " Someone will get back to you " .
But no - one did .
" We 're not going to be able to help you with this one , " said Sally Ann Allman of the Sheffield shopfitters Barlows which lists M&S as one of it clients .
None of that comes as a surprise to Bryan Roberts at Planet Retail .
" It 's a real No Comment culture .
These kind of budget cuts could be really significant for a shopfitter which does n't have a client base diversified across several sectors .
M&S still needs to buy sausages but it can manage without a refit , remodel or refresh . "
Already four or five firms have gone out of business , according to the National Association of Shopfitters .
The cuts are beginning to bite everywhere .
As they leave the pub Bryan Roberts and his colleagues swap examples :
" At the Tesco head office in Cheshunt in the suppliers waiting room they 've turned the heating off .
And they are showing Aldi ads on a continuous loop to concentrate suppliers ' minds " .
" In the Walmart waiting room suppliers have to pay for their own coffee . "
" An IT company has just told me that M&S has just has cut its IT support budget by 40 pc . "
On it goes , there are cuts in business travel , in entertaining expenses , in the renewal of company cars .
And each one of the cuts ripples out further into the real economy .
Cutting back - at the factory
" The management wo n't let you on the premises , I 'm afraid , " says the union rep .
We are standing in the car park at the massive factory complex which houses the Range Rover production line in Solihull near Birmingham .
" But one of the lads will come out and talk to you outside . "
The car industry has been one of the first sectors of the British economy to be visibly affected by the way that the global financial crisis is cascading through to the real economy .
Companies seeking cutbacks are not replacing company cars .
And private buyers are doing the same .
Sales of new cars in the UK fell in October at their fastest rate for 17 years , down 23 per cent from a year ago .
The impact is already being felt throughout the UK car industry .
Jaguar , Honda and Bentley have all scaled back production .
Here at the Land Rover factory production of the luxury 4x4 Range Rover has been cut from two shifts to one .
Night shift working on the Range Rover assembly line has been suspended .
For men like Steve Allen that means a 25 per cent drop in his weekly wage .
Steve , aged 40 , fits alternators on the 4x4 production line .
" The loss of the night shift , " which pays more than daytime working he explains , " will cost me nearly £ 300 a month . "
He was already feeling the pinch because overtime at the plant was axed some time ago .
He has already lost £ 150 a month through that .
" With the rises in gas and electricity prices that means we 'd already started to make economies , " he says .
Steve looks an unlikely type to be interested in grocery shopping .
But he has a formidable command of current prices .
" In Sainsbury 's we 've switched to own brands and Basics .
Coke is 89 p a bottle ; own brand cola is 44 p and it 's palatable .
I 've swapped from a £ 1.30 bag of sweets to a 40 p packet of wine gums .
The weekly shop used to be £ 85 ; now I aim to get it in under £ 60 . "
He likes a drink .
In the old days he would come off the night shift at 6.30 am on a Friday morning , go home to sleep and then meet his mates in the pub on a Friday afternoon .
" I 'd have 4 or 5 pints .
But last week I bought 4 bottles of Newcastle Brown , for £ 1.09 a piece .
That 's less than half the price in the pub .
And you do n't drink them as quick . "
One of the things that recession breeds is increased isolation .
" My mate was supposed to be getting some and coming round but in the end we did n't bother .
Both just stayed at home and had a drink on our own . "
Economic hard times may , in these little ways , make us a more self - focussed and solipsistic society .
This is not the only part of Steve Allen 's social interaction which is being curtailed .
" I 've knocked ten pin bowling on the head .
That save me £ 20 - 25 a month . "
And he has n't been to a football match all season .
He is - unlikely as it might seem for a Midlander - a West Ham fan .
" It was the first team I watched as a lad .
Usually I go down to , London 6 or 7 times a season .
It 's £ 25 on petrol , £ 35 on a ticket , so with something to eat it comes in around £ 70 .
But this year I have n't been at all .
I did n't even go when they were playing the Albion up here because the seats were £ 40 which is extortionate " .
He pulls a pack of tobacco from the pocket of his bomber jacket and takes out a roll - your - own he made earlier .
" We 're still hoping to go on holiday but we 're looking at going at Whit which is cheaper than the summer .
I 've found a camping holiday in Spain ; 12 days for £ 365 and I reckon it'll cost about £ 200 for petrol , compared with £ 1500 for two weeks in peak time in Portugal or Spain .
I never thought I 'd be having a camping holiday at my age .
Better than not having one at all .
and you only pay that then , whereas with a holiday you have to hand over your cash up front .
" Still , " he adds , looking on the bright side , " the tent has a fridge and a mini-cooker . "
He looks at the thin cigarette in his hand .
The management has just announced that it now wants 400 voluntary redundancies from the 16,000 - strong workforce across its three vehicle assembly sites .
" The mood on the line is sombre .
People coming up to retirement are thinking about taking redundancy .
But I 'm 40 .
I 've been a manual car worker for 14 years and I know , if I took redundancy and looked for another job , I would n't get anything round here on anything like the same kind of money .
Some of the lads have worked in construction in the past but there 's nothing going in the building trade just now . "
He falls to musing on further economies .
" I could get rid of Sky Sports .
I could switch to home brew ...
All at once he becomes philosophical .
" All this might not do me any harm in a sense .
Our lives have become consumer - driven .
You start reassessing and re-evaluating ; you can still enjoy some nice things without having to put your hand in your pocket . "
He looks down at the mobile phone on his lap .
" I mean , do I really need a mobile phone at £ 25 a month ? "
Would he think about giving up the ciggies ?
" No . I enjoy smoking ; I 'd be gutted if I had to stop .
Anyway I 've already switched from Richmond king size to roll - ups .
Richmond are £ 4.70 a pack and you can get 25gm of tobacco for £ 5.90 .
" That 's twice as many smokes for the same money . "
And he lights up .
Hard hit - the corner shop
Only half of the neon lights are on in the newsagent 's shop .
The owner , Richard Green , is trying to save money .
A quarter of his weekend trade has fallen off since overtime was cancelled at the Land Rover factory down the road .
A big part of his profit comes from cigarette sales .
" On a Saturday and a Sunday I used to get 25 to 30 car workers coming in between 5.30 am and 7.30 am on their way to weekend overtime work , " he says , perched on a tall stool behind the counter .
" That 's been cancelled for a while .
There 's just one or two skeleton staff in now .
And I have n't sold a box of chocolates since Easter and I usually sell two or three a week .
Overall , takings are down around 10 per cent " .
A woman in a tracksuit enters the shop .
She has the whey pasty - face of someone who eats a poor diet .
" Can I have a look at your Dr Who cards ? " she asks the newsagent .
He passes her a box containing packs of the cards that kids collect on their way to school .
She goes through the entire box searching for slightly fatter packs .
" The fat ones are the one that have the shiny embossed cards that are the hardest to get , " she explains .
But though she finds three packs she decides she can only afford to buy two .
The cards are £ 1.50 a pack and even then she does n't have enough money .
She tries to pay with a credit card .
" We do n't take them , love , " says Richard Green .
The woman goes out to the cash machine down the road and comes back with a £ 10 note .
" More and more people are trying to pay with credit cards for everything , " the newsagent observes after she has gone .
Money is getting tight all round in Solihull .
" I 'm definitely concerned , " he says .
" The car workers are all worried .
And it has a knock - on effect .
If there 's no customers I go out of business . "
He speaks from the heart .
He used to run a pub but got out just before the smoking ban came in .
He 's already making changes both in the shop and at home .
" Just silly little things but I 'm watching the bills .
That 's why only half the lights are on .
And I only stock up on cigarettes once instead of twice a week .
I 've cut back on the amount of stock I hold .
You lose a few sales that way because you run out of stock , but you do n't tie up money unnecessarily .
I 've stopped carrying brands that do n't sell much , because you have to buy them from the wholesaler in cartons of 200 and that 's too much dead money tie up . "
At home he has begun to pinch pennies too .
" I 've just sent off for some standby savers for the electricity points and I 've just bought my son a bus pass so I do n't have to drive him places ; I 'm cutting back on journeys so I have to fill the car every 2 or 3 weeks instead of weekly . "
He begins his list hesitantly but is soon in full flow on his new found skimping .
" We 're having a takeaway every other week instead of every week .
The kids have stopped drinking Coke and Dr Pepper and are on cheap brands of pop .
I 've stopped going to away games for the Blues [ Birmingham City ] and next season I 'll cancel the season tickets for me and my son .
We usually go to Florida on holiday ; it 's good value because money goes a long way when you get there .
But with flights , car , hotel etc it costs £ 4,000
So we have n't even looked at it this year .
And we 've shelved big things like having the windows replaced .
It is a Thursday .
So the local paper is selling well .
Thursday is the day with the Jobs section in it .
" People are looking for extra jobs , evening jobs , weekend jobs , anything to bring some extra income in . "
An unsmiling ginger - haired workman in heavy boots and a luminous jacket comes into the shop and spends £ 10 on scratchcards .
He goes out to his white van to uncover them .
Two minutes later he is back ; he has won on two .
He collects £ 6 winnings - and uses money to buy more scratchcards .
He goes back to the van , and returns with a card on which he has won £ 2 .
Again he uses it two buy two more cards and goes back to the van .
This time he obviously loses .
He drives off .
" He comes in every day and goes through all that .
He 's looking for a big win . "
He is far from the only one .
" Sales on scratchcards , and lottery tickets , are up - by about 5 per cent , though not enough to offset the loss on cigarette sales .
' I need to win , ' people tell me , and it 's not just a joke .
They are the only thing I 'm selling more of " .
Redundancy - and beyond
For 30 years Chemix Ltd was a leading UK manufacturer of the chemical mixtures used increasingly by the building industry to make modern plastic window frames , cladding and facia board .
It sold a wide range of rigid PVC extrusion compounds throughout the UK , Europe and the USA .
Until recently it was a rapidly growing market .
Then people like Richard Green , the newsagent from Solihull hit by falling cigarette sales , decided he would not have his windows done .
Millions of other homeowners made the same decision .
Now Jackie Horn , its IT worker , and the rest of the 60 - strong workforce at Chemix have lost their jobs .
" I was one of the lucky ones , " she says , now in her first week of unemployment .
" I was kept on for an extra three weeks to help with the winding down .
It gave me time to get used to the idea .
The others had to come to terms with it immediately - and one man 's wife had just had a baby , another has one due in December , another was abroad on holiday , another was coming to the end of a fortnight 's honeymoon .
There was no company redundancy , just the state minimum . "
For the last three weeks she manned the switchboard .
" Everyone who rang in was sympathetic apart from one woman the company owed money too who got angry and said she'd go bankrupt that afternoon as a result .
Over the weeks the guys came back to get references .
Those who had taken out private insurance to cover their mortgage repayments in the event of redundancy needed to get their claim forms signed .
A few had savings but most people do n't have much of a cash cushion . "
Jackie herself has begun to make economies .
" I 've gone from M&S ready - meals to beans on toast .
I 've stopped buying clothes , magazines and make - up .
I 'm just buying what I need and going to Aldi .
My washing machine is broken .
I could get a new one for £ 220 but it's not a priority ; I 'm just taking my washing to my Mum or my ex boyfriend's " .
She has cancelled a trip to visit her sister in New Zealand at Christmas .
" Fortunately I have n't got big debts and I have a family .
My mum has paid off my credit card and my dad says he 'll pay my mortgage . "
What now ?
" A couple of the guys have got jobs already ; one is driving a van , another is working in Morrisons ; and one of the managers has got a new job .
The others are job hunting and saying that the wages on offer are low .
You want the same wage that you 've been on because you get used to the money you 've had .
But that may not be possible in the future . "
Gathering clouds - the future
So what does the future hold for people like Jackie Horn ?
To find out I return to London to Tokenhouse Yard , the narrow street behind the Bank of England which one housed the office for the delivery of farthing tokens , used for several centuries by many London tradesmen .
At the end is the grand town house which was formerly the headquarters of the Queen 's stockbrokers , Cazenove .
In those days staff were not allowed up the main staircase down which Ian Harnett appears .
Harnett is a formidable figure .
Formerly a Bank of England economist he has been in the markets for 20 years .
He was European strategist at the global financial services company UBS before setting up his own business , Absolute Strategy , with David Bowers the former chief global strategist at Merrill Lynch three years ago .
The clients they advise manage investments worth $ 4 trillion between them - or at least that was what they were worth until recently .
In a wood panelled office , with a chiming clock and mahogany table , Ian Harnett - a neat , discreetly - suited , bespectacled man who looks the image of financial probity - sketches a grim prognosis .
" The US , UK , Spain , Iceland and Ireland have all been living on money borrowed from Asia and the Middle East , " he says .
" They were all living beyond their means on what was all just a fiction .
The end of cross - border flows of money has put a sudden end to this .
Globalisation is over , for a while . "
The benefit of globalisation was that it brought us cheap products at a lower price .
That may be over now .
" We wo n't have access to cheap labour from Asia and Eastern Europe .
Prices will rise . "
The £ 29 DVD players I saw in Bury market early on my tour of the British economy are is almost certainly a thing of the past .
" Is £ 29 the right price - the answer is probably not .
People still do n't appreciate the scale of the crisis and the impact it will have on every sector of the economy . "
Grim news is what you might expect out of Tokenhouse Yard .
This was , after all , where Daniel Defoe recorded in his Journal of the Plague Year that " I had many dismal scenes before my eyes , as particularly of persons falling dead in the streets , terrible shrieks and screeching of women , who in their agonies would throw open their chamber windows , and cry out in a dismal surprising manner .
Passing through Tokenhouse Yard , in Lothbury , of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head , and a woman gave three frightful screeches , and then cried , ' Oh ! death , death , death ! ' in a most inimitable tone , which struck me with horror , and a chilliness in my very blood .
There was nobody to be seen in the whole street , neither did any other window open , for people had no curiosity now in any case , nor could anybody help one another . "
There is a creeping sense of the economic equivalent of that impotence slowly seizing the nation .
Despite global taxpayers having now spent £ 5 trillion to shore up the world 's banks all the indicators , he says , are pointing downwards .
House prices continue to fall ; they are now 14 per cent lower than a year ago , the sharpest annual drop since 1991 .
Mortgage lending in the UK has crawled to a near standstill and banks have banks dramatically increased the size of the deposits that are now required by lenders .
Sales on the high street remain weak .
Some 21 per cent of Britons have scrapped their gym membership .
Taxi drivers in place after place on my travels - Newcastle , Edinburgh , Birmingham , Manchester - all reported that their takings were down £ 100 a week or more .
The use of executive limos in the City is down 40 per cent .
A third of small manufacturing firms have shed jobs in last 3 months , a CBI survey this week revealed , and a quarter plan to do the same in the next three months .
Meanwhile cheap forms of escapism are flourishing : cinema audiences this summer were their highest since 1972 with the feelgood Abba musical Mamma Mia the biggest grossing blockbuster .
And sales of computer games consoles have doubled as people spend more time at home .
On the way to meet Ian Harnett I bumped into Richard Hunter once again .
The equities guru from Hargreaves Lansdown had echoed the same dark prophecy .
" The UK is not well placed to weather a recession , " Hunter had told me .
" The currency is weaker ; that 's good for exporters but - unlike Sweden with its phones or Germany with its cars - we do n't export much manufactured stuff .
We 're a service - dominated economy so we can't export our way out of trouble .
We 're in for a tough time .
The Stock Market should recover nine to 12 months before the real economy does .
I like to think that will be sometime next year , but it could take longer . "
Indeed .
" What 's happening now is an epochal change , " says Ian Harnett , the man with $ 4 trillion turning on his analysis .
" It 's a pivotal moment in world history . "
He fears a new era of a new protectionism of the kind seen in the 1930s .
Then an economic clump turned into the Great Depression when each nation slapped taxes on imports in an attempt to protect their own industries from outside competition .
Harnett fears that today nations could do something similar - with money rather than goods .
He calls that " capital protectionism " and fears that if each state refuses to lend others that will severely curb worldwide economic activity .
" That 's the real choice governments face : whether to move to a more protectionist model or work together to create a new global order with new controls .
The latter may be too difficult to agree , though the IMF now has leverage to exert there that it did n't have before .
But the current crisis is like global warming , or a pandemic ; it 's not a national government issue .
Gordon Brown has a feel for what 's at stake here .
But the trouble is it may be hard for the UK to opt out of this credit protectionism . "
But what does that mean for us ordinary folk ?
" People are trying to work out how to put Humpty Dumpty together again .
But the answer may be that it can't be .
Instead of piecing together the broken jigsaw it may be that we have to make a new picture from just half the pieces .
In the 70s and 80s the miners had to find new jobs and reinvent themselves .
That will happen to many people today , and not just in banking . "
How would that affect the people who have lost their jobs in a company like Chemix .
What should a 55 - year - old chemical worker , a 45 - year - old manager and a 35 - year - old IT worker do now ?
" The more adaptable you are the better , " he replies .
" Large scale retraining is needed .
Skills are going to be the passport to survival .
The trouble is it 's unclear what kind of training people should do .
For the miners in the 1980s , the shift to IT made sense , but it 's not clear what that equivalent will be in the 21st century , though the more IT literate people are the better .
Presentation skills will be important and so will skills on dealing with environmental change . "
Some of us will find it harder than others , he conceded .
Of the three he suggests the 45 - year - old manager might have the most difficulty finding a new job .
The 55 - year - old chemical worker may be better placed to " find a day - job at a supermarket and perhaps do some training in the evening " .
The 35 - year - old IT worker will be best placed .
" The financial crisis is causing wealth destruction on a massive scale , but it will also create opportunities " .
Meantime the burden of the economic downturn will fall disproportionately on certain individuals .
" True , and it 's the job of government to address that . "

Her last day at work was a Friday .
" At the end of the day , " says Jackie Horn , " I looked out of my window for the final time .
The guy who had been kept on to pack the last orders that Chemix had in train saw me .
He looked up from the shop floor and started to sing " Farewell my friend " to me .
I had to look away before I started crying . "
The last remaining person in accounts was finishing that day too .
" We did a tour of the place , going into every room before we locked up and gave the key to the administrators .
Then we had a hug and said Goodbye .
I loved working there .
It was a very friendly place . "
Next Monday , home alone , she picked up the phone .
" I rang the Social and have an appointment there tomorrow to see about signing on , " she says with an enforced brightness .
" I 've written up my CV with help from the people who used to be the managers .
I 've looked for jobs on the internet ; I found one locally but it had gone when I rang .
I would hope to stay in IT ; I 'm a programmer .
But I can do office admin and reception .
I hope there are jobs out there but more and more people are being made redundant .
I 'm optimistic but I 'm scared .
I only have a small mortgage but I live on my own so I need to work to pay it .
I have a few savings .
I could maybe manage until the New Year , and then ... "
She looks up at the Art Nouveau patterns in the stained glass on her windows .
One thing she wo n't be doing with her savings is having them replaced .
" They are a bit draughty .
I had a quote to have them replaced in the summer - it would have been £ 1,700 - but I decided against it .
That wo n't be happening now . "
If she is aware of the irony of that she does not disclose it .
Perhaps irony is a luxury only those in work can afford nowadays .
Dear Cecil :
What 's the deal with Pygmies ?
I heard that the Europeans found some in the jungles when they went off exploring , but they also supposedly discovered people with one foot and men 80 feet high , so you can understand my doubt .
What I want to know is :
Are they real ?
And are they just humans that have adapted or are they evolved from a separate branch of the protohuman ?
The Immortal Mango , via the Internet
Cecil replies :
A letter like yours rouses my anthropological curiosity , Mango .
So I ’ll answer your question , provided you answer one of mine :
How does it feel to be the stupidest person on earth ?
Just kidding , of course .
There are boatloads of folks as ignorant as you , and Pygmies have historically brought a lot of them out of the woodwork .
To take just one example , a Pygmy was briefly exhibited in the Bronx Zoo ’s monkey house in 1906 ( more on that below ) .
In The Origin of Races ( 1962 ) anthropologist Carleton Coon ( sheesh ) argues that our Homo erectus ancestors evolved separately into five modern human subspecies — you can see where that idea might lead — and in The Living Races of Man ( 1965 ) suggests that Pygmies , at the time numbering around 150,000 , are the oldest of the “ Congoid ” ( central African ) races .
While I do n’t know that Coon ever explicitly says that Pygmies are a “ separate branch of the protohuman , ” that ’s the implication — he makes much of their status as hunter - gatherers , for instance .
Anyone reviewing Coon ’s evidence , though , which mostly has to do with superficial physical characteristics , would be a fool to agree .
To cut to the chase : Pygmies are definitely real , they ’re as human as you and me , and yes , they ’re pretty short .
Now , about that Pygmy in the zoo .
His name was Ota Benga , and he was initially brought to Saint Louis in 1904 for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition after being sold as a slave by thugs on the payroll of the Belgian government , who ’d butchered his wife and children in the Congo .
Colonization of Africa and Asia by Western nations had awakened public interest in the new science of anthropology , and throngs of fairgoers could gawk at indigenous tribespeople from around the globe in replica villages , where they conducted native ceremonies , made crafts , and so on .
( One star of the show was Geronimo , the legendary Apache chief , then in his 70s . )
The typical fairgoer evidently being but little removed from the swamps himself , Ota and several other Pygmies exhibited with him were subjected to ridicule and abuse — poking them with lighted cigars was reputedly a common experiment .
Nonetheless all the Pygmies survived the ordeal and were returned to their homeland .
( Most of these details are found in Ota Benga : The Pygmy in the Zoo by Phillips Verner Bradford and Harvey Blume , 1992 . )
Not long afterward Ota ’s second wife died of a snakebite , and in 1906 he decided to return to the U.S. in the company of the man who ’d first brought him over , an eccentric adventurer named Samuel Verner .
Down on his luck after arriving in New York , Verner turned Ota over to the Bronx Zoo , whose equally eccentric director , William Hornaday , decided to put the Pygmy on exhibit at the monkey house — with bones scattered about the enclosure , the better to suggest his bestial nature .
( Ota ’s sharpened teeth also provoked repeated false claims of Pygmy cannibalism . )
The young man drew tens of thousands of visitors , who were encouraged to think of him as the missing link between apes and humans .
Among other things he was asked to play with an orangutan , a task he apparently enjoyed .
This racist display , passed off as a vindication of Darwinism , incensed the black community , and a delegation of ministers demanded that the exhibition be stopped .
Zoo officials compromised , letting Ota have the run of the park during the day , but after he got tired of being mobbed and brandished a stolen knife , Hornaday caved and turned him over to a black orphanage .
Ota , by then in his late 20s , learned to speak and read English but otherwise showed little interest in schooling .
After a few years he was sent to live in Lynchburg , Virginia , the site of a Baptist seminary where he occasionally took classes .
He supported himself with odd jobs and tobacco - factory work , hunting in his off hours and becoming quite a favorite of the local youth .
In 1916 , though , homesickness overcame him .
Despite the new caps on his teeth , he did n’t fit in .
After learning that the trip back to Africa was beyond his means , Ota borrowed a revolver and shot himself fatally in the heart .
Not to traffic in the obvious , but given his experiences with so - called civilized folk you have to ask :
Who here was the savage ?

The Biggest Scientific Breakthroughs of 2008 Discoveries in every realm of science marked ' 08 .
Here 's our list of the top 10 .
Dec. 22 , 2008  --
The year 2008 closes with two enormous scientific and technological challenges unresolved :
How to create renewable and benign sources of energy and how to lessen the damage we 're doing to the global climate system .
Those twin issues are the " greatest challenge facing modern science , " according to Nobel laureate Steven Chu , the gifted physicist who has been nominated to head the Department of Energy .
He will be at the center of the effort to deal with these vexing problems , and his nomination signals a new day in that effort .
Clearly , those two issues dominated the world of science during 2008 , a year that also saw much progress in fields as diverse as genetic engineering , the imaging of new planets outside our solar system and the maturing of social media that has altered everything from how we meet people to financing a costly and victorious campaign for the presidency of the United States .
It 's difficult to pick a single scientific achievement that stands out above all others because science , as a whole , does n't work that way .
Science is and always will be a work in progress .
Discoveries today are built upon past discoveries as progress is achieved , inch by inch .
But rarely has there been a year when two inseparable issues dominated so much of our lives .
Energy and climate moved science from the lab to our living rooms and they were the " hot button " scientific issues of 2008 .
The " breakthrough " in this case is not just hardware ; it 's a growing understanding of the urgency in solving these critical problems .
Here 's our list of the top 10 .
Energy and Climate Change
The year the earth stood still .
Polluted air , a lopsided dependence on shaky sources of foreign oil and congested highways could n't convince Americans that it was time to get serious about new sources of energy .
But more than four bucks per gallon at the gas pump did the trick .
Biofuels , hybrids and photovoltaic cells slipped into our conversations like invaders from another planet .
Progress was reported from all areas of energy production but not all roads led us closer to energy independence .
Corn is n't going to replace gasoline .
That may be the most important energy " discovery " in 2008 .
Corn displaces agricultural land normally used for food production and , according to one study , it takes about 28 gallons of water to produce enough biofuel from corn to push a car just one mile .
Substitute water wars for gas wars .
That disappointment grew out of research that was dictated by funding .
Washington thought corn was a good idea and that 's where a lot of research funds went .
It should be the other way around .
Let discoveries chart the course ; let the funding follow .
Stay fluid .
Throughout the year , discoveries flowed in from hundreds of labs : wearable electronic circuits that can use body movements to recharge batteries ; solar panels so flexible they can be " painted " on a roof ; photovoltaic cells that are twice as effective at converting sunlight to electricity ; and a new generation of fuel - efficient vehicles .
The Sun Is Rising
Construction is under way on new wind farms , with huge turbines generating electricity from the passing breeze , and vast acreage is being converted to solar collectors .
Scientists at several institutions made progress in creating a way to store solar energy by using solar power to split water into oxygen and hydrogen and using the hydrogen as fuel .
It took a long time but the sun is finally rising as our most promising source of clean , sustainable energy .
Cells , a New Beginning
Scientists achieved several goals in what was once thought impossible -- reprogramming adult cells to act as stem cells , morphing into new cells .
That progress , labeled by Science magazine as the " breakthrough of the year , " could potentially solve two huge problems .
It now appears much more likely that scientists will be able to reprogram cells to fight a wide range of diseases , including muscular dystrophy and Parkinson 's disease , as well as many others .
And it eases the ethical problem of using embryonic stem cells , which results in the destruction of the embryo , because mature cells may be reprogrammed to do the job .
Furthermore , it is likely that a patient 's own cells can be reprogrammed in the near future , thus lessening the need to introduce foreign cells .
It is , put mildly , a new day in medical research .
But the road ahead is still bumpy .
The process is not well understood and there is some concern that reprogrammed cells might not always act the way they are supposed to .
But many researchers around the world are working to solve those problems .
A Really Big Machine
The grandest new toy to go online in 2008 is the Large Hadron Collider , a 17 - mile - long , ring - shaped particle accelerator on the French - Swiss border meant to recreate the conditions during the first instant after the Big Bang .
The machine , built by 26 nations for $ 8 billion , gives scientists their best chance yet to find the postulated Higgs boson or so - called " God particle , " which is believed to be the particle that gave mass to all other particles .
But every new accelerator , erroneously referred to as atom smashers , seems to come with its own agenda .
Who 's to say , at this point , what the Hadron will tell us about the beginning of the universe ?
Unfortunately , the collider had to be shut down after operating a few days in September because it sprang a helium leak .
It is scheduled to be operational again in June .
But , fortunately , it did n't do what some folks feared it might -- create black holes that could destroy the earth .
Physicists have tried to dehorn that myth , noting that particle collisions happen naturally all the time and the planet is still here .
Social Media
Here 's a newcomer to the annual year 's top 10 list , and it slipped in so quietly that a lot of lists missed it entirely .
Some of its components have been around for awhile -- Facebook , YouTube , Twitter , etc. -- but during 2008 they took center stage , changing the way many of us interact and providing vital information during disasters ranging from fires to warfare to terrorism .
Social Networking Here to Stay
This year , it helped President - elect Barack Obama make history , raising enough money from millions of citizens to finance a successful campaign for the presidency .
Obama used the new kid on the block , Twitter , to keep his followers informed and , of course , to lift a little change out of their pockets .
Social networking is here to stay and several sites remain the hottest on the Internet .
Earlier this month .
Google reported that four of the 10 " fastest - rising " search terms in 2008 were for social - networking sites , including three in Europe -- Facebook login ( 3 ) , tuenti ( 4 ) , nasza klasa ( 7 ) and wer kennt wen ( 8 ) .
Dead Mice Resurrected
Geneticists in Japan cloned dead mice that had been frozen for 16 years and produced 13 healthy , live mice .
The breakthrough suggests that it may be possible to bring back extinct animals , like the wooly mammoth , that have been dead and frozen for some time , a feat that was once thought impossible .
This process relied on transferring the nuclei from dead cells drawn from the brains and blood of the dead mice and injecting just that part into unfertilized mouse eggs , creating embryos .
But it will be difficult to resurrect animals that have been dead for a long time , the scientists said in announcing their discovery , because cells from dead animals decay quickly , even if frozen .
It 's not quite Jurassic Park but maybe it's a step in that direction .
Spacewalk , Made in China
Low earth orbit is n't exactly crowded but it grew a little tighter this year when a Chinese astronaut took a 15 - minute spacewalk outside the Shenzhou VII capsule 213 miles above the Earth .
It was China 's third manned venture into space , and the country plans to launch its own space station in a little more than a decade .
China is now recruiting more astronauts -- or " taikonauts " in Chinese lingo -- for future missions .
Planets , Anyone ?
Discovery of new planets outside our solar system came in rapid fire during 2008 and , for the first time , astronomers were able to image several planets , not just infer their existence from various clues .
New telescopes , and new techniques , revealed huge planets orbiting at great distances from their stars , so none of them are likely to harbor life as we know it .
But it was a significant milestone in the search for whatever , or whoever , is out there .
Previously , astronomers relied on faint movements of the stars from the gravitation of an orbiting planet , called the wobble effect , as one means of finding planets .
They could also measure the slight dimming of a star when a planet passed between the star and the earth .
But neither of these techniques allowed them to actually see the planets , which were too dim to be seen near a brilliant star .
Now , they can begin analyzing their data to learn more about the planets ' atmosphere and , thus , more about whether they could sustain life .
None of the exoplanets imaged so far are likely candidates but maybe someday ...
Can You See Me Now ?
Invisibility Cloaks on the Horizon
Have you ever wished you could be invisible , a fly on the wall that no one could see ?
Well , stay tuned .
Some clever researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , say they are close to inventing a " cloak of invisibility " that can deflect anything that travels as a wave , like light and sound .
You can't see it , you can't hear it , how you going to know it 's there ?
This magic resulted from the creation of new substances , called metamaterials .
The surface has incredibly tiny structures that are small enough to interfere with individual waves .
If you were cloaked in such material , light waves would bend around you and meet up on the other side .
You would have disappeared without a clue .
The technology could have many practical applications , some of which are obvious .
Think stealth bomber .
Life on Mars ?
Not yet , at least not that we know of .
But NASA 's intrepid spacecraft Phoenix , cobbled together partly with some leftover parts at a paltry cost of $ 420 million , showed once and for all that there is ice beneath Mars ' north pole .
That increases the possibility that there is , or at least was , life somewhere on the Red Planet , because water is essential for life as we know it .
Phoenix was n't exactly looking for life but months of poking and digging and analyzing produced some reason for hope .
The small craft found salts and clays , which require water to form , and it dug up ice crystals from the red soil .
Because of the planet 's varying distances from the sun , and its tilted axis , the polar regions do warm up about every million years or so , making those areas more suitable for life .
Even a microbe would be a welcome sight .
Your Genome , Cheap
DNA guru James Watson had his entire genome sequenced .
It took a couple of months and cost only about $ 1 million .
Now , it seems , everybody wants to get into the act .
A number of companies began offering genome sequencing , and the cost dropped to about $ 200,000 .
Still others opened shop , offering an abbreviated profile that would search for a wide range of potential illnesses for a few hundred dollars .
But health authorities across the country became alarmed because of the potential for mistakes and difficulty in interpreting what the findings actually mean , and regulatory agencies leaped into action with new and proposed rules .
So at the moment it 's not clear how available any of these services are likely to be but it 's probably only a matter of time .
At least we would know more about what to dread , even if we can't cure it yet .
SeaGen Shatters Tidal Power Generation Record
December 18th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Since its inception , we have been keeping a close eye on Marine Current Turbine ’s SeaGen project in the UK , the world ’s first commercial scale tidal stream turbine .
Well , today there is more big news to report from the strong tidal flows of Strangford Lough as SeaGen has generated at its maximum capacity of 1.2MW for the first time .
Thus far , this is the highest power produced by a tidal stream system anywhere in the world and exceeds the previous highest output of 300 kW produced in 2004 by the company ’s earlier SeaFlow system , off the north Devon coast .
[ social_buttons ]
“ Generating at full power is an important milestone for the company , and in particular our in - house engineering team .
We are very pleased with SeaGen ’s performance during commissioning , ” said Martin Wright , Managing Director of Marine Current Turbines ( MCT ) .
“ It demonstrates , for the first time , the commercial potential of tidal energy as a viable alternative source of renewable energy . ”
According to company officials , now that SeaGen has reached full power it will move towards full - operating mode for periods of up to 22 hours a day , with regular inspections and performance testing undertaken as part of the project ’s development program .
>> Watch an animation of SeaGen turbines in action
“ Marine Current Turbines has pioneered the development of tidal current turbines .
As the first mover in tidal stream turbine development , we have a significant technical lead over all rival tidal technologies that are under development , ” rightfully boasted Wright .
“ There are no other tidal turbines of truly commercial scale ; all the competitive systems so far tested at sea are quite small , most being less than 10 % the rotor area of SeaGen . ”
Drawing on its experience at Strangford Lough , MCT ’s next project is a joint initiative with npower renewables to build a 10.5 MW project using seven SeaGen turbines off the coast of north Wales .
That project is scheduled to come online in late 2011 / early 2012 .
The company is also investigating the potential for tidal energy schemes in other parts of the UK and Ireland , and in North America .

How to Make a Girl Squirt
There are many steps which describe the process about how to make a women squirt , but all is needed are fingers and oral job .
The best advice is to try with exploration in different things , different numbers of fingers , different parts of her pussy and ass .
Most important is to be innovative and inventive .
Surely , some of the best fingering comes in conjunction with oral , but there is a little secret that gives to any women best orgasm of her life .
How To Make a Girl Squirt :
You can start by performing oral on her inner thighs , clitoris and labia especially , to start getting her relaxed and wet .
You must continually suck and lick the clitoris throughout the duration of the whole oral act , because oral increases power , pleasure and increases chances of female ejaculating orgasm .
With the hand you write with , take two fingers closest to your thumb ( pointer and middle finger ) and make them wet with her pussy juice or with your mouth .
The most important thing is to make sure your nails are trimmed and not sharp , because you could hurt her .
Slide those two fingers in , with the fingerprint part of the fingers facing up ( nails down ) , slide them in firmly but slowly , as far as they will go without using too much pressure .
If she is really tight you may need to start with one , and if there is a lot of wetness but resistance , you may need to tease and taste her pussy some more .
Once you get those fingers in , tease her inner walls slowly with the pads of your fingers , and get her even more juicy .
When you think that she is ready to have the orgasm of her life , you may begin :
Now you will maneuver your fingers to find her g-spot .
Yes , it exists , and yes , every woman has one .
Slide your fingers in about 2 inches , UP , and then BACK towards the front of the pussy ( like you ’re going up behind her clitty ) .
Her g- spot is actually a patch of her inner walls which is on the FRONT INNER WALL of her pussy , above the hole itself .
So , in , up , and back towards the entrance .
You should feel , on that wall , a very rough patch of skin rougher than the rest of her smooth inner pussy .
You ’ve found it .
Congratulations .
By making a beckoning motion with your two fingers ( a come hither , bending fingers motion ) , you should be able to pull the fingerprint / pad part of the tips of your two fingers against that spot .
Try it .
Pull back against it with your two fingers and press a little .
Tease it , stimulate it with your fingers .
Make her feel good .
She should be squirming and breathing very heavily by now .
As you start to rhythmically tap / press / pull your fingertips against the g - spot , she should start getting wetter .
If you ’re doing it right , and she ’s comfortable with it , you ’ll start to hear squelching , sponge - like sounds .
The g - spot is like a sponge , it contains a lot of liquid , and feels rough .
Keep pressing your fingers against it , over and over , rhythmically , with the same kind of rhythm as if you were sliding your cock in and out of her pussy .
As she starts to get wetter , and enjoy it more , start doing it harder .
The more she thrashes from side to side , the harder you do it .
Eventually , you can replace the tapping / poking of the g - spot with an outright speed - sliding of those two fingers in and out of her hole .
Do it faster and faster , maintain the rhythm , but increase the force .
Even when you ’re slamming them straight in and out of her hole , try and maintain an upward , outward force with the fingertips , so you ’re still pressing up against that g- spot even as you ’re slamming her with your fingers with reckless abandon .
Through all of this , she should be squelching , squirming and OBVIOUSLY loving it .
If she ’s not , you should stop .
If she says it hurts ( especially if she says it more than once , you might want to stop or at LEAST slow down or not do it so hard .
Make sure she ’s always wet , not dry for any period of time .
Now here ’s the crucial part .
When she gets close to ejaculation , she will say that she needs to pee .
SHE DOES NOT NEED TO PEE .
It ’s just a temporary sensation that will pass , but you have to make sure she knows about it beforehand , and you have to make sure she does not stop you , and you do not desist in your slamming .
Hold her legs apart with the other hand , if you have to .
You can even use your head or knees or whatever to hold her legs open , but make sure she stays relatively still ( or she might get hurt on your fingers ) and that you KEEP GOING .
In fact , when she needs to pee , that ’s when you should start doing it harder , cause orgasm is around the corner .
10 - 50 seconds after the pee sensation begins , she will start to cum .
When she does , DON ’T STOP .
Just do it harder and harder and harder , pressuring the g - spot upwards all the while .
Now she should start to ejaculate .
She ’ll scream , and her pussy will start shooting clear ( transparent ) , odourless liquid all over the place .
There could be a lot of it , it might soak you completely and soak the sheets and everything around her , so make sure you ’re prepared .
I guarantee you , if she ’s never had one before , the squirting orgasm will be the best orgasm of her life .
In my experience , 97 % of women are capable of having them , and in certain circumstances , I think it ’s more like 99.9 % .
If you want her to ejaculate in great volumes , have her drink lots of water before you do it , and stay well hydrated .
Once she ’s finished squirting , SHE CAN SQUIRT AGAIN .
Especially if you did n’t do it too hard , and still got her to cum , you can usually start all over , and between one and ten minutes later , she ’ll be squirting again .
Usually , you have to do it harder each time .
My record is seven .
The girl that squirted seven times in 45 minutes passed out for 6 hours afterwards ( it ’s physically exhausting and dehydrating ) so be careful if you try more than 2 at once .
Most girls pass out after a couple of them .
This can make a girl fall in love and at the very least want to fuck your brains out , so use it wisely rather than to your advantage .
Do n’t take advantage of people using this .
If you do it wrong , or if she ’s on her period , she might bleed .
That ’s usually okay , but just make sure you do n’t hurt her , and you stop if she ’s screaming with pain , rather than pleasure .
You should always have a safe word with your partner , and you should always make sure she knows what you intend to do and that she ’s fine with it .
Enjoy this , and I hope it works out for you ; I hope it works out for HER , even more so .
If it does well , just wait and see .
I ’m jealous of women because of g - spot orgasms !
There ’s NO male equivalent it ’s just absolute ecstasy , nothing less .
Remember there are at least fifty ways to make a woman cum ( actually lots more ) and at least five different types of orgasms so do n’t limit yourselves to this whether it works or not .
* UPDATE * SQUIRTING VIDEO TUTORIAL :
It ’s by a guy named Jason Julius .
And his tips and techniques on how to give women incredible pleasure are pure gold .
In the video Jason demonstrates how to find and stimulate a woman ’s G Spot , which will later lead to heaps of squirting orgasms .
Let me tell you I just got done watching this video and it blew me away !

How to give a girl a squirting orgasm video .
* UPDATE * MORE ABOUT THE FAMOUS G-SPOT
As many of you complained about finding the g - spot while trying to give their females squirting orgasms , I have decided to write additional information about the g - spot and how to locate it more precisely in order to get better squirting .
What is G - Spot ?
The G spot is something quite mysterious , especially for those , who are not too experienced in sex .
Pretty much everyone has heard it , but they do not know how to find it , or even doubt its existence .
Still , it is there , and it has been proven that it provides a significant amount more pleasure than simply a sexual act without coordination .
This is why , if you really want to please your partner , you should familiarize yourself with a few ways to locate and stimulate it , in order to enjoy a healthy sexual life .
Who Discovered G - Spot ?
It is actually quite funny – it was debated for over 20 years whether the mysterious G spot actually existed .
Many scientists simply could not find it , using the medical equipment available to them at the time .
Even though countless women explained how they felt significantly more stimulated during certain practices , practitioners still suspected the placebo effect .
It was not until the introduction of more sophisticated technologies , such as the MRI for instance , that the existence of the G spot was finally truly uncovered .
Today , there are many sexual therapists and guides , who can help you , improve your sex life using it .
What Does G - Spot ?
After this medical breakthrough however , there has been numerous medical research to see what exactly the effects of the so - called G spot are , when it is stimulated .
It has been proven that it increases sexual pleasure at least six times , and it helps for the healthy release of dopamine within the brain .
Basically , even science has stated that stimulating this particular area will make you happy .
If you really like to improve upon your sex live , you should experiment with your partner in this field , and try out different methods to find it .
Research shows that relationships are significantly improved when the sex life gets back on track .
How To Find G - Spot ?
As for finding and stimulating the G spot , there is a rather complex and detailed process you should try out first .
You should remember one very important thing – you need to make sure that the vagina is properly lubricated .
This is derived from two reasons – proper lubrication decreases painful traction , and more importantly – the G spot will not show itself before the person is aroused .
This is why you should really spend some time and efforts for foreplay , in order to make sure that you have unlocked the spot itself .
After you have achieved lubrication , you need to pinpoint the exact location of the spot .
It is usually located 1 to 3 inches deep after you have inserted a finger into the vagina .
Most people claim that it is closer to 3 inches .
Since it is on the frontal wall of the vagina , you should imitate a “ come here ” movement with your finger .
This will help you feel the surroundings , and feel exactly where the G spot is located .
You should be observant of changes in respiration in your partner as well – there is no better way to know that you are doing better .
After you have located the spot , you will need to stimulate it properly for the ultimate effect .
First of all , you will need to insert 2 fingers , or a specialized sex toy into the vagina .
The fingers should be the middle and the ring ones .
Once you have done this , you need to curl them accordingly , simulating the “ come here ” movement gently at first , and then more rapidly .
You should know however , that your partner will need to be lying down with spread legs , and you will need to be by her side , while facing her , in order to achieve the full effect .
Curling your fingers is essential , but you should know that this only lasts in the beginning phases of stimulation .
After you have done this , you should actually start pulling your arm upwards , in order to improve the pressure on the spot .
At first , you should make sure you are really gentle , in order not to inflict pain .
However , the more you continue , the more you can increase both the speed and the force of pressure .
This is due to the fact that with continued arousal , your partner will demand more and more out of you .
You should know that not all methods for stimulation of the G spot require the fingers , or given toys though .
There are a lot of special sex poses , which will help you use the penis in order to stimulate it effectively and improve the sexual experience tenfold .
Sex instructors will easily tell you that sexual pleasure during the act is not only controlled by the size , speed and force of the mail organ .
A large part is played by the angle through which you do it .
This is one of the most essential things you need to experiment with , if you want to provide ultimate pleasure .
Here is an interesting fact – the G spot actually has a similarity with the male penis .
When it is aroused , it is also filled with blood , and therefore enlarged .
This is why , if you are unsure as to where to look , you should make sure you arouse your partner enough .
This will make the spot easy to feel , and you will have no trouble to pinpoint and stimulate it .
If for some reason you cannot find it , you have probably not been able to stimulate your partner enough during the session , or there are some other reasons behind it .
As a whole , finding and stimulating the G spot might be a bit hard for most people , who have no interactions with it .
The longer you are in a relationship , the easier will be for you to make your partner feel good and this is normal .
You should keep in mind though , that experimentation will be one of your best friends when it comes to sex in general .
You need to make sure you try out different positions , various angles , and constantly be interested in what your partner asks of you .
That way you can guarantee yourself a healthier and more pleasant sexual life .
If for some reason you are having troubles , you should try and find a professional , who will be able to guide you .
There are a lot of reasons for a sexual life to be dysfunctional , and it is good to find help when that occurs .
Germany : Gulf between rich and poor is rapidly widening
By Dietmar Henning
12 December 2008
A report from the Hans Böckler Foundation shows that the share of profits for private wealth - holders has reached a new high .
Income from profits and assets accruing to company chiefs and the relatively small number of those who own capital has risen in both net and gross terms in 2008 .
Such income comprised 34 percent of all net income in 2007 ; in the first six months of 2008 this figure had risen to 35.8 percent .
Almost 50 years ago , in 1960 , this figure stood at 24.4 percent .
In the 30 years leading up to 1990 , this figure grew to 30 percent .
It had reached 32 percent in 2005 .
“ Business profits have risen considerably , ” a press statement from the foundation notes .
Gains by those at the top mean losses for the majority of wage earners .
The share of wages and salaries as a percentage of national income , after the deduction of payroll taxes and social and health insurance contributions , rose slightly in 2007 compared to the previous year .
However , this figure then fell in the first six months of 2008 to 39.3 percent , below the 2006 level .
Before 1990 , this figure regularly exceeded 50 percent ( e.g. , in 1960 it was almost 56 percent ) .
The researchers point out that the current decline in the share of wages and salaries , compared to income from business profits and assets , is largely a result of the tax and social contributions policies introduced by the Christian Democratic - Social Democratic grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel .
In making this claim , the spokesperson for the Hans Böckler Foundation , which is funded by the trade unions , ignores the fact that for the last 10 years both the labour and social affairs ministries have been headed by Social Democrats .
It is their decisions that have contributed considerably to the growth of social inequality .
Cuts in taxes on profits and income derived from assets mean the rich now contribute just one fifth of all taxation .
At the beginning of the 1960s , their share was about one third .
From 1998 onwards , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) - Green Party government under Gerhard Schröder ( SPD ) brought about a redistribution of social wealth on a scale never previously seen .
The introduction of welfare and labour reforms meant the welfare state was cut back drastically , while taxes for business and the rich were lowered .
The SPD now continues this policy as part of the grand coalition government .
The share of taxes from business and profits on capital is declining due to recent changes in business , inheritance and other taxes , meaning businesses and the wealthy are paying even less , according to the researchers .
The widening gulf between profits and assets on the one side — and wages and salaries on the other — evidences a massive growth in social inequality .
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) recently presented its annual global report on wages .
The report shows growing inequalities in Germany for incomes derived from wages and salaries , with those at the top and those at the bottom drifting further apart between 2001 and 2007 .
Among industrialized countries , only Poland has seen a wider growth of wage differences .
Wages in Germany have risen only very slightly in recent years .
Between 2001 and 2007 , average wages rose by just 0.51 percent , similar to the growth of wages in France .
The ILO report compares wages in 10 different income groups .
The wages of the top 10 percent of German earners was around 3.26 times that of those in the bottom decile .
This difference rises considerably when comparing the wages of the top 1 percent of earners with those at the very bottom of the scale .
( These figures take into account wage earnings only , and not bonuses , stock dividends , capital gains , etc . )
While top managers and high earners are raking in the money , the numbers employed in the low - wage sector are growing .
According to the report from the Hans Böckler Foundation , the main cause for the widening wages gap is the “ clear growth of the low - wage sector in Germany over the last years . ”
So - called “ mini jobs , ” part - time working and the increase of contract labour are responsible for the rapid growth in wage inequality in Germany .
According to German Trade Union Federation ( DGB ) contract expert Reinhard Dombre , the number of people engaged in “ precarious employment ” accounts for 30 percent of all those working .
Well over 1.5 million now work in jobs that pay less than the legally established minimum required to ensure a person ’s survival , and are forced to claim additional welfare benefits to “ top up ” their wages .
The numbers of those dependent on social welfare “ top ups ” has risen sharply over the past years , despite the expansion of the economy , according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
Under the grand coalition government from 2005 to 2007 , the number of those with a gross monthly wage of between €400 and € 800 requiring “ top ups ” increased by more than 40 percent , with a 40 percent rise in those with a gross monthly wage of over € 800 .
So - called wage dumping — whereby employers pay foreign workers less than the minimum wage fixed in union - negotiated agreements — is being promoted by the state , the report concludes .
In view of the financial and economic crisis , the ILO forecasts that workers will face “ painful cuts ” in their real wages in the coming years and warns of growing social tensions , particularly in the industrialized countries .
Many employers will frantically ax jobs in the coming months in an effort to improve their bottom lines .
Other companies will wield a scalpel to whittle out cost savings from employee perks .
A whopping 86 percent of companies expect recent financial market changes to affect employee benefits in the next year , according to a recent survey .
Here ’s a look at the where employers are likely to make cuts .
Layoffs .
Large employers , including Citigroup and Sun Microsystems , have already begun massive layoffs .
Americans lost 240,000 jobs in October .
And the current 6.5 percent unemployment rate is the highest since 2004 .
Analysts predict that many more layoffs are still to come .
A mid-October survey of 248 companies by the consulting firm Watson Wyatt found that 26 percent of employers expect to make layoffs in the next 12 months .
Hiring freezes .
Firms are likely to institute multiple cost - saving measures in tandem .
“ No single action here is going to help companies weather the storm , ” says Laura Sejen , global director of strategic rewards at Watson Wyatt .
“ Companies are looking at the full array of cuts they might make , and I think they are pulling a number of these triggers . ”
As an alternative or in addition to layoffs , companies may stop hiring new people and leave some vacant positions unfilled .
A quarter of the companies Watson Wyatt surveyed plan to freeze hiring in the next year .
Higher health costs .
Premiums for employer - sponsored health insurance climbed to $ 12,680 annually for family coverage this year .
Employees pay an average of $ 3,354 out of their paychecks to cover their share of the cost , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 2,832 companies .
“ Health insurance is steadily becoming less comprehensive , ” says Kaiser President and CEO Drew Altman .
“ With rising deductibles , more and more people face a substantial amount out of pocket for their healthcare before their insurance fully kicks in . ”
About 18 percent of employees currently have deductibles of at least $ 1,000 , up from 12 percent last year .
And 25 percent of companies plan to increase employee contributions to health insurance in the next year , Watson Wyatt found .
Travel restrictions .
Extravagant company travel may be a thing of the past in many industries .
Some 34 percent of companies have already added or increased restrictions to the company travel policy , and an additional 25 percent plan to do so soon .
Some companies are cracking down on nonessential travel and increasing Internet and teleconferencing as an alternative to meetings in person .
Many employees are also being encouraged or required to use public transportation for local trips and book economy flights for necessary travel .
Training cuts .
Helping employees to develop advanced skills usually helps the bottom line of a company .
But on - the - job training is expensive and time intensive , and immediate results are not always realized .
Some 18 percent of companies plan to reduce or eliminate training for employees .
Keeping your skills up to date on your own , however , could help keep you employed .
Canceled parties .
Most industries are n’t feeling very jolly this year .
About 19 percent of companies have either downgraded or canceled the holiday party , and an additional 18 percent plan to , Watson Wyatt found .
A handful of companies -- mostly manufacturing firms -- even plan to institute mandatory holiday shutdowns to save on operating expenses .
Salary freezes .
Workers used to getting an annual cost - of - living raise may be out of luck next year .
Four percent of companies have already frozen salaries and 12 percent more plan to .
“ As a cost - saving measure , it can have a fairly significant impact in terms of managing increases in cost , ” says Sejen .
“ Typically , it would be for 12 months , and then the organization would revisit the decision . ”
Reduced merit increases .
Do n’t count on getting a large holiday bonus or merit pay increase next year either .
Approximately 28 percent of employers have already reduced their merit pay budgets because of recent financial events .
Among those employers , the projected raise is now 2.5 percent for 2009 , down from 3.7 percent .
Pension freezes .
Many companies no longer want to bear the burden of providing traditional pensions for employees .
Sometimes companies stop allowing new employees to join the plan .
Other firms promise to pay the benefits already accrued but do n’t allow workers to earn any additional benefits .
Some 11 percent of companies have already frozen their pension plans and an additional 4 percent plan to do so in the next year , Watson Wyatt found .
Marty Lederman joins the Office of Legal Counsel JB Some of you may have noticed that Marty Lederman has not been blogging recently at Balkinization .
The reason is that he has been working on the Department of Justice Transition team .
As of today , the commencement of the Obama Administration , he begins work as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel .
There he will be joined by two of his former OLC colleagues , Dawn Johnsen , nominated to be head of the office ; and David Barron , who will serve as the Principal Deputy ( and as the Acting AAG while the Senate considers Dawn ’s nomination ) .
Both Dawn and David have been guest bloggers on Balkinization and I have also had the pleasure of being a co-blogger with Dawn , David and Marty on Slate 's former legal blog Convictions .
You may also recall that Marty and David are the co-authors of two splendid ( and definitive ) articles on the Commander - in - Chief power in the Harvard Law Review .
I have known Dawn , David , and Marty for years and think very highly of their legal skills , and more importantly , their judgment .
I think that all three will do a splendid job in their new positions and I wish them every success .
Needless to say , I am very pleased for the country by Marty 's new job .
I do not exaggerate when I say that Marty is one of the finest lawyers I know , and there is perhaps no better time to put his remarkable talents to use in helping to reform a Justice Department that so badly needs reform .
Yet there is also a little sadness to this announcement , for Marty has been an integral part of this blog since he began writing on the torture memos in late 2005 .
He has the rare talent of being both a first class lawyer and a first class legal blogger .
Things will not be the same without his amazingly sophisticated , detailed and cutting - edge legal analysis .
We at Balkinization send Marty all our of our good wishes and wish him the greatest of success in the OLC .
We will keep his place for him here , awaiting the day when he finishes his service to our country and returns to private life .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The economy shed 533,000 jobs in November , according to a government report Friday - bringing the year 's total job losses to 1.9 million .
November had the largest monthly job loss total since December 1974 .
" This is a dismal jobs report , " said Keith Hall , commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , at a congressional hearing .
" There 's very little in this report that 's positive .
This is maybe one of the worst jobs reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( founded in 1884 ) has ever produced . "
The number of jobs lost in the current recession , which began in December 2007 , surpasses the 1.6 million jobs lost in the 2001 recession .
The job market expansion leading out of that recession was drawn out and tepid , so the jobs lost now are more at the core of the nation 's economy - a scary sign .
According to the Labor Department 's monthly jobs report , the unemployment rate rose to 6.7 % from 6.5 % in October .
The rate is compiled in a separate survey from the payroll number .
Revisions
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 325,000 jobs in the month .
Revisions to the two prior months brought more dismal news .
October 's job loss was revised up to 320,000 from 240,000 , and September was revised up to 403,000 .
The revisions brought the 3 - month job loss total to 1.3 million .
November 's report provided the first glimpse at employers ' reaction after the peak of the credit crisis , reached in mid-October .
With credit largely unavailable and expensive , consumers scaled back their spending , dragging down manufacturing and construction businesses .
Travel has also been scaled back .
As a result , job losses were spread across a wide variety of industries : manufacturing , leisure and hospitality , construction and even , in the midst of the holiday shopping season , retail .
Also seeing sharp declines were professional and business services , a category seen by some economists as a proxy for overall economic activity , and financial services , at the heart of the current crisis .
Deeper cuts likely to come
With the economy in a recession and most economic indicators signaling even more difficult times ahead , economists say job losses will likely deepen and continue through at least the first half of 2009 .
Citing weak economic conditions , a slew of large - scale job - cut announcements came this week .
On Thursday alone , AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) , DuPont ( DD , Fortune 500 ) , Viacom ( VIA ) , Credit Suisse ( CS ) and Avis ( CAR , Fortune 500 ) announced cuts that totaled nearly 23,000 cuts , most of which will take place over the next several months .
According to a report by the outsourcing agency Challenger , Gray & Christmas , planned job cut announcements by U.S. employers soared to 181,671 last month , the second - highest total on record .
Temporary employment , including workers employed by temp agencies , fell by 100,700 jobs last month , the highest on records that go back to 1985 .
That could mean even more full - time payroll reductions to come , as employers often cut temporary workers before they begin cutting permanent staff .
Tig Gilliam , chief executive of placement agency Adecco , the nation 's third - largest employment agency , said employers are trying to position their companies to weather the ever intensifying economic storm .
" CEOs are trying to get their businesses better positioned for the start of the year so they 're not constantly chasing the slowdown " he said .
" December will be another very tough month . "
In another sign of weakness , a growing number of workers were unable to find jobs with the amount of hours they want to work .
Those working part - time jobs - because they could n't find full - time work , or their hours had been cut back due to slack conditions - jumped by 621,000 people to 7.3 million , the highest ever on records that date back to 1955 .
Underemployment at 12.5 %
The so - called under - employment rate , which counts those part - time workers , as well as those without jobs who have become discouraged and stopped looking for work , soared to 12.5 % from 11.8 % .
But there was hiring in some economic sectors last month .
Government hiring has stayed strong throughout the downturn , adding another 7,000 jobs in November .
Education and health services also grew payrolls , with a gain of 52,000 employees .
The average hourly work week fell to 33.5 hours last month .
Economists expected the workweek to hold at October 's level of 33.6 hours .
But with a modest 7 - cent gain in the average hourly salary , the average weekly paycheck rose by 52 cents to $ 613.05 .
Obama : Time for stimulus
With 2008 already the worst year for jobs since 1982 and on pace to become the worst since 1945 - and second worst on records that date back to 1939 - support for a second stimulus package to boost the job market has grown among economists and lawmakers .
The prior stimulus package , in the spring , sent tax rebate checks to millions of tax filers .
It helped the economy grow in the second quarter , but it did little to stem the tide of job loss in the country .
But the proposed stimulus package , supported by President - elect Barack Obama , would focus on aid states and municipalities as well as consumers , adding millions of infrastructure jobs for Americans .
" Our economy has already lost nearly 2 million jobs during this recession , which is why we need an Economic Recovery Plan that will save or create at least 2.5 million more jobs over two years , " said Obama in a statement .
" There are no quick or easy fixes to this crisis , which has been many years in the making , and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better . "
Experts say a two - part stimulus package is the right way to stem the tide of mounting job losses .
" First , you have to get consumers to spend , since 70 % of the GDP is tied to consumer spending , and then you need job stimulus like highway projects to maintain economic job growth , " said Gilliam .
" This number is so bad that Obama will have to do something drastic soon . "
In the meantime , Bush administration officials say the priority remains restoring liquidity to the financial system .
" We have to get the job done that we can while we have time left in office , and that is restoring credit , " Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez told CNNMoney.com .
" This is the key first step to restoring growth and restoring jobs . "
The White House echoed the Commerce secretary .
" We need to focus on the causes of the economic downturn in order to reverse this trend in job creation , said Dana Perino , White House press secretary .
" We intend to continue our aggressive efforts to restore health to our credit and housing markets . "

What Kind of Person Actually Responds To Spam Mail ?
Filed under : December 8 , 2008 , 11:13 amFiled under : Humor
It ’s a thought I ’m sure that you ’ve had at one time or another .
Let me set the scene , you ’ve just woken up and half drowsily , you check your email , only to see a flood of emails with promises of impossibly easy to obtain college degrees , cheap replica Rolex watches , and enhancements for bodily parts you do n’t even have , and you wonder to yourself , “ what kind of person actually buys into this crap ? ” .
Naturally , the logical conclusion that comes to your mind is an idiot , a complete and utter idiot .
The thing is , you have to be a little more specific , since the complete and utter idiot demographic is surprisingly large compared to the ridiculously dismal amount of spam that is actually responded to .
A recent study mentioned here estimated that only 1 in approximately 12500000 spam letters actually derive a response , yet the spammers still make a profit , and it is directly because of that one person that the other 12499999 of us have to suffer .
So to mutually help the spammers target their desired massive idiot demographic at the same time as help them target less of us normal idiots , I have undertaken a quest to find out exactly what kind of person would respond to spam mail and give spammers a little help on their line of sight .
Okay , let ’s take the most infamous case of spam email , the Viagra spelled in a million different ways to avoid spam filters type ( Sorry , no Cialis ) .
Let ’s work this out by simple deduction , take or leave a few numbers … or digits … or accurate information , you get the idea .
Trust me , I ’d love to know as much as you do , but I have n’t quite figured out how to make contact with the Illuminati just yet .
Okay then !
Our “ Spam Magnet ” should logically possess the following traits :
Be male : Unless she is a woman who is deeply unsatisfied with her husband or forgot what gender she belonged to long enough to desire Viagra .
Unless she is a woman who is deeply unsatisfied with her husband or forgot what gender she belonged to long enough to desire Viagra .

Know what Viagra is : Further more , know about three thousand different ways to spell it along with the word “ pharmacy ” .

Makes it also difficult to type as well Okay , this is getting ridiculous : I know what you mean .
Now , this might all be confusing at first , but it all makes perfect sense when you think about it .
As logic would conclude , our Spam Magnet must be among one of these three archetypes :
A . A borderline bankrupt delusional former DRM developer and high school drop out in his late thirties who has lost all meaning to life , likes colorful , shiny objects and lives in a deluxe cardboard box # 23 with a mail box next to it , owns a stolen laptop , siphons Wi-Fi off of the neighbors and has just lost a girlfriend due to male inadequacies and is not high or drunk at the time , but just happens to accidentally get his inbox mixed up with his spam folder .
Having a gun pointed to his head by the Lochness Monster is a probable factor , and likes to write long run on sentences with poor paragraph breaking skills is a necessity .
B. A person who responds to spam for the sake of responding to spam .
C. The Lochness Monster
Now , using all of this incredibly useful data , I have constructed the most diabolically effective spam letter imaginable : .

In addition to the personal attacks on seed cleaners , Monsanto is getting laws put into place that themselves are overwhelming and destructive of seed cleaners and all those who save normal seeds .
http://www.ethicalinvesting.com/monsanto/news/10040.htm
If Monsanto can eliminate seed cleaners , they would have accomplished a TOTAL monopoly in the Midwest , the bread basket of the world , and they would control world food , feed and now bio - fuel prices at will .
They would , as well , have broken the fragile dam that seed cleaners and seed bankers now provide against the insanely - fast and just plain insane on - coming tide genetic engineering .
And Monsanto is working closely with the FDA in redefining seeds as a potential health hazard , subject to bioterrorism , and under that rubric to create rules for importation ( controlling access )
Interim final rules on Prior Notice of Importation
rules for registering acceptable facilities ( setting up corporate standards for the storage seeds , threatening small farmers )
Interim final rules on Registration of Food Facilities rules for talking police control of the seeds ( allowing for raids on farmers )
Final rules on Administrative Detention and rules for a level of record keeping almost impossible for small farmers and ordinary people to achieve .
Upcoming final rule on Establishment and Maintenance of Records .
" These new rules will allow FDA to better identify potentially dangerous foods , as well as respond more quickly to new threats and to handle foodborne illness outbreaks more efficiently . "
Using the Bioterrorism Act and the Food Emergency Response Network ( FERN ) , the FDA now has a focus on seeds which includes
Prevention ( federal and state surveillance sampling programs to monitor the food supply )
Preparedness ( strengthen laboratory capacity and capabilities )
Response ( surge capacity to handle terrorist attacks or a national emergency involving the food supply ) , and
Recovery ( support recalls , seizures , and disposal of contaminated food or feed to restore confidence in the food supply ) .
For those of you painfully familiar with what is happening to real milk dairy farmers and the government use of false " contamination " reports to raid farms , steal products ad equipment and terrorize and destroy farmers , it will be important to see how " bioterrorism " has now moved control over normal food even more tightly into the hands of government / corporate agencies , giving them national reach , crushing regulations for farmers , immense policing power over food , and the use of an emergency to be able to seize and destroy anything they choose .
At the level of seeds , it is important note that Monsanto is promoting every part of this .
http://www.fda.gov/oc/speeches/2004/asta0629.html
The laboratories that FERN uses represent the FDA , FSIS , the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Defense , Bureau of Customs and Border Protection , the Agricultural Marketing Service , the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , and the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Agency .
Other federal members of the FERN include the Agricultural Research Service , the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and the Department of Homeland Security , the Laboratory Response Network ( LRN ) and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network ( NAHLN ) .
The FDA talks about " a safety net " for human health but it is one defined by corporation and one that is closing on small farmers ' existence .
And even the FDA 's basic food safety is being " set " in a way aimed to destroy seed cleaners and ( if you will notice in the short list below ) organic farming itself .
FDA 's guidance on good agricultural practices ( GAPs ) can be found in the
FDA Guide to Minimize Microbial Hazards for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables
After years of jabbing Microsoft for the seeming need to run antivirus software on Windows , Apple has quietly posted its own recommendation for similar security with its own operating system .
The knowledge base article , posted roughly a week and a half ago , does n't go so far as to say the software is necessary but still advocates " widespread use " of more than one antivirus package to minimize security risks .
By using more than one piece of security software , virus writers can't assume that there will be a particular security suite to bypass , Apple says .
In Windows , more advanced viruses already know to look for certain defense suites and will mask themselves or even disable the protection to make their tasks easier .
Apple currently recommends Intego's VirusBarrier X5 , McAfee 's VirusScan for Mac , and Symantec 's Norton Anti-Virus 11 .
The posting is n't necessarily a reversal of opinions for Apple , though it does reflect an overall softening of its opinions .
While one of the first " Get a Mac " TV spots in 2006 made fun of Windows ' susceptibility to viruses and portrayed the Mac as near - immune , the current campaign does n't mention this point .
The company 's current FAQ for curious switchers also simply says that Mac OS X " resists most viruses " and does n't make any blanket statements .
' Joe the Plumber ' says journalists should be ' abolished ' from war coverage Nick Cargo
Published : Sunday January 11 , 2009
Print This Email This On Sunday , conservative media barnacle and McCain campaign relic Samuel " Joe " Wurzelbacher took time out of his new job as a war correspondent for Pajamas TV to tell the very people who were filming him that they should n't be allowed to cover war :
" I 'll be honest with you : I do n't think journalists should be anywhere allowed war .
( sic ) I mean , you guys report where our troops are at .
You report what 's happening day to day .
You make a big deal out of it .
I think it 's asinine .
You know , I liked back in World War I and World War II when you 'd go to the theater and you 'd see your troops on , you know , the screen and everyone would be real excited and happy for 'em .
Now everyone 's got an opinion and wants to ... down soldiers .
You know , American soldiers or Israeli soldiers ... I think media should be abolished from , uh , you know , reporting .
You know , war is hell .
And if you 're gonna sit there and say , ' Well , look at this atrocity , ' well , you do n't know the whole story behind it half the time .
So I think the media should have no business in it . "

The administration area of a Web application is a favorite target of hackers and thus particularly well protected .
The same goes for WordPress : when creating a blog , the system creates an administrative user with a perfectly secure password and blocks public access to the settings area with a log - in page .
This is the cornerstone of its protection .
The administration area of a Web application is a favorite target of hackers and thus particularly well protected .
The same goes for WordPress : when creating a blog , the system creates an administrative user with a perfectly secure password and blocks public access to the settings area with a log - in page .
This is the cornerstone of its protection .
Let ’s dig deeper !
This article focuses on defending the administration area of WordPress , meaning all those pages in the wp-admin folder ( or http://www.yourblog.com/wp-admin/) that are displayed after a user a verified .
We highlighted the phrase “ after a user is verified ” deliberately : it should be explicitly understood that only a simple query stands in the way of an evil hacker and the powerful admin area of your whole blog .
The latter is only as strong as the passwords that are generated .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
To make an attack more difficult , you should perform the following actions manually .
These solutions do not guarantee 100 % security , but you can create effective stumbling blocks on a hacker ’s way to the administration area .
1. Rename and Upload the wordpress Folder
Since version 2.6 , it has been possible to change the path of the wp- content directory .
Unfortunately , this is still not possible for the wp-admin directory .
Security - minded bloggers will just have to accept this fact and hope that this protection of their blog will be made possible in future versions .
Until then , the following recipe is a comparable alternative .
Upon extracting the zipped WordPress files , you ’ll see a folder named Wordpress .
This folder should be renamed ( ideally to something cryptic ) , and , after also adjusting the wp - config .
php file , uploaded to the root directory of the domain .
What does this change accomplish ?
First , the files will no longer be loose in the main directory , thus increasing the clarity of the root level .
Other files and folders will be found quicker .
Secondly , many WordPress instances can now be created and can be put parallel to each other without interfering with other system files and settings , making it perfect for testing and development .
The third advantage actually speaks to security : the admin area ( and the blog itself ) is no longer in the root domain and must first be found by robots .
It wo n’t be easy to find the path of this relocated log - in page , at least for a human .
Until then , this change will protect your blog .
Note :
If the system files of a WordPress blog are no longer in the main directory , and the name of the installation ’s main folder has been changed ( as recommended above ) , the blog can still be accessed from http://example.com.
How ?
In the WordPress address ( URL ) field under the general settings , include the path of the renamed folder .
For example , if the unzipped Wordpress folder is renamed to wordpress_live_Ts6 K , enter the path as http://example.com/wordpress_live_Ts6K.
Your blog address will remain beautiful and not distracting .
2. Extend the file wp - config.
php
The WordPress configuration file wp - config .php contains settings and access data for the database .
But security - related values can also be found in the file .
The following definitions must be in the wp - config .
php file ( but may not be ) and should be added or modified :
Security keys : Since WordPress 2.7 , WordPress has had four kinds of security keys , which must be set up properly .
WordPress saves you from having to come up the strings yourself by generating the lines of security keys automatically .
You just have to implement these security keys in your configuration file .
These keys are essential to the safety of your installed blog .

The table prefix of a newly created WordPress installation should not be the standard _wp__ .
The more cryptic the word , the less likely an intrusion into the MySQL database tables will occur .
Bad : _$table_prefix = ‘ wp ’ ;.
Much better : _$table_prefix = ‘ wp4FZ52Y ’; .
This value is assigned only once and you do n’t have to remember it because it has an internal function .

Much better : _$table_prefix = ‘ wp4FZ52Y ’; .
This value is assigned only once and you do n’t have to remember it because it has an internal function .
If the server has SSL encryption available , it is recommended to encrypt the administration area .
This can be done by adding the following command to the wp - config .
php file : _define ( ’ FORCE_SSLADMIN’ , true ) ;
available , it is recommended to encrypt the administration area .
This can be done by adding the following command to the wp - config .
php file : _define ( ’ FORCE_SSLADMIN’ , true ) ;
In addition , you can adjust other system settings in the configuration file .
A clear and comprehensive list of settings for greater safety and performance can be found in the WordPress Codex .
3 . Move the wp - config . php file
Also since version 2.6 , WordPress allows you to move the wp - config .
php file to a higher level .
Because this system file contains by far more sensitive information than any other , and because it is difficult to access the parent file server level , it certainly makes sense to store it outside of the actual installation .
WordPress automatically looks at the highest underlying index for the configuration settings file .
Any attempt by users to adjust the path is thus useless .
4. Protect the wp - config. php file
Not all ISPs , though , allow you to transfer data to a higher level than the main directory .
Administrators cannot always execute the previous step if they do not have this privilege .
In this case , external access to the wp - config . php file can be excluded via the .htaccess file .
It is important to make sure that the .htaccess file , with this built - in protection , shares the same directory as the wp - config .
php file .
Incidentally , this technique would also be useful if you use multiple WordPress installations but are not allowed to relocate the relevant configuration files .
5 . Delete the admin User Account
When WordPress is installed , an administrator acount with the username admin is automatically created , without any options set .
This is a well - intended gesture by WordPress , but a default user with administrative rights and an assigned ID of # 1 is an easy target for hackers .
In an attack , only the password of this user would have to be broken .
Hence our advice :
Create another administrator in the admin area .
Log out of the back end .
Log in as the new user .
Delete the old admin from the user list .
A second user gives greater security : that name will be displayed in all future published articles and commentaries , and the name of the actual administrator will never be displayed on blog pages and therefore never communicated to the outside world .
6 . Choose strong passwords
The probability and frequency of attack increases in proportion to the popularity of the blog .
And when the back end of a WordPress blog is skillfully attacked , you have to be sure there are no weak links in the chain of security .
More often than not , passwords are the weakest link in this chain .
The reason ?
The way that passwords are usually handled or chosen is too reckless .
Numerous studies show that miserably vast numbers of passwords contain too few characters and are too easily guessed .
WordPress responded to this problem with an intuitive indicator , based on a traffic - light visual , that displays the strength of a user ’s desired password .
Inexplicably , though , this tool is only available for existing profiles ( found under Settings > Users > Your profile ) .
If the administrator creates new users , then password strength is not communicated visually .
Our recommendation for a secure WordPress password is that it be at least seven characters long and include uppercase and lowercase characters , numbers and symbols such as ! ” ? $ % ^ & ) .
7. Protect the wp-admin Directory
Adhering to the motto “ Two are better than one , ” the administration area is equipped with additional password protection .
The query ( in WordPress otherwise responsible for Permalinks ) is handled by .htaccess , which is stored in the wp - admin folder along with .htpasswd .
After making this change , the browser will ask for the data stored in .htaccess .
This can be different for each blog author or the same for everyone .
Note : the Htaccess and Htpasswd generator helps to create the necessary files with desired values .
8. Suppress Error Feedback on the Log - In Page
The log - in page of a WordPress installation is the door to the administration area .
The administration area is only accessible upon error - free verification .
Until successfully logging in , visitors — whether good or bad — have countless attempts to enter the correct data in the log - in fields .
In case of a failed attempt , WordPress communicates to the user what the problem might be .
When troubleshooting , WordPress is really fussy and provides a unique , meaningful message for each error .
So if a user name is typed incorrectly , that will be communicated .
If the password is wrong , that will be also communicated .
This is a comfort for the user and a blessing for the thief .
Unintentionally , WordPress provides valuable feedback to the bad boys who are trying to access your data .
It ’s just a matter of time until they gain access to the back end .
A simple one - liner solves this problem cleverly :
The output of the error on the log - in page is simply blocked to looters .
This code goes in the functions .
php file of your theme :
add_filter(‘login_errors ’, create_function ( ‘$ a’ , “ return null ; ” ) ) ;
9. Restrict Erroneous Log -In Attempts
WordPress keeps no record of failed attempts to log in , much to the detriment of the blog administrator , who does n’t see the insidious attack coming and so ca n’t gather the tools to combat the threat .
Is there a way out of this dilemma ?
Two solutions exist : Login LockDown and Limit Login Attempts .
Upon being installed , they record all log - in attempts .
Furthermore , both extensions can lock out visitors for a specified time after a certain number of failed attempts .
Thus , robots and hackers are limited in the scale of their attack .
The extensions are free and compatible with WordPress 2.7 .
Finally , the following should be stated : WordPress developers are very fast and react immediately to vulnerabilities in WordPress .
Keep your installations up to date .
Since version 2.7 , available updates are just a click away .
The same goes for plug-ins !
And remember : less is more .
As an administrator , you should ensure that only the extensions that are necessary are active in your installation .
Every plug - in is a potential risk and should be inactive or , better yet , removed if it is not needed .
LOS ANGELES , Dec. 6 ( UPI ) -- U.S. rock guitarist Joe Satriani says the group Coldplay lifted parts of an instrumental he composed and used them in its hit song " Viva La Vida . "
Satriani filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , saying the Coldplay song -- a key track on its latest album , " Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends " -- was substantially plagiarized from his 2004 instrumental " If I Could Fly , " the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday .

The Coldplay song was nominated Wednesday for song and record of the year Grammys by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences , the newspaper said .
Satriani is a virtuoso rock ' n ' roll guitarist who has been recording steadily since 1986 .
The suit seeks a jury trial and profits from Coldplay , which credited all four band members -- Chris Martin , Guy Berryman , Will Champion and Jonny Buckland -- as the authors of " Viva La Vida , " the Tribune said .

Netbooks represent the latest consumer electronics craze .
They 're small , they 're portable , they 're dirt cheap , and , in 2008 , consumers bought somewhere in excess of 14 million of them .
At last week 's CES , all the major players introduced new netbooks , stimulated by that consumer demand : Sony introduced the Pocket P ; HP debuted the Mini Mii ; Asus brought out its S121 with a 512 GB solid state drive .
Power users are often skeptical of small , underpowered devices and we at Ars can understand that .
Now that CES is over , here are five points to consider that might change your mind about netbooks and how you might use one .
Netbooks do n't have to be your primary computer
Almost no one buys a netbook as their primary system .
Netbook sales appear to be filling a niche for secondary computers that let you hit the road with the bare minimum of computing hardware .
That 's made possible by a new wave of applications that do n't care what platform you 're computing on , so long as you can authenticate yourself .
Between clever syncing strategies , Exchange - like servers , and web - hosted applications , your data no longer care if you 're at the office on a PC , on the go with your primary laptop , or on a netbook .
You can check in at work and do some light - weight computing at meetings , with a platform that offers more flexibility than a smart phone and less overhead than a traditional laptop .
Netbooks augment rather than replace laptops when it comes to portable computing .
They 're not underpowered for what they really do
In the real world , laptops let you perform serious work and let you do so without a lot of compromise .
In the portable world , netbooks just are n't meant for that standard of computing .
The screen is small ; the keyboard is compromised ; the chip runs slow .
So consider them in the light of the activities that people use netbooks for : sending e-mail , browsing the net , enjoying multimedia , and chatting on the go .
In each of these domains , the netbook handles its job at a satisfying level , offering a significant improvement over any smartphone .
Even the smallest netbooks offer keyboards that are an order of magnitude better for typing than those found on phones — the best phones with pull - out keyboards simply cannot compete .
The same goes for screens .
Even the finest phone interfaces are limited by their screen space , which is at best about a quarter of the size of a typical netbook screen .
As for the clock speed , none of these tasks are particularly CPU intensive .
The popular Intel Atom processor is more than up to the task .
They 're sitting on the edge of a ubiquitous connectivity revolution
Netbooks are the perfect match for some form of built - in connectivity , although , in all honesty , they have yet to realize this potential .
Some netbooks currently ship with built - in 3G modems , notably those offered outside the US .
Sadly , the pricing of these connectivity plans is not in keeping with the " keep it cheap " netbook ethos .
In the US , RadioShack sells the Aspire One netbook for $ 99 provided one takes on a pricy $ 60 / month 3G data contract .
That works out to a cost of $ 1540 over the two - year lifetime of the contract , including the hardware itself .
To compare , the iPhone offers 3G data plus a very reasonable voice package starting at $ 70 / month , or $ 60 / month if you 're on a grandfathered plan .
The Radio Shack plan seems to be a tentative exploration of the netbook connectivity space that , if properly priced and promoted , could become huge .
For the moment , many netbook users are choosing to tether instead , sharing an internet connection on a smart phone rather than buying a netbook - specific data plan .
Tethering is a morally gray area , as many of the phones that are being used to tether with do not explicitly allow this in their contract terms and conditions .
Tethering also means you have to coordinate two devices ( instead of using hardware already built into a netbook ) and have to watch battery usage on both .
Tethering , you 'll be unsurprised to hear , can drain a phone 's battery very quickly .
This all having been said , the netbook 's strength lies in its amazing portability .
As built - in connectivity takes off ( and it will ) , netbooks will be able to offer their network - based applications regardless of whether users are traveling in a car on a highway or at a WiFi- enabled cafe hotspot .
And that is going to be a huge deal .
You can dock
As with any other laptop , netbooks are easily connected to peripherals thanks to standard USB and Ethernet connectivity .
You can bring your netbook home , dock it , and treat it as a secondary system .
Yes , you 're still limited by the modest but not unacceptable processor speed but , in all other ways , the netbook can bypass its normal limitations when brought into the office .
If the screen is too small , use a bigger screen .
Every netbook I have ever worked with could readily drive an external monitor at a respectable resolution .
Most allow you to create an extended desktop that spreads across both the internal monitor and the external one , creating an even greater workspace .
If you do n't like the size and feel of the built - in keyboard , you can use it with a full - sized external USB keyboard and mouse .
There 's no reason you have to compromise on typing when at your desk .
Should disk space be an issue , it 's simple to connect an external USB drive .
You can also network to your primary computer and share its disk resources , scanners , and printers , as well .
Just a small collection of peripherals , ready to dock to at your office , can transform a netbook to a system that 's just as useful at a desktop as it is on the go .
The price and size appeal is real
While you can argue that the price of regular laptops has plunged over the last few years , the netbook price point remains extremely appealing .
For a few hundred dollars , you can walk away with a portable computer that adds to , rather than replaces , your existing computing setup .
And , should that system fail , it 's a lot less expensive to replace .
You do n't have to buy special carrying luggage either , nor haul around lots of accessories the way most people do with laptops .
Netbooks can be used more casually and tucked into briefcases , handbags , and backpacks with less worry and overhead .
You 're rarely going to do the kind of long - term extended work on netbooks that you do with laptops , so power concerns are also diminished .
A full charge on a netbook easily gets you through a meeting and off and on use through an afternoon .
As a final appeal point , consumers find netbooks " cute . "
It may be a hideously embarrassing truth , but the netbook appeal goes well beyond businesses — a lot of soccer moms and grandparents are buying netbooks because they have a basic ownership appeal .
Netbooks work well for anyone who regularly moves around and wants to bring a certain level of computing with them .

John Bolton has been one of the most useless , counterproductive politician to come out of the Bush Administration ( closely following supreme incompetents like Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz ) .
Working as United States Ambassador to the United Nations back in 2005 , Bolton was famous for not actually believing in the United Nations and doing his best to undermine anything that used negotiation as a means to conflict resolution .
A prominent neo con and war monger , Bolton has been banging the drums for a war with Iran , a position so extreme even the Bush Administration has given up on it .
In a recent interview on Hannity and Colmes , Bolton stated his desire to use military force against Iran for its supposed attempts to build nuclear weapons , despite the fact that Iran is n't trying to develop nuclear weapons ( as verified by the CIA ) , a multi-trillion dollar deficit , an imploding economy , and being involved with two other wars .

" I would use military force against Iran 's nuclear program , " said Bolton , " Because I think the world gets a lot more dangerous once Iran gets nuclear weapons . "
Thankfully , Bolton is n't actually doing anything important these days other than appear on Fox News , so does n't hold any real sway .
But his ability to encourage stupidity should not be underestimated , and he should be carefully scrutinized whenever he opens his mouth .

Cleaning Up Tech : How To Recycle Old Electronics
September 15th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Every time I buy a new gadget it ’s like welcoming a new pet into the family .
You go to the store , select the perfect little tyke , and rush home to introduce it to your existing collection .
The best part ?
No jealousy among your older electronics : they ’re made to play together .
But electronics rarely last as long as a real pet .
As faithfully as it might serve you , within a few years it ’s time to put that gadget out to pasture .
This is your guide to the greenest pastures around .
Re-use
Good news !
If your electronic is still in good shape , you can sell it .
That ’s right , get a little something back for that expensive hardware .
Ecopreneurist has profiled two handy companies before :
Gazelle.com
TechForward
They will give you cash for your gadgets .
You can also try your luck Ebay ’s Rethink Initiative .
Not interested in the money ?
You can still donate or Freecycle your e-stuff .
Also try TechSoup.org .
Their site was undergoing maintenance when I wrote this article , but it comes highly recommended .
Recycle
With the digital TV transition looming in the USA and underway abroad , recycling old electronics that no one can use anymore is a very big deal .
Any BestBuy will take your old cellphones , rechargeable batteries and ink cartridges for free .
If you buy a new TV from them and have it delivered , they ’ll recycle your old TV for free .
Individual companies like Samsung , Nokia and Sony offer free recycling programs for their products internationally .
These companies have even earned kudos for their efforts from environmental groups .
The U.S. EPA has a complete list of corporate efforts for electronic recycling , and resources to find a local program .
For a quick search in your local area , try :
Earth911
The Electronics Take - Back Coalition
My Green Electronics
The European Union has the WEEE Directive to encourage proper e-waste disposal , but it ’s implemented differently in every country .
A quick Google search for your local area should get you started .
In Australia , try Recycling Near You .
In China , take - back programs started to be implemented in 2007 .
In India , check out the E - Waste guide or maybe the E - Exchange .
It ’s important that you sell or recycle your electronics instead of throwing them away .
Almost all electronics contain poisonous and valuable heavy metals and chemicals .
Since most items can be sold for reuse or recycled for free , it ’s easy to go green and recycle your gadgets .

Did you know that there are more than 7 - 8 million Muslims in the United States ?
Did you know that 98 % of them voted for Obama ?
Guess how many popular votes Obama won by ?
8,136,711 .
That means that Muslims could ’ve been the difference between this election being another Bush / Gore 2000 , rather than the Clinton / Bush 1992 that it turned out to be .
The funny thing about this election is that , while the majority of Muslims have historically voted Republican , this year , there seems to have been an overwhelming shift toward the Democratic Party .
As of this election , despite what the numbers indicate , two - thirds of Muslims still identified themselves as Democrats , while the other third identified themselves as Republican .
This means if Muslims voted along party lines , Obama would have still won , but by a much smaller popular margin .
McCain would be projected to have ~ 60.4 million popular votes and Obama would ’ve had ~ 63.3 million .
A smaller margin than the ~ 8.1 million popular votes that separated them on November 4th .
Now I know popular votes do n’t dictate the election results because of the electorate system .
Nevertheless I think the popular vote plays an important role in the perception of the President among the people , and is very telling of their confidence and trust in his leadership during times of crisis .
I ’m pretty sure we can all agree on how important it is to trust your head - of - state during times of crisis .
Look at what happened when confidence in Bush plummeted , nothing he said or did could regain the respect of the very people who voted him in power .
With that said , why did Muslims overwhelmingly vote for Obama ?
I mean , precluding a multitude of reasons like personality , charisma , and speech - writing ability .
It ’s something that has fascinated me , so I ’m going to take a look at his policy promises and political stances from the campaign that pertain to issues of foreign policy and national security , issues that are likely to hit closer to home for many American Muslims , and Muslims abroad .
Since there is a plethora of information regarding Obama ’s policies on the internet , I ’ll be splitting this post according to the issues , trying to dedicate a single post to a single issue , and will span this overview out over the course of the next 70 days , leading up to his swearing in .
So let ’s start with Obama ’s potential actions and policies towards Afghanistan .
Afghanistan
When the US went into Afghanistan in December of 2001 , Barack Obama was fresh off a defeat for his first bid to the U.S. House of Representatives .
He did n’t have a chance to participate in legislative measures concerning the planned action in Afghanistan .
So to speak on his stance on the conflict at that time is largely irrelevant to what he seemingly wants to accomplish there now .
Throughout his Presidential campaign , one of the things Obama stressed that I have advocated for is to phase troops out of Iraq and increase their numbers in Afghanistan .
Had the U.S. dedicated the same number of troops to Afghanistan that they did to Iraq , Afghanistan would be a much more stable nation right now .
With that said , Obama ’s policy requires increasing troop counts to weed out the Taliban and al - Qaeda , particularly along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , and to do so while allowing the Karzai Administration to expand their rule beyond Kabul .
Obama ’s policy would include sending two more troop brigades , increasing the total American non-ISAF troop levels by 7,000 to 25,000 .
He also favours the U.S. carrying a heavier military load than the NATO Allies .
While he does not oppose trying the approach taken in Iraq , where local tribesman were armed in an effort to have locals fight insurgents , he does not want to rely on such a policy as his primary mode of counter - insurgency .
He understands the situation on the ground in Afghanistan differs greatly from that of Iraq .
Even senior political analysts at RAND have echoed the sentiment that there is nothing to gain long - term from arming militias and tribesman .
One analyst , Christine Fair , said ‘ we are where we are today because we choose to outsource securing Afghanistan to [ people who are ] basically warlords .
There is no reason to believe that it will be successful , except in a very short - term definition of success . ’
Obama has stressed that the United States cannot continue its current policy towards Afghanistan .
He has indicated that it is a failed policy , when taking into account that it is the very policy responsible for the American intervention and quick pullout in the 1980’s , and is the same policy allowed the Taliban to take power , allowed al - Qaeda to establish a base , and created the current instability that exists today .
While Obama ’s policies regarding Afghanistan do not differ greatly from his election opponent , John McCain ; where Obama really separates himself is his understanding of the human aspect of the conflict .
He has emphasized , with criticism , that the U.S. needs to stop bombing and killing indiscriminately in Afghanistan , in efforts to kill what it believes are insurgents , but are turning out to be civilians .
He has repeatedly stressed the need for better intelligence , and more accurate and reliable information before conducting military operations .
He has said , “ We 've got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we 're not just air - raiding villages and killing civilians , which is causing enormous problems there ” .
The Washington Post even fact checked his remarks , and reported that the Associated Press count for civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2007 by militants was 231 , and civilian casualties resulting from Allied NATO bombings and air - raids was 286 .
So unlike President Bush , President - elect Obama has displayed an understanding of the reality for ordinary Afghans .
He has stated that to help decrease the military efforts he is going to negotiate and seek compromise wherever possible ; a welcome change to the ‘ kill them all and let God sort them out ’ policy that the Bush Administration has seemingly employed in conflict .
With regard to the people themselves , Obama has stated that he wants to increase non-military aid by $ 1 billion to help poppy - growers transform their crops into something else , although he has not indicated what they can transform their crops into .
Personally , I would suggest tea .
With a huge market for tea drinkers in South and Central Asia , a supply that can be shipped from closer locations than East Africa and Southern India could be beneficial to the overall economies of the area .
Obama has also urged Afghan government to improve governance , provide security and jobs to its people and to actively work to expand its reign beyond Kabul .
Because of the lack of central governance beyond the district of Kabul , the locals often refer to Karzai as the “ Mayor of Kabul ” .
Obama is seeking to help increase central power with the current Afghan government and discontinue the undercutting of its rule by local warlords .
Obama ’s most notable and controversial policy on Afghanistan centers around his insistence that there be more government - rule around the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , and that U.S. and NATO be allowed to chase al - Qaeda operatives who escape into Pakistan , if Pakistan ’s military is unable to catch them .
Obama has stated that this policy - change is necessary to completely eradicate al - Qaeda on both sides of the border .
He has tied his policy on Afghanistan to Pakistan , and is insisting on the establishment of more government control over the tribal regions .
He wants to do so while still remaining sensitive to the cultural values and local needs of the civilians with the hope that it will improve the perception of the United States amongst the Afghan people .
Obama also strongly believes that by strengthening Afghanistan economically and politically , military intervention will not become a primary necessity , like it has been the past 7 years .
So , in regards to his policy on Afghanistan , while I can’t speak for all Muslims , I think I can safely say that Obama is headed in the right direction in regards to Afghanistan , and that his approach to a solution to the conflict is refreshing .
Whether or not it will be a successful policy , however , remains to be seen , but I think with respect to how Muslims may feel about the conflict itself , it is certainly a step in the right direction .

ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wal - Mart - expected to benefit this holiday season from its deep discounting in a tough economy - had its Black Friday marred when an employee was trampled to death as thousands of people rushed through the doors at the opening of the store in Valley Stream , N.Y .
Police said the man , identified as 34 - year - old Jdimytai Damour , was a temporary employee who lived in New York City 's borough of Queens .
In addition , police officials said a pregnant woman was taken to a local hospital , but was expected to be released Friday .
Video footage showed as many as a dozen people knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the Wal - Mart store , according to Nassau County Police detective Lt. Michael Fleming .
The employee was " stepped on by hundreds of people " as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd , Fleming said .
" We expected a large crowd this morning and added additional internal security , additional third party security , additional store associates and we worked closely with the Nassau County Police , " said Hank Mullany , Wal - Mart 's vice president for the Northeast , in a statement .
" Despite all of our precautions , this unfortunate event occurred . "
" Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those impacted , " he added , saying the company is cooperating with authorities in their investigation .
( Full story )
Around the nation , shoppers descended upon Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) en masse in hopes of scoring Black Friday discounts .
From New Jersey to Dallas , there were reports of hundreds of shoppers lining up before stores opened , looking for $ 2 DVDs and flat - panel TVs priced just under $ 400 .
At the Fairfax , Va. , location , the scene was social .
Hundreds queued up before doors opened at 5 a.m. , with some having arrived the night before in order to be among the first to shop .
" We skipped Thanksgiving dinner , " said 30 - year - old Arash Habiezadeh .
Wal - Mart , which operates more than 4,100 U.S. stores and 3,100 international locations , is expected to be a big winner this holiday season as its discounts resonate with budget - conscious shoppers .
The company has been aggressively courting customers by lowering its prices and introducing holiday - gift sections in stores .
" Even with the economy , you 've got to go with the deals , " said Robert Balboni of Centreville , Va. , while loading his shopping cart with a 42 - inch flat panel TV , a portable DVD player and a Philips 2GB MP3 player .
Wal - Mart has already shown signs of benefiting from the economic slowdown .
Same - store sales , or sales at retail stores open at least a year , gained 2.4 % in October , beating the company 's own forecast .
Overall , the U.S. retail sector is expected to endure one of its worst holiday seasons in years .
Sales are projected to climb just 2.2 % , according to the National Retail Federation , making it the weakest sales gain in six years .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India and Pakistan have ratcheted up their rhetoric over last month ’s Mumbai attacks , but analysts say a fourth war between the two nuclear - armed rivals remains unlikely .
Tensions are nonetheless running high after India warned its nationals Friday it was unsafe to travel to Pakistan and Islambad cancelled all army leave , leaving Washington to urge both sides not to increase tensions further .
Another attack on India launched by Pakistan - based militants , however , could see New Delhi act decisively .
Here is a look at some possible scenarios for India in event of war :
POLITICAL
- The Indian government faced widespread voter anger at the security and intelligence failures that led to the Mumbai attacks and must go to the polls by May .
A strong response could see people rally behind it .
The opposition BJP has made militant attacks a major campaign issue ahead of the general elections and has already indicated it would back the government if it chose to go to war .
However , the BJP has also been criticised in some quarters for being opportunistic in making terrorism an election issue .
India signed a landmark civilian nuclear cooperation deal with the United States earlier this year and might hope its growing political ties with Washington would get a further boost if it hit militant targets inside Pakistan with missiles and fighter jets .
But war would complicate the West ’s efforts to stabilise Afghanistan , a major priority for Washington and President - elect Barack Obama ’s new administration .
Some jihadi groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir have built ties with al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan ’s ethnic Pashtun tribal belt on the Afghan border .
SECURITY
- India lost 8,000 soldiers in the three wars it has already fought with Pakistan and would naturally not want to suffer more casualties if it began significant troop movements to its western border .
In case of war , India ’s big concern would be internal security .
Maoist guerrillas -- described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the biggest internal security threat -- could be expected to step up attacks , along with rebel groups in the northeast .
As India moves its troops guarding the India - China and Indo - Myanmar borders in the remote northeast to western India , militants could also use the vast gaps left behind to infiltrate into India .
Islamist militant groups could also use this opportunity to enter Indian territory from the fluid border with Bangladesh and carry out suicide strikes to further divert attention .
ECONOMY
- With India struggling to recover from the effects of a global economic meltdown , a war could mean a disaster for the country which , according to economic think tanks , would have to spend an estimated $ 3 billion on troop movements alone .
There would be an immediate effect on trade , with sea and air routes disrupted .
On the other hand , the manufacturing industry would gain as demand for war hardware would increase , providing more employment opportunities .

Advertisement Thai anti-government protesters have agreed to end their occupation of Bangkok 's airports , allowing thousands of stranded tourists to leave .
Passenger flights from the main international airport could resume as soon as 4 December , say correspondents .
Protests had shut down Thailand 's two main airports for more than a week .
The deal follows a court ruling that forced Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat to step down over election fraud and disbanded his governing party .
ESCALATING CONFLICT
September 2006 : Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra ousted in military coup February 2008 : Samak Sundaravej sworn in as prime minister August 2008 : PAD protesters occupy government buildings , demanding the government step down September 2008 : Mr Samak dismissed for violating conflict of interest law .
Somchai Wongsawat , Thaksin 's brother - in - law , becomes prime minister October 2008 : Thaksin given a two - year jail sentence for corruption in his absence 26 November 2008 : Anti-government protesters take control of Bangkok 's main airport 2 December 2008 : Thai court rules that PM Somchai should be banned from politics , and his party should be dissolved
Tough times for Thai economy Thai crisis exposes class struggle Q&A : Bangkok protests Extra planes for stranded Britons
The occupation had closed Suvarnabhumi international airport and the smaller domestic Don Mueang airport , stranding tens of thousands of foreign tourists and forcing them to scramble for alternative ways home .
Thailand 's important tourism industry was crippled and exports of everything from electronics to fresh food were either stopped or had to be switched to ships or transported to Malaysia to be flown out .
The leaders of the anti-government People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) said all their protests would end from 1000 ( 0300 GMT ) on 3 December .
There are conflicting reports as to when passenger flights from the two airports will resume , but they may begin as soon as 4 December , says the BBC's Quentin Sommerville at Suvarnabhumi airport .
The date signifies the importance in the crisis of Thailand 's King Bhumibol Adulyadej , whose birthday is celebrated on 5 December , our correspondent says .
Although now elderly and frail , the king is greatly revered by Thais and continues to be a powerful figurehead .
New coalition
The PAD declared victory after the constitutional court 's ruling forced the prime minister to step down .

" The People 's Alliance for Democracy has agreed to cease protesting after a long - running 192 - day campaign , " said Sondhi Limthongkul , one of the group 's leaders .
The nine - judge constitutional court found the People Power Party ( PPP ) , the Machima Thipatai party and the Chart Thai party guilty of vote - buying in the last general election , in 2007 .
The parties have been ordered to disband and their leaders have been barred from politics for five years .
Most of the PPP's MPs will retain their seats however , and they have said they will regroup and form a new coalition .
They said they would seek a parliamentary vote for a new prime minister on 8 December .
The court 's ruling came after months of PAD - led protests that have crippled the political process in Thailand .
They had vowed to continue their protests until the entire government stepped down .
They accused Mr Somchai 's administration of being corrupt and hostile to the much - revered monarchy , and too close to ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
The protests had forced a political crisis , revealing deep splits between the PAD - a loose alliance of royalists , businessmen and the urban middle class - and government supporters , who draw their strength from the rural north and north - east of Thailand .

Apple fans love speculating about imaginary new products almost as much as they love getting their hands on a brand - new MacBook Air .
But it 's easy to get carried away and take these speculative flights of fancy as true , or even as somewhat credible rumors .
The latest of these rumors is the $ 100 Walmart iPhone , such a preposterous proposition that we thought we'd take a look at the rather obvious reasons why Apple wo n't be stripping either the price or the capacity of its highly successful cellphone .
And while we 're at it , let 's debunk the Apple netbook and the Apple tablet , two other rumors that refuse to die .
$ 99 iPhone
Myth : According to the entire internet , Apple will , just after Christmas , sell a 4GB , $ 100 iPhone through Walmart .
The usual excuse is made : Apple needs to sell cheaper hardware in " these troubled times . "
Fact : Apple will in fact sell iPhones through Walmart , but they will be the same ones you can get elsewhere , and at the same price .
What every one of these analysts fails to understand is the Apple business model .
The company just does n't do cheap .
Look at it this way : Apple 's PC market share continues to grow .
The iPhone seems unstoppable .
The new " expensive " unibody MacBooks are doing just fine .
Why on earth would Apple undercut its own successful iPhone line with a cheap version ?
If it can sell as many $ 200 or even $ 300 iPhones as it likes , why sell a $ 100 one ?
The 4GB part of this rumor irks , also .
Name one other product line from Apple which has seen a memory decrease .
You can't .
The fact that Apple already discontinued the 4GB iPhone because the sales were slow compared to the 8GB model should tell us something .
Yes , there might be a 4GB , $ 100 iPhone .
It will be announced at the exact same time as a 5GB , HDD iPod .
With a physical clickwheel .
Mac Tablet
Myth : Some day soon , Apple will release a touchscreen Mac tablet .
It 'll be sort of like a Windows - based Tablet PC , except not lame .
Fact :
Let 's face it — a Mac tablet is basically an oversized iPod Touch .
And we love the persistence of this rumor , mostly because we would actually buy an oversized iPod Touch .
But we have the feeling that after an hour or so of playing , we 'd want to go outside — and the oversized iPod Touch would n't fit in our pocket .
We further imagine that we 'd soon hanker for a proper keyboard to get some work done .
The thing is , Apple already makes a tablet PC , and it is the current iPod Touch .
The other problem would be price .
How much would Apple charge for a tablet ?
It would have to be a lot more than the Touch , itself already an expensive little device at the high , 32 GB end .
What would you pay ?
$ 800 ?
$ 1,000 ?
That 's a little too much for such a specialist computer .
Mac Netbook
Myth : Apple is just about to release a super - light , super - cheap netbook .
Unlike the MacBook Air ( thin , light , but wide and expensive ) this will be small enough to fit into a purse and will cost less than $ 500 , just like an Eee PC or an MSI Wind .
Fact : Steve Jobs dismissed the netbook market as " nascent . "
This certainly does n't mean that Apple wo n't make one — Jobs has a history of denying entire product categories until Apple is ready to actually ship — but do n't expect an Apple netbook anytime soon .
Why ?
Apple almost never rushes products to market .
Look at any Apple success of the last few years and you 'll see not a brand - new product but a simpler , often better version of what has been around for a while .
The iPod was certainly not the first portable MP3 player , the iPhone was n't the first touchscreen smartphone , although in both cases you'd be forgiven for thinking so .
One day , I 'm sure , we 'll see a tiny MacBook with a proper keyboard and a trackpad you can actually use .
But it will be awhile , and it will probably cost more than the competition .
In the meantime , you can hack your own Mac netbook using an MSI Wind and a copy of OS X .
A volunteer at a US animal sanctuary has died after he was savaged by a 1,000 - pound liger - a rare cross between a lion and a tiger .
Peter Getz , 32 , suffered fatal puncture wounds in his neck and back as Rocky , who weighs twice that of an ordinary lion and is 20 times more powerful than a human , pounced on him during feeding time .
An investigation was under way last night into why Mr Getz , an accomplished big cat keeper , broke with protocol and entered Rocky 's enclosure at Safari 's Animal Sanctuary in Broken Arrow , Oklahoma .
Bleeding heavily , he hauled himself out of the enclosure with help from two fellow keepers but collapsed outside and was airlifted to hospital , where he died last night .
" This is just horrid , " said the sanctuary 's owner , Lori Ensign .
" We try to have all the procedures in place but for some reason they were n't followed this time .
In all my years we 've stressed that whatever you do , do n't open that gate . "
Rocky , who came to the sanctuary from a zoo in North Carolina that closed because it went broke , is so powerful that his toys were bowling balls and he would ordinarily be fed fresh meat via a pole poked through the fence .
But Ms Ensign also stated that when Rocky was younger , she would ride on his back and that he was playful and gentle .
Pictures on her website show her walking a tiger on a leash and bottle - feeding a cub .
Animal Planet host and wildlife expert Jeff Corwin said yesterday : " You 're talking about an animal that is 20 times more powerful than the human that was feeding it .
" This animal could have , by its nature , a very individualistic , nice , personality ... but one bad moment can be critical , if not lethal , to a human being . "
Ligers are a cross between a male lion and a female tiger and are the biggest of all big cats .
The non-profit Safari 's sanctuary is run by volunteers and regulated by state wildlife officials , who were investigating last night .
They will determine whether Rocky will have to be euthanised .
Eight years ago , a bear was reportedly put down after biting keepers at the refuge , which is home to around 200 rescued animals .
Mr Getz had volunteered there for over a year and had previously worked at Tulsa Zoo .
Dr Dan Danner , a local veterinarian who knew both the keeper and the liger , said : " Rocky is a big old baby , but if you 've got an offensive lineman and they get excited , they are going to chomp a little harder and get aggressive . "

The excuse for militarizing the inauguration is the same tired one trotted out for militarizing the country : 9/11 .
Ten thousand National Guardsmen , 7,500 active - duty soldiers , 25,000 cops from " 99 federal , state and local law - enforcement agencies . "
A city " honeycombed " with " communication command centers " spying on supposedly free Americans with 5,265 surveillance cameras .
And , as if we are n’t already up to our eyeballs in goons , an entire brigade of the US Army on call .
The cost for this hyperbolic hysteria ?
Hundreds of millions at a time when many taxpayers can’t scrape together the next month ’s mortgage .
All for an inauguration that has attracted no " specific threats . "
" Critics " contend that this is overkill .
Go figure .
The piranhas swarming the security food - chain beg to differ .
After all , they are n’t squandering their own money to guard against every conceivable threat , whether it ’s a discarded cigarette igniting Obama ’s hot air or the Almighty hurling a meteorite at DC ’s massed mountebanks .
Michael Chertoff , large intestine at the Department of Homeland Security , pompously assured CNN , " We are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th . "
Having turned Washington into an armed camp , this twit added , " You do n’t want to make this like an armed camp because it spoils the event itself . "
Then there ’s White House chief of staff Josh Bolton .
He equates dreaming up the remotest of risks and spending other people ’s money to prevent them with common courtesy : " In the post - 9/11 world , this is n’t just good manners , good government ; it ’s a national [ sic for ‘ homeland ’ ] security responsibility . "
Geez , Josh , get with the program .
Your boss has been tossing off the Nazi terminology for 8 years now : time you did , too .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The excuse for militarizing the inauguration is the same tired one trotted out for militarizing the country : 9/11 .
Gordon Johndroe is a spokesman for the National Security Council who apparently boasts as little historical perspective as Chertoff and Bolton do common sense : " … obviously the world is a substantially different place in 2009 , " he opined to CBS .
Yo , Gordie : politicians have ever embroiled their subjects in wars , attacks , ambushes , assaults , and incursions that invite reprisals .
Farmers in ancient Israel feared Philistine raids thanks to their kings ’ provocations ; medieval serfs huddled inside their lords ’ castles lest the enemies those lords made massacre them ; French and British settlers in the New World kept a musket within reach while plowing their fields .
9/11 was just another link in a very long chain , not the cataclysmic break Our Rulers allege .
Naturally , Gordie and his buddies understand none of this .
Nor do they see the irony in protecting politicians from us when we ’re the ones needing protection from them .
Some of our millions will pay everyone ’s favorite bureaucracy to strut about DC during the inauguration , searching the people footing its bills as though they ’re criminals .
Whoops , I misspeak : criminals usually merit the dignity of a warrant before a search commences .
Not so the throngs jamming the capital – who are guilty , I admit , but only of criminal stupidity .
Yet the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , steadfast stomper of the Fourth Amendment for the last 7 years , will take its war on the Constitution from the country ’s airports to its capital .
" TSA spokesman John Allen [ said ] … that 300 TSA workers from all over the country are being flown in to Washington , D.C. to work security for special events .
They will screen guests as though they were coming into the airport . "
Whoa-ho !
That oughta endanger everyone but good : these are the nitwits who ca n’t discern plastic props from weapons .
They actually called a bomb squad a few days ago when a screener uprooted a forgotten , fake grenade from an actor ’s bag at Los Angeles International Airport .
Said squad helpfully pointed out that " the weapon was n’t live because it did n’t have a firing pin or explosive . "
No matter .
" It was a practice grenade ; a prohibited item , " sniffed one of the TSA ’s leeches , Nico Melendez .
I hope but I doubt that he blushed and stammered while trying to excuse such lunacy .
You can say this for the TSA and the millions of Americans cheering an emperor who has no clothes : they certainly deserve one another .

Guess who 's getting tired of being locked up in his East 64th Street penthouse , instead of jail ?
The Post reports that $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff has , according to a source , complained about his gilded cage , whining , " I 'm a prisoner in my own house !
I can't go anywhere !
I 'm stuck here all day ! "
Tell it to the judge who allowed you to stay at home !
And lest you think Madoff can surf the Internet ( and , you know , read celebrity gossip and transfer funds to off - shore accounts ) , his web and phone habits are being tracked .
Federal investigators are going through documents at a warehouse in East Elmhurst , Queens .
Earlier this week ,
The Daily Beast 's Lucinda Franks said there were 20 million pages of documents in the warehouse and reported it 's believed Madoff 's wife Ruth helped him with fake bookkeeping to keep the scam going , " No one could create that amount of paper without considerable help . "
And speaking of Ruth Madoff , her father Saul Alpern " referred friends and their relatives who spent winters in North Miami Beach and summers at the Sunny Oaks Hotel in New York ’s Catskill Mountains in the 1960s , " Bloomberg News reports .
Sunny Oaks owner Cynthia Arenson , who lost $ 1.25 million with Madoff , said the scammer " was doing very well .
Would n’t you encourage your friends to invest with him ?
Sometimes they got 18 percent , sometimes they got 19 percent . ”
The NY Times has an interesting article on how JPMorgan Chase pulled out of hedge funds that invested in Madoff .
While the bank 's Madoff - related losses are " pretty close to zero , " the Times reports , " The bank did not notify investors of its move , and several of them are furious that it protected itself but left them holding notes that the bank itself now says are probably worthless .
KIWANJA , Congo 
At last the bullets had stopped , and François Kambere Siviri made a dash for the door .
After hiding all night from firefights between rebels and a government - allied militia over this small but strategic town , he was desperate to get to the latrine a few feet away .
“ Pow , pow , pow , ” said his widowed mother , Ludia Kavira Nzuva , recounting how the rebels killed her 25 - year - old son just outside her front door .
As they abandoned his bloodied corpse , she said , one turned to her and declared , “ Voilà , here is your gift . ”
In little more than 24 hours , at least 150 people would be dead , most of them young men , summarily executed by the rebels last month as they tightened their grip over parts of eastern Congo , according to witnesses and human - rights investigators .
And yet , as the killings took place , a contingent of about 100 United Nations peacekeepers was less than a mile away , struggling to understand what was happening outside the gates of its base .
The peacekeepers were short of equipment and men , United Nations officials said , and they were focusing on evacuating frightened aid workers and searching for a foreign journalist who had been kidnapped .
Already overwhelmed , officials said , they had no intelligence capabilities or even an interpreter who could speak the necessary languages .

Republican presidential candidate John McCain has become embroiled in a war of words with racial undertones after clashing with a civil rights icon .
John Lewis accused Mr McCain 's campaign of " sowing hatred " against opponent Barack Obama and said he was reminded of 1960s segregationist George Wallace .
Mr McCain , who recently said Mr Lewis was one of his most admired Americans , called the reference " beyond the pale " .
Mr McCain has also tried to cool his supporters ' resentment of Mr Obama .
In Minnesota on Friday , Mr McCain defended Mr Obama after some at the town hall meeting labelled him a " terrorist " , " an Arab " , a " traitor " and a candidate who inspired fear .
The Republican 's campaign has also suffered from a legislative probe in Alaska that found his vice - presidential running mate and state governor , Sarah Palin , had abused her power .
With just over three weeks to go to the election , she has again denied any wrongdoing in the affair .
Rally boos Democratic Congressman Lewis is considered one of the key figures of the civil rights movement .
He said : " Senator McCain and Governor Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all . "
My statement was a reminder to all Americans that toxic language can lead to destructive behaviour
John Lewis
Economy may deflect Palin probe Mr Lewis said the " sowing of seeds of hatred and division " reminded him of Alabama Governor Wallace 's rhetoric in 1963 that was blamed for a church bomb attack that killed four young girls .
Mr McCain reacted angrily , calling the reference " shocking and beyond the pale " .
" I am saddened that John Lewis , a man I 've always admired , would make such a brazen and baseless attack on my character , " he said .
Mr Lewis later said his reference was not a direct one , but was simply pointing out that " toxic language can lead to destructive behaviour " .
He also welcomed Mr McCain 's attempts to cool angry supporters at Republican rallies .
At the Minnesota meeting , Mr McCain said Mr Obama was a decent family man and voters should not be afraid of him , but drew boos for defending him .
The Obama campaign quickly said it did not believe Mr McCain 's campaign was in any way comparable to Wallace .
Abortion attack
The McCain campaign has targeted Mr Obama over his alleged links to 1960s militant William Ayers .
Mrs Palin said Mr Obama was " palling around with terrorists " .
On Saturday , Mrs Palin defended herself against the findings of the Alaskan investigation .
It found she had abused her power by allowing her husband to put pressure on officials to sack her former brother - in - law , a state trooper who was in a bitter custody battle with her sister .
Asked by a journalist in Pennsylvania if the accusations were correct , she said : " No , and if you read the report you will see that there was nothing unlawful or unethical about it . "
The report said Mrs Palin failed to act to stop her husband contacting the officials in the case known as Troopergate .
Mrs Palin on Saturday stepped up her attacks on Mr Obama , calling him a pro-abortion radical .
" He hopes you wo n't notice how radical , absolutely radical , his ideas on this and his record is until it's too late , " she said .

What are these ?
Choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate was apparently meant to accomplish the following :
# Rally the conservative base without alienating the center .
#
Increase support among white women , many of whom may have been disappointed by Senator Clinton 's loss # Defend against Obama 's framing himself as the Change candidate and McCain as a third term of George W Bush .
Reposition the campaign with McCain and Palin as the Reformers and Obama / Biden as the Establishment .
# Generate a lot of excitement and press coverage .
He seems to have succeeded in all of these points .

BlackBerry maker Research In Motion ( RIMM ) says its latest gadget , the BlackBerry Storm , is selling well , and is Verizon 's ( VZ ) best selling phone .
This despite many crappy reviews and anecdotal stories of mass returns .
( Which Verizon denies . )
Wonder why people are rushing to buy a phone many people think is a hairball ?
Because Verizon subs basically have no choice .
Thanks in large part to the buzz Apple 's ( AAPL ) superior iPhone has generated , consumers want to buy touchscreen smartphones this year and ditch their Motorola ( MOT ) Razrs .
And for those tens of millions of people on long - term Verizon contracts -- or Verizon family plans , or Verizon loyalists -- who want a smartphone but can't switch to AT&T ( T ) for the iPhone , the BlackBerry Storm is their least - bad option .
Check out the other smartphones and touchscreen phones Verizon is offering this Christmas .
Most are either running no -name operating systems or Microsoft's ( MSFT ) clunky Windows Mobile .

Microsoft's ( MSFT ) ad agency has finally cooked up something cool -- retro t- shirts we might actually buy .
AdAge : Microsoft is going from marketing computer programs to making clothes , with a new line of graphic tees dubbed " Softwear by Microsoft . "
" Softwear , " instead of software .
Get it ?
It 's no surprise that Crispin Porter & Bogusky — the agency Microsoft is relying on to make it cool — had a hand in the line of urban geek shirts expected to hit select stores on December 15 .
Crispin conceived of the collection , the branding and many of the designs , as well as all the marketing materials , an agency representative said .
The Redmond , Wash .- based software giant once again called upon a celebrity spokesperson to help it gain some street cred , this time , in the form of rapper Common .
He contributed designs to the collection , reminiscent of the 80s , a time when he and Microsoft both came of age .
The line features retro MS - DOS fonts and a Bill Gates mugshot tee .
It launched this week with a bash in New York .

· Effect of overfishing could be greater still , say experts · Porbeagle , spiny dogfish and common skate at risk
More than a quarter of sharks and rays in the north - east Atlantic face extinction through the effects of overfishing , with 7 % classed as critically endangered , conservationists have warned .
The Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature states that 26 % of these species are at risk of being wiped out and a fifth are now regarded as " near threatened " .
The true number of fish under threat may be considerably larger , the report by the IUCN 's shark specialist group cautions , because scientists have too little information on 27 % of them to determine the health of their populations .
Many of the animals at risk are slow - breeding fish that have few young and reach sexual maturity late in life , a fact that makes them especially vulnerable to the fisheries ' activities .
The spiny dogfish ( rock salmon ) and porbeagle shark , both caught for their meat , are critically endangered .
They are among a handful of species under EU fishing restrictions , though these quotas are well above the zero- catch levels proposed by scientists at the International Council for Exploration of the Sea ( Ices ) .
Angel sharks and common skates are also critically endangered in the north - east Atlantic , according to the report .
The realisation is prompting Ices scientists to call for greater restrictions on fisheries which either deliberately catch the fish or land them as bycatch .
The basking shark , the world 's second largest fish , is listed as vulnerable .
The report was released ahead of European commission recommendations for tighter controls on fishing , including zero - catches for porbeagle sharks and spiny dogfish .
The advice is also for a ban on fishing vessels keeping aboard common skates , undulate rays , white skates and angel sharks , which should be returned safely to the water wherever possible .
Fisheries ministers are due to discuss the new restrictions at a meeting next month .
If the quotas are cut in line with the proposals , fisheries would lose permission to catch 600 tonnes of porbeagles and 2,600 tonnes of spiny dogfish .
Sonja Fordham , policy director at the Shark Alliance and co-author of the report , said : " The north Atlantic is one of the most overfished regions in the world and yet only four species of sharks and rays are protected .
This is a clear consequence of overfishing , whether these species are targeted or taken as bycatch . "
Another species listed as critically endangered is the deepwater gulper shark , sought for its rich liver oil , which is used by the cosmetics industry .
In 2005 Ices urged the EU to ban deepwater shark fishing , but current quotas will allow more than 800 tonnes to be taken next year .
The IUCN finds that the percentage of sharks and rays in the north - east Atlantic region classified as threatened is higher than the figure for the species globally - which is given to be 18 % .
It says the decline in numbers is due to the activities of fishing nations such as Spain , Portugal , France and Britain .
Two species of guitarfish , whose fins are among the most highly sought after for use in shark fin soup in Asian markets , are classified as endangered in the north - east Atlantic .
There are no limits on catches of them in European waters .
Scientists working for the IUCN said that it could already be too late to save two types of sawfish , both of which were critically endangered .
Claudine Gibson , former programme officer for the IUCN shark specialist group and lead author of the report , said : " North - east Atlantic populations of these vulnerable species are in serious trouble , more so than in many other parts of the world .
" Most sharks and rays are exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing because of their tendency to grow slowly , mature late , and produce few young .
Those at greatest risk of extinction in the north - east Atlantic include heavily - fished large sharks and rays ... as well as commercially valuable deepwater sharks and spiny dogfish . "
The EU is also looking to protect a string of other species , including cod and haddock , in proposals that reduce quotas by up to a quarter next year .
" We have made real progress in fisheries management over the last six years and we are starting to see positive results , such as the recovery in certain stocks under long - term management plans , " said the EU fisheries commissioner , Joe Borg .
" But this good news remains the exception , not the rule .
There has been so much overfishing over many years that the balance of the marine ecosystems on which our fisheries depend is seriously disturbed . "
Marine conservationists urged tighter curbs .
" Such action is immediately possible and absolutely necessary to change the course toward extinction of these remarkable ocean animals , " said Fordham .

A computer is a mechanism for interpreting a language .
Computers interpret ( perform the actions specified in ) sentences in a language which is known as the computer 's machine language .
It follows , therefore , that a study of the organization of computers is related to the study of the organization of computer languages .
Computer languages are classified in a variety of ways .
Machine languages are rather directly interpreted by computers .
Higher level computer languages are often somewhat independent from a particular computer and require translation ( compilation ) to machine language before programs may be interpreted ( executed ) .
Languages are also classified as being imperative or applicative depending on the underlying model of computation used by the system .
Abstraction is an important concept in computing .
Generally , higher level languages are more abstract .
A key tool of abstraction is the use of names .
An item of some complexity is given a name .
This name is then used as a building block of another item which in turn is named and so on .
Abstraction is an important tool for managing complexity of computer programs .
Functional programming is more than just using a functional programming language .
The methodology of functional programming is different from that of imperative programming in substantive ways .
The functional programming paradigm involves means for reliably deriving programs , analysis of programs , and proofs of program correctness .
Because functional programming languages are based on ideas from mathematics , the tools of mathematics may be applied for program derivation , analysis , and proof .
Functional programming languages ( applicative languages ) differ from conventional programming languages ( imperative languages ) in at least the following ways :
In applicative languages , names are associated with items which are stored in memory .
Once created , in memory , an item is never changed .
Names are assigned to items which are stored in memory only if an item needs to be referenced at a later point in time .
Items stored in memory are used as arguments for subsequent function applications during the course of a functional computation .
For example , in C ( an imperative language ) we might write :
int foo ; ... foo = 4 ;
In this example we associate the name foo with a particular memory cell of size sufficient to hold an integer .
Its state at that moment is unspecified .
Later foo is assigned the value 4 , i.e. , its state is changed to 4 .
In J ( an applicative language ) we might write :
foo =: 4
An item 4 is created in memory and the name foo is assigned to that item .
Note that in C we say that the value 4 is assigned to foo , but in J we say that the name foo is assigned to the value 4 .
The difference is subtle .
With imperative languages the focus is on the memory cells and how their state changes during the execution of a program .
With functional languages the focus is on the items in memory .
Once an item is created , it is never changed .
Names are more abstract in the sense that they provide a reference to something which is stored in memory , but is not necessarily an ordinary data value .
Functions are applied to items producing result items and the process is repeated until the computation is complete .
For example , consider the following C ( an imperative language ) program :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { int sum , count , n ; count = 0 ; sum = 0 ; while ( 1 == scanf ( " %d
" , &n ) ) { sum = sum + n ; count ++ ; } printf ( " %f
" , ( float ) sum / ( float ) count ) ; exit(0 ) ; }
This program reads a standard input stream of integer values and computes the average of these values and writes that average value on the standard output stream .
At the beginning of the average computation , memory cells count and sum are initialized to have a state of 0 .
The memory cell n is changed to each integer read .
Also , the state of sum accumulates the sum of each of the integers read and the state of count is incremented to count the number of integers read .
Once all of the integers have be read , their sum is acumulated and the count is known so that the average may be computed .
To use the C average program one must compile the program .
[ jhowland@Ariel jhowland ] $ make ave cc ave .c -o ave [ jhowland@Ariel jhowland ] $ echo " 1 2 3 " | ave 2.000000 [ jhowland@Ariel jhowland ] $
In functional languages , computations involve function application .
Complex computations require the results of one application be used as the argument for another application .
This process is known as functional composition .
Functional languages have special compositon rules which may be used in programs .
Functional languages , being based on the mathematical idea of a function , benefit from their mathematical heritage .
The techniques and tools of mathematics may be used to reason ( derive , simplify , transform and prove correctness ) about programs .
For example , consider the following J ( an applicative language ) program :
+/ % #
This program computes the average of a list of numbers in the standard input stream .
The result ( because no name is assigned to the resulting value ) is displayed on the standard output stream .
The J average program has several interesting features .
The program is concise .
There are no named memory cells in the program .
There are no assignments in the program .
Numbers are not dealt with one by one .
The algorithm is represented without reference to data .
To use the J average program you put the program and list of numbers in the standard input stream of a J machine ( interpreter ) .
[ jhowland@Ariel jhowland ] $ echo " (+/ % #) 1 2 3 " | jconsole (+/ % #) 1 2 3 2 [ jhowland@Ariel jhowland ] $
The J average program consists of three functions .
+/ sum
sum % divide
divide # tally
When a three function program is applied to a single argument , y , the following composition rule , fork , is used .
( f g h ) y = ( f y ) g ( h y )
In the J average program , f is the function +/ , sum , and g is the function % , divide , and # is the function tally which counts the number of elements in a list .
More explaination is needed for the J average program .
/ ( insert ) is a function whose domain is the set of all available two argument functions ( dyads ) and whose result is a function which repeatedly applies its argument function between the items of the derived function 's argument .
For example , +/ produces a function which sums the items in its argument while */ derives a function which computes the product of the items in its argument .
Most functional languages allow functions to be applied to functions producing functions as results .
Most imperative languages do not have this capability .
For example , the derived function +/ sums the items in its argument while the derived function */ computes the product of the items to which it is applied .
Imperative languages use language constructs ( such as assignment ) which describe the state changes of named memory cells during a computation , for example , a while loop in C .
Such languages have many sentences which produce no values or which produce changes of other items as a side - effect .
count ++;
count
Pure functional languages have no side - effects .
Functional programming is important for the following reasons .
Functional languages allow programming without assignments .
Structured imperative languages ( no goto statements ) provide programs which are easier derive , understand , and reason about .
Similarly , assignment - free functional languages are easier to derive , understand , and reason about .
Functional languages encourage thinking at higher levels of abstraction .
For example , Functions may be applied to functions producing functions as results .
Functions are manipulated with the same ease as data .
Existing functions may be modified and combined to form new functions .
Functional programming involves working in units which are larger than individual statements .
Algorithms may be represented without reference to data .
Functional programming languages allow the application of functions to data in agregate rather than being forced to deal with data on an item by item basis .
Such applications are free of assignments and independent of evaluation order and provide a mechanism to operate on entire data structures which is an ideal paradigm for parallel computing .
Functional languages have been applied extensively in the field of artificial intelligence .
AI researchers have provided much of the early development work on the LISP programming language , which though not a pure functional language , none the less has influenced the design of most functional languages .
Functions languages are often used to develop protoptype implementations and executable specifications for complex system designs .
The simple semantics and rigorous mathematical foundations of functional languages make them ideal vehicles for specification of the behavior of complex programs .
Functional programming , because of its mathematical basis , provides a connection to computer science theory .
The questions of decidability may be represented in a simpler framework using functional approaches .
For example , the essence of denotational semantics involves the translation of imperative programs into equivalent functional programs .
The J programming language [ Burk 2001 , Bur 2001 , Hui 2001 ] is , a functional language .
J uses infix notation with primitive functions denoted by a special symbol , such as + or % , or a special symbol or word followed by the suffix of .
or : .
Each function name may be used as a monad ( one argument , written to the right ) or as a dyad ( two arguments , one on the left , the other on the right ) .
The J vocabulary of primitive ( built - in ) functions is shown in Figures 1 and 2 .
These figures show the monadic definition of a function on the left of the * and the dyadic definition on the right .
For example , the function symbol + : represents the monad double and the dyad not - or ( nor ) .
Figure 1 : J Vocabulary , Part 1
J uses a simple rule to determine the order of evaluation of functions in expressions .
The argument of a monad or the right argument of a dyad is the value of the entire expression on the right .
The value of the left argument of a dyad is the first item written to the left of the dyad .
Parentheses are used in a conventional manner as punctuation which alters the order of evaluation .
For example , the expression 3*4+5 produces the value 27 , whereas ( 3* 4 ) + 5 produces the value 17 .
Figure 2 : J Vocabulary , Part 2
The evaluation of higher level functions ( function producing functions ) must be done ( of course ) before any functions are applied .
Two types of higher level functions exist ; adverbs ( higher level monads ) and conjunctions ( higher level dyads ) .
Figures 1 and 2 show adverbs in bold italic face and conjunctions in bold face .
For example , the conjunction bond ( Curry ) binds an argument of a dyad to a fixed value producing a monad function as a result ( 4& * produces a monad which multiplies by 4 ) .
J is a functional programming language which uses functional composition to model computational processes .
J supports a form of programming known as tacit .
Tacit programs have no reference to their arguments and often use special composition rules known as hooks and forks .
Explicit programs with traditional control structures may also be written .
Inside an explicit definition , the left argument of a dyad is always named x. and the argument of a monad ( as well as the right argument of a dyad ) is always named y. .
J supports a powerful set of primitive data structures for lists and arrays .
Data ( recall that functions have first - class status in J ) , once created from notation for constants or function application , is never altered .
Data items possess several attributes such as type ( numeric or character , exact or inexact , etc. ) shape ( a list of the sizes of each of its axes ) and rank ( the number of axes ) .
Names are an abstraction tool ( not memory cells ) which are assigned ( or re-assigned ) to data or functions .
In functional programming the underlying model of computation is functional composition .
A program consists of a sequence of function applications which compute the final result of the program .
The J programming language contains a rich set of primitive functions together with higher level functions and composition rules which may be used in programs .
To better understand the composition rules and higher level functions we can construct a set of definitions which show some of the characteristics of the language in symbolic form using standard mathematical notation .
We start with argument name assignments using character data .
x = : ' x ' y = : 'y '
We wish to have several functions named f . g , h , and i , each of the form :
f =: 3 : 0 'f ( ' , y. , ' ) ' : 'f ( ' , x. , ' , ' , y. , ' ) ' )
Rather than enter each of these definitions ( and their inverses ) we use a function generating definition which uses a pattern .
math_pat =: 3 : 0 ' ' ' ' , y. , '( '' , y. , '' ) ' '' , LF , ' :' , LF , '' ' ' , y. , '( '' , x. , '' , '' , y . , '' ) ' ' ' )
Applying math_pat produces the definition :
math_pat 'f ' 'f ( ' , y. , ' ) ' : 'f ( ' , x. , ' , ' , y. , ' ) '
Using explicit definition ( : ) and obverse ( :. ) we have :
f = : ( 3 : ( math_pat 'f ' ) ) :. ( 3 : ( math_pat ' f_inv ' ) ) g = : ( 3 : ( math_pat ' g ' ) ) :. ( 3 : ( math_pat ' g_inv ' ) ) h = : ( 3 : ( math_pat ' h ' ) ) :. ( 3 : ( math_pat ' h_inv ' ) ) i = : ( 3 : ( math_pat ' i ' ) ) :. ( 3 : ( math_pat ' i_inv ' ) )
which produces definitions for each of the functions f . g , h , and i and a symbolic definition for each inverse function .
Next , we use these definitions to explore some of J's composition rules and higher level functions .
f g y f( g(y ) ) ( f g ) y f(y , g( y ) ) x f g y f( x , g( y ) ) x ( f g ) y f( x , g( y ) ) f g h y f ( g ( h ( y ) ) ) ( f g h ) y g(f (y ) , h( y ) ) x f g h y f(x , g( h ( y ) ) ) x ( f g h ) y g( f ( x , y ) , h( x , y ) ) f g h i y f ( g ( h ( i ( y ) ) ) ) ( f g h i ) y f(y , h ( g (y ) , i( y ) ) ) x f g h i y f(x , g( h ( i( y ) ) ) ) x ( f g h i ) y f(x , h ( g (y ) , i( y ) ) ) f@g y f ( g(y ) ) x f@g y f ( g( x , y ) ) f&g y f ( g (y ) ) x f&g y f ( g ( x ) , g( y ) ) f&.g y g_inv( f ( g ( y ) ) ) ( h &.

Inexact ( floating point ) numbers are written as 3e10 and can be converted to exact representations by the verb x : .
x : 3e10 30000000000
Exact rational representations are given by using r to separate the numerator and denominator .
] a = : 1r2 1r2 ( %a ) +a^2 9r4 %2 0.5 % x : 2 1r2
Using the reshape verb ( $ ) we create a table using exact values .
] matrix = : x : 3 3 $ _1 2 5 _8 0 1 _4 3 3 _1 2 5 _8 0 1 _4 3 3 ] inv_matrix = : %. matrix 3r77 _9r77 _2r77 _20r77 _17r77 39r77 24r77 5r77 _16r77 matrix +/ . * inv_matrix 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

To answer the question of how many zeros there are at the end of !n , we use the function q : which computes the prime factors of its integer argument .
Each zero at the end of !n has a factor of 2 and 5 .
It is easy to reason that there are more factors of 2 in !n than factors of 5 .
Hence the number of zeros at the end of !n is the number of factors of 5 .
We can count the zeros at the end of !n with the following program .
+/ , 5 = q : > : i. 4 0 !6 720 +/ , 5 = q : > : i. 6 1 !20x 2432902008176640000 +/ , 5 = q : > : i. 20 4

5.2 Algorithms and their Processes
Howland [ How 1998 ] used the often studied recursive Fibonacci function to describe recursive and iterative processes .
In J , the recursive Fibonacci function is defined as :
fibonacci =. monad define if .
y. < 2 do . y. else .
( fibonacci y. - 1 ) + fibonacci y. - 2 end . )
Applying fibonacci to the integers 0 through 10 gives :
fibonacci " 0 i.11 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
Howland [ How 1998 ] also introduced the idea of a continuation ; a monad representing the computation remaining in an expression after evaluating a sub-expression .
Given a compound expression e and a sub-expression f of e , the continuation of f in e is the computation in e , written as a monad , which remains to be done after first evaluating f .
When the continuation of f in e is applied to the result of evaluating f , the result is the same as evaluating the expression e.
Let c be the continuation of f in e .
The expression e may then be written as c f .
Continuations provide a ``factorization '' of expressions into two parts ; f which is evaluated first and c which is later applied to the result of f .
Continuations are helpful in the analysis of algorithms .
Analysis of the recursive fibonacci definition reveals that each continuation of fibonacci in fibonacci contains an application of fibonacci .
Hence , since at least one continuation of a recursive application of fibonacci is not the identity monad , the execution of fibonacci results in a recursive process .
Define a monad , fib_work , to be the number of times fibonacci is applied to evaluate fibonacci .
fib_work is , itself , a fibonacci sequence generated by the J definition :
fib_work =. monad define if .
y. < 2 do. 1 else .
1 + ( fib_work y. - 1 ) + fib_work y. - 2 end . )
Applying fib_work to the integers 0 through 10 gives :
fib_work " 0 i.11 1 1 3 5 9 15 25 41 67 109 177
Consider the experiment of estimating how long it would take to evaluate fibonacci on a workstation .
First evaluate fib_work 100 .
Since the definition given above results in a recursive process , it is necessary to create a definition which results in an iterative process when evaluated .
Consider the following definitions :
fib_work_iter = : monad def ' fib_iter 1 1 , y. ' fib_iter = : monad define ( ' a ' ; ' b ' ; ' count ' ) =. y. if .
count = 0 do .
b else .
fib_iter ( 1 + a + b ) , a , count - 1 end . )
Applying fib_work_iter to the integers 0 through 10 gives the same result as applying fib_work :
fib_work_iter " 0 i. 11 1 1 3 5 9 15 25 41 67 109 177
Next , use fib_work_iter to compute fib_work 100 ( exactly ) .
fib_iter 100x 57887932245395525494200
Finally , time ( time = : 6 !:2 ) the recursive fibonacci definition on arguments not much larger than 20 to get an estimate of the number of applications / sec the workstation can perform .

Using 3500 applications / sec as an estimate we have :

which is ( approximately ) 5244612256 centuries !
An alternate experimental approach to solve this problem is to time the recursive fibonacci definition and look for patterns in the ratios of successive times .
[ experiment = : ( 4 10 $ ' fibonacci ') ,. " : 4 1 $ 20 21 22 23 fibonacci 20 fibonacci 21 fibonacci 22 fibonacci 23 t = : time " 1 experiment t 2.75291 4.42869 7.15818 11.5908 ( 1 }. t ) % _ 1 }. t 1.60873 1.61632 1.61924
Note that the ratios are about the same , implying that the time to evaluate fibonacci is exponential .
As an estimate of the time , perform the computation :
[ ratio = : (+/ % # ) ( 1 }. t ) % _ 1 }. t 1.61476 0 100 365 24 60 60 rep x : ratio^100 205174677357 86 306 9 14 40
This experimental approach produces a somewhat larger estimate of more than 205174677357 centuries .
Students should be cautioned about certain flaws in either experimental design .
Suppose we have the following test scores .
[ scores = : 85 79 63 91 85 69 77 64 78 93 72 66 48 76 81 79 85 79 63 91 85 69 77 64 78 93 72 66 48 76 81 79 /:~scores NB. sort the scores 48 63 64 66 69 72 76 77 78 79 79 81 85 85 91 93
A stem - and - leaf diagram has the unit digits ( leaves ) of observations on one asix and more significant digits ( stems ) on the other axis .
These may be computed from the scores as :
stem = : 10&* @ <. @ %&10 leaf = : 10&| sl_diagram = : ~.@stem ; " 0 stem </. leaf sl_diagram /:~scores +--+-----------+

A more conventional frequency tabulation is given by the definition fr = : +/" 1 @ ( =/ ) .
The left argument is a range of frequencies and the right argument is a list of obversations .
4 5 6 7 8 9 fr <. scores%10 1 0 4 6 3 2
This frequency tabulation may be shown as a bar chart ( Figure 4 ) using the built - in ploting library .

When tossing a coin a large number of times , the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of throws should approach a limit of 0.5 .
However , the absolute value of the difference between heads and tails may become very large .
This can be illustrated with the following experiment , the results of which are shown in Figures 5 and 6 .
toss = : > : i. n = : 500 NB .

We examine some elementary ideas from number theory to demonstrate the expressive power of J .

Next we generalize these expressions as functions totatives and non_totatives .
totatives =: 3 : 0 p =. > : i. y. ( 1 = p +. y. ) # p ) non_totatives =: 3 : 0 p =. > : i. y. ( -. 1 = p +. y. ) # p ) totatives 12 1 5 7 11 totatives 28 1 3 5 9 11 13 15 17 19 23 25 27 non_totatives 12 2 3 4 6 8 9 10 12 non_totatives 15 3 5 6 9 10 12 15 divisors =: 3 : 0 p =. non_totatives y.

The number of totatives of n is called the totient of n .
We can define totient = : # @ totatives .
An alternate ( tacit ) definition is phi = : * -.@%@~.&.q : .
( totient " 0 ) 100 12 40 4 phi 100 12 40 4
Euler 's theorem states that given an integer coprime with , then .
This leads to the definition :
euler =: 4 : 'x. ( y.&| @ ^ ) totient y.' 2 euler 19 1 2 euler 35 1 3 euler 28 1 3 euler 205 1 3 euler 200005 1
The product of two totatives of , is a totative of n .
We can see this by using J's table ( / ) adverb .
totatives 12 1 5 7 11 12 | 1 5 7 11 */ 1 5 7 11 1 5 7 11 5 1 11 7 7 11 1 5 11 7 5 1
We notice that we have a group ( closure , identity element , inverses , and associativity ) .
There is a table adverb which may be used to present the above results .
table 1 : 0 u.table ~ y. : (' ' ; , .x. ) , .({.;}. ) " : y., x.u./y. ) 12&|@* table totatives

Notice that addition residue 12 of the totatives of 12 do not form a group .

Finally , consider the definition powers which raises the totatives to the totient power .
powers =: 3 : '( totatives y. ) ( y.&| @ ^ ) / i. 1 + totient y. ' powers 12 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 5 1 1 7 1 7 1 1 11 1 11 1 powers 17 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 8 16 15 13 9 1 2 4 8 16 15 13 9 1 1 3 9 10 13 5 15 11 16 14 8 7 4 12 2 6 1 1 4 16 13 1 4 16 13 1 4 16 13 1 4 16 13 1 1 5 8 6 13 14 2 10 16 12 9 11 4 3 15 7 1 1 6 2 12 4 7 8 14 16 11 15 5 13 10 9 3 1 1 7 15 3 4 11 9 12 16 10 2 14 13 6 8 5 1 1 8 13 2 16 9 4 15 1 8 13 2 16 9 4 15 1 1 9 13 15 16 8 4 2 1 9 13 15 16 8 4 2 1 1 10 15 14 4 6 9 5 16 7 2 3 13 11 8 12 1 1 11 2 5 4 10 8 3 16 6 15 12 13 7 9 14 1 1 12 8 11 13 3 2 7 16 5 9 6 4 14 15 10 1 1 13 16 4 1 13 16 4 1 13 16 4 1 13 16 4 1 1 14 9 7 13 12 15 6 16 3 8 10 4 5 2 11 1 1 15 4 9 16 2 13 8 1 15 4 9 16 2 13 8 1 1 16 1 16 1 16 1 16 1 16 1 16 1 16 1 16 1
In this section we discuss the representation of polynomials and operations defined on polynomials .
A polynomial is determined by its coefficients so we represent the polynomial as a list of coefficients written in ascending order rather than the usual decending order .
For example , the polynomial is written as 5 2 0 1 .
To evaluate a polynomial we write :
peval = : ( #. |. ) ~ 5 2 0 1 peval 3 38
A primitive for polynomial evaluation , p. is provided .
5 2 0 1 p. 3 38
To add or subtract two polynomials we add or subtract the coefficients of like terms .
psum = : , @ (+/ @ , : & , :) pdif = : , @ ( -/ @ , : & , :) 1 2 psum 1 3 1 2 5 1 3 psum 1 3 1 4 3 1 1 2 pdif 1 3 1 0 _1 _1
Next we consider the product and derivative of polynomials .
If we make a product table , the coefficients of like terms lie along the oblique diagonals of that table .
The oblique adverb /. allows access to these diagonals .
pprod = : +/ /. @ (*/) 1 2 pprod 1 3 1 1 5 7 2 pderiv = : 1 : }. ] * i. @ # pderiv 1 3 3 1 3 6 3 p.. 1 3 3 1 NB .
There is a primitive for derivative 3 6 3
To illustrate the ease with which higher level functional abstractions may be expressed , consider the problem of working with matrices whose elements are polynomials .
We represent these as a boxed table .
For example ,
[ m = : 2 2 $ 1 2 ; 1 2 1 ; 1 3 3 1 ; 1 4 6 4 1 +-------+---------+
|1 2 |1 2 1 | +-------+---------+
|1 3 3 1|1 4 6 4 1 | +-------+---------+ [ n = : 2 3 $ 1 2 3 ; 3 2 1 ; 1 0 1 ; 3 3 3 3 ; _ 1 _2 3 ; 3 4 5 +-------+-------+-----+
|1 2 3 |3 2 1 |1 0 1 | +-------+-------+-----+
|3 3 3 3|_1 _2 3|3 4 5 | +-------+-------+-----+
Next , we define new versions of psum , pdif , and pprod which assume their arguments are boxed polynomials .
psumb = : psum &. > pdifb = : pdif &. > pprodb = : pprod &. >
Then we can define a matrix product for these matrices whose elements are polynomials as :
pmp = : psumb / .

Iverson and others have written several books which use J to describe a number of computing related topics .
One of these [ Ive 1995 ] uses J in a rather formal way to express algorithms and proofs of topics covered in [ Gra 1989 ] .
Following is an example from the introduction of [ Ive 1995 ] .
A theorem is an assertion that one expression l is equivalent to another r.
We can express this relationship in J as :
t= : l -: r
t
l = : +/ @ i. NB .
Sum of integers r = : ( ] * ] - 1 : ) % 2 :
r = : ( n * n - 1 : ) % 2 :
t =: l -: r
t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
l +/ @ i. Definition of l +/ @ |. i. Sum is associative and commutative ( |. is reverse ) ( (+/ @ i. ) + (+/ @ |. @ i. ) ) % 2 : Half sum of equal values +/ @ ( i. + |. @ i. ) % 2 : Summation distributes over addition +/ @ ( n # n - 1 : ) % 2 : Each term is n - 1 ; there are n terms ( n * n - 1 : ) % 2 : Definition of multiplication r Definition of r
Iverson discusses the role of computers in mathematical notation in [ Ive 2000 ] .
In this paper he quotes
A. N. Whitehead
By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work , a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems , and in effect increases the mental power of the race .
Some symbols , like , , , that were used originally for only positive integral values of stimulated intellectual experimentation when is fractional , negative , or complex , which led to vital extensions of ideas .
Mathematical notation , like language , has grown up without much looking to , at the dictates of convenience and with the sanction of the majority .
Other noteworth quotes with relevance for J include :
Friedrich Engels
In science , each new point of view calls forth a revolution in nomenclature .
Bertrand Russell
A good notation has a subtlety and suggestiveness which at times make it almost seem like a live teacher .
A. N. Whitehead , in Introduction to Mathematics
It is a profoundly erroneous truism , repeated by all copy books and by eminent people when they are making speeches , that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing .
The precise opposite is the case .
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them .
Certainly , the J notation , being executable , relieves the brain the task of doing routine calculations letting it concentrate on the ideas behind the calculation .
The notation also removes certain ambiguities of mathematical notation , not confusing _3 ( minus three ) with the application - 3 ( negate three ) .
An example of the kind of extensions provided by a good notation to which Cajori refers can be found in the notation for outer product ( spelled . ) . +/ . * ( matrix product ) expressed as an outer product led to other useful outer products such as +./ . *. .
Sadly , J is not widely accepted within computer science and even stranger is its lack of acceptance within mathematics .

At law the Bush Admin is a Criminal Conspiracy
The Bush Administration Is an Ongoing Criminal Conspiracy Under International Law and U.S. Domestic Law
by Prof. Francis A. Boyle
Justice Robert H. Jackson Conference :
Planning for the Prosecution of High Level American War Criminals
Massachusetts Law School
September 13 - 14 , 2008
Andover , Massachusetts
Since the impeachable installation of George W. Bush as President in January of 2001 by the U.S. Supreme Court ’s Gang of Five , the peoples of the world have witnessed a government in the United States that has demonstrated little if any respect for fundamental considerations of international law , human rights , and the United States Constitution .
What the world has watched instead is a comprehensive and malicious assault upon the integrity of the international and domestic legal orders by a group of men and women who are thoroughly Machiavellian and Straussian in their perception of international relations and in their conduct of both foreign policy and domestic affairs .
Even more seriously , in many instances specific components of the Bush administration ’s foreign policies constitute ongoing criminal activity under well - recognized principles of both international law and U.S. domestic law , and in particular the Nuremberg Charter , the Nuremberg Judgment , and the Nuremberg Principles , as well as the Pentagon ’s own U.S. Army Field Manual 27 - 10 on The Law of Land Warfare ( 1956 ) , all of which apply to President Bush himself as Commander - in - Chief of United States Armed Forces under Article II , Section 2 of the United States Constitution .
Depending upon the substantive issues involved , those international crimes typically include but are not limited to the Nuremberg offenses of crimes against peace :
For example , Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , and perhaps their longstanding threatened wars of aggression against Iran and now Pakistan .
Their criminal responsibility also concerns Nuremberg crimes against humanity and war crimes as well as grave breaches of the Four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and of the 1907 Hague Regulations on land warfare :
For example , torture at Guantanamo , Bhagram , Abu Ghraib , and elsewhere ; enforced disappearances , assassinations , murders , kidnappings , extraordinary renditions , “ shock and awe , ” depleted uranium , white phosphorous , cluster bombs , Fallujah , and the Gitmo kangaroo courts .
Furthermore , various members of the Bush administration have committed numerous inchoate crimes incidental to these substantive offences that under the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment , and Principles as well as paragraph 500 of U.S. Army Field Manual 27 - 10 are international crimes in their own right : planning and preparation — which they are currently doing today against Iran and Pakistan — solicitation , incitement , conspiracy , complicity , attempt , aiding and abetting .
Finally , according to basic principles of international criminal law set forth in paragraph 501 of U.S. Army Field Manual 27 - 10 , all high level civilian officials and military officers in the U.S. government who either knew or should have known that soldiers or civilians under their control ( such as the C.I.A. or private contractors ) , committed or were about to commit international crimes and failed to take the measures necessary to stop them , or to punish them , or both , are likewise personally responsible for the commission of international crimes .
At the very top of America ’s criminal chain - of - command are President Bush and Vice - President Cheney ; former U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld ; Rumsfeld ’s Deputy Paul Wolfowitz ; Secretary of State Rice ; former Director of National Intelligence Negroponte ; National Security Advisor Hadley ; his Deputy Elliot Abrams ; former U.S. Attorneys General Ashcroft and Gonzales , criminally responsible for the torture campaign launched by the Bush Jr. administration ; and the Pentagon ’s Joint Chiefs of Staffs along with the appropriate Regional Commanders - in - Chief , especially for U.S. Central Command ( CENTCOM ) .
These U.S. government officials and their immediate subordinates are responsible for the commission of crimes against peace , crimes against humanity , and war crimes as specified by the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment , and Principles as well as by U.S. Army Field Manual 27 - 10 .
Today in international legal terms , the Bush Jr. administration itself should now be viewed as constituting an ongoing criminal conspiracy under international criminal law and U.S. domestic law because of its formulation and undertaking of serial wars of aggression , crimes against peace , crimes against humanity , and war crimes in violation of the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment , and Principles that are legally akin to those perpetrated by the former Nazi regime in Germany .
Of course the terrible irony of today ’s situation is that six decades ago at Nuremberg the U.S. government participated in the prosecution , punishment and execution of Nazi government officials for committing some of the same types of heinous international crimes that the members of the Bush administration currently inflict upon people all over the world .
To be sure , I personally oppose the imposition of capital punishment upon any human being for any reason no matter how monstrous their crimes , whether they be Bush Jr. , Tony Blair , or Saddam Hussein .
As a consequence , American citizens possess the basic right under international law and United States domestic law , including the U.S. Constitution , to engage in acts of civil resistance designed to prevent , impede , thwart , or terminate ongoing criminal activities perpetrated by Bush administration officials in their conduct of foreign affairs policies and military operations purported to relate to defense and counter - terrorism .
Today ’s civil resisters are the sheriffs !
The Bush administration officials are the outlaws !
We American citizens must reaffirm our commitment to the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment , and Principles by holding our government officials fully accountable under international law and U.S. domestic law for the commission of such grievous international and domestic crimes .
We must not permit any aspect of our foreign affairs and defense policies to be conducted by acknowledged “ war criminals ” according to the U.S. government ’s own official definitions of that term as set forth in the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment , and Principles , U.S. Army Field Manual 27 - 10 , the U.S. War Crimes Act , the Four Geneva Conventions and the Hague Regulations .
The American people must insist upon the impeachment , dismissal , resignation , indictment , conviction , and long - term incarceration of all U.S. government officials guilty of such heinous international and domestic crimes .
If not so restrained , the Bush administration could very well precipitate a Third World War .
In this regard , during the course of an October 17 , 2007 press conference , President Bush Jr. terrorized the entire world with the threat of World War III if he could not work his illegal will upon Iran .
It is my opinion that the Bush administration is fully prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against Muslim and Arab states and peoples in order to break the taboo of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
After the terrible tragedy of September 11 , 2001 the United States of America has vilified and demonized Muslims and Arabs almost to the same extent that America inflicted upon the Japanese and Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor .
As the Nazis had previously demonstrated with respect to the Jews , a government must first dehumanize and scapegoat a race of people before its citizens will tolerate if not approve their elimination : witness Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
In post - 9/11 America we are directly confronted with the prospect of a nuclear war of extermination conducted by our White Racist Judeo - Christian Power Elite against Peoples of Color in the Muslim and Arab worlds in order to steal their oil and gas .
The Crusades all over again .
But this time nuclear Armageddon stares all of humankind right in the face !
We American lawyers must be inspired by the stunning example set by those heroic Pakistani lawyers who led the successful struggle against the brutal Bush - supported Musharraf military dictatorship in Pakistan .
We American lawyers must now lead the fight against the Bush dictatorship and empire !
This is our Nuremberg Moment !
Thank you .

Born in April 1948 in Beaconsfield , and educated at High Wycombe Technical High School , Sir Terry sold his first story when he was 13 years old and used the money to buy a second - hand typewriter .
A few years later , in 1971 , his first book The Carpet People was published .
It detailed the first of Pratchett 's alternative universes , but the most successful has been Discworld - with magical characters living on a flat world sitting on the backs of four elephants , who stand on the shell of a giant turtle .
The first Discworld novel was The Colour of Magic ( 1983 ) , which Sir Terry wrote in his spare time while working as a press officer .
He turned to writing full time in 1987 after completing his fourth Discworld novel Mort .

There are 36 books in the Discworld series .
The first Discworld novel for children , The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents , was published in 2001 and was awarded the Carnegie Medal .
Many of his books have been adapted for stage , TV and radio .
' Satire '
On his official website , Sir Terry says of Discworld : " It started out as a parody of all the fantasy that was around in the big boom of the early ' 80s , then turned into a satire on just about everything , and even I do n't know what it is now .
" I do know that in that time there 's been at least four people promoted as ' new Terry Pratchetts ' so for all I know I may not even still be me . "
Sir Terry has won numerous literary awards , and was made an OBE for services to literature in 1998 .
He has honorary doctorates from the Universities of Warwick , Portsmouth , Bath and Bristol .

In April , Sir Terry told ITV's This Morning that news of his illness had made him " absolutely angry " .
" I did n't know where to go and what to do and there was a lot of flailing around and shouting really , " he said .
The writer said : " I 'm a humanist , which means I 'm an atheist , the trouble with being an atheist is that it lets God off the hook .
You really want someone to blame . "

A group of innovative inventors from Design that Matters have built an incubator from recycled car parts that could prevent millions of newborn deaths in the developing world .
According to DtM , 3.9 million infants in the developing world die every year within a month of birth .
25 percent of those deaths are due to complications of prematurity , usually heat and water loss.[ social_buttons ]
Dr. Kristian Olson , the principal investigator in the project , says the main causes of newborn death – infections , preterm birth and asphyxiation – are readily treatable with the right expertise and equipment .
He hopes to create a cheap , reliable incubator that can be serviced easily with existing resources .
The Global Health Initiative at the Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology ( CIMIT ) is promoting the project , which is working toward a design that can be :
Sold for about $ 1000 ( 3 % of the cost of the current incubators )
Manufactured from parts available locally , and repaired by local workers
Designed for the local conditions , like temperature extremes and fluctuations in power supply
In the Design that Matters incubator , the heat for the unit comes from a pair of headlights .
An automobile air filter and fan provide the climate control , and a car door alarm signals emergencies .
Dr. Jonathan Rosen , former director of CIMIT ’s technology implementation program , said he learned from doctors working in developing countries that no matter how remote the community , there always seemed to be a Toyota 4 Runner that worked .
So the challenge became to “ start with a 4 Runner and take away all the parts that were n’t an incubator . ”
With $ 150,000 in initial financing from CIMIT , the project ’s next step is to find funding to develop a working prototype , then gain endorsement from organizations like the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Fund to speed the adoption of the technology .
The New Solutions
Developing standards to measure piracy 's impact and then educating consumers seems like solid footing on which both the PC Gaming Alliance and the ESA can begin to address their respective constituencies .
But then what ?
Christian Svensson , senior director of strategic planning and research at Capcom and a PCGA member , says it best : " You ca n't talk about piracy without talking about countermeasures .
" One such countermeasure is , of course , digital rights management utilities that work in various ways to copy - protect software , and some of these have been controversial -- in particular , SecuROM , which most recently drew fire for EA with
The ESA steers clear of opining on which DRM methods work best , or on judging various solutions , preferring instead to leave it at the publisher 's jurisdiction .
" Generally , publishers undertake their own measures based on their own judgment about the effectiveness and the cost of various applications that can be used , and measures that can be used to prevent the piracy of their game products , " says the ESA 's Ric Hirsch , senior vice president of intellectual property enforcement .
But as for the PCGA , Svensson says that internal discussions have focused on some possible best practices for DRM -- although he stresses that there is " absolutely no policy " in place for such standards just yet .
" I think that Stardock 's Bill of Rights , for example , touches on DRM slightly , " he says .
But even standardizing best practices is a complicated goal .
" [ Stardock CEO ]
Brad [ Wardell ] 's approach is very hands - off , " says Svensson .
" I think that if the PCGA as an organization is going to be all - embracing , if Stardock were to become a member and EA were to become a member , I think there are very obvious differences in their strategy as pertains to DRM .
As a PC gaming organization , we probably need to be able to embrace both approaches , and still be able to make recommendations . "
" I think it 's fair to say that , along the continuum of what is the best experience for the consumer and what provides the highest level of protection for developers and publishers , there 's a whole realm of grays in there .
I do n't think that anyone has the right answer today .
" Svensson says new , emerging technologies that make rights management increasingly transparent to end users -- and also increasingly secure - can help .
" Everything , no matter how you slice it , it tends to be net - authenticated , " he says .
" I do believe that session - based online protection ... like [ Valve 's ]
Steam , is probably the most secure and least onerous , in most cases .
" Indeed , Valve has placed a particular emphasis on unintrusiveness with its Steam service ; widespread media reports recently focused on an email Newell purportedly wrote to a fan , who published it on his LiveJournal , in which Newell said that most DRM offerings are " broken " and " just dumb . "
" The goal should be to create greater value for customers through service value ( make it easy for me to play my games whenever and wherever I want to ) , not by decreasing the value of a product ( maybe I 'll be able to play my game and maybe I won't ) , " Newell wrote , as he addressed a fan who wanted to " give as little money as possible to EA " -- a distribution partner to Valve -- in protest of its use of SecuROM DRM .
As for Svensson , he spoke to Gamasutra strictly on behalf of the PCGA , and not as a representative of Capcom 's individual stance as a company -- " We have an exclusive agreement with SecuROM at Capcom , and we 're very pleased with that level of protection , " he says .
" But I think you 're going to see a number of technologies emerging from various vendors that do allow for session - based access , that free up the issue of , 'am I renting this thing , or do I own this thing ? '.
" Speaking of newer technology , " probably had the best DRM implementation that I 've ever seen , " says Svensson .
"
They had tripwires all through that thing that basically would do an authorization check at certain activities ... if any failed , it would trigger weapons overheating , or you 'd level at a slower rate ... it was really well thought - out , and really well - engineered .
" However , there was an unintended side effect of that sort of efficacy .
" I think a lot of pirates got frustrated by that - but I also think there 's a messaging component there , " Svensson explains .
"
You have those pirates saying , ' what kind of buggy POS is this ? ' and then legit copies did n't have that experience at all , but potential buyers say , ' I do n't want to buy that buggy game , ' because they did n't really message , or give people any awareness .
" Svensson saysmight have suffered from the same issue - it would crash when tripwires failed to authenticate , and so gained a reputation for being an unstable title , creating a negative perception of the product .'s creator , Iron Lore , recently shuttered its studio -- notably , Michael Fitch , creative director ofpublisher THQ , blamed rampant piracy in part for Iron Lore 's failure to thrive .
Moreover , this sort of technology requires detailed implementation and testing , and Svensson notes how time consuming and expensive such an investment can be .
" So there 's a cost / investment / loss equation , " he says -- which again comes back to the issue of how hard it is to quantify the benefit when the impact of piracy is so hard to map out .
As the PCGA convenes a new subcommittee to investigate just this very quantification issue , Svensson ultimately hopes they 'll come up with information that will make those calculations easier .
But in the meantime , he recalls when , on the heels of EA 's own DRM controversy , CEO John Riccitiello told Gamasutra that he hated DRM .
" I do n't like locks on my door , and I do n't like to use keys in my car ...
I 'd like to live in a world where there are no passports .
Unfortunately , we don't , " Riccitiello said at the time .
" I think that was spot on , " says Svensson .
" People rail against DRM and feel that it treats them like criminals - unfortunately , we live in a world where some peoplecriminals , and sometimes we have to take steps to mitigate as best we can .
We live with some slight inconveniences , and obviously , we try to keep inconveniences to a minimum . "
" I think people who put it out there that publishers are just trying to be evil -- I assure you .
We do n't make money by making your lives difficult .
If we did n't feel it was absolutely , positively imperative that we have this for our business , we would n't do it . "
Who wants to go and see a movie about a war that finished more than 60 years ago ?
Judging by recent box - office results , Second World
War films are back in vogue in a way that has left some analysts scratching their heads .
Bryan Singer 's Valkyrie , starring Tom Cruise as would - be Hitler assassin Col Claus Von Stauffenberg , has opened strongly in the US despite its lengthy and troubled gestation .
( It has already made over $ 60 m at the US box - office . )
Ed Zwick 's Defiance , about four Jewish brothers fighting against the Nazis , has likewise performed well on limited release in the US , overcoming mixed reviews .
Meanwhile , Stephen Daldry 's The Reader , starring Kate Winslet as a former SS guard , is a leading awards contender .
It 's not only the Americans and Brits who 've been making , and lapping up , Second World War movies in recent months .
The Germans have co-financed several Hollywood productions , including The Reader , Valkyrie and Quentin Tarantino 's forthcoming Inglourious Basterds .
They 've also been making Second World War movies of their own .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Downfall , about Hitler in his bunker days , was a runaway success in 2004 .
An even more harrowing war movie , Anonyma – A Woman In Berlin , in which Nina Hoss stars as one of the victims of the mass rape of German women by Soviet soldiers , was recently completed in Germany .
The biggest box - office hit in Denmark last year was Flame & Citron , about the Danish resistance against Nazi occupation .
The Dutch have likewise done roaring business with Second World War movies , first with Paul Verhoeven 's Black Book ( 2006 ) and now with Winter In Wartime , about a teenage boy protecting a British soldier in hiding during the last winter of the conflict .
We 've had films about Japanese Emperor Hirohito ( Alexander Sokurov 's The Sun ) ; about French Africans fighting against the Nazis ( Days of Glory ) and about black American soldiers fighting in the US army in Italy ( Spike Lee 's Miracle at St Anna ) .
Steven Spielberg seems obsessed by the war ( Empire of the Sun , Schindler 's List and Saving Private Ryan all deal with different aspects of the conflict ) .
In 2006 , Clint Eastwood made two Second World War films back to back – Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima which depicted the same battle from , respectively , American and Japanese viewpoints .
Some of the most feted literary adaptations of recent times , whether Anthony Minghella 's The English Patient or Joe Wright 's Atonement , have the war as their main backcloth .
Second World
War movies come in every shape and guise .
At the Sundance Film Festival this month , audiences will be confronted by Tommy Wirkola 's Dead Snow , which is billed as the first Norwegian Nazi zombie - slasher - feelgood movie .
Peter Jackson has long been linked with a remake of The Dam Busters .
British director Stuart Urban is raising finance for his new comedy , I Was Hitler 's Weatherman , in which Lee Evans will star as a Jewish waiter who takes on the identity of the Führer 's chief meteorologist .
On one level , audiences ' enthusiasm for films about Second World War seems perplexing .
The same spectators who gave the recent batch of Iraq war movies ( Paul Haggis 's In the Valley of Elah , Brian De Palma 's Redacted , etc ) a very wide berth are – it seems – only too willing to watch Tom Cruise with an eye patch in Valkyrie .
Twenty years ago , the Second World War movie seemed almost extinct as a genre .
Vietnam movies such as Apocalypse Now , The Deer Hunter and Platoon had a topicality and delirious feel about them that no stiff - upper - lipped yarn about sinking The Bismark or dropping bouncing bombs could hope to match .
The Dam Busters , The Wooden Horse and The Colditz Story seemed old - fashioned and even disingenuous in the light of a film like Alain Resnais ' Night and Fog ( 1956 ) , which dispassionately showed the horror of the concentration camps .
The sheer formal brilliance of Gillo Pontecorvo 's The Battle of Algiers , about the Algerian war of independence , left most movies about the Second World War looking leaden - footed .
For film - makers today , however , the period is seemingly an acceptable pretext for both nostalgia and escapism .
Unlike Iraq or Vietnam , it seemed a " just " war .
As Michael Apted told me when he was making Enigma ( his thriller celebrating the work of the " boffins " of Bletchley Park ) , " I 've always loved the Second World War .
It just makes me feel proud to be British .
It was the one moment of staggering heroism , when the British stood up against the Germans : against the Nazis .
You go around Europe and you look at all the wonderful cities and you think ' why are they so beautiful ? '
And you realise they were n't fucking bombed because the countries gave in ... most wars are a complete fucking muddle , but this seems to have been a clear war . "
Revisionist historians might take issue with Apted 's characterisation of the Second World War , but his remarks hint at why this remains such an attractive subject , for contemporary British and US film - makers alike .
For a start , there are obvious villains .
No amount of special pleading is going to turn Hitler or Himmler into anything other than embodiments of evil .
The war is also safely in the past .
For younger cinemagoers , the Nazi-occupied France that Tarantino is likely to show in Inglourious Basterds will seem as remote and fantastical as the evil Galactic Empire in Star Wars .
The Brits feel nostalgia for the Second World War on many , often contradictory , levels .
The conflict may have been a time of austerity and rationing , but it saw the loosening of the British class system .
There was sexual liberation , too .
" People think that the Sixties were so sexually open , but it was much more so during the war – there was this sense that this might be your last opportunity .
That heightened people not just sexually but artistically , too .
People felt there was a reason to really push themselves , " notes film - maker Kevin Macdonald , whose grandfather , Emeric Pressburger , scripted such wartime classics as A Canterbury Tale and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp .
For British kids , as films like John Boorman 's Hope and Glory and Spielberg 's Empire of the Sun have shown , the war was exhilarating as well as terrifying .
This was also a golden era for British cinema .
Powell and Pressburger , David Lean and Launder and Gilliat did some of their best work during the war years .
Documentaries such as London Can Take
It and Fires Were Started fixed an image of the Brits as stoical and resilient under fire .
Ealing Studios emerged as a British company celebrating the everyman icon .
Perhaps an added attraction of the era was that this was a time before teen culture – Elvis , James Dean , rock 'n 'roll – and there was less evident generational tension .
Italian cinema also thrived partly as a consequence of the Second World War .
Neorealist movies such as Roberto Rossellini's Rome , Open City ( 1945 ) and Paisa ( 1946 ) , made in the aftermath of the war , had a roughness and vitality that studio - set films conspicuously lacked .
They were shot on the streets .
One of the reasons they are looked back on so fondly is that they were engaged with experiences that ordinary Italians knew at first hand .
In the US likewise , the Second World War years have taken on a roseate hue , and not only in hindsight .
Read the journalism of the great wartime American foreign correspondent Ernie Pyle ( played by Burgess Meredith in William Wellman 's 1945 film , The Story Of GI Joe ) and you are transported into a world as far removed from Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo Bay as it is possible to imagine .
Pyle celebrated the optimism and resourcefulness of the American foot soldiers .
As John Steinbeck wrote , Pyle 's journalism was about a " war of the homesick , weary , funny , violent common men who wash their socks in their helmets , complain about the food , whistle at Arab girls , or any girls for that matter , and bring themselves through as dirty a business as the world has ever seen and do it with humour and dignity and courage " .
Pyle was killed by Japanese machine - gun fire in April 1945 .
The image of American GIs he provided has fed into countless war films , from The Longest Day to Saving Private Ryan .
It 's the idea of the soldiers as resourceful , courageous and optimistic .
They may be womanisers who excite unholy passions in the civilians whose countries they help liberate , but their decency is never in question .
Even the renegades – for example , the misfits under Lee Marvin 's charge in Robert Aldrich 's The Dirty Dozen – retain the basic qualities that Pyle idealised .
Like Pyle , the film - maker Sam Fuller also served in the war .
He was on Omaha Beach in June 1944 .
It is instructive to read his thoughts about war movies .
" To make a real war movie would be to occasionally fire at the audience from behind the screen during the battle scenes , " he once suggested .
His war movies , especially his late masterpiece The Big Red One , are rough and inchoate .
They do n't have a tidy narrative structure .
Battle scenes always seem to feature abandoned children on the sidelines .
Boredom , squalor , terror and cowardice are his themes .
To his detractors , his films seem like B -movies .
Nonetheless , The Big Red One has an authenticity that the far slicker Saving Private Ryan lacks .
After all , Fuller was there .
He was showing on camera what he had experienced at first hand , not relying on newsreels , or juddering camerawork or the testimony of others .
Nor did he feel any yearning to gloss over his experiences .
It was n't only Fuller who had served in the war .
Lee Marvin , the star of The Big Red One and several other war films ( including The Dirty Dozen ) , had also seen combat .
" Lee , who had horrendous experiences of war as a combat marine in World War Two , felt very much as Sam [ Fuller ] did : war is hell , surviving is paramount .
But Lee was left with an enormous feeling of guilt that deeply affected him .
He had lived while so many others died – in front of him and on top of him .
Although he felt that the Second World War had to be fought , he was very anti-war thereafter , " Pam Marvin ( the actor 's widow ) told me when The Big Red One was re-released four years ago .
There was something touching and forlorn about the way the Brits , in particular , clung on to the Second World War movie , even as the years passed .
All those John Mills , Kenneth More and Jack Hawkins films of the 1950s set during the conflict evoked a period when the Brits still seemed to have dignity , purpose and status .
Films such as They Made Me a Fugitive ( 1947 ) , The Ship That Died of Shame ( 1955 ) in which ex-servicemen were drawn into crime , suggested how much some former war heroes struggled to adjust to the drudgery of civilian life in a country that was rapidly losing influence .
By the early 1980s , Second World War films seemed as archaic as old John Wayne westerns .
However , they were still being made .
This , it turned out , was a genre that could take endless different forms and could be reinvented by each new generation .
Soviet director Elem Klimov's Come and See ( 1985 ) was an astonishingly brutal and lyrical account of a teenage boy in Belarus whose family was massacred by the Nazis .
Terrence Malick 's adaptation of James Jones 's novel The Thin Red Line ( 1999 ) was poetical and philosophical in a way that few earlier Second World War movies had been .
Over the years , the Second World War movie has undergone many metamorphoses .
There have been Home Front melodramas such as William Wyler 's Mrs Miniver ( 1942 ) , in which Greer Garson played a British housewife with such glamour and fortitude that some credited her with helping rally the US to Britain 's aid .
There have also been many comedies , for example the films of Ernst Lubitsch , Mel Brooks 's version of To Be or Not To Be and Chaplin 's The Great Dictator , that relished mocking the comic absurdity of the Nazis .
Luchino Visconti's The Damned ( 1969 ) portrayed a German industrialist family in the Nazi era as if they were counterparts to the Borgias .
Some of the best Second World War movies were n't about the war at all , but about the experiences of ex-soliders trying to resume civilian life , for example William Wyler 's The Best Years of our Lives ( 1946 ) .
Meanwhile , documentary makers continue to turn to the war .
Blind Spot : Hitler 's Secretary , Into the Arms of Strangers : Stories of the Kindertransport , K , The Last Days and My Enemy 's Enemy are just some of the many recent feature docs exploring aspects of the 1939 - 1945 conflict .
It is no coincidence that so many countries are making Second World War films now .
At a time when governments seem powerless in the face of a global financial crisis , it is reassuring to celebrate the camaraderie and heroism of an earlier generation .
( Tellingly , the films made in countries that were once occupied by the Nazis are invariably about the resistance fighters and not the collaborators . )
Some current Second World
War films seem based not so much on the historical events that they purport to show , as on earlier movies about the war .
Tarantino , for example , has openly stated that Inglourious Basterds is his version of The Dirty Dozen or a Where Eagles Dare .
He is clearly more interested in Robert Aldrich - style cynicism and spaghetti western - style shoot - em up action than in making a documentary - style drama exploring the origins of the war .
One prediction can safely be made : if audiences around the world like movies the last world war , film - makers will continue making them .
This is one subject that will never be exhausted .
' Valkyrie ' is released on 23 January
All heil !
The actors who 've filled Hitler 's shoes
' Downfall ' : Bruno Ganz
Actors seemingly relish playing Adolf Hitler , regarding the chance of portraying one of history 's ultimate bogeymen as an intriguing formal challenge – a bit like playing Shakespeare 's humpbacked Richard III .
He lends himself to comedy as well as dark , brooding drama .
Some have played him as an arm - twitching , yelling demagogue .
Others have tried to show the man behind the monster .
" He is a human being not a psychopath , " stated Bernd Eichinger , writer and producer of ' Downfall ' ( in which Hitler was played by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz as a tormented , introspective figure in the grips of paranoia . )
' Hitler : The Last Ten Days ' : Alec Guinness
Filmmakers are especially fascinated with Hitler in his final days , when the Third Reich was crumbling around him .
British cinema 's resident chameleon Alec Guinness had a stab at playing Hitler with mixed results this 1973 movie .
Many critics felt that he lurched too close toward parody .
' Hitler : The Rise Of Evil ' : Robert Carlyle
No doubt drawing on his experience terrorising pub drinkers in Leith as Begbie in ' Trainspotting ' , Scottish actor Robert Carlyle was cast as Hitler in this 2003 movie , a sprawling biopic that followed the Austrian 's rise to power .
' Mein Fuhrer ' : Helge Schneider
In 2007 , German director Dani Levy sparked a national debate by satirising Hitler in ' Mein Führer ' , which starred Helge Schneider as a petulant , brattish and incontinent Hitler .
Other countries had been lampooning Hitler for years , but Levy was the first to German to mock the Führer in a screen comedy .
' Valkyrie ' : David Bamber
Here David Bamber is the latest in a long line of British actors to tackle Hitler .
" A low - toned portrait of a paranoiac " is how ' The New Yorker ' characterised his performance .
In other words , Bamber is n't a Hitler in pantomime villain mode – and that is probably a relief .
' Moloch ' : Leonid Mozgovoy
Russian director Alexander Sokurov , who has made a series of features about 20th - century " men of power " ( Emperor Hirohito and Lenin among them ) , recruited Leonid Mozgovoy to play Hitler opposite Elena Rufanova 's Eva Braun in ' Moloch ' ( 1999 ) , set in Bavaria over a weekend in 1942 .
" Murky " and " mind- numbing " complained some critics but David Cronenberg , president of that year 's Cannes jury , was a big fan , making sure the film won Cannes ' Best Screenplay award .
' The Bunker ' : Anthony Hopkins
In his pre-Hannibal Lecter and Richard Nixon days , Anthony Hopkins made an intriguing Hitler in this 1981 TV drama .
He played the Führer as a schizophrenic figure who sounds measured and reasonable one moment , but then rages away like a madman the next .
' Max ' : Noah Taylor
" He [ Hitler ] was n't born in a cloud of sulphur , " agreed director Menno Meyjes who recruited Australian actor Noah Taylor to play Hitler as a young man in ' Max ' ( 2003 ) .
Taylor 's Hitler was a Bohemian would - be artist with the demeanour of a surly adolescent who has a grudge against a world that refuses to take him seriously .

It 's what happens when you get a high profile endorsement .
You tout it .
You let people know that this person likes you and not your opponent .
So when Colin Powell announced his support for Barack Obama , the Obama campaign touted it .
Likewise , when Dick Cheney announced his support for John McCain , the Obama campaign touted it .
Bipartisan Obama
What , is the Democratic nominee so incredibly bipartisan that he 'll put out a press release for both his endorsements and McCain's ?
Apparently so .
Talk about unselfish .
Obama congratulates McCain
Vice President Cheney was in Laramie , Wyoming over the weekend ( where his approval rating is still above freezing ) stumping for Republican candidates when he announced his support for McCain .
The ever - alert Obama campaign took those remarks and pieced together a brand new commercial this morning .
" Wanted to make sure you caught our delightful new ad starring the vice president , " emailed Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
Musical
Different musical selections accompany video of the the high - profile endorsements both candidates have received .
Majestic sounding french horns sound as the announcer says , " Barack Obama , endorsed by Warren Buffet and Colin Powell . "
Frantic 1950 's - like alien invaders attack Earth music underscore a sped - up video of John McCain hyper - blinking with the announcer stating , " And John McCain 's latest endorsement ? "
Cartoonish music is served up with a video of the Vice President announcing , " I 'm delighted to support John McCain and I 'm pleased he 's chosen a running mate with executive talent , toughness and commonsense , our next vice president , Sarah Palin . "
" And boy did McCain earn it , " the announcer dryly ads .
" He voted with Bush and Cheney 90 percent of the time ... and that 's not the change we need . "
Bipartisan McCain
But the always bipartisan McCain team apparently wanted to share the endorsement of Cheney reminding voters that Obama and Cheney are n't just family but -- get this -- are cut from the same political cloth .
“ Barack Obama and Dick Cheney are n't just cousins , they ’ve shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out - of - control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Watch Obama 's new commercial here .
This afternoon , one radio talking head noted that Health Care and College Education are the two industries that really , really have us all by the short - and - curlies .
My gut reaction to this is , “ D’uh ! ” Health Care and College Education are two of the most heavily regulated industries .
Some callers noted that a broken leg cost $ 36,000 or a ruptured appendix cost $ 25,000 for four nights , or that post-natal nursery care costs $ 2,000 regardless of whether the infant spent any time in the nursery .
A caller was quick to chime in with “ The cost of health care in the last decade has risen by 500 % ( or something ) and the cost of cars has only gone up 15 % , why does the government allow this to happen ? “ .
Now , I ’m on record as describing “ universal ” or “ single - payer ” health care as moral hazard of epic proportions , because the concept , almost by definition , violates every principle of proper ( by which I mean “ actuarially sound ” ) insurance .
I would go as far as to suggest that outside of State socialism ( and we all know how well that works … ) universal health care is a metaphysical impossibility : “ Successful ” and “ Single - payer ” should never appear in the same sentence .
In all fairness , the scariest part about Universal Healthcare is the amount of control it would give bureaucrats over your life , as if they do n’t exercise enough already .
But you might dismiss that as tinfoil - hat - paranoia , “ Our bureaucrats are noble and benevolent , ” you might protest .
Fine .
So what if they are ?
Universal , single - payer health care does n’t work in Canada ( e.g. , “ some health care for poor people ” but inadequate care for anyone else ) and it does n’t work in the U.K. ( e.g. , flat - out denials of arguably needed services , etc. ) .
Single - payer health insurance did n’t work in Massachusetts , despite all their ham - fisted attempts to outlaw the laws of economics , and it goddamn - well is n’t going to work anywhere else some half - wit politician tries to implement it .
So , back to the question , “ Why does the government allow this to happen ? ”
The government not only allows this to happen , its policies cause it to happen .
If you think TEH GOVERNMENT is going to solve the “ health - care crisis , ” or the “ education crisis ” , you ’re in for a rude awakening .

The March issue of Shonengahosha 's Young King Ours magazine has announced on Friday that Kouta Hirano will launch his new manga series in the June issue , which will ship on April 30 .
Hirano ended his most famous work , Hellsing , in the same magazine last September after 11 years .
The new work 's title has not been announced yet .
He had originally said in a June 12 blog entry last year that he was planning a fantasy work and a one - shot mystery story set in the early Showa era ( after 1926 ) after he finishes Hellsing .

Nitrogen Triiodide
The well - known explosive crystals Simon Cotton
Uppingham School , Rutland , UK Molecule of the Month December 2001
Also available : JSmol versions .
Sounds like another boring covalent molecule
This one 's explosive !
When dry solid nitrogen triiodide is touched , even with a feather , it decomposes rather violently .
Click on the images below to see an animation .
2 NI 3 ( s ) N 2 ( g ) + 3 I 2 ( s )
Very impressive !
The purple smoke is iodine vapour , I suppose ?
Yes .
In the animation , the shockwave from the first detonation sets off the second sample of NI 3 .
Why is it so explosive ?
The process 2 NI 3 ( s ) N 2 ( g ) + 3 I 2 ( s ) is exothermic , so that N 2 ( g ) + 3 I 2 ( s ) 2 NI 3 ( s ) is endothermic .
Endothermic compounds tend to be unstable .
Is that all ?
Not at all , things are more complicated than they seem .
Traditionally , nitrogen triiodide is made by reacting iodine with aqueous ammonia solution .
That does not produce NI 3 , an ammonia complex is obtained instead .
This is either [ NI 3 . NH 3 ] or [ NI 3 .
( NH 3 ) 3 ] , and the ammonia can not be removed from this .
So can pure NI 3 be made ?
This was n't achieved until 1990 , when it was found that boron nitride reacted with iodine monofluoride in CFCl 3 at - 30°C .
BN + 3 IF BF 3 + NI 3
What is pure NI 3 like ?
It 's a dark red solid that can be sublimed in a vacuum at - 20 °C .
It decomposes at 0 °C , sometimes explosively .
Can you make other nitrogen trihalides ?
Yes , certainly , thanks to some brave and intrepid chemists .
NCl 3 was the first of the family to be made in 1811 , by Pierre L.Dulong , who later became Professor of Chemistry at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris ; he lost 3 fingers and an eye in studying it .
He made it by the reaction of chlorine with slightly acidic NH 4 Cl .
The main route used commercially today is the electrolysis of slightly acidic ammonium chloride ; the NCl 3 is removed as fast it is formed using an air current .
This air / NCl 3 mixture is much more stable than pure NCl 3 and is commercially important .
It is also formed in swimming pools when the chlorine gas used to disinfect the water reacts with nitrogen compounds found in urine , and can be a health risk to people like lifeguards who work continuously around the water .
NCl 3 can be formed when chlorine reacts with nitrogen compounds in wastewater treatment plants .
The particular danger associated with the formation of NCl 3 under these conditions is that a combination of its sensitive nature and low solubility in water leads to explosive droplets of NCl 3 .
Stable NF 3 was first made in 1928 by Otto Ruff , a German chemist ( d.1939 ) who probably made more fluorides than anyone else , by electrolysis of a molten mixture of ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride .
Another route uses the reaction of ammonia with fluorine / nitrogen mixtures over a copper catalyst .
4NH 3 + 3 F 2 NF 3 + 3 NH 4 F
NBr 3 was originally synthesised in 1975 by the reaction of bis( trimethylsilyl ) bromamine with ClBr at - 78°C .
( Me 3 Si ) 2 NBr + 2 BrCl NBr 3 + 2 Me 3 SiCl
What are they like ?
NF 3 is pretty unreactive at room temperature ; it is not affected by water and only reacts with most metals on heating .
NCl 3 is much more reactive ; it is light - sensitive and , like all the other halides , apart from NF 3 , explosive .
All these compounds are volatile , as expected for small covalent molecules .
Why is NF 3 stable but the others are unstable ?
For all these compounds , it is possible to work out ΔH f for the formation of NX 3 in the gas phase , using bond energies .
N 2 ( g ) + 3 X 2 ( g ) 2 NX 3 ( g )
The process is not especially favourable owing to the difficulty in breaking the very strong N - N triple bond ( E( N - N ) = 945 kJ mol - 1 ) .
Using values for the F-F and N - F bond energies of 159 and 278 kJ mol - 1 , respectively , ΔH f ) = - 123 kJ mol - 1 ( per mole of NF 3 ) ; similarly , for ammonia , using H - H and N - H bond energies of 436 and 390 kJ mol - 1 , respectively , ΔH f = - 43 kJ mol - 1 ( per mole of NH 3 ) .
In contrast , using I - I and N - I bond energies of 151 and 169 kJ mol - 1 , respectively , ΔH f per mole of NI 3 = + 192 kJ mol -1 .
One factor making NF 3 more stable than the other NX 3 is the very low F - F bond energy ( 159 kJ mol - 1 ) .
This has been ascribed to repulsions between lone pairs on the two rather proximate fluorine atoms .
Additionally , the N - F bond is also particularly strong , as would be expected for a linkage between two elements in the first short period .
The other NX 3 molecules may be less stable than NF 3 owing to congestion round the small central nitrogen atom leading to non-bonded repulsive interactions between the halogens .
This is particularly bad for large iodine atoms , as can be seen in the space - fill image of NI 3 , right .
What is their structure ?
In all these compounds , the nitrogen atom has a complete " octet " , with four outer - shell electron pairs ; one of these is a non-bonding ( " lone " ) pair .
These arrange themselves as far apart as possible around the nitrogen atom in a roughly tetrahedral disposition , to minimise repulsions between the negative charge clouds .
However , because repulsions involving lone pairs are stronger than those involving just bond pairs , the X - N - X angles are a little under the regular tetrahedral angle of 109½° ; thus the value for ammonia , NH 3 , is 107.5° .
Because fluorine is much more electronegative than hydrogen , the bond pairs of electrons are attracted away from nitrogen , so that in NF 3 the bond angle is actually 102.3° .
In contrast , the corresponding value for NCl 3 is 107.1° , although on electronegativity grounds it would be expected to be intermediate between the values for NF 3 and NH 3 .
This may possibly be due to non-bonded Cl ... Cl repulsions .
The molecules themselves have a trigonal ( triangular ) pyramid shape .
They are , of course , polar .
NF 3 has a small dipole moment ( 0.234D ) in comparison with NH 3 ( 1.42D ) ; an explanation for this is that the moment due to the nitrogen atom and its lone pair is in opposition to the moment associated with the three polar N - F bonds in NF 3 .
NCl 3 also has a small dipole moment ( 0.6D ) .
They sound very exotic - do they actually have any uses ?
NCl 3 is used as a dilute mixture in air to bleach and sterilise flour and as a fungicide for citrus fruits and melons .
The semiconductor industry uses NF 3 as an etchant of thin films , also for cleaning up chemical vapour deposition chambers , both uses depending on the use of a plasma to produce fluorine from NF 3 .
It is also used as an oxidizer of high energy fuels , for the preparation of tetrafluorohydrazine ( another fuel ) , and for the fluorination of fluorocarbon olefins , whilst it has been studies as a high - energy oxidiser for HF - DF chemical lasers .

Researchers have captured for the first time a geological event considered key in shaping the Earth 's landscape .
An international research team led by Eric Calais , a Purdue University professor of geophysics , was able to measure ground displacements as two tectonic plates in Africa moved apart and molten rock pushed its way toward the surface during the first so - called " dyking event " ever recorded within the planet 's continental crust .
The event left a wall of magma 6 miles long and 5 feet wide wedged between the two plates .
A paper detailing the event will be published Dec. 11 in Nature .
Dyking events have been reported in the thin oceanic crust but had never been directly observed and quantified in the thicker areas of the planet 's shell , Calais said .
" Such dyking events had been included in theories , but researchers had never before been in the right place at the right time with the right equipment to record them , " Calais said .
" The event was preceded by a slow slipping of the tectonic plates along a fault line .
This also had not been seen before .
Faults usually slip suddenly , which produces earthquakes , but this was a very seismically quiet course of events that lasted about one week . "
The existence of these events provides a key element of how the Earth 's rigid outer shell - the lithosphere - breaks apart and moves .
The known forces pushing and pulling on continents are not powerful enough to break them apart .
However , repeated dyking events could weaken the lithosphere severalfold , allowing it to shift and break under far less force , Calais said .
" To break a continent apart , one needs to overcome the strength of the Earth 's lithosphere , " he said .
" But when we calculate the forces available from plate tectonics , we find that they are not large enough to do the job .
We know that continents break apart and have done so repeatedly in the geological past .
So , how can it happen ?
One way is to add a little push to the system , and this is exactly what dyke intrusions do . "
During a dyke intrusion , magma held in deep reservoirs breaks through surrounding rock and rises toward the surface , forcing the two plates apart , and , over time , weakening the lithosphere by transferring heat to the surrounding rocks .
The magma fills and widens cracks and fractures as it rises .
The end result is a vertical wall , or dyke , of magma that has pushed the Earth 's crust apart , he said .

" Eventually , if these events occur over and over again for millions of years , an ocean will form between the two plates , " he said .
" So , today in Tanzania , we are really witnessing the earliest stages of ocean formation . "
Calais and his collaborators captured this event in Tanzania 's Lake Natron basin during the summer of 2007 .
The basin lies near the southern tip of the eastern branch of the East African Rift , the area where the Somalia and Nubia tectonic plates are moving apart .
Reports of a series of moderate earthquakes from northern Tanzania felt all the way to Nairobi in Kenya caught the team 's attention .
French collaborators had installed seismographs in the vicinity of the Natron basin a few months before the event and recorded more than 600 small earthquakes in two weeks , pinpointing the center of the tectonic activity .
Tanzanian researchers were able to collect Global Positioning System ( GPS ) measurements in the Natron area .
Calais compared these measurements with those taken earlier to determine the amount of displacement of the Earth 's surface .
But these displacements did not match what was expected from the earthquakes .
" The displacement was much too large given the small size of the earthquakes , which was the first lead that something unusual was happening , " Calais said .
" Soon after these earthquakes , one of the volcanoes in the area entered an explosive eruptive stage , which indicated that magma was involved .
So we had an idea this might be a dyking event . "
He then worked with colleagues in Luxembourg to obtain radar interferometry ( InSAR ) data , which provided a detailed picture of ground movements .
A team of led by Belgium scientists went to the area for a field check and mapped 13 miles of open fissures that corresponded well with the observations from InSAR data .

" Once we had all of the measurements , in particular the InSAR data , we knew that the combined dataset could only be explained by the injection of a dyke , " Calais said .
" If we had only the GPS data and / or seismic activity data , this would have been difficult to prove .
We needed all of these methods to really understand what was happening . "
A dyking event is mostly an aseismic process , meaning it does not create large earthquakes or release a lot of ground - shaking energy .
It would be easy to miss such an occurrence without some of the advanced geodetic measurement technology available today , he said .
" When you look at events like this with only one measurement tool , you are half blind , " Calais said .
" You are missing a lot of what the planet is telling us .
Sometimes it whispers instead of shouting . "
It is possible that there have been several dyking events on the East African Rift within the past few decades , he said .
" If there is evidence that these events have been happening within recent time , there is no reason not to believe that they have been happening for several million years , " Calais said .
" This could then be a very important contribution to the dynamics of the East African Rift system . "
Co-authors of the paper include Nicolas d'Oreye and Anneleen Oyen from the National Museum of Natural History in Luxembourg ; Julie Albaric , Jacques Déverchère and Julie Perrot from the University of Brest in France ; Anne Deschamps from the National Center for Scientific Research in France ; Damien Delvaux , Francois Kervyn , Benoit Smets and Christelle Wauthier from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium ; Cynthia Ebinger from the University of Rochester ; Richard W. Ferdinand from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania ; Athanas S. Macheyeki from the Renard Centre of Marine Geology in Belgium ; Elifuraha Saria from Ardhi University in Tanzania ; and D. Sarah Stamps from Purdue .
Calais and his collaborators next will watch the surrounding area for the aftermath of this dyking event .
" When a large event like this occurs , the state of stress on the Earth 's upper layers are changed , and we expect several additional events to follow , " Calais said .
" Other magma reservoirs may be touched and trigger another dyking event .
It will take a while for the system to relax again and get back to its quiet , steady - state , behavior . "
His team also plans to examine the area in more detail to try to discover evidence of past dyking events .
This information could illustrate any historical patterns in the incidences of these events and how regularly they occur .
" At stake is a better understanding of geohazards in East African countries , whose fragile economy may easily be disrupted even by seismic or volcanic events of moderate magnitude , " Calais said .

Advertisement Israel 's air assault on Gaza is " the first in several stages " of operations aimed at ending militant rocket fire , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said .
As bombing continued for a fourth day , another top official said Israel was ready for " long weeks of action " .
Palestinian officials say more than 360 people have been killed since Saturday .
Four Israelis have died in rocket fire .
As EU officials met to discuss the crisis , some reports from Israel said it was considering a temporary truce .
Mr Olmert was set to discuss the idea of a 48 - hour suspension , suggested by France , with his officials later in the day , the French news agency AFP said .
But Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer warned a truce would allow militant group Hamas - which controls Gaza - " to regain strength ... and prepare an even stronger attack against Israel " .
US President Bush agreed in a telephone conversation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that for any ceasefire to be effective it had to respected by Hamas , the White House said .
A BBC reporter says Israeli tanks and troops are massed along Gaza 's border .
Correspondents say this could be a prelude to ground operations , but could also be intended to build pressure on Hamas .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana called for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of crossings to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza , as EU foreign ministers held talks in Paris to discuss the crisis .
Foreign ministers from the Quartet trying to broker peace in the Middle East - the US , Russia , the UN and the EU - also held a conference call , no details of which were released .
' Defenceless population '
On Tuesday , Israeli jets attacked more targets linked to Hamas , hitting a number of government buildings and security installations .
See detailed map of attacks
At least 10 people were killed and 40 said to have been wounded in the raids .
One air strike killed two sisters , the eldest aged 11 , riding in a donkey cart in Beit Hanoun , northern Gaza , Palestinian medical sources said .
Gaza aid boat ' rammed by Israel ' US tacitly backs Israeli offensive Aid worker diary : Gaza raids Rocket attacks plague Israeli towns
The UN has called for an investigation into the attacks , which are causing heavy civilian casualties .
It says at least 62 of the Palestinians killed so far were women and children .
Richard Falk - the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories - said the international community must put more pressure on Israel to end its assault .
" Israel is committing a shocking series of atrocities by using modern weaponry against a defenceless population - attacking a population that has been enduring a severe blockade for many months , " Mr Falk said in a BBC interview .
But Israeli officials said there was more to come .
The Israeli military " has made preparations for long weeks of action " , deputy defence minister Matan Vilnai said .
Mr Olmert 's statement that the bombardment was " the first of several stages approved by the security cabinet " was quoted from a briefing he gave to President Shimon Peres on Tuesday .
Separately , Israeli naval vessels confronted pro-Palestinian activists seeking to break the Gaza blockade by boat .
The activists said one vessel rammed them ; their boat made port in Lebanon with heavy damage on one side .
Rocket fire
The Egyptian - Gaza border was due to be opened to permit more trucks carrying aid to enter the territory , and for wounded Palestinians to be transported to Egyptian hospitals .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , under popular pressure to open the crossing fully , said that could not happen while Hamas , rather than the Palestinian Authority , led by its rival Fatah , controlled the border .
Demonstrators in Yemen , angered by Egypt 's co-operation with the blockade on Gaza , briefly stormed the country 's consulate in Aden , where they burned an Egyptian flag and hoisted a Palestinian one .
There have been angry protests against the Israeli offensive in many other cities across the Arab world and in several European capitals .

Hamas has pressed on with rocket and mortar assaults , killing three Israeli civilians and a soldier in areas that have not previously suffered such fatalities .
Israeli military officials said rocket attacks landing more than 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Gaza put nearly 10 % of Israel 's population of seven million within range .
Israeli political leaders have been under pressure to act against rocket fire with a general election looming in early February .
Opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu has backed the offensive , telling the BBC that " Israel is using a fraction of its power to try to target surgically the terrorists " .
The strikes began less than a week after the expiry of a six - month - long ceasefire deal with Hamas , which has controlled Gaza since 2007 .
Correspondents say short of a full - scale invasion of Gaza , it is unlikely Israel will be able to prevent rocket fire permanently .
Israel dismantled its strategic settlements and military bases in Gaza in 2005 but has kept tight control over access in and out of the narrow coastal strip and its airspace .

CHAIN OF COMMAND FOR TREASON
By Andrew C. Wallace
October 28 , 2007
NewsWithViews.com
It is imperative for our survival that Americans know that Elites control most everything and everybody and are responsible for damn near every bad thing happening in the United States .
Elites control everything using the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ consisting of Elites and their Foundations who rule Corporations which in turn control Government Officials in all three Branches .
Many Elites are also government officials and consider it to be the family business just like royalty .
Americans must know identity of these Elites , how they are responsible for invaders killing , raping , robbing , and molesting millions of Americans every year .
Americans must also know how Elites are at war with average Americans in every possible way , they are systematically looting us and our country , converting us into an impoverished nation of slaves , and stealing our sovereignty .
Elites are the leaders of both political parties , there is no difference between the parties , they are partners in everything .
Government Officials are ignoring their Solemn Oath of Office by refusing to obey the Constitution and Laws of the United States .
Elites cause far more death and destruction than terrorists .
Our Constitution in simple unambiguous language calls this Treason , and so should you .
Let me give you another current example of how every American is being robbed and forced to pay more for everything they need which benefits Elites .
Recently American banking and financial institutions controlled by Elites , gambled and lost big time in the sub - prime real estate market causing great losses and a shortage of liquidity .
The Federal Reserve choose to bail out the banking and finance corporations by having average Americans pay more for everything they buy .
This was done by putting Billions of dollars into the banking system and lowering interest rates that banks pay .
This resulted in a decline in value of the dollar to an all time low forcing all Americans to pay more for everything they need to bail out the corporations .
Every dollar you have in savings or pensions has lost value to save Elites from loss and this is part of an ongoing operation .
As a bonus this also resulted in corporations making more money in dollars from overseas investments .
Any first year Economics student could have predicted this result with certainty .
Inflation , and theft like the preceding has been going on since the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913 .
Our Constitution calls for our currency to be in gold and silver or backed by it .
If that was still true it would reduce government flexibility and the recent debacle and ongoing scams would have been impossible .
Any currency without substantial backing in gold is subject to manipulation , theft and ultimately economic destruction .
History without exception substantiates this fact .
Continuing decline of dollar relative to gold and other currencies will steal everything you have and leave you to die homeless , hungry and in pain as a slave of Elites , I guarantee it .
This is how Hitler came to power in Germany .
When I left service after the Korean War wives did not have to work and a new car cost me about $ 2,000 .
Now it takes two or more to support a family and that car costs 15 times as much .
Anyone who does not see this as a reduction in your standard of living is just a plain idiot .
This is an example of the redistribution of wealth from the bottom up .
If you read the Oct. 2 , 2007 article by Richard C. Cook you will learn that our dollar has declined by 95 % with the Federal Reserve Note .
Dr. Cook said that ï¿ ½a monetary system based on lending must result in the migration of all a nations wealth into hands of lenders .
The Federal Reserve mainly assures as its first priority that the wealth held by banks will not be diminished .
Since the recession of 1979 - 83 , the concentration of wealth in the hands of the nations upper income groups , i.e. those with money to lend or invest has been increasing .
We have had inflation for 38 years .
The U.S. is teetering on the edge of a major financial collapse right now .
In fact , those with money are quietly trying to secure their wealth while the unfortunate ones who are heavily mortgaged or locked into inflexible retirement accounts may be left holding the bagï¿½ .
Iglitzin and Hill wrote on 7-1-07 that a 2005 study by the Federal Reserve found the top 10 % of income earners own 70 % of wealth , top 1 % own more than the bottom 95 % .
These are examples of the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ at work .
The average American must be told in simple blunt terms that Elites and their Foundations are mostly anti-American and socialist .
They control our Banking , Finance , Media , and Business Corporations along with many teachers at all levels who have no loyalty to this country or to its citizens either .
Americans must be told that Government officials in all three branches who fail to obey their oath of office , our Constitution and Laws are guilty of Treason .
The ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ is really simple : Elites and Foundations control Corporations which in turn control Government Officials .
We must fight these people and show them our rage and contempt .
You must fight them in every possible way .
As consumers you control 75 % of economy so stop buying from those who tell you to press one for English or offer you cheap and dangerous imports .
Tell all of them in a point blank and angry way how and why you hold them in contempt .
Be especially plain spoken with government officials who have sold you out , they are not entitled to any respect .
Do not buy anything from companies who outsource .
Bank of America is guilty of treason for profit by assisting invaders to remain in this country and no one should do business with them .
When you see a business with obvious illegal employees ask the owner and tell him you are reporting him to ICE .
When Verizon installed their fiber optic cable in Tampa recently there was not a single worker who spoke English , I informed Verizon and ICE .
Remember that corporations and their masters have no loyalty to anything but power and money .
Even the AFL - CIO are greedy whores by supporting illegal invaders who are replacing American workers and lowering wages .
In other words you must be loud and obnoxious , but legal with enemies of the people .
You have been told that a service based economy is viable , that is a damn lie .
You must have manufacturing .
Every job in manufacturing supports 5 - 7 service jobs .
Millions of illegals have been induced and allowed to invade our country and remain for cheap wages and government benefits by those in the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ .
This Treason has resulted in cheap wages and excess profits of Blood Money for employers of invaders .
It is Blood Money because millions of Americans were allowed to be killed , raped , robbed or molested for profit every year .
Any government benefits given to illegals reduces your standard of living , value of the dollar and enriches traitors in the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treason .ï¿½
American taxpayers are subsidizing the illegal workers because government is paying for medical care , incarceration , education and social programs .
Corporations have done everything possible to reduce wages and eliminate jobs of Americans by moving manufacturing to other countries or by importing .
Even service jobs are outsourced .
Bill
Gates of Microsoft , an Elitist , wanted unlimited visas so he could hire foreign workers at a savings of $ 12,000 a year per worker .
When he did not get it he said he would go to Canada .
As the richest Elitist in the world he is no patriot , he just wants more money and to hell with Americans .
Gates is no different than the other greedy power mad Elites .
It should be clear that most of the Elites and Foundations are socialists and communists who hate our Constitution and Republican form of government , they believe in a worldwide totalitarian and Godless dictatorship run by and for the Elites
These traitors emulate the actions of Hitler in so many ways ..
The former President Bush promoted this New World Order numerous times in speeches as did his son .
Mostly Foundations were formed to evade taxes and allow wealthy families to maintain control of their corporations and support things that they otherwise could not .
Some Foundations started with worthy goals that did not last .
These foundations support among other things : same sex marriage , incest , Mideast extremist groups , multiculturalism , multilingualism , uncontrolled illegal immigration , one world government , loss of our borders , loss of our sovereignty and loss of our freedom and rights as Americans .
Foundations have a fantastic $ 500 Billion in assets to spend tax free with no control .
This is where La Raza and the other anti-American and open borders groups get their money .
Some of the more infamous foundations are the Ford , Rockefeller , Pew , Carnegie , and of course the Soros .
You remember George Soros who Said ï¿ ½The main obstacle to a stable and just world is the United Statesï¿½ .
Moveon .
Org is an example of his money at work .
ï¿ ½Historian Oswald Spengler foresaw what many American liberals cannot or donï¿½t want to see : A huge segment of the political left has come to be manipulated if not controlled by its supposed enemy ---- the superï¿½rich .
Author Hilaire Belloc in The Servile State predicted that monopoly capitalism and socialism would basically , down the road , join hands to establish a new ï¿½servile civilizationï¿½ .
Both of these quotes and much of my information on Foundations came from the great scholarship of Phil Kent in his new book ï¿ ½Foundations of Betrayal - How the Liberal Super - Rich Undermine Americaï¿½ .
You will find many of our Enemy Elites and their suck - ups are members of one or more of these groups : the Council on Foreign Relations , Trilateral Commission , and the Bilderberg Group .
Most Americans do not know what the hell is going on because the Corporate Owned Media run by their Liberal Slaves refuses to Inform them .
These media liberals will be responsible for the death and enslavement of Americans and are effectively bringing about the same end result as those who led their own people into Nazi gas chambers .
The big difference is that our liberals sold us out for money , ignorance and cowardice , while the others did it to live one more day .
Some say that Americans will just beg like whipped dogs when faced with this reality , and some might , but millions of Americans will go into a killing rage .
We must defeat the Elites before it gets this far or it will be a pyrrhic victory with few Elites remaining .
Defeating these traitors is simple , but not easy .
We must defeat any politician regardless of party who refuses to end all immigration of any kind for 10 years , deport all illegals , terminate anchor baby citizenships as illegal , terminate NAFTA , all trade agreements and treaties , defeat UN Law of the Sea Treaty , use whatever force is required to close borders and protect Americans , no language but English , prosecute employers of illegals , accept nothing from anyone , limit individual campaign contributions to $ 100 per candidate per election , obey Constitution and laws , impeach and / or prosecute any judge or official who fails to follow our laws and constitution to the letter .
In the meantime we attack Elites by getting legislation to end the scam of tax free foundations .
We encourage Americans to take legal action against employers of illegals who harmed them and all government officials , especially those in sanctuary cities , who contrary to the law did not do everything possible to keep illegals out of the country or to deport them .
Lawyers can get rich on contingency contracts by representing the Millions of Americans who have been harmed by illegal invaders who were encouraged and protected contrary to the constitution and laws of the United States .
The following hints will help your lawyer .
Anyone who , under color of law , deprives any citizen of rights , privileges , or immunities secured by United States Constitution is subject to civil and / or criminal penalties pursuant to Title 42 United States Code , section 1983 , 1985 , 1986 and / or Title 18 United States Code section 241 and 242 .
Our poor people were the first to lose employment to illegals , and no one noticed or cared .
Then our middle class lost many of their jobs and nothing was done .
Dr. Dennis Cuddy reported in News With Views that we lost 3 million manufacturing jobs just since Bush became President .
This results in the loss of 15 - 21 million service jobs .
Now jobs that require college education are being replaced by foreign workers here and overseas and government is trying to bring in even more foreign replacements .
The college educated and professional workers better join this fight while they have the chance before they too are impoverished .
Socialist professors and teachers promoted this treason and it is poetic justice that they too will be impoverished by it because there will be no students nor money to fund their employment or benefits .
Dr. Alan Blinder reported that 30 - 40 million more U.S. jobs are at risk from free trade .
Again this reminds me of the mindset of people in Nazi Germany .
Our low unemployment rate is a perfect example of how figures donï¿½t lie but the people using them sure do by excluding from the count everyone who is unemployed and has given up hope of getting a job .
This number almost equals the number of employed foreign born .
For details go to cis.org and heritage.org .
Now the ï¿ ½Chain of Command for Treasonï¿½ with leaders of both political parties is trying to sell us out again by passing the UN Law of the Sea Treaty .
Cliff Kincaid in News With Views reported on 10 - 5- 07 that this Treaty supported by presidents Carter , Clinton , both Bushes and leaders of both political parties will subvert U.S. Sovereignty in favor of the UN .
During the hearings in Congress State Department Officials were caught in bald faced lies by Senator Vitter .
It is imperative that you call your Senators to defeat this treaty unless you want UN Bureaucrats telling us what we can and canï¿½t do .

Yesterday was a historic day .
On January 20th , 2009 , Barack H. Obama was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States of America - the first African - American ever to hold the office of U.S. Commander - in - Chief .
The event was witnessed by well over one million attendees in chilly Washington D.C. , and by many millions more through coverage on television and the Internet .
Collected here are photographs of the event , the participants , and some of the witnesses around the world .
( 48 photos total
The remote island of Ukerewe , several hours across Lake Victoria and two days overland from the capital of Tanzania , is the one remaining shelter , a place where albinos can live in relative safety .
" Life is better here on the island , " says Alphonce Kajanja .
Standing in Ukerewe 's main market he is just like any other fishmonger , only his hat shades a white face with swollen liquid eyes and cracked lips .
He says there have been no albino murders on the island .
" People here do n't believe in this satanic campaign . "
Elsewhere , the killing continues .
In the past week , two more Tanzanian albinos were murdered .
Elizabeth Hussein was hacked to pieces by men with machetes in Shinyanga province last Tuesday .
She was just 13 .
Then Ezekiel John , 47 , was shot and had his arms and legs cut off near the city of Kigoma on Thursday .
Their deaths bring the toll to 35 murders in just more than a year .

There is similar violence throughout east and central Africa .
And even in west and southern Africa , albinos face persecution and discrimination .
The campaign is being orchestrated by witch doctors who claim they can make people rich using limbs and blood from their white - skinned neighbours .
In some areas , albino children go to school with bodyguards , others hide at home , and distraught relatives pile rocks on their dead loved ones to deter grave - robbers .
I had been brought to Ukerewe by the Tanzanian Albino Society , an organisation set up to fight discrimination which is entirely funded by the UK - based charity Action on Disability and Development , one of the three charities being supported by this year 's Independent Christmas Appeal .
Ukerewe is believed to have the highest concentration of albinos in the world .
No one here is sure why there are so many zeru , the Swahili word for " ghosts " .
Some believe an unknown mineral in the fish the islanders live on makes mothers have albino babies .
Others say intermarriage has bred an increased minority compelled to stick together .
Ukerewe 's elders tell a different story of a nearby islet of Kilita where unwanted albino children would be dumped by families that could not bear the stigma .
According to this tale , fishermen would sometimes take pity on the abandoned ones and take them in or give them to families they call " samaritans " on Ukerewe .
Whatever the cause , among the tin shacks , fishing dhows and tropical fruit trees of Lake Victoria 's largest island there are an extraordinary number of people with the distinctive white skin , gingery blond hair and pale eyes .
Albinism is an inherited disorder .
It derives from a congenital lack of the melanin pigment which protects the skin , eyes and hair from the sun 's ultraviolet rays .
Some have very poor vision , though not all have red eyes as myth often suggests ; most have blue , others have hazel or brown eyes .
But all forms of albinism are associated with vision problems and those who have the condition are " legally " blind .
What all albinos have in common is that they are rare .
In most parts of the world , only one person in 20,000 has some form of albinism .
In Denmark , the prevalence is one in 60,000 , but in Africa it is thought to be about one in 5,000 .
In sub -Saharan Africa they are immediately visible ; too white to be black .
In Tanzania , an east African giant of a country that stretches beneath the equator from the Indian Ocean to the great lakes of Victoria and Tanganyika , people are five times more likely to have some form of albinism .
Estimates of the numbers of albinos in the country differ , some are as high as 200,000 , all of them complicated by the stigma attached to their condition which in many cases makes their family hide them from the outside world .
But the prevalence has led many researchers to consider whether the original genetic variant may be traceable to this region of East Africa , or even to Ukerewe itself .

Counting his tilapia fish on the slab , Alphonce Kajanja has a simpler explanation .
" When God saw how they treated us , the names they called us and how they killed their own children , he sent them more albino children .
We are a punishment from God . "
Until now , the fishmonger 's main enemies have been prejudice and skin cancer .
At 48 , he has so far fended off the sun which burns here with an unforgiving intensity ot his defenceless skin .
Thanks to his lifelong hobby of weight - lifting , he has been better prepared than most to confront the other enemy .
A son of non-albino parents who accepted his condition , he grew up among the tough streetchildren of Ukerewe 's main town , learning to fight for everything .
He used that ability to get his pitch in the fish market and that status to get a non-albino wife , an extremely unusual distinction .
He has had five children , none of them albino , and has won the grudging acceptance of his peers .
Few have been so lucky .
Less than a handful of albinos on Ukerewe have an actual job .
In an already impoverished community , access to the goodwill and charity of the extended family or clan is vital to most peoples ' survival .
For albinos , a lifetime of social exclusion and abject poverty is all that awaits .
Many albino children , uneducated about their condition , are left to a life of harsh labour in the sun : the result is catastrophic skin damage , agonising side - effects and an early death .
Skin cancer means a life expectancy of just 30 .
None of Alphonce 's four albino brothers and sisters have survived .
Beyond the shores of Ukerewe , an even worse fate awaits .
The one - time zeru are hearing a different nickname called to them now , " money " : they are seen as walking bank notes .
Jospehat Torner is attempting to document the horrific killing spree that has left albinos feeling " terrified and hunted " .
An albino himself , his outfit is designed for maximum protection from the sun .
A baseball cap is pulled down tight to shade his face , and a suit and tie defy the soaring temperature .
Despite these precautions , he looks much older than his 34 years .
Mr Torner is a leading campaigner with the Tanzanian Albino Society , an organisation set up to fight discrimination that has found itself fighting for life itself .
He says last week 's murder of the 13 - year - old girl was typical .
She had been tempted to leave the safety of her home to see a film about Jesus being shown on a projector near to her village .
All the local children went .
On the way back is when those he calls the " greedy people " got her .
" They chopped off her legs and her arms , " he adds , gesturing with a look of pain as if he was losing his own limbs .
The question , he says , is , " Who is the consumer of these body parts ?
When you go to the traditional healers they say it 's the fishermen ; when you go to the fishermen they say it 's the miners .
And they blame the traditional healers . "
In fact , the evidence already points in one direction alone , the healers or witch doctors who have started to market albino bones , skin , hair and blood as ingredients in potions that will make people rich .
One man was caught trying to enter DRC with the head of an albino child in his luggage .
He said he was taking it to a businessman in Congo who was going to pay for the head according to its weight .
The severed limbs of Elizabeth Hussein were found on the premises of a local witch doctor .
But he was tipped off and escaped police .
Like many members of TAS , Mr Torner has been trying to make himself more visible at just the time where it is most dangerous to do so .
Everywhere he goes , he must register with the local police and district commissioner to let them know he is there .
His mobile phone , which he must hold inches from his face to see who is calling , so poor is his eye - sight , has been ringing with death threats .
" They say to me , ' Where are you ?
We want to kill you ' .
And I say , ' fine , let 's meet ' . "
TAS believes its mission to reach out to the multitude of albinos in Tanzania – and educate them , bring them into the open and teach them their rights – is the only way to fight back in what has become a battle for survival .
The non -profit group does not have the resources to face the mounting crisis and has been utterly reliant on the British charity ADD ( Action on Disability and Development ) .
" Support for TAS is vital if albinos are to secure the of basic human rights of safety , security and freedom , " said ADD 's acting chief executive , Jabulani Ncube .
Last month , when the death toll stood at 30 , TAS drew thousands of people to a protest march to highlight the killings .
It organised another protest on Saturday and plans weekly demonstrations through December .
The Tanzanian government – appalled to see the country 's cherished reputation as a haven of stability and development collapsing – has been scrambling , after an acutely slow start , to look busy .
The President , Jakaya Kikwete , was guest of honour at the 19 October demonstration and has recently sponsored the country 's first albino MP .
Practising witch doctors have been arrested by the score and death sentences threatened to those found guilty ; so far , no one has been successfully prosecuted and the killings continue .
The fear has reached Ukerewe .
In Masahonga , at the end of a 100 km dirt road that connects the nearest paved road with the ferry to Ukerewe , a crowd had gathered last week .
The district commissioner used a megaphone to hammer home the message that albino murders must stop .
In angry Swahili , she denounces the witch doctors as " liars " .
But the deadly cocktail of traditional beliefs and modern avarice will not be easily neutralised .
Mr Torner has an even darker view .
He believes the murders may have been going on unnoticed for many years .
Countless numbers of albino babies die in childbirth .
" What 's to stop a nurse killing an albino baby and saying that it died of natural causes . "
Nobody knows how many disappeared before people started keeping count .
The lives of many albinos have been lived in total seclusion .
Inside some homes , albino graves have been dug and marked .
People have grown up , he says , being told albinos are ghosts .
" We do n't die , " he says .
" We just disappear . "

An Obama administration could give the federal courts a decidedly leftward turn .
Obama presidency could reshape courts
While the differences between John McCain and Barack Obama blur on some issues , there is no mistaking the gap between them on the subject of the Federal courts .
McCain has stressed his preference for judges and justices who defer to the elected branches of the government .
Obama has stressed just the opposite , a preference for appointees who check “ majoritarian impulses . ”
Advertisement
McCain , in his most extensive speech about the Supreme Court , challenged a ruling he felt abridged Americans ’ property rights .
Obama , by contrast , has chosen in his campaign to attack a ruling that made it harder for women to sue for equal pay .
Obama ’s ideal appointee recognizes “ who the weak are , and who the strong are in our society . ”
McCain stresses judges who show “ self - restraint . ”
Beyond their differences over Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion , the gap between McCain and Obama reprises the struggle for the court between liberals and conservatives underway since the 1970s .
Either man through his appointments could have a profound impact on the judiciary for decades to come , with McCain continuing the conservative ascendance brought about by the Reagan and Bush years and Obama striving to reverse it .
At the Supreme Court level , a single new justice joining the reliably conservative bloc — which includes Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia , Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — could indeed threaten Roe , while a new justice opposed to capital punishment , for example , could build momentum for blocking the death penalty once again .
In fact , Obama stands a greater chance than any Democratic President since Lyndon Johnson of making an impact on the both the appeals courts and the Supreme Court , especially if the Democrats get 60 seats in the Senate , which must confirm appointments .
Among the reasons , say court observers , is the unique knowledge he and his running mate would bring to the process .
Obama , a Harvard Law School graduate , was a lecturer at the University of Chicago for 12 years , from 1992 to 2004 , when he was elected to the U.S. Senate .
Biden , who earned his law degree at Syracuse , chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 through 1995 , presiding over the stormy confirmation hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork , and opposing both nominations .
“ The first thing to know about Obama , which has n’t gotten sufficient attention , is that he is himself appointable to the Supreme Court , ” said Harvard Law School ’s Cass Sunstein , an Obama friend , advisor and former faculty colleague at the University of Chicago Law School .
“ He is a constitutional specialist who has taught for many years , said Sunstein .
“ There ’s a guarantee that we ’d get someone of the first intellectual rank .
No Harriet Miers . ”
Plus , he said , Obama “ is obviously alert to the fact that there ’s been a rightward drift on the court … .
I would n’t say he’d be interested in anything like ‘ leftwing ’ judges , ” said Sunstein , who stressed that he was speaking for himself only , and not the campaign .
But “ he does want people of certain perspectives and values when the legal materials are unclear . ”
A McCain judiciary “ would be pretty similar to the Bush judiciary , ” said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr .
“ I think most Republican administrations have actually looked pretty similar in terms of the kind of people they look for , ” he said .
Kerr , who serves on a McCain campaign legal advisory committee , stressed that he was speaking only for himself .
“ The tough thing to predict , ” especially in a McCain administration , “ is where the Senate goes in terms of how much deference the president gets ” in making appointments , said Kerr .
“ The key change was with Roberts and Alito , where you saw a lot of senators opposing the nominee for general ideological reasons , ” as opposed to the confirmations of Scalia , nominated by President Reagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , nominated by President Clinton .
“ A President McCain will likely face a Senate with 55 or more Democrats , ” Doug Kendall , head of the Constitutional Accountability Center , said in a recent Brookings panel discussion .
“ And with liberal justices retiring , and the possibility of a sharp ideological shift in the makeup of the Supreme Court , a Democratic controlled Senate will almost certainly demand a consensus nominee .
The skirmishes we saw over John Roberts and Sam Alito will look like child ’s play in comparison to the battles likely to accompany McCain ’s Supreme Court nominees . ”
All talk of the Supreme Court ’s future makeup is inherently speculative .
The next president could have no appointments or many .
The oldest Supreme Court justices — John Paul Stevens , 89 , and Ruth Bader Ginsburg , 79 — are commonly perceived as the most likely to depart .
On the other hand , no one expected Sandra Day O'Connor to retire in 2006 , or the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in 2005 .
Presidents have a much greater chance of leaving their mark on the U.S. Courts of Appeal , which are the end of the line for the vast majority of legal issues in the Federal courts and the primary source of Supreme Court justices — including Roberts and Alito — in recent years .
Russell Wheeler , a Brookings expert on the courts , calculates that the new president will immediately have 15 appellate vacancies to fill , and would likely get another 14 in the probable event that Congress expands the courts soon to accommodate rising caseloads .
Retirements from among the 164 appeals court justices now sitting .
“ A reasonable estimate , ” Wheeler wrote in a recent study , “ is that a President McCain would increase the total proportion of Republican appointees from 56 % to 74 % and reduce the proportion of Democratic appointees from 36 % to 26 % .
“ That would make for the second most lopsided appellate judiciary in modern history , after 1953 , following 20 years of Roosevelt and Truman appointees , ” Wheeler said in his study .
“ A President Obama , by contrast , would reduce the proportion of Republican appointees [ from 56 % ] to 42 % and increase the proportion of Democratic appointees from 36 to 58 % , ” he wrote .
Appointees to the Federal bench often go their own way once confirmed for life — “ whenever you put a man on the Supreme Court he ceases to be your friend " Harry Truman once quipped .
Nevertheless , ideology and party does matter .
“ When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer , ” Biden said during his debate with Sarah Palin , “ I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed , suggested by the president had a judicial temperament , had not committed a crime of moral turpitude , and was -- had been a good student .
“ …. It took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference . ”
Last month , many mutual funds and institutional investors piled into Treasurys , pushing yields down to zero for short - term bills and barely above two percent for longer - term debt .
The feeling then was that it was better to keep what you had than to lose more money in stocks .
But with the new year , the sentiment has changed .
" You 're seeing some bond investors make the judgment that things are a little better elsewhere , " Larson says .
" Why am I on the short end lending money for free and why am I on the long end when I 'm accepting 2 percent for 10 years ? "
With a huge government debt auction slated for later this week , the move out of Treasurys is likely to escalate — though that does n't necessarily mean good news for stocks .
Bond prices slid again Tuesday as traders were scared away by the looming auction of $ 166 billion of debt this week , including an $ 8 billion offering of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities , or TIPS .
The influx of supply , necessitated by aggressive government rescue and stimulus programs , is apt to push value down for Treasurys and has investors looking for alternatives .
" The bigger issue that I see is the massive amount of money - borrowing — or in the case of the Fed money - printing — to support the economy , " Larson says .
Indeed , 10 - year Treasurys fell nearly a full point in price Tuesday to hit three - week lows .
And even though that meant a mild gain for yields , which move in the opposite direction of prices , it still kept them remarkably low and far from an enticement especially with the boom in supply coming .
Exchange - traded funds , or ETFs , that track bond prices also are lower .
The iShares Barclays 20 + - year Treasury Bond fund is off about 9 percent over the past two weeks , while the company 's iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond fund has moved in the opposite direction , gaining more than 18 percent since early December .
Still , that has n't translated to stock market gains .
While the market posted a nice run last week , the rally faltered on Monday and was up modestly on Tuesday .
There 's widespread sentiment that until the economy stabilizes , stocks will continue to be unpredictable .

Holidays hit as pound sinks to a new all - time low against the euro
Sterling plummeted against the euro to a new low in early trading today as one pound after commission bought less than one euro for the first time .
Holidaymakers and business travellers were faced with the dire exchange rate at the Travelex bureau in London City airport .
Last night , £ 99.98 could buy just 97 euros as sterling continued to plunge to all - time lows against the euro .
The pound has fallen a record low against the euro after the Bank of England revealed it considered cutting interest rates further to stave off inflation
As thousands prepared for Christmas holidays , experts warned that things would get worse and that further falls could be expected .
European breaks now cost up to 30 per cent more than this time last year , when travellers enjoyed an exchange rate of 1.40 euros for the pound .
The pound hovered around 1.08 euros on the money markets yesterday but tourist rates are always worse .
Today it slumped to 1.07 euros .
Airports take advantage of travellers ' last - minute panic to buy currency , factoring wide profit margins into rates and charging high commission .
Glenn Uniacke , a currency specialist at MoneyCorp , said : ' Tourist prices are eye - wateringly bad now .
' It 's the first time holidaymakers have seen such a bad deal in London .
Our corporate clients were a little more prepared for this fall in value and have hedged , selling sterling ahead , but no one would have bought their skiing holiday money in the summer , would they ?
' The economic downturn is global , but there 's a perception that the UK 's problems are more acute so traders are dumping the pound . '
The pound has now fallen 14 cents against the euro in three weeks as the Bank of England slashed the interest rate to two per cent in an attempt to prevent a deep recession .
Investors are choosing to shun the pound because the UK interest - rate is below that in the euro zone and could yet fall to near zero .
Mark O'Sullivan , dealing director at Currencies direct , said : ' This is likely to get worse as more investors lose confidence in the pound . '
The gloomy economic data emerging from Britain adds more downward pressure on sterling .
The jobless claimant count topped one million for the first time in eight years yesterday as it emerged that dole queues are lengthening at their fastest rate since the Nineties recession .
Short sellers are also betting on sterling continuing to fall .
The title is self - explanatory .
And I could go on , but I have to stop somewhere , so let ’s make it 10 .
Your own nominations welcome in the comments .
The coffee - stained envelope , please :
10 . Keeping Up with the Kardashians .
You could fill this whole list with the exhausted genre of celebreality shows , but let ’s stick with E ! ’s tribute to undeserving fame ( well , I ’ll exclude Bruce Jenner ) , begun in 2007 , which is possibly the first TV show essentially spun off from a sex tape .
9. Do Not Disturb .
This short - lived
Fox hotel sitcom made me long for death , or ‘ Til Death , whichever would come first .
8. American Gladiators .
Besides being an outstanding source of baby names — Stealth !
Venom !
Fury !— there was little to recommend this big - haired strike retread .
7. The Andromeda Strain .
More like strained , this tedious , stiffly acted remake tried to glom onto the zeitgeist with a trendy environmental conspiracy plot , but it simply blew greenhouse gas .
6. Alter Eco. … and speaking of trendy environmentalism , while Discovery ’s new Planet Green channel had a handful of worthy series ( e.g. , Greensburg ) , this Adrian Grenier vanity project was n’t one .
The star and his friends showed us how to build green mansions , how to buy expensive biodynamic wine , and , mainly , how cool and noble they are .
On the plus side , Entourage is now Grenier ’s second worst show .
5. Little Britain USA .
The British sketch comedy show crossed the Atlantic and went from amusing and overrated to pointless and perplexing .
The funniest sketches involved characters already worn out on the original show , jarringly transplanted into American settings .
But there were worse imports …
4. Kath & Kim . … QED .
The Australian mother - daughter sitcom did n’t translate , losing the original ’s full - throated nastiness but managing to stay creepy and patronizing to its characters .
3 . The strike .
The root of much of TV ’s evil this year ( see American Gladiators ) , it does n’t claim the number one position only because we had to share it with 1997 2007 .
2. Rosie Live .
The one redeeming factor : this was clearly a labor of love for variety fan Rosie O’Donnell .
But the result was a self - indulgent trainwreck of poor production , lame jokes and painful musical numbers .
Rosie was doing this one for herself , and it probably should have stayed that way .
1. Knight Rider .
A lot of shows make the worst list because they are so poorly executed .
This one makes the list because , as far as I can tell , it was perfectly executed : it resurrected the spirit of lousy high - concept ’ 80s TV , and made me grateful to be living two decades later .
“ It ’s not a TV show so much as an ironic nostalgia lunchbox in video form , ” I wrote when it debuted .
If only we could sell it on eBay and forget about it .
As I said , this list is hardly comprehensive , so feel free to toss your rotten tomatoes into the ring .
JAMAICA , VERMONT -- The Crash of '08 offers the incoming Obama Administration a rare chance to rein in the excesses of our economic system .
I can think of few better places to start than banning leveraged buyouts .
Leveraged buyouts ( LBOs ) are Wall Street 's solution to American capitalism 's dirtiest secret and biggest problem : no one has any money .
Really .
Working as an investment banker during the 1980s , I was repeatedly astonished when deals would fall apart because would - be buyers of major corporations did n't have enough cash on hand to buy a house in the Hamptons .
Many of the wealthiest people in the world , it turned out , have zero or negative net worth .
According to The New York Times , for example , one of Donald Trump 's biggest sources of income was his job hosting the TV show " The Apprentice . "
Those buildings with his name on them ?
He leased his name to developers who liked his brand .
It 's true : the rich are different than you and me .
But not because they 're rich .
If most " wealthy " people ever had to settle up with their creditors , they'd be worth less than the average homeless Iraq War vet .
What they do have -- or , until recently , had -- big lines of credit .
Now the corporate raider owns the company .
But the company owes big payments to the bank .
The raider has two options .
He can use his management skills to make it more efficient and profitable .
Or he can sell off pieces of the company .
More often than not , " turn around " experts find that they 're not much smarter than the management they replaced and end up selling assets and cutting costs .
For other acquirers , turn - arounds are n't the point .
They 're out to gut the joint from the start .
The results are the same in both scenarios .
Each sale of a division and each round of layoffs reduces the already cash - starved acquired company 's chances of survival .
The formerly profitable company is forced to file bankruptcy .
Its employees lose their jobs .
Because the law inexplicably lets corporations use retirement plans as collateral for loans , they often lose their pensions too .
Suppliers are stiffed .
Customers suffer higher costs due to less competition .
It 's bad news for most people -- but not for everyone .
The corporate raider sells off his equity stake in the company before the fiscal excrement encounter the fan , then pays himself and his friends millions in golden parachutes .
The bank , which collected high interest payments as the company began its post - LBO decline , seizes and sells off what remains of the company 's assets .
Here 's another way to look at it :
Let 's say you want to buy a car you can't afford , like a Rolls Royce .
You " buy " the fancy hand - crafted auto using the car itself as collateral .
When the payments come due , you sell the engine , tires , carburetor , CD player and other parts to a chop shop .
You pocket the cash and default on your loan .
This , of course , is illegal -- yet in this scenario all that 's been lost is a nice car .
LBOs inflict much greater damage .
They transform profitable companies into bankrupt ones , throw thousands of people out of work , stifle competition and deprive government of the tax revenues it needs in order to build schools , maintain roads , and drop bombs on Muslims .
Yet LBOs are legal .
Generally speaking , LBOs succeed under two conditions : an expanding economy and a management team able to radically increase profits in a short time .
These conditions are rarely present at the same time , and almost never for very long .
Signs that the LBO model was untenable began appearing 20 years ago , when two of corporate raider Robert Campeau 's victims , the Revco drugstore chain and Federated Department Stores , went bankrupt .
Federated , which employed thousands of American workers before Campeau came along , had been saddled with LBO debt equal to 97 percent of its net assets .
LBO transactions have since led to scores of bankruptcies and hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs -- all to line the pockets of a tiny cabal of greedy speculators .
The LBO goons ' latest victims , ironically enough , are the media giants lionized by their own business reporters in breathless puff pieces .
In 2007 Sam Zell , described as " a 65 - year - old billionaire and president of Chicago - based Equity Group Investments , " bought the Tribune Company for $ 8.23 billion .
Tribune was one of the largest media chains in the United States , owning The Chicago Tribune , The Los Angeles Times , The Baltimore Sun , 20 television stations , and other properties -- as well as the Chicago Cubs baseball team .
Like most " billionaires , " Zell did n't have any money .
Like most takeover artists , he did n't know anything about the multibillion - dollar business he wanted to run .
Zell invested a mere $ 315 million ( 3.6 percent of the purchase price ) and stuck Tribune with $ 8.4 billion in debt , promising to make early debt payments by selling the Cubs and turning around the company 's flagging newspapers .
Everyone saw trouble ahead .
" The leveraged buyout is making Tribune one of the riskiest newspaper companies , according to John Puchalla , a media analyst at Moody 's Investors Service in New York , " reported the Bloomberg business wire service at the time .
Now , a year later , Tribune has filed Chapter 11 .
Layoffs are coming fast and furious .
After just 18 months under Zell 's careful stewardship , Tribune -- formerly a profitable company -- reports assets of $ 7.6 billion and debt of $ 13 billion .
" Factors beyond our control have created a perfect storm -- a precipitous decline in revenue and a tough economy coupled with a credit crisis that makes it extremely difficult to support our debt , " Zell said , acknowledging the disaster .
Zell is right about the credit crisis .
But it would have a lot easier for Tribune to weather the storm if he'd never come along .

The CUSEC convention ’s last keynote speech was Richard Stallman ’s presentation titled Copyright vs. Community in the Age of Computer Networks .
It ’s similar to the one he gave at the University of Toronto in the summer of 2007 ; you can see my detailed notes on that presentation here .
At the end of his keynote , he declared an auction , the proceeds of which would go to the Free Software Foundation ( I heard a couple of people say “ Yeah , right ” behind me ) .
The first item up for auction was a hardcover copy of his book Free Software , Free Society .
I already own an autographed edition , so I was n’t interested in bidding .
He started the bidding at CAD $ 40 .
In response , someone from the audience yelled out “ we ’re students ! ” .
Oblivious to the remark , he went on with the bidding .
The book ended up selling for somewhere close to a hundred dollars .
With the book sold , he showed the audience the next item for auction : a plush gnu , the mascot of the Free Software Foundation :
“ You should totally bid for that ! ” someone behind me said .
I ’d been thinking the same thing .
As with the book , the bidding started at student - unfriendly 40 dollars .
I waited until the price hit $ 60 , after which the room fell quiet .
That ’s when I threw my hat in the ring .
“ Sixty - five ! ”
The room burst out in laughter .
They ’d seen my presentation yesterday and knew I worked for Microsoft , long a major figure in the Free Software Foundation ’s demonology .
“ You should know that he ’s with Microsoft ! ” someone in the audience said to Stallman .
“ There are anti-animal cruelty laws , ” said Stallman , facing in my direction .
“ You have The Empire ’s assurance that no harm will come to him , ” I replied .
The bids continued .
For every bid that came in , I immediately countered with one that was $ 5 higher .
“ Seventy ! ”
“ Seventy - five ! ”
“ Eighty ! ”
“ Eighty - five ! ”
By this point , the room was really getting into the bidding war .
Would the Microsoftie actually win the auction for the symbol of the organization that views it as The Great Satan ?
And up the bids went until I said “ One hundred . ”
Just to underscore my intent on getting that gnu , I bid again .
“ One hundred five . ”
“ Going once … ” said Stallman , “ … twice … SOLD !
For one hundred and five dollars . ”
I walked up to the stage to thunderous applause .
Stallman seemed a tiny bit confused as to why someone from Microsoft would even want a gnu , never mind pay that much money for one .
“ You do promise to obey anti-animal cruelty laws ? ” he asked again , as if it were a real flesh - and - blood gnu .
“ I wo n’t harm a hair on its head .
I do come from the Free Software world , ” I replied , being careful not to call it the “ Open Source ” world .
I did n’t want to give him any reason to cancel the sale .
I pulled out my Microsoft corporate credit card .
I held it up and asked the audience : “ Would it be all right if I paid with this ? ”
That got a good laugh from the audience .
Using my best Darth Vader impression , I extended my hand out to Stallman and said “ Join me , Stallman , and together we shall bring order to the galaxy ! ” , which got a good laugh .
At the end of the conference , I walked up to Stallman , who was selling Free Software Foundation paraphernalia at the registration table .
I asked him for his autograph , which he gladly provided on the plush gnu ’s tag .
“ Happy hacking !
Richard Stallman , ” it read .
I did it all in the name of fun and also to show that Microsoft people have a sense of humour .
I was also more than happy to hand over some money to the Free Software Foundation as a way of saying thanks for all the things they ’ve done for developers – myself included – over the years .
As for the gnu , I plan to take it out from time to time , posing it for photographs just as the travelling garden gnome is .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congressional Democrats are asking the Big Three automakers to submit a plan no later than December 2 for spending the $ 25 billion they have requested to rescue their companies , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday .
Democratic senators are examining a proposed automaker bailout bill , two sources tell CNN .
Congress probably would reconvene by December 8 to consider the proposal , which would be reviewed with an eye toward convincing the public that they would be well - served , the Nevada Democrat said .
" The key is accountability and viability , " Reid said .
" We want them to get their act together . "
" Until they show us the plan , we cannot show them the money , " added Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a news conference in the Capitol .
Watch why the Big Three bailout is stalled »
Reid said that so far the companies have failed to convince Congress and the American people that this bailout would be their last .
The CEOs of General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC spent two days on Capitol Hill this week seeking $ 25 billion in loans to solve a looming cash crisis that could lead to bankruptcy filings for GM and Chrysler later this year or early next year .
Reid said the automakers would submit the plan to Rep. Barney Frank , D - Massachusetts , and Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Connecticut .
Frank chairs the House Committee on Financial Services and Dodd heads the Senate Banking Committee .
Reid also told reporters that members of Congress from Michigan have come up with a bipartisan agreement for the auto companies -- " but it 's their agreement . "
There still is nothing on the table that could be approved by Congress or President Bush , he said .
" We 're disappointed that those hopes have not been met , " said Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , who helped forge the agreement .
But he said he was encouraged that the leadership was taking all steps needed to help the auto industry survive with bridge loans .
Frank defended the amount of time being spent on the automakers ' request .
" We put through a bill putting $ 700 billion of taxpayers money at risk , although we hope to recover it , " he said , referring to the stimulus fund approved for banks .
" There is widespread dissatisfaction -- not just in the Congress but in the country -- with what is perceived to be a failure of the recipients of those funds to carry out the intent that the Congress had . "
He added , " There is a sense that we did not do a good enough job of safeguarding those funds .
That 's why we need to take time . "
CNN 's Dana Bash contributed to this report .

Here 's some tips for surviving the night with your sanity intact .

Do n't be left speechless at midnight .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson said today that he believed the banking system had been " stabilized , " and he implied that there was no major institution likely to present a problem that would shock regulators .
Here ’s Paulson in an interview with Robert Siegel on NPR News ’ " All Things Considered " :
Siegel :
You said yesterday , overall , we ’re in a better position than we were .
That ’s a modest statement of progress , but it ’s a statement of progress .
How can you tell Americans who are listening something that ’s happened , something that should have affected their lives by now , that is a tribute to the nearly $ 300 billion that has already been committed by the U.S. government [ to a banking bailout ] ?
Paulson : Yeah , I would say the first thing I would say to Americans , what we were dealing with was , we were dealing with a financial system , a banking system that was on the tipping point .
Credit was frozen .
Banks were n’t lending to each other .
People were asking themselves about the viability of banks .
I believe the banking system has been stabilized .
No one is asking themselves anymore , is there some major institution that might fail and that we would not be able to do anything about it .
So I think that is a positive .
I think in terms of the challenges , in terms of working through this economic downturn .
Let me tell you , it took a long time to build up these excesses .
It ’s going to take a good while to work through this period .
And the first focus , as I said yesterday , should be on recovery and repair .
And it ’s going to take a while longer to work through it .
Siegel :
But just to clarify , you ’re saying no one is saying now there could be a failure of a major institution that we would n’t be able to deal with .
There could be a failure of another major institution , though .
Paulson : I got to tell you , I think our major institutions have been stabilized .
I believe that very strongly .
I 'm one of your many fans from Australia .
Today in my country a judge made a ruling that could set a dangerous precedent , particularly for readers of adult oriented comics and ( especially ) the retailers who supply them .
A New South Wales judge has found that a man found with crude , fan made pictures depicting Simpsons characters Bart , Lisa and Maggie having sex .
http://www.theage.com.au/national/simpsons-cartoon-ripoff-is-child-porn-judge-20081208-6tmk.html
Apparently these drawn images are " people " in the eyes of the law and there is no distinction made between this and actual photographs of pedophilic acts .
This worries me for a number of reasons .
First of all , I own a copy of Lost Girls .
By this definition , I 'm in possession of something that could put me in jail and have me registered as a sex offender .
Also , this has the potential for a slippery slope that could lead to censorship / the banning of some of my favorite works , not to mention jail for the proprietors of Australia ’s few and far between dedicated Comics shops .
To the best of my knowledge , Australia has nothing like the first amendment and I 'm not sure if the CBLDF operates outside of the US .
I 'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter .
Thanks for your time and please , do not stop writing .

" In my view , the magistrate was correct in determining that , in respect of both the commonwealth and the NSW offences , the word ' person ' included fictional or imaginary characters ... , " the judge said .
possibly not safe for work , might prompt embarrassing questions from small children , do not click on this if a small reproduction of cartoon characters doing softcore filthy things upsets you

And I suspect the Judge might have just inadvertantly granted human rights to cartoon characters .
I think it 's nonsensical in every way that it could possibly be nonsensical .
The Simpsons characters are n't real people .
They definitely are n't real children .
( Given that they first appeared in the late eighties , they 're also all over eighteen now ... )
The famous 1967 Wally Wood " Disney Memorial Orgy " poster ( http://flickr.com/photos/25308024@N08/2509508040/sizes/o/ >( ) is a parody of Disney 's image , an attack in cartoon form on the idea of consumerism and the innocence of cartoon characters , as the Disney characters let their hair down and indulge in a memorial orgy for the late Walt Disney .
The idea that you could be arrested in the Western World for having that image in your computer is mind - boggling , let alone for owning , or for doodling members of the Peanuts gang doing things they tended not to do in the Schulz comics , or for reading Harry Potter slash , or owning the Paedophilia special .
And , I should warn members of the Australian judiciary , fictional characters do n't just have sex .
Sometimes they murder each other , and take fictional drugs , and are cruel to fictional animals , and throw fictional babies off roofs .
Crimes , crime everywhere .
The ability to distinguish between fiction and reality is , I think , an important indicator of sanity , perhaps the most important .
And it looks like the Australian legal system has failed on that score .
I do n't know if it 's something that they can further legally appeal , or afford to appeal , but I hope they can .
If not , I hope that a bunch of Australians will get together to change the law .
I 'm sure the CBLDF -- and many other organisations who have concerns about the barriers between art and life , expression , freedom of speech , and , possibly , now , pension plans for cartoon characters -- would offer advice and information .
But this is something that Australians will have to sort out ....

Every Conscious Machine Drives us Closer to Death
“ Every time the clock ticks ‘ plus one ’ , ’plus one ’ , ’plus one ’ ,
it will be telling you ‘ one less ’ , ’one less ’ , ‘ one less ’ … ”
Abril Despedaçado
The Doomsday Argument is alive and kicking , and since its formulation in the beggining of the Eighties by the astrophysicist Brandon Carter it has gained wide attention , been strongly criticized and has been described in many different , and sometimes non-interchangeable analogies .
I will briefly present the argument here , and departing from Nick Bostrom ’s interpretation , I will defend that doom may be sooner than we think if we start building conscious machines soon in the future .
The Argument
From Bostrom [ 1996 ] :
The core idea is this .
Imagine that two big urns are put in front of you , and you know that one of them contains ten balls and the other a million , but you are ignorant as to which is which .
You know the balls in each urn are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 … etc .
Now you take a ball at random from the left urn , and it is number 7 .
Clearly , this is a strong indication that that urn contains only ten balls .
If originally the odds were fifty - fifty , a swift application of Bayes ’ theorem gives you the posterior probability that the left urn is the one with only ten balls .
( Pposterior ( L=10 ) = 0.999990 ) .
But now consider the case where instead of the urns you have two possible human races , and instead of balls you have individuals , ranked according to birth order .
As a matter of fact , you happen to find that your rank is about sixty billion .
Now , say Carter and Leslie , we should reason in the same way as we did with the urns .
That you should have a rank of sixty billion or so is much more likely if only 100 billion persons will ever have lived than if there will be many trillion persons .
Therefore , by Bayes ’ theorem , you should update your beliefs about mankind ’s prospects and realise that an impending doomsday is much more probable than you have hitherto thought .
So what the argument states is simply that if you are willing to concede that you are a random possible human , and you are aware that you are the ( aprox ) 60 billionth person on this planet , than you should be willing to shift your predictions about the end of the world ( meaning the end of your class of people ) to a much sooner time than you previously did .
Several objections have been put forth against this standard formulation of the doomsday argument , ranging from the counter - intuitiveness of the conclusion to saying that the analogy fails for many different reasons , such as that it has no temporal component , that birth ranks are indexicals , that one could not have been only a possible human , rather than an actual one , among others .
Still , counterarguments have been put forth to all these objections [ BOSTROM 1999,2001 ] and it is far from clear that we have any reason to cast doubt on the central argument , let alone consider it refuted .
The most usual objections to the Doomsday argument rely on an intuitive misaprehension of the basic ideas underlying the argument , reason for which I will copy another version of it here , from Bostrom [ 2001 ] which specifies a particular hypothesis regarding prior probabilities that will be used in this article as a basis for reasoning about the consequences of creating new forms of consciousness with regard to our distance to Doomday .
“ The Self - Sampling Assumption and its use in the Doomsday argument
Let a person ’s birth rank be her position in the sequence of all observers who will ever have
existed .
For the sake of argument , let us grant that the human species is the only intelligent life
form in the cosmos .
1
Your birth rank is then approximately 60 billionth , for that is the number of humans who have lived before you .
The Doomsday argument proceeds as follows :
Compare two hypotheses about how many humans there will have been in total :
h1 : = “ There will have been a total of 200 billion humans . ”
h2 : = “ There will have been a total of 200 trillion humans . ”
Suppose that after considering the various empirical threats that could cause human extinction ( species - destroying meteor impact , nuclear Armageddon , self - replicating
nanobots destroying the biosphere , etc. ) you still feel fairly optimistic about our prospects :
Pr( h1 ) = .05
Pr( h2 ) = .95
But now consider the fact that your birth rank is 60 billionth .
According to the
doomsayer , it is more probable that you should have that birth rank if the total number of
humans that will ever have lived is 200 billion than if it is 200 trillion ; in fact , your
having that birth rank is one thousand times more probable given h1 than given h2 :
Pr (“ My rank is 60 billionth . ” | h1 ) = 1 / 200 billions
Pr (“ My rank is 60 billionth . ” | h2 ) = 1 / 200 trillions
With these assumptions , we can use Bayes ’s theorem to derive the posterior probabilities
of h1 and h2 after taking your low birth rank into account :
Pr(h1 | R = 60 B ) = ________Pr( R = 60 B | h1 ) Pr( h1 ) ______________ ≈ .98
. . Pr( R = 60 B | h1 ) Pr( h1 ) + Pr( R = 60 B | h2 ) Pr( h2 )
Your rosy prior probability of 5 % of our species ending soon ( h1 ) has mutated into a
baleful posterior of 98 % . ”
Prior Probabilities
The greatest problem about using bayesian reasoning in arguments such as the Doomsday argument is that we have no method whatsoever of determining the prior probabilities of outcome .
We cannot know if the possibilities range from there being , all and all , 100 billion humans to there being 100 trillion or if the probabilities range from there being 100 billion to a googol humans , neither how likely each option it .
Since we do not know what are these prior possible probabilities we must rely in one or another intuition about the probability distribution if we are to take in consideration our actual case .
Before going to the concrete case of mankind in the early 21st century , I want to point out that at an abstract level the argument is sound and works no matter what are the prior probabilities .
Even though we cannot ascribe any certainty to from how much to how much should we shift the probability of extinction within , say , 200 years , we can be sure that we should make the shift , and think of it as much more probable than we usually do .
The abstract bayesian reasoning is sound independently of determining the specific values to be treated , and therefore the belief that we are likely to be extinct sooner than we think is independent of the belief of how sooner are we to expect doom .
What is important is that we understand that this reasoning , if appliable , slides the probability towards a sooner catastrophe , and that any further considerations we apply within this line of reasoning will slide it towards or away from our new set - point , whichever it is .
For mankind in the 21st century , we have the data that you are around the 60 billionth person to ever live , and since , as I said , we hace no way of being sure about prior probabilities we can use as a working hyphotesis the same simplified case that Bostrom used to unfold our discussion , that is , that the two prior possibilities are that there are 200 billion and 200 trillion people during all the history of man .
This is just a working hyphotesis , and it does n’t have to be anywhere near the truth for the consequences that we can draw from it be useful , even if it turned out that the options are 500 billion with 1/3 prior chance 229 googols with 1/3 prior chance and 12 with 1/3 prior chance , the sliding of our belief would still be the same , and the reasoning remais sound as long as we are not epistemologically aware of the prior probabilites ( which we never will , since they are prior ) .
If that is the case then , as his arguing shows , we have reason to believe that we are 98 % likely to be in a world that will stand more 140 billion people , and 2 % likely to be in a world that will stand more 199 940 000 000 000 people , which is a lot more than 140 billion .
But then along comes the question , how soon it that ?
Or , as a fact of matter , how soon are the predictions thus far made based on any other prior probabilities ?
In a recent article Jason Matheny [ 2007 ] sums up a few predictions :
“ While it may be physically possible for humanity or its descendents to flourish for 10 ^ 41 years , it seems unlikely that humanity will live so long .
Homo sapiens have existed for 200,000 years .
Our closest relative , homo erectus , existed for around 1.8 million years ( Anton , 2003 ) .
The median duration of mammalian species is around 2.2 million years ( Avise et al. , 1998 ) .
A controversial approach to estimating humanity ’s life expectancy is to use observation selection theory .
The number of homo sapiens who have ever lived is around 100 billion ( Haub , 2002 ) .
Suppose the number of people who have ever or will ever live is 10 trillion .
If I think of myself as a random sample drawn from the set of all human beings who have ever or will ever live , then the probability of my being among the first 100 billion of 10 trillion lives is only 1 % .
It is more probable that I am randomly drawn from a smaller number of lives .
For instance , if only 200 billion people have ever or will ever live , the probability of my being among the first 100 billion lives is 50 % .
The reasoning behind this line of argument is controversial but has survived a number of theoretical challenges ( Leslie , 1996 ) .
Using observation selection theory , Gott ( 1993 ) estimated that humanity would survive an additional 5,000 to 8 million years , with 95 % confidence . ”
So the weather forecast is already dark grey , and here I intent to make it only worse .
Going back to our assumption of the 200 billions against 200 trillions , we have foreseen that there are probably only 140 billion of us coming along for the ride , and before going into all the birth - rates and population predictions , we must stop and analyse what is the “ us ” when I say that there are 140 billion of us coming along for the ride .
The Reference Class Problem
The Doomsday argument works once you consider your birth rank in relation to your reference class , the class that you belong to which matters for considering the Doomsday argument .
This could be any of these :
( 1) Beings that have read , understood , and believed the Doomsday Argument
( 2) Beings who could have mastered the argument
( 3) Human Beings
( 4) Conscious Beings
( 5) Conscious Intelligent Beings
As things stand , there is no settled down position to which of this reference classes should we consider ourselves when reasoning about Doomsday .
The intuitive grasp is that we should count our birth rank as humans , but that can be deceptive , since there are no strict frontiers that determine humanity ( or any of these classes ) and some consider it likely that even you could one day become some sort of tranhuman , super - human or post - human of a kind .
Intuitively , that should not change your predictions about doom made before you upgraded , so we have some reason to believe that class ( 3 ) is not the best bet for Doom predictions .
Most of us only care about our lives as long as we are conscious , so that if one would keep us in deep anesthesia , in a coma , or in a sleepless dream , most of us would not like the idea .
We hold a tacit conception that what matters about us in consciousness , meaning that were we not concious ( i.e. If philosophical zombies were possible ) life would be pointless .
Also , we make ethical considerations regarding other entities in terms of consciousness : “ do n’t hurt that squirrel , he can feel it . ”
This is not a specific argument in favour of using the class of conscious observer when analysing global catastrophic risks , but it is a gereral argument in favouring of favouring consciousness over other things , whatever consciousness turns out to be .
From now on I will assume that the important class of reference when one is analysing the Doomsday Argument is indeed the class of conscious beings , and I ’ll also assume that there is no such thing as half - conscious or partly - conscious .
We will pretend that it is very clear who is and who is not conscious , and that each conscious being can be accounted as an equal into Doomsday reasoning ( independently of how much he lives , how powerfull his mind etc … )
We are not also particularly interested in knowing when will be the Doomsday of all humans , supercomputers and squirrels .
Not at least if we can instead know when is the Doomsday of all humans and supercomputers only .
So , even though the debate goes on about squirrel ’s consciousness , and why not say , bats ’s as well , we will consider our reference class to be observers who are both conscious and intelligent .
This comes from the simple fact that we want to predict the Doom of these fellows , not of squirrels , not of superpowerfull intelligent unconcious machines .
To be in our reference class , we demand intelligence for squirrels and consciousness for machines , if they do not present them to us , we stand where we are .
Conscious Observers in an Atemporal World
The underlying reasoning behind Doomsday pressuposes a sort of atemporality that has been much discussed .
Since we are considering as part of the class of reference beings from the future , that do not yet exist , how can we use them in our reasoning ?
Two lines of objections have been put forth , one that says that you cannot use them at all since they do not exist , and other that says that if the world is indeterminate ( i.e. Quantum Physics etc … ) then we can not use them to calculate anything .
I think that these objections miss the point of the doomsday argument .
As Daniel Dennett said : <! – @page { margin : 2 cm } P { margin- bottom : 0.21 cm } – >” The future is going to happen , and that is true whether determinism is true or wheter inderminism is true , there going to be a future ” .
There are two very different senses of being determinate .
The more usual one is the classical formulation of determinism , epitomized by Laplace ’s Demon though experiment .
We are asked to imagine a omni-intelligent being that can compute all the laws of physics ( whatever they are ) and that knows the postion of all particles in one particular moment .
By definition , if this demon is able to know the future and the past , then the universe is determinate , otherwise , it is indeterminate , or open .
Then there is another less used sense of determinate , let ’s call it God ’s Eye Determination .
Instead of the Demon , we have an omniscient God that knows all non-indexical facts , past and future , all the particles , everything that can be known by one being about the universe .
A weak sort of determinate , which is the one Dennett alludes when forecasting the future , is the one in which this God knows the future .
That only means that the future will come ( if it comes ) and that what happens in it will happen in it ( it is as tautological as it sounds ) .
The reason I exposed these two senses of determinate is because both objections against doomsday that rely on the fact that the argument is temporal , whereas the urns with 10 balls or 100 balls are not is mixing up these two senses .
For the mathematical assumption that you are a randomly chosen figure in a reference class to work all you need is God ’s Eye Determination , there has to be a fact of matter as to how many beings there will ever be , but it is completely irrelevant if this information could be known by a Laplacean Demon , calculated by our best computers or accessible in any other fashion .
The reasoning that gives soundness to the Doomsday argument is completely independent of the future , and of the level of determination of reality ( in the sense of predictability ) .
This may seem counterintuitive at first , but it seems very logical since the Doomsday Argument is a mostly mathematical argument , which implies it probably needs very thin ground in the nature of reality to work .
Can a Machine Be Conscious ?
So the Doomsday argument is sound , works well and predicts a dark weather for our world , with not so many people ( lattu sensu ) to come after you , since you are the 60th billionth person around .
Let us now turn to the refernce class .
We have decided to consider only intelligent conscious beings as part of our supposed reference class , and that brings about the age - old question , can a machine be concious ?
Within philosophy of mind this is one of the most discussed topics of the late 20th century .
For starters , there are at least four widely used senses of the word “ consciousness ” that have been elegantly split up by Ned Block in Concepts of Consciousness .
If we are phenomenal realists , like Block , Chalmers and Searle , that is , if we attribute reality to phenomenal qualities ( i.e. Qualia ) then the sense that matters to us is the sense Block calls p-consciousness ( short for Phenomenal Consciousness ) .
If we are materialistic monists , like Dennett , then what people call phenomenal consciousness actually stands for a bunch of interacting physical entities and their relations , not to phenomenal qualities .
In this case to ask if a machine is conscious is to ask wether it can perform certain kinds of activities , and behave in such and such way , it is an empirical question .
I will remain neutral as to should we be phenomenal realists or materialistic monists .
Since philosopher are allowed to suppose contradictory things , as long as they do them one at a time , I will work on both hipothesis .
Phenomenal Realism is true : Supposing that phenomenal realism is true , it remains to be seen wether consciousness is a physical process ( type or token identity and physical emergentism would be qualified here ) or if it is non physical ( here being all sorts of dualisms ) .
For the sake of brevity , I wo n’t discuss Idealism .
Another option is that consciousness is in fact a part of a physical process ( property dualism , as well as qualia being the intrinsic nature of matter , opposed to the physical spectrum , which describes the relational nature ) .
Materialistic Monism is true :
An empirical theory of consiciousness would have to account for all we call conscious phenomena in an explanatory and clear way .
Alternatively , it could be true and undiscoverable ( because we do not have the means to perform such a discovery ) but these details should not divert us from what matters for doomsday , so we can assume that it is discoverable .
As many options as there are for the philosophical Realist , most of them have an non-investigable outlook .
Dualist formulations are almost always unverifiable , epiphenomenalism in particular .
Even within cartesian dualism , if there were inter-substancial causality , what we could analyse from outside is only that the physics , say , of a brain is not working as expected , but that does not entail that it is consciousness that is doing the job .
If it is consicousness , we do n’t have a way to find out .
If consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter , since all our apparatus of measurement only measures relational aspects , we could not know either whether a machine was consicous .
As things stand , if phenomenal realism is true , we have no way of finding out if a machine is conscious or not , and are condemned to remain forever thinking through analogies , just like we do today with chimps and squirrels , guessing from their distance to us if , and how much are they concious .
So , perhaps there could be conscious machines , but we would not be able to aknowledge them as such .
If on the other hand Materialistic Monism is right than we can assume that we will find a standard definition of consciousness and more or less direct ways of testing if it applies to different beings .
Some believe we already do have the necessary apparatus .
In any case it is technically feasible that we will one day find out a consciousness - meter and know whether machines are or not conscious .
Note also that since we are assuming that we are conscious , it is a decided fact of matter that there can be conscious machines , because there already are , it only remains to be seen whether we will be able to produce non-biological machines that are conscious as well .
Thusfar I have addressed the epistemological grounds for machine consciousness , and argued that in both cases it is possible ( does not contradict any central thesis ) that machines are conscious .
Both Phenomenal Realists ( of most kinds ) and Materialistic Monists would be ready to aknowledge at least the possibility of machine consiciousness , so our reference class , which considers the future , seems to be increasing in size , but how much is it increasing ?
How Long do We Have
The Doomsday argument purports to show that hiphotesis with fewer individuals ( say , 200 billion ) are more likely than with many individuals ( 200 trillion ) .
Our reference class is much more likely to be around the billions than the trillions , now what is the consequence of incresing the size of the reference class that we think that actually will live .
In other words , what is the consequence of thinking that it is likely that soon we will be able to create conscios machines ?
For the argument , it is unfortunately ( i’ll explain soon ) none .
The only important data when reasoning is the set from which you decided that you are a random sample from and your birth rank among that set .
So , that is well stablished , we have decided that we are the 60th billionth people around and that our set of reference is of conscious intelligent beings .
That is all the information we need !
You already now , right now , that the world is much more like to have more 140 billion intelligent conscious beings than it is to have several trillions .
If I add a new piece of information , it will not change your calculations , but I will do anyway :
New information :
Within the first half 21th century , we will be able to create intelligent conscious machines .
Many people , most proeminently Ray Kurzweil , have defended this hiphotesis as highly likely .
Moore ’s law seems to be still working , technology is developing quickly , brain - computer interfaces are getting better every day , IBM has a brain - simulation project , our best computers perform computations only 2 or 3 orders of magnitude inferior to the human brain etc … in other words , it is a likely possibility , and we should give it careful thought .
I said that it does n’t make any difference for the Doomsday Argument , and that is true , but that does not mean it does n’t make any difference for the Doomsday itself .
Doomsday , in our hiphotetical scenario is to take place whenever the 200 billionth conscios intelligent being is born , or created ( remember that the argument works independently of the numbers we assumed , the same follows if we had chosen as prior possibilities other numbers instead of 200 billion ) .
Doomsday will come not in a specific when , but in a specific if .
If the 200 billionth being is born , then ( per armageddon ? ) the reference class will be destroyed ( or stop reproducing ) .
Since no one forecasts that humans or machines will suddently stop reproducing unless they run out of fuel , armaggedon is more likely than immortality without children .
It is estimated that around 350 000 people are born every day , that ammounts to some 130 million born every year .
Supposing that current trends of decreasing populational growth will continue , we can say that the 21st century will see some 5 billion more people being born .
That is not so bad ( given that we did not attribute any prior probabilities for , say , 63 billion all and all , because that would scare us too much ) .
But now suppose that we do create intelligent machines , not only that , but we create machines that can create copies of themselves , just like we do .
The difference being that they are much faster .
Now , there is no theoretical obstacle for them to create , say , 145 Billion copies of themselves , within 15 years .
That is almost sure doom for us , and for them .
It can still get worse .
Let us suppose ( also a higly likely possibility ) that we create simulations of societies , just like our current videogames , but with conscious beings on them .
One simulation could simultaneaously run a very large number of conscious beings , say , 200 milion .
Or more , much more , the only limit is computational power , and that has been more than doubling every two years for decades .
So , how long do we have in fact ?
It impossible to forecast that for a great number of reasons .
( 1 ) We do not have the prior possibilities and their probabilities ( 2 ) We do not know if there were or there are other in our reference class alive today ( aliens etc … ) ( 3 ) Even if we did know that we are alone , and that the prior probabilities were such and such , this would still give us only a likelihood distribution , and we would have no way of telling which specific instance of it we were .
Just like all bayesian reasoning based on unknown prior probabilities , the Doomsday argument is more an argument towards a shift in our current beliefs , than it is a settlement of what we should believe .
In this article , I hope I have made a strong case for another shift .
Even though we cannot be sure whether machines are or not conscious , if we will ever build simulations , if Moore ’s law will keep its pace etc …
We have to shift upwards the fear we have of creating more individuals of our reference class ( specially in ways that look dangerous ) .
Doomsday , which will happen even if only in the heat death of the universe , is shifting towards us every time a conscious intelligent observer is created , and we should really take that in consideration when making future plans about building inteligent machines , at least if our mathematical and computational abilities manage to make us understand what can be blatantly obvious to the machines , but not so much for old apes from the Savannahs .

We go into a restaurant with the aim of eating healthily .
The menu does not tell us much about fats , salt or additives contained in the dishes .
So how do we make the best decision ?
Psychologists Rocío García - Retamero and Jörg Rieskamp have analysed the influence that inferences about missing information can have on the accuracy of our decisions .
Rocío García - Retamero , a teacher at the Faculty of Psychology from the University of Granada ( Universidad de Granada - UGR ) , and Jörg Rieskamp , a researcher from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany , have examined the hit rate of the two types of strategy we usually use to make inferences , depending on the mechanism that is used to treat information that is not available to us .
The strategies are known as the take - the - best ( TTB ) and weighted additive ( WADD ) strategies , “ two prototype strategies that represent very well how we as human beings usually behave ” , García - Retamero explains to SINC .
The first strategy , namely TTB , consists of selecting a route , the one we consider most significant for our objectives .
In the restaurant , for example , the cooking method can be useful to enable us to differentiate between a healthy meal and an unhealthy one .
Even if this facility does not allow us to discriminate , then we select a second route .
On the other hand , by using the WADD strategy , we consider many more routes and value the importance of each of them more .
So , the cooking method together with other properties of the food , such as source and nutrient content , are added to the inference with reasoning .
Ways of inferring
The researchers explain that in the last twenty years studies dealing with the way in which individuals deal with incomplete information have shown that we function very differently , depending on the type of inference problem we are confronting .
The distribution of information that is missing can help us .
Returning to the example of the restaurant , we can consider , for example , that that information is the same for all the dishes ( uniform distribution ) or that , on the other hand , for the less healthy dishes that “ hidden ” information is greater ( conditioned distribution ) .
Using these criteria , the researchers have designed ten inference problems , that differ in respect to the number of objects considered ( between 24 and 181 ) , the quantity of missing information ( from 0 to 100 % ) and the distribution of that information ( uniform or conditioned ) , and they have calculated the hit rate percentage in each case .
The study reveals that the different options of dealing with what we do not know and also the ways in which the “ hidden ” information is distributed have the same impact upon the two inference strategies .
The authors call this a “ surprising ” result , because a priori we could think that using a compensated strategy such as the weighted additive strategy increases the probability of being right about our inferences .
However , as the psychologist points out , the result “ is in line with previous studies about the take - the - best strategy , that show that simple strategies based on a small amount of information can be as precise as those made up of a high number of clues in our environment ” .
Mr Varley says unemployment is set to rise further
The head of Barclays bank has predicted that economic gloom will deepen , with house prices to fall in total by 30 % .
John Varley 's warning comes ahead of the latest UK unemployment figures on Wednesday , where the number of jobless is expected to rise sharply .
A new survey suggests household debt is on the increase , and the value of sterling has fallen against the euro .
House prices have already fallen by 15 % this year , and his remarks suggest they may fall at the same rate next year .
John Varley , group chief executive of Barclays , painted a bleak outlook in an interview on Sky News , during which he criticised mortgage borrowing levels over the last decade .
I think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate
John Varley
UK house prices in detail
He warned the UK was only " halfway " through the slump with house prices set for even greater falls .
He said : " Our view was that from the top to the bottom , you would see a fall of something like 25 to 30 % .
" I suspect we 're about halfway through that at the moment .
I mean that slowdown , the negative house price inflation started in 2007 , it 's accelerated in 2008 .
" We 're probably about halfway through that period , so in other words we 've got another 10 to 15 % to fall between now and the end of next year .
That would be our assessment . "
His bleak prediction extended into the jobs market .
He said : " Our view is that unemployment will rise .
Unemployment is likely to go north of 7 % over the course of the next 12 months or so , it might be as high as 7.5 % .
" I think an additional 700,000 people unemployed over the course of the next 12 months is certainly possible to contemplate . "
Mr Varley was speaking ahead of the release , on Wednesday , of the latest UK unemployment figures .
The number of jobless could rise sharply , with some forecasters warning the total of those out of work might hit two million or more .
Debt increase Meanwhile , a survey commissioned by the Bank of England has suggested an increase in the number of households struggling with debt .
Many said they had less to spend after paying household bills and had saved less than they expected .
Nearly 2,500 households were interviewed for the survey in late September and early October .
More respondents were finding their debts to be a burden than in any similar survey since the mid 1990s .
The bank says after a period of growth and low inflation , it has seen an abrupt change in the circumstances facing British households .
Sterling 's lows International investors ' lack of confidence in the UK economy has seen the the pound hitting new lows against the euro : last week one pound bought as little as 1.11 euros , the lowest ever .
But the government appears to have ruled out action to shore up sterling .
On Sunday the chief secretary to the Treasury , Yvette Cooper , told the BBC the government was not planning to step in to support the pound .
She said attempts by previous administrations to target exchange rates had been unsuccessful .
Instead the government would continue to try to keep inflation under control and support the economy , she said .
" We have never had a policy of targeting the pound .
Our policy has been to target inflation and that , I think , has been the right way .
It has paid off over the last 10 or 11 years . "
Huge deficits
But the government has been warned that any action it takes to support the UK economy must not break EU rules .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet told the Financial Times that the EU's " stability and growth " pact must not be allowed to fall apart .
The pact has rules designed to stop EU member states from racking up huge budget deficits and national debt in order to boost their economies .
" We would destroy confidence if we blew up the pact , " he said .
Mr Trichet is said to be worried that fiscal indiscipline - such as governments printing large amounts of currency in order to boost spending - could threaten " already fragile " economic confidence .

Inglewood police officers have repeatedly been embroiled in sex- related scandals over the last five years , according to court documents , law enforcement records and interviews .
In May 2004 , Officer Ron Navarreta , a 13 - year veteran , was fired after FBI agents discovered that a suspect in a child pornography investigation had e-mailed explicit images to Navarreta ’s AOL account , according to court records .
Investigators found that Navarreta ’s AOL account included a screen name called “ PlyGRoUndObsver . ”
An agent alleged that the screen name ’s user prowled the Internet seeking a relationship with a mother and daughter and listed “ teaching vry yng fem students about love ” as a hobby , according to internal affairs records that Navarreta ’s attorney included in a civil court case filed to get his job back .
Navarreta denied receiving the images e-mailed to him by the child - porn suspect .
FBI agents were unable to examine the computers he used because they had been sold or reported stolen .
An arbitrator found there was not enough evidence to prove Navarreta knowingly received child porn but concluded that he lied to the FBI and Inglewood investigators and should be fired .
A judge upheld his termination .
Later that year , an anonymous letter sent to the department ’s Internal Affairs Bureau prompted a sexual harassment investigation of traffic Officer James Manzi .
Manzi , according to an internal affairs report included in court records , played for on - duty colleagues a videotape and an audio recording of himself having sex .
Manzi was suspended for 20 days but retired on disability before the discipline was imposed .
He declined to comment .
In January 2006 , another officer was accused of taking a cellphone photograph of an inmate during a strip search .
The officer was suspended and then fired for unrelated misconduct .
Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said supervisors now monitor strip searches .
“ That ’s one of the circumstances where we have to be exceedingly careful because it has the potential to be interpreted as something very demeaning , ” she said .
In December 2006 , a woman visiting from Florida claimed that an on -duty Inglewood officer raped her and forced her to perform sexual acts while he kept his hand on his holstered gun .
According to a district attorney ’s report , the woman was standing on a street corner wearing a miniskirt and fishnet stockings when Officers Donvey Lindsey and Brandon Beak pulled up , suspecting she was a prostitute .
The officers followed the woman back to her motel and confirmed she was a registered guest , according to the report .
Lindsey then followed her to her room , telling Beak that he would check her identification , Beak told authorities .
The woman , in a statement to the FBI , claimed she complied with Lindsey ’s orders to perform sexual acts because he threatened to arrest her .
Prosecutors declined to file charges , saying it would be difficult to prove the case because the woman had been arrested for prostitution in her home state .
The woman has filed a federal civil rights suit against the city .
The suit is pending .
Seabrooks said Lindsey has been fired .
He did not return a call seeking comment .
Just two months after the rape claim , the city was shaken by allegations that other officers visited prostitutes at massage parlors .
Among them was six - year veteran Officer Richard Correa .
According to civil court records , a prostitute who worked at a massage parlor on La Brea Avenue told investigators that she had performed a sex act on Correa while he was on duty and in uniform .
She implicated other officers who she said frequented the massage parlor for sex and promised to alert her to police raids .
Correa told internal affairs investigators that he had sex with an employee at a different massage parlor on Manchester Boulevard while in uniform , court records show .
He denied paying her and said it happened only once .
“ That was a bad decision on my part , and it ’s stupid , ” he told investigators .
He was fired in March 2007 .
A department spokesman said seven officers were fired for allegedly visiting the massage parlors or covering for officers who did .
Seabrooks said she and her predecessors have moved swiftly to rid the department of officers who commit serious misconduct .
She said the 195 - officer force should not be judged based on the conduct of a relative handful of officers .
“ It is unfortunate that these things seemed to have plagued us , ” she said .
“ In any barrel , you ’re bound to find some bad apples that touch each other , and you ’re going to find the vast majority that are just fine . ”

Judge :
No probe into torture of journalist who threw shoes at Bush Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday December 22 , 2008

This Judge dismisses torture allegations ; Brother claims journalist beaten , subjected to electric shocks , forced to sign false confessions .
BAGHDAD ( AFP ) 
The Iraqi journalist thrust to instant fame when he threw his shoes at US President George W. Bush will go on trial this month on charges that carry up to 15 years in jail , a judge said on Monday .
Investigating judge Dhiya al - Kenani rejected new allegations by the journalist 's family that he had been tortured in custody , charges that were levelled after a brother was allowed a first prison visit .
" The investigation phase is over and the case has been transferred to the Central Criminal Court , " Kenani said .
" The trial will start on Wednesday , December 31 . "
Muntazer al - Zaidi stands accused of " aggression against a foreign head of state during an official visit , " an offence that carries a prison term of between five and 15 years under Iraqi law .
But the court could convict him of the lesser charge of " attempted aggression " which carries a prison term of one to five years .
Zaidi , 29 , became a hero to many when he threw his shoes at Bush during the US president 's surprise visit to Iraq on December 14 , an action considered a grave insult in the Arab world .
Kenani confirmed that Zaidi's lawyer had lodged a complaint over his treatment and that a letter would be sent to the office of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to request that security guards be brought to justice .
One of Zaidi 's brothers , Uday , told AFP he had been able to visit him in custody for the first time on Sunday and charged that the journalist had been tortured by his captors to force him to sign a statement .
" I met my brother for around an hour .
He has been tortured while in detention for 36 hours continuously .
He has been hit with iron rods and cables , " the brother said .
" There is very severe bleeding in his eye , and he has bruises on his feet and nose , and he was also tortured with electric shocks .
" He was forced to sign a statement confessing to receiving money from different groups and saying that he did not throw his shoes for the honour of Iraq , " Uday said .
" But Muntazer said I will not apologise for what I did -- not now , not ever . "
Maliki's office confirmed that the premier had received a letter signed by Zaidi alleging third party involvement in his protest .
" Muntazer al - Zaidi has expressed regret in a letter I received from him in which he revealed that an individual persuaded him to commit this action and that this person is well - known for beheading people , " it quoted Maliki as saying .
The allusion was clearly to insurgent groups opposed to his US - backed government that have executed captives in the past , but it was unclear precisely which individual Maliki was referring to .
The judge dismissed the family 's torture allegations .
" Muntazer 's brother is lying , because there are only bruises on Muntazer 's face that he received during the arrest and they are small ones , " Kenani told AFP .
" Even if it were true that he had been tortured with electric shocks , it would leave burns on his body , and you will see Muntazer during the trial , so you can judge for yourself .
But Uday insisted that any public appearance would prove the truth of his allegations .
" If I am lying , let the judge show Muntazer on television for everyone to see , " he said .
His lawyer had asked that Zaidi 's case be transferred from the central criminal court , which handles terrorism cases , to an ordinary tribunal but the judge refused .
Meanwhile another brother , Durgham , slammed people reportedly trying to exploit the incident for commercial gain .
" It 's all nonsense .
These people want to exploit what my brother did , " he said after being told a Turkish firm claimed it had manufactured the offending footwear .
A White House spokesman reiterated the US position that it is up to Iraq to handle Zaidi .
" He 's in the hands of the Iraqi system .
I do n't have anything more on the shoe - thrower , " spokesman Tony Fratto told reporters when asked if the White House was concerned about reports that the Iraqi journalist showed signs of having been tortured .
" I think that 's been explored extensively and I have nothing new for you . "
'iTax ' is one of 137 additional fees for New Yorkers as state governor tries to ease budget crisis
New Yorkers who download music to their iPods are to see the cost rise after the state governor , David Paterson , slapped a 4 % tax on the practice as part of an attempt to ease a massive budget crisis .
The charge , which has been nicknamed the iTax , will also cover ebooks and other " digitally delivered entertainment services " .
It is one of 137 additional fees the state will exact from residents in its 2009 - 10 budget .
Income from high - earning and highly taxed Wall Street financiers has nosedived since the credit crunch , leaving the state with a $ 15.4 bn budget gap .
To try to close it , Paterson has risked incurring the wrath of multiple groups of voters as he pushes up taxes and slashes spending .
One of his most innovative moves is a charge on sugary soft drinks , dubbed the obesity tax .
Any non -diet fruit drink that contains less than 70 % natural fruit juice will be subject to an 18 % tax .
State officials said the tax would combat obesity , which affects one in four New Yorkers , but there was no disguising that it would raise more than $ 400 m in the fiscal year , rising to $ 539 m the year after .
Other products and services to be hit by higher taxes will be taxi rides , petrol , cigars and beer , manicures and massages , and tickets to cinemas and sports arenas .
The budget includes cuts of almost $ 10 bn to hospital and school subsidies .
Efforts to reduce class sizes and improve healthcare for poor families are likely to suffer .
" Tax Hell " was the headline blazed across the front page of Rupert Murdoch 's New York Post .
The tax on music and video downloads will make New York the second state after New Jersey to impose such charges through legislation .
A separate sales charge is exacted by Apple through iTunes in 18 states .
Internet trade organisations have protested about the idea , saying it will merely increase piracy .
The trade group NetChoice argued that downloading should be encouraged – as it involves no environmentally damaging packaging – rather than discouraged through taxation .
The first patch since The Wrath of the Lich King has just hit Blizzard 's World of Warcraft , bringing fixes , class changes , and perhaps most importantly - a complete revamp of the clam system .

While the ability to create a Death Knight on any server is nice , and the fact that damage over time spells that do n't immediately damage monsters now tag the critters as yours anyway is a great boon for several casting classes , WoW Insider 's Guide to Patch 3.0.8 highlights the greatest change the patch has delivered .
Players can now open clams while riding a vehicle , sitting , mounted , stealthed , and invisible .

You hear that rumbling ?
That is the sound of hundreds of thousands of lapsed WoW players rushing to their computers .
This changes everything .

WoW Insider 's Guide to Patch 3.0.8 [ WoW Insider ]
It might seem like political comedians have an easy job -- to take shots at leaders and bureaucrats for whom the public at large already have a healthy dose of cynical mistrust .
But the best political comedians do more than taking shots ; they shape the discussion and become part of the process through the act of telling jokes .
They can be more than simple commentators ; they can be voices .
Funny , funny voices .
Though the majority of political comedians do tend to lean left , there are those who speak to conservatives and others who elect not to choose sides .
All are represented here , in varying numbers and degrees .
01 of 10 Bill Maher GC Images / Getty Images
Though he had been a stand - up comic for almost 15 years , it was n't until Bill Maher became the host of " Politically Incorrect " in 1993 that the country really took notice .
On that show and its follow - up , the HBO talk show " Real Time with Bill Maher " , he regularly mixes it up with politicians , pundits , and celebrities on a wide range of issues .
A self - described " libertarian , " Maher is an equal - opportunity offender , willing to make fun of all political parties .
During the Bush II administration , he became far more critical of the conservative right , but he 's still willing to speak his mind and make jokes based on what he believes -- even when it 's unpopular .
No comedian has done as much for the mixture of politics and comedy in the last 20 years .
02 of 10 Jon Stewart FilmMagic / Getty Images Taking over Comedy Central 's nightly news spoof " The Daily Show " in 1999 , Stewart quickly became one of the country 's go - to comics for political comedy .
The genius of Jon Stewart is n't just his quick wit or sharp writing ; what makes him great is that he is truly passionate about the political problems Americans face today .
It would be easy to remain at a distance , criticizing everything underneath a guard of ironic cool ( just ask Stewart 's predecessor , Craig Kilborn ) .
But Stewart is more than the class smart - ass ; underneath the political commentary and jokes is a distinct feeling that yes , he ​gets it .
And he cares .
03 of 10 Lewis Black Robin Marchant / Getty Images Lewis Black has allowed politics to drive him nuts .
Unlike Bill Maher 's smirkiness and Jon Stewart 's bafflement , Black 's political comedy is flourished with his trademark rage -- no one can build to a frustrated scream quite like Black .
Another comedian who 's critical of both major political parties ( he calls himself a socialist ... oooh ... ) , Black is a comic whose name has become synonymous with political humor .
He makes regular appearances on " The Daily Show " to offer political commentary , and the majority of his Grammy - winning stand - up album , " The Carnegie Hall Performance " , is an indictment of the Bush / Cheney administration .
What resonates with Black is his rage -- and even when we do n't agree with his politics , we can all relate to that .
04 of 10 George Carlin Mark Mainz / Getty Images George Carlin was n't an exclusively political comic , but when his act did turn to politics he proved to be one of the sharpest minds on the subject ever to grace the stage .
The oldest and most seasoned comic on the list , Carlin was able to cover four decades of politics in his act ; revisiting any of his 14 comedy albums now is like opening a political time capsule .
Carlin loved to point out the hypocrisy in any institution , and there were few institutions he saw more hypocrisy in than government ( though The Church comes a close second ) .
Carlin had a natural gift for cutting through B.S. , and it served him well as a political comedian -- he 's one of the few comics who could change your mind about something with a joke .
He is missed .
05 of 10 Dennis Miller Scott Dudelson / Getty Images
For whatever reason , there are n't a whole lot of " conservative " comedians .
So , as the only real conservative comic on the list , Dennis Miller represents a very different point of view when it comes to political comedy .
Once a more liberal - minded Bush I basher ( during his days on " Saturday Night Live " and as the host of his own often - political talk show on HBO ) , Miller has claimed that America 's response to 9/11 changed his political views .
He 's since become the go - to comic for the conservative right and FOX News but lost most of his edge in the process .
06 of 10 D.L. Hughley WireImage / Getty Images
Over the course of his career , D.L. Hughley transitioned from a funny observational comic into one of the foremost political comedians of the 2000s .
Taking a page from Richard Pryor and even Chris Rock , Hughley 's comedy is tinged with brutal honesty and frustration about race and the status quo .
He hosted his own news and political discussion show for a brief time -- " D.L. Hughley Breaks the News " -- on CNN , and continues to be a vital and necessary voice in today 's comedy landscape .
07 of 10 Stephen Colbert WireImage / Getty Images Stephen Colbert might seem like another conservative comedian , but only to viewers who do n't get the joke ( and , really , who does n't get the joke ? ) .
Formerly host of his own Comedy Central show , " The Colbert Report " , and currently the host of " The Late Show " , Colbert savages right - wing pundits nightly ; he 's a sly satirist disguised as every thick - headed conservative blowhard on FOX News .
Colbert has even used his status as a political comedian to enter the realm of politics ; he spoke at the White House Correspondents '
Dinner in 2006 and even entertained a brief run for the White House in the 2008 election .
08 of 10 Chris Rock Mark Sagliocco / Getty Images Chris Rock , like George Carlin before him , is n't always political ( though , again like Carlin , he is always societal ) .
But his acts are always at least somewhat political -- typically critical of the government and often invoking race .
Almost all of his stand - up specials address the political climate of the times they 're born out of , including the election of the first African - American president .
When it comes to politics , Rock is willing to say things other comics wo n't -- not for shock value , but in the interest of speaking his view of the truth .
09 of 10 Janeane Garofalo Donna Ward / Getty Images Janeane Garofalo is another comedian who did n't begin politically , but whose career has shifted towards politics over the years .
Though she started out as a more observational , alternative comic -- joking about Weezer concerts and body image -- she has gradually become an active political voice in comedy .
She has often appeared on " Real Time with Bill Maher " and hosted her own radio show on the left - wing Air America network .
Her politics do n't always mix with her comedy the same way as some others on this list -- though fiercely left - wing , she does n't necessarily incorporate those ideas into her act -- but she still remains one of the foremost political comics in the country .
Britain has 7,800 troops in Afghanistan , the second largest troop commitment after the United States .
Its commanders have said that to ease severe strains on Britain ’s armed forces they need to take their troops out of Iraq without immediately recommitting them to Afghanistan .
They have also said they are reluctant to commit more British troops to Afghanistan unless other NATO nations , including France and Germany , agree to step up their troop levels .
The need to replace the departing British troops near Basra will place new strains on American commanders in Iraq .
Since 2003 , they have relied on British troops to maintain stability in southern Iraq and to guard the vital overland supply route from Kuwait , past Basra and on to central Iraq , where most of the American troops are based .
Now , if the British reports are confirmed , those commanders will have to detach an American force of brigade strength to the south , just as they begin drawing down their own troop levels farther north .
According to The Guardian and The Times of London , the 300 to 400 British service personnel who will remain after the drawdown will mainly assist in the training of Iraq ’s armed forces .
The British withdrawal will leave to history the controversy that has surrounded the performance of British troops in the south .
From early in the war , American commanders were frustrated by what they regarded as an inadequately robust use of British military force , particularly in confronting the rampant militia loyal to Moktada al - Sadr , the radical Shiite cleric , in Basra and Amara .
At times , strains between American and British commanders were severe , with the Americans admonishing the British for acquiescing in the Sadrist group ’s takeover of wide areas of the south when American forces were fighting the Mahdi Army , Mr. Sadr ’s ruthless militia , in Baghdad , Najaf and other Shiite population centers .
Within 18 months of the invasion , British commanders were complaining privately that the Americans lacked Britain ’s colonial experience in countries like Iraq , and that the heavy use of firepower against Mr. Sadr was counterproductive .
The British mantra then , and later , was summarized by a British general in Basra who said that Britain had learned from centuries of ruling occupied countries that “ you have to govern people as you find them , ” and that Mr. Sadr was a reality who had to be accepted .
But as Basra and Amara fell increasingly under the sway of militiamen and criminal gangs , the British approach met with growing criticism from defense experts and opposition politicians at home , who said British forces had abandoned ordinary Iraqis to chaos .
The denouement came in March this year , when units of the American 82nd Airborne Division were flown to Basra to rescue Iraqi troops floundering in an ill - prepared bid to drive the Mahdi Army from the city .
OMakeすごい。OMakeはマジですごい。
OMakeはGNU makeの代替品みたいなものなんだけど、正直なところこのツールの強力さはGNU makeと比べると失礼なくらいすごい。これのおかげで、「コード修正→ビルド→デバッグ→コード修正→・・・」のループの、ビルドにあたる作業がほぼ消え去った。
ファイルの依存関係の解析がとにかくすごい。よくあるユースケースなんかの場合、最小限の手間でほぼ完璧に依存関係を網羅して、よしなにビルドしてくれる。
とりあえず、はやみずが実際に使ってみたケースを例にとってそのすごさの一端を紹介しようと思う。
case study
論より証拠ということで、自分が OMake を試しにつかってみたケースを紹介する。C言語でスタティックライブラリを作っていて、それに加えて簡単なテストプログラムを書いている。
/ include / 以下にヘッダファイルが全部ある
/ src/ 以下に *.c があり、それをまとめて libfoo .a にする
/test/testfoo.c がテストプログラム。これと /src/libfoo.a をリンクして実行ファイルを作る
これらをOMakeでビルドするための手順を書いていく
まずはおまじない プロジェクトのルートとなるディレクトリで、 $ omake -- install を実行する。すると 、
OMakefile と OMakeroot という2つのファイルができる。OMakerootは編集する必要はないので、OMakefile を書き換える。 書き換えるの は2点。 #
Delete this line once you have configured this file eprintln ( $ ( CWD ) / OMakefile is not configured ) という2行を削除。eprintln によってビルドを実行した際にエラーメッセージが表示されるので、うざいから消すだけである。 そして、 # .
SUBDIRS : の行のコメントを外して、ビルドを実行したいディレクトリ名を追加する。実際にビルドが行われるのは、
/src と / test なので、 .
SUBDIRS : src test とすればよい。これで、src と test の中にそれぞれ入ってビルドを実行するよう指示したことになる。
OMake では、プロジェクトのルー ト をOMakerootによって知ることができる。それにより、サブディレクトリの中からでも、プロジェクト全体に渡るようなビルドを実行することができる。
/src/libfoo. a を作る つぎにライブラリ libfoo .
a をビルドするルールを記述しよう。/src/OMakefile というファイルを作り、次のように記述する。libfoo.a は、foo_a.c、 foo_b.c、 foo_c.c という3つのファイルをくっつけて作りたいとする。
CFLAGS += -g - I ../ include .DEFAULT : $ ( StaticCLibrary libfoo , foo_a foo_b foo_c ) これでおしまい 。OMake には StaticCLibrary ( スタティックライブラリをビルド ) や CProgram ( C言語の実行ファイルをビルド ) など、典型的なユースケースのための関数群が予め用意されている。もちろん、そういう関数を自分で作ることもできる。OMakeすごい！ ところで、foo_a.c などが include しているファイル （たとえば / include / foo.h をインクルードしていたとしよう）などは指定しなくてもいいのだろうか、という疑問が湧いてくると思う。 実はもう指定されている。foo_a.c のファイルの中に、 " #include " と。 OMake では、 gcc の - MM オプションを利用して、そのファイルが include しているファイルを調べてくれる。つまり、自分でヘッダファイルの依存を調べる必要が全くない。もし
/ include / foo.h が / include / bar.h を include していたとしても、その場合は自動的に 「 foo_a . c は bar.h にも依存している」と解析してくれる。OMakeすごい！ この仕組みは決してC言語だけのアドホックな機能だけではなく、スキャナという依存関係を調べる一般的なフレームワークとして提供されている機能を利用して、予め実装されているだけである。
長くなってしまったけど、とりあえず上の2行を書くだけで、全ての依存関係をちゃんと解決して、ビルドできるようになったということだ。この状態で /src/ の中で $ omake というコマンドを実行すれば、ビルドが完了する。/include/foo.h を編集して omake を再び実行すれば、依存しているファイルが更新されたと認識され、再度ビルドが行われる。OMakeすごい！
This is Tanya Vlach ’s new eyeball .
She lost her real one in a car accident a few years ago .
I met Tanya at a film festival recently .
During our conversation she said she was looking for help in turning her artificial eye into a eye - cam .
You know , a mini web cam inside an eyeball .
It would capture live video and stream it to a memory somewhere and also perhaps eventually assist her own vision in real time .
She confessed that she was not technologically adept enough to hack it on her own .
I suggested that she put her request out into the web to see if anyone there has any ideas .
She is serious about the project , which is half art , half medical innovation .
She does n’t have any money to fund the contraption because she says , she is still trying “ to figure out how to get out of my astronomical debt that I owe for the medical care that saved my life . ”
Her solicitation for engineering help , and a place to reply is here .
I am attempting to recreate my eye with the help of a miniature camera implant in my prosthetic / artificial eye .
The intraocular installation of an eye - cam will substitute for the field of vision of my left eye that I lost in 2005 from a car accident .
While my prosthetic is an excellent aesthetic replacement , I am interested in capitalizing on the current advancement of technology to enhance the abilities of my prosthesis for an augmented reality .
Specifications for the eyeball :
* DVR
* MPEG - 4 ? Recording
* Built in SD mini Card Slot
* 4 GB SD mini Card
* Mini A/V out
* Firewire / USB drive
* Optical 3X
* Remote trigger
* Bluetooth wireless method
* Inductors : ( Firewire / USB , power source )

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After nearly a year of flagging sales , low gas prices and fat incentives are reigniting America 's taste for big vehicles .
Trucks and SUVs will outsell cars in December , according to researchers at the automotive Website Edmunds.com , something that has n't happened since February .
Meanwhile , the forecast finds that sales of hybrid vehicles are expected to be way down .
" Despite all the public discussion of fuel efficiency , SUVs and trucks are the industry 's biggest sellers right now as a remarkable number of buyers seem to be compelled by three factors : great deals , low gas prices and winter weather , " commented Michelle Krebs , Senior Editor of Edmunds ' AutoObserver.com .
This month , trucks and SUVs will make up 51 % of all vehicles sold in the U.S. , according to Edmunds.com .
Before the spike in gas prices earlier this year , market share for trucks and SUVs had been even higher than that , said Edmunds.com sales analyst Jesse Toprak .
" We do n't claim they 're back to what they used to be , " Toprak said , " but it 's a reversal of the trend . "
A big drop - off in truck sales , caused by high gas prices as well as weak home construction and contracting markets , has been a major factor creating a financial crisis for American automakers .
Not only were these vehicles popular , they also generated much higher profits than cars .
Domestic automakers also face less competition from foreign automakers for the truck and SUV buyers .
On Friday , the Bush administration said it would lend $ 13.4 billion to GM and Chrysler to keep them out of bankruptcy .
Like summer for convertibles , winter is usually a strong selling season for SUVs as falling snow reminds buyers of the benefits of four - wheel - drive .
Besides that , and low gas prices , truck and SUV buyers are seeing deals they can no longer resist , Toprak said .
Pickup and large SUV sales are usually more dependent on incentives than those of other vehicles , even when the economy is relatively good .
The current market has caused some automakers to put unprecedented rebates on their trucks , Toprak said .
For instance , for every truck they sell this month , automakers are spending about $ 5,200 on incentives , on average , according to data from Edmunds.com .
Combined with discounts negotiated at the dealership , the actual prices consumers pay can be amazingly low , he said .
" I can get about $ 10,000 off a large SUV , " he said .
" There 's probably not going to be a better time . "
Next year , incentive spending is expected to drop and , correspondingly , prices paid by consumers will rise as recently announced production cutbacks limit the supply of new vehicles , Toprak said .
The term " SUV , " in this case , includes only truck - based vehicles like Ford Motor Co. 's ( F , Fortune 500 ) Ford Explorer and General Motors ' ( GM , Fortune 500 ) GMC Yukon , not car - based crossover vehicles like the Ford Escape or GMC Acadia .
Truck - based SUVs have a separate frame and they are designed for heavier hauling and towing .
They generally weight more and have lower fuel economy than crossover vehicles .
While truck and SUV sales are increasing , sales of hybrid vehicles are expected to be down , Toprak said , as sharply lower gas prices have made hybrids less attractive .
Gasoline prices now average about $ 1.67 a gallon , according to the most recent AAA gas price survey .
Prices had topped $ 4 a gallon this summer .
Because of their additional batteries and electric motors , hybrid vehicles cost thousands more to purchase than non -hybrid vehicles but , when gas prices are high , owners of some hybrid vehicles can make up that additional cost in fuel savings over a few years .
When gas is cheap , it takes longer to make up the extra cost .
Sales of the Toyota Motor Co.'s ( TMA ) Prius hybrid car are expected to be lower this month .
The Prius is , by far , the most popular hybrid vehicle in America , accounting for more than half of all hybrid vehicles sold in America .
As the highest - volume seller among hybrids , the Prius is seen as an indicator of the overall hybrid market , Toprak said .
In November , Prius sales were already down 48 % compared to the same month in 2007 .
Prius prices are also expected to be much lower , Toprak said .
When gas prices were high , Priuses were selling for more than their sticker price as buyers queued up on waiting lists .
Overall , December sales will still be dismal , Edmunds.com reported , despite an increase from the previous month .
Sales are usually stronger in December than in November , anyway .
Compared to seasonally adjusted trends , December will actually be the worst month of the year , Edmunds.com said .
Despite an increase in truck sales , market share for domestic automakers Ford , General Motors and Chrysler will drop about one percent to 51 % compared to December of 2007 .

The North American distributor FUNimation Entertainment has announced on Friday that it licensed Gonzo's Gankutsuou : The Count of Monte Cristo television anime series .
Director Mahiro Maeda ( Blue Submarine No.6 , The Animatrix 's " Second Renaissance " ) oversaw this science - fiction re-imagining of Alexandre Dumas ' classic novel about revenge and deception .
Natsuko Takahashi ( 07 - Ghost , Tales of Agriculture ) and Tomohiro Yamashita ( Afro Samurai , Red Garden ) supervised the scripts , while Hidenori Matsubara ( Ah! My Goddess , Sakura Wars ) designed the characters which Gonzo gave a distinctive stained - glass texture .
The anime aired in Japan from 2004 to 2005 , and won the award for the best television series at the 10th Animation Kobe Fair .
Instead of the post - revolutionary - era France of the original novel , Gonzo 's retelling takes place in a surreal distant future .
Albert , the son of a renowned general , meets the enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo during a festival on Luna .
Albert invites the beguiling count back to Paris .
Unbeknownst to Albert , his father had once framed the count and destroyed the count 's personal and public life .
What follows is a dark passage for Albert as he discovers the depths of the past wrongs and the lengths that the count is willing to go to avenge himself .
Another distributor , Geneon Entertainment ( USA ) Inc. , had released this anime series in North America in 2005 and 2006 .
Then , Geneon Entertainment ceased in - house distribution of its own titles in September 2007 .
FUNimation announced at Anime Expo 2008 this past July that it agreed to manufacture , sell , and distribute selected DVD titles from Geneon Entertainment in North America .
However , Gankutsuou : The Count of Monte Cristo was not licensed from Gonzo 's corporate parent GDH until now .

The main problem of most trading strategies and indicators based on the average analysis is a number of false signals in the case of flat and trend reverse ( for example , frequent crossings of the averages , numerous changes in the direction of the averages , etc. ) … .
The Kenji indicator using a unique algorithm avoids the most common average analysis traps and significantly improves the quality of signals by determining the current state of the market ( using the color indication “ Kenji ” shows the current state of the market : red color – downtrend , blue – uptrend , green – flat ) .

Interview by Jim Jepps
December 22 , 2008 --
There 's been surprisingly little discussion in the UK on the launching of the New Anti-Capitalist Party ( Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste or NPA ) over the water in France .
I thought I 'd take a look at this interesting and significant new development and so I spoke to John Mullen , the editor of Socialisme International , to see if I could find out more .
You recently attended the French launch of the " New Anti-Capitalist Party " .
How did it go ?
The official founding conference will be in January 2009 .
For the moment there are 400 “ committees for a new anti-capitalist party ” all over France .
The Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire ( LCR ) was the force which proposed and coordinated the foundation , and will dissolve itself into it in a couple of months time .
I attended the November national delegate meeting as one of the delegates for my town .
The meeting was very encouraging .
The new party initiative is obviously attracting a lot of people , many of them young , others are experienced union activists , mostly ( apart from the LCR members ) people who have not been in a party as such before .
Obviously for the moment , there is quite a lot of concentration on the preparation of a programme to be voted at the founding conference .
Nevertheless many committees have been active in campaigning on the issue of the financial crisis , defending schools and universities against budget cuts , defending illegal immigrants against expulsions and so on .
Four - hundred committees seems like an impressive number of groups for an organisation that has n't even been launched yet .
How do these committees operate ?
How large are they , for instance would you have more than one in a town ?
Essentially are they the new party in waiting or are they the campaign for the new party ?
It is impressive .
In Montpellier , a day - long regional meeting got 2000 people to it , a similar regional meeting in Marseilles got 1500 , other towns had huge meetings .
National commission meetings on ecology , on politics in working - class neighbourhoods and so on have produced wide debates and proposals .
Essentially the committees are already the new party in embryo – every week there is a national political leaflet given out in almost all the towns .
But the committees also have a lot of autonomy .
In one town there will be a public meeting on the financial crisis , in another a symbolic invasion on the local hypermarket to protest against the government ’s refusal to raise the minimum wage .
The LCR already had very much a federal sort of organisation ( for better and worse ) , and this will no doubt continue .
But the party - in - embryo does not yet have a regular publication , an essential element for a campaigning party .
Nor does it yet have a proper financial structure , though plans have been made for subs based on income .
There is a website , and a weekly paper should be set up two months after the founding conference .
So what 's the thinking behind the new organisation ?
After all , even more than the UK , there 's no shortage of left - wing groupings .
The massive strike waves and political movements of the last few years have shown that there are many , many people in France who would like to build a political alternative on the radical left .
Olivier Besancenot , the spokesperson of the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire , has recently had significantly higher popularity ratings than Sarkozy or his prime minister , Fillon .
But this widespread sympathy for radical left ideas has not led people to join far - left parties to anything like the extent one might think .
And the Socialist and Communist parties are generally identified as “ the parties who do n’t change much when they ’re in government ” , even if the Socialist Party has not yet been fully converted to Blairism .
The New Anti-capitalist Party was called for by the LCR ( and the LCR will be dissolving and merging with it ) .
The idea was a party which is based on struggle , where elections are secondary , but which does not ask members to all identify with a specific revolutionary or Trotskyist position .
Who 's currently involved in this initiative ?
The only big organisation involved is the ( soon to be ex - ) LCR .
And a few thousand individuals , quite a few of them well - known local or even national leaders of the non-party radical left , which has been quite big here for a number of years .
Inside the NPA , some activists want to draw the lines of the party fairly narrow , to be absolutely sure not to include people who are too quick to ally in local or regional government with the Socialist Party and their acceptance of neoliberalism .
Others would like to make the party considerably broader , because they are worried that people who put mass movements and strikes at the centre of their politics , and are firmly opposed to the dictatorship of profit , will be kept out of the party if the lines are drawn too narrowly .
Discussions continue on this .
But the present name of the party , “ anti-capitalist ” , represents the compromise position at present .
We want people who are opposed to capitalism , who generally believe that capitalism cannot be durably given a human face .
This means that inside the party you have people close to anarchism , close to radical green politics , close to Che Guevara ’s ideas etc. etc .
The debates are very interesting every time each current avoids simply affirming its identity and makes sure the questions are looked at in depth .
Do you think the current crisis in the Socialist Party is something that might bring dividends to the new project ?
The Left Party ( Die Linke ) in Germany certainly benefited from having a leading SPD member behind the project from the start .
What are the prospects for attracting the best parts of the Communists , Socialists , Lutte Ouvrière and , I guess , the Greens ?
Recent economic and political events certainly will boost the new party .
It is not hard to get people to listen to anti-capitalism these days – waves of sackings are making sure of that .
And the relative paralysis of the Socialist Party , and the Communist Party will certainly make it easier for the NPA to build support .
The situation is however complex , and the NPA is not the only organisation trying to crystallise the radical left .
To go through the parties one by one , but briefly :
The Trotskyist organisation of a few thousand activists , Lutte Ouvrière , is opposed to the New Anti-Capitalist Party to such an extent that it broke with a very long tradition by allying itself with the Socialist Party in the municipal elections last April , rather than risking an alliance with the LCR and the non-party radical left .
For Lutte Ouvrière , all these people in the NPA are not revolutionaries and therefore not interesting .
Over the last few years , Lutte Ouvrière has been completely cut off from any of the big unity political campaigns ( against the European constitution , against the far - right politician Le Pen etc ) .
LO sticks strictly to “ workplace issues ” and is in decline because of this .
It has just expelled the minority current from its ranks because this current wanted to work with the New Anti-capitalist Party .
The leadership of the Communist Party ( PCF ) won a good majority at its conference for a “ business as usual ” motion putting alliances with the Socialist Party at the centre of its strategy .
All minority motions did very well though .
Whole sections of communists are leaving the party ( many favourable to a federation of the radical left ) .
But its paper and its good analyses of the economic crisis mean the PCF still has an audience .
The Socialist Party has seen two historic events in the last six months .
First , a significant split to the left by Mr Mélenchon , who has now established a new party “ Le parti de gauche ” on the model , he says ( but much smaller ) , of Germany 's Die Linke .
It will be founded very soon , and will attempt to fill the gap between the Socialist Party “ let ’s manage capitalism more humanly ” line and the “ almost revolutionary ” line of the New Anti-Capitalist Party .
It could become an important force , it ’s hard to say .
The second key event is that Ségolène Royal , the Tony Blair of the Socialist Party , was defeated by an alliance much to the left of her ( though not that left ) , on a very close poll .
This is excellent news , and means that left arguments will be more audible .
The radical left should be able to point up the difference between the left speeches of Martine Aubry , the new leader , and the lack of support for key struggles from this absolutely electoralist party .
Finally , some of these fragments , as well as teams from the non-party left , have just set up a “ Federation ” of left forces and activists , to try to overcome the bittiness of the radical left .
The idea is that different forces and individuals can join it to run joint campaigns , but do n’t need to leave their own organisations – dual membership is encouraged .
This Federation is backed by a number of important figures .
The upshot of all this is that the New Anti-Capitalist Party has a lot of decisions to make about who to work with on what .
For example , for the European elections in 2009 – is it better to have united slates of candidates across the radical left ( I think so ) or to have an independent “ New Anti-capitalist Party ” slate so as to be able to put forward a clearer platform .
The tendency within the New Anti-Capitalist Party is to rock forwards and backwards between sectarianism and unity politics .
I am not talking about mad small - group sectarianism ( because the new party will start with many thousands of people ) .
But that sectarianism which always emphasises first of all our differences with other groups , and finds a host of reasons why we cannot work with them even for limited aims .
There is a real tendency inside the NPA to think “ we are the only real left ” or “ of course we want unity : people from other organisations should leave them and join us instead , then we ’ll be united ” .
The tendency towards sectarianism is the biggest danger for the NPA .
The numbers , relative youth , enthusiasm , energy and real pedagogy for explaining key issues are the most important positive points .
In Britain there has been an ongoing difficulty with left unity projects where revolutionaries have been determined to hang onto their autonomy within the broader alliance to the extent that it can create , to my mind , unnecessary conflicts and distrust of separate agendas .
What 's the position of the LCR , as the most significant organised current in the NPA , on this tricky balancing act between retaining distinct organisation within the NPA and submerging their efforts into it ?
An old and tricky problem , and you and me wo n’t necessarily see it in the same way .
In my opinion the problem comes when differences are not discussed but separate agendas are pushed forward in rather hidden ways .
I personally would like to see the NPA declare : “ The NPA is a party which has some people who are revolutionaries and others are not .
Debate will continue within the party on these issues , while together we build all the struggles which are needed to oppose the dictatorship of profit . ”
This is not really happening .
There is a tendency to hide differences .
So for example , on the question of whether the NPA is a revolutionary party or not , the posters will say “ A party to revolutionise society ” and a whole number of other formulations which avoid the question .
This “ formulation politics ” was already one of the banes of the LCR .
On a difficult question , find a formulation which upsets no one , instead of deciding the question .
Some of the formulations had no meaning …
So , it is an ongoing question .
To emphasise that the aim of the LCR is not to control the NPA , the LCR is officially dissolving itself just before the foundation of the NPA , and there is no plan to maintain an LCR current inside the NPA .
I think it likely that the different currents that were in the LCR will end up setting up three or four currents in the NPA , which seems fine to me .
As Socialisme International , our tiny group of comrades , along with a couple of dozen others will certainly set up openly a current based on IS ideas ( close to British Socialist Workers Party 's theories ) .
To sum up , the New Anti-Capitalist Party is a very exciting initiative and everyone should build it .
The new economic crisis means workers have even more of a need for a party based on class struggle , and there is a new generation of young activists being built very quickly .
I hope the NPA will quickly work with wider federations , and in this way help to win partial victories on important points , while continuing the debate on how to definitively eliminate capitalism .

A district court judge this week clarified her decision of last December to dismiss important parts of a trade mark case against Google brought by car insurance firm GEICO over the search engine 's AdWords service .
Car insurance firm GEICO sued both Google and Yahoo ! subsidiary Overture in May 2004 over the sale of its registered trade marks as sponsored search terms in the keyword advertising services of both search engines .
These services work by allowing advertisers to sponsor particular search terms so that , for a fee , whenever that term is searched the advertiser 's link will appear next to the search results .
Google ’s AdWords underwent a policy change in April 2004 .
Until then Google had respected requests from companies that asked it to prevent their marks from being available for sponsorship .
Conversely , Google has always allowed trade mark holders to request that their trade marks do not appear in the headings or text of sponsored links .
But the policy change – allowing a trade marked term to trigger a third party 's ad – sparked lawsuits against Google , including the action filed by GEICO .
Overture settled in late November , but Google continued its fight .
In December , Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia , announced her decision .
This week , she issued a formal opinion explaining in more detail her reasons for that decision , albeit parts of the case are still due to continue to trial unless the parties reach a settlement .
The upshot : Google 's sale of GEICO trade marks as keywords was not unlawful .
But GEICO established a likelihood of confusion with regard to those sponsored links that use GEICO 's trade marks in their headings or text .
So the sale of GEICO as a keyword was lawful ; but ads that included GEICO 's marks in their text , however triggered , were not .
If the keyword GEICO triggered an ad without GEICO 's marks in its text , there would be no infringement .
GEICO had presented survey evidence of user confusion , based on a study carried out by a university ; but Judge Brinkema expressed " serious doubts about the accuracy of the survey results ' reflection of actual users ' experiences with and reactions to the Sponsored Links . "
She wrote that GEICO " has failed to establish a likelihood of confusion stemming from Google 's use of GEICO 's trademark as a keyword and has not produced sufficient evidence to proceed on the question of whether the Sponsored Links that do not reference GEICO 's marks in their headings or text create a sufficient likelihood of confusion to violate either the Lanham Act or Virginia common law . "
Had GEICO 's survey methodology been better , the result may have been different .
And mindful of the importance of the issues before her " to the ongoing evolution of internet business practices and to the application of traditional trademark principles to this new medium , " Judge Brinkema was careful to emphasise that her ruling " applies only to the specific facts of this case " .
When the survey participants were shown a page bearing sponsored ads for Nike alongside organic listings in response to a search for GEICO , there was no confusion .
Judge Brinkema said this " refutes the allegation that the use of the trademark as a keyword , without more , causes a likelihood of confusion . "
Notwithstanding the flaws , she acknowledged that GEICO had produced survey evidence " sufficient to establish a likelihood of confusion regarding those Sponsored Links in which the trademark GEICO appears either in the heading or text of the ad . "
She continued : " Based on this finding , Google may be liable for trademark infringement for the time period before it began blocking such usage or for such ads that have slipped or continue to slip through Google 's system for blocking the appearance of GEICO 's mark in Sponsored Links . "
Whether Google or its advertisers should be liable for the use of GEICO 's trade marks in the headings and text of Google 's sponsored links is a question that has still to be answered .
GEICO 's General Counsel , Charles Davies , responded to the written opinion , saying , " GEICO will continue to aggressively enforce its trade mark rights against purchasers of its trade marks on search engines and against search engines that sell GEICO 's trade marks to advertisers . "
He continued : " We continue to believe that the sale of GEICO 's trade marks to its competitors is wrong and a violation of federal and state law and look forward to litigating that issue in future cases . "
Google 's Litigation Counsel , Michael Kwun , described the ruling as " an extraordinary victory for Google . "
He explained to SearchEngineWatch.com : " Google is extremely pleased with the outcome in this case .
The important issue for us in it – which is the use of trademarks as keyword triggers – was decided decisively in our favor . "
