One Russian blogger has spotted a something looking like a crash site in the wild forests near St. Petersburg .
So he decided to travel to that place and see it by his own eyes .
After a long journey through the woods he found the AN - 8 plane which was landed in the middle of the forest and now stays abandoned .
The reasons why it had to this are unknown .

At last week ’s Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) FRR , program managers discussed a wide range of topics , including Weather Satellite limitations , the Boundary Layer Transition DTO ( Detailed Test Objective ) , several new operations that will be a part of STS - 128 – including Discovery ’s debut of new flight software – as well as previous flight performance of the MPLM ( Multi- Purpose Logistics Module ) on STS - 126 .
Weather and Boundary Layer Transition :
One of the first notes pertaining to new procedures for STS - 128 in the Mission Operations Directorate ’s ( MOD’s ) Mission Procedures presentation to the FRR related to the Continental United States ( CONUS ) weather satellite system .
“ GOES - 12 ( East ) will not be available due to eclipse power - outage , ” notes the presentation .

Caused because the GOES - 12 satellite will be in Earth shadow , the presentation notes that the satellite will be unavailable between 12:15 A.M. through 1:45 A.M. EDT from August 23rd through 28th .
Given that this period of time covers the extent of Discovery ’s launch window – although the 23rd has been all but ruled out due to processing timelines – the Space Flight Meteorology Group has indicated that the GOES - 11 ( West ) satellite is capable of providing a “ non-optimal ” oblique view of the Kennedy Space Center during the eclipse times for GOES - 12 .
The next item of interest to gain attention by the MOD is the Boundary Layer Transition DTO Discovery will conduct during her re-entry at the end of the mission .
“ Second flight of DTO will gather data during entry regarding the aerothermal effects caused by the boundary layer transitioning from laminar flow to turbulent flow at a high Mach number , ” notes the Mission Operations presentation .
This DTO was first performed on Discovery ’s previous flight ( STS - 119 ) .
However , there are several changes to the DTO for its second flight .
For the second Boundary Layer Transition DTO , the protuberance height on a modified Thermal Protection System ( TPS ) tile on the underside of Discovery has been increased to 0.35 inches – enabling the Boundary Layer to be tripped at Mach 18 .
Furthermore , based on post - flight analysis from STS - 119 , a temperature - sensitive coating has been applied to two TPS tiles located downstream of the protuberance , the thermocouples have been relocated , and one downstream tile has been replaced with one that has a higher heat load capacity .
New Operations :
Debuting on Discovery for STS - 128 is the OI - 34 ( Operational Increment number 34 ) software .
“ Enhancements made to Backup Flight Software Heads Up Display to make performance more similar to PASS HUD , ” notes the Mission Operations FRR presentation .
Additional enhancements made possible by the OI - 34 software include a Bodyflap warning message on the HUD , enhanced runway overlays using “ landing site table data for correct length , ” HUD high g limit warnings , and deceleration command restoration .
The remaining changes implemented include “ memory efficiencies , minor DR fixes , removal of unused code , and documentation - only CRs . ”
The previous software upgrade – OI - 33 – included safety modifications for engine out scenarios , External Tank separation during a RTLS ( Return To Landing Site ) abort , and the orbiter ’s ability to return to Earth unmanned .

Discovery will also debut the O2 crossover Valve Position indication as a result of a failure seen on STS - 126 last year .
“ MO10W wiring modification provides position indication for system 1 & 2 crossover valves and simplifies pre-launch and on - orbit troubleshooting . ”
The final Launch Commit Criteria modifications for this new wiring configuration were approved by the PRCB ( Program Requirements Control Board ) at the Noon Board on June 23 , 2009 .
Also noted in the Mission Operations presentation under the “ new procedures ” category is the Ammonia Tank Assembly removal and replacement ( R&R ) on the P1 truss .
“ NH3 vent planned for FD2 .
ATA will be isolated from EATCS loop and on - orbit tests confirm the EATCS loop can function without the ATA , ” notes the FRR presentation .
Venting of NH3 is required for this operation in order to reduce the pressure in the ATA tank to the Quick Disconnect line .
The venting will prevent over - pressurization in the lines that can be caused by thermal changes .
It will also reduce the risk of a leak – which is classed as a “ catastrophic hazard / flammability risk in PLB . ”
The presentation also notes that if the venting operation should fail , “ one tank isolation valve will be opened to reduce over - pressurization . ”
Also , the vent can be performed manually during an EVA ( Spacewalk ) if required .
Previous Mission Anomalies :
The main issues / anomaly gaining note from the MOD relate to the previous MPLM flight – STS - 126 .
Before STS - 126 , the ISS Program and ASI telemetry representatives removed the MPLM off - nominal condition values in an effort to save S - band bandwidth .
However , they did not properly communicate the removal with ASI flight control team .
As a result , “ MPLM Telemetry Parameters were noted as off - nominal and were unavailable in the ISS S - band stream during the STS - 126 mission for the ASI ( Agenzia Spaziale Italiana ) flight control team . ”
In response to this anomaly , NASA and ASI agreed to provide Caution and Warning “ events ” to the ASI flight control team for the three remaining Shuttle MPLM flights – the first of which is STS - 128 .
This will be accomplished by “ placing a camera on the Caution and Warning display and displaying it in the MPLM area . ”
In all , the MOD is ready to support STS - 128 pending the completion of all standard and non-standard open work .

The Trappist Monks live a modest life of work , prayer , and study .
Each monastery is self - supporting and engages in great charitable efforts , most often through the production and sale of a variety of goods , from cheese and bread to clothing and coffins , and always of the highest quality .
The monks are not prohibited from the consumption of alcohol ; indeed ale was often a staple of their diets , and was the only thing to sustain them through the 40 days of fasting they observed between Ash Wednesday and Easter .
To this day , seven monasteries throughout Belgium and the Netherlands are known for producing what is among the finest ale in the world , which was once available only to the monks themselves or the communities surrounding the monasteries .
The work of intrepid beer explorers ( far grander than us ) has brought these fine ales to the entire world today .
The Trappist Punks take our name in the tradition of these fine men in honor of their dedication to the crafting and consumption of the finest beer .
As for the modest lives ... they can keep all that ... hence the " Punks " part .
Cheers !

FOUR hundred years ago our understanding of the universe changed for ever .
On August 25th 1609 an Italian mathematician called Galileo Galilei demonstrated his newly constructed telescope to the merchants of Venice .
Shortly afterwards he turned it on the skies .
He saw mountains casting shadows on the moon and realised this body was a world , like the Earth , endowed with complicated terrain .
He saw the moons of Jupiter — objects that circled another heavenly body in direct disobedience of the church 's teaching .
He saw the moonlike phases of Venus , indicating that this planet circled the sun , not the Earth , in even greater disobedience of the priests .
He saw sunspots , demonstrating that the sun itself was not the perfect orb demanded by the Greek cosmology that had been adopted by the church .
But he also saw something else , a thing that is often now forgotten .
He saw that the Milky Way , that cloudy streak across the sky , is made of stars .
That observation was the first hint that , not only is the Earth not the centre of things , but those things are vastly , almost incomprehensibly , bigger than people up until that date had dreamed .
And they have been getting bigger , and also older , ever since .
Astronomers ' latest estimates put the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years .
That is three times as long as the Earth has existed and about 100,000 times the lifespan of modern humanity as a species .
The true size of the universe is still unknown .
Its age , and the finite speed of light , means no astronomer can look beyond a distance of 13.7 billion light - years .
But it is probably bigger than that .
Nor does reality necessarily end with this universe .
Physics , astronomy 's dutiful daughter , suggests that the object that people call the universe , vast though it is , may be just one of an indefinite number of similar structures , governed by slightly different rules from each other , that inhabit what is referred to , for want of a better term , as the multiverse .
Star trek
The shattering of the crystal spheres which Galileo 's contemporaries thought held the planets and the stars , with the sphere containing the stars representing the edge of the universe , is ( along with Darwin 's discovery of evolution by natural selection ) the biggest revolution in self - knowledge that mankind has undergone .
The world that Galileo was born into was of comprehensible compass .
The Greeks had a fair idea of the size of the Earth and the distance to the moon , and so did the medievals who read their work .
But these were distances that the imagination might , at a stretch , embrace .
And it was easier to believe that a human - sized universe was one that might have been brought into being with humanity in mind .
It is harder , though , to argue that the modern version of cosmology , let alone any hypothetical one which is multiversal rather than universal , has come about for mankind 's convenience .
Four centuries on , it is difficult to think of Galileo 's intellectual heirs , meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union ( see article ) , as firebrand revolutionaries .
Yet their discoveries — from planets around other stars that may support alien life , to dark matter and energy of unknown nature that are the dominant stuff of reality — are no less world - changing than his .
Moderns may be more comfortable than medievals with the idea that man 's notion of his place within the universe can suddenly change .
That should not blind them to the wonder of it .
MI6 chief blows his cover as wife 's Facebook account reveals family holidays , showbiz friends and links to David Irving
Compromised : Incoming MI6 head Sir John Sawers in a picture his wife published on her Facebook profile page
The new head of MI6 has been left exposed by a major personal security breach after his wife published intimate photographs and family details on the Facebook website .
Sir John Sawers is due to take over as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in November , putting him in charge of all Britain 's spying operations abroad .
But his wife 's entries on the social networking site have exposed potentially compromising details about where they live and work , who their friends are and where they spend their holidays .
Amazingly , she had put virtually no privacy protection on her account , making it visible to any of the site 's 200 million users who chose to be in the open - access ' London ' network - regardless of where in the world they actually were .
There are fears that the hugely embarrassing blunder may have compromised the safety of Sir John 's family and friends .
Lady Shelley Sawers ' extraordinary lapse exposed the couple 's friendships with senior diplomats and well - known actors , including Moir Leslie , who plays a leading character in The Archers .
And it revealed that the intelligence chief 's brother - in - law - who holidayed with him last month - is an associate of the controversial Right - wing historian David Irving .
Immediately after The Mail on Sunday alerted the Foreign Office to the astonishing misjudgment , all trace of the material – which could potentially be useful to hostile foreign powers or terrorists - was removed from the internet .
The move suggests that MI6 or the Foreign Office , which is also responsible for the GCHQ electronic eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham , had not vetted what sort of information Sir John and his family were distributing over the internet .
Nor does it appear that the new intelligence chief - who will be codenamed ' C ' once he takes up his post - had considered the potential risks of what his family was revealing to the world .
Foreign
Office staff are warned about their use of social networking sites when they join the department but MI6 expects its agents to maintain an even tighter secrecy , telling them not to reveal their true role to all but their closest family .
Sir John Sawers , currently Britain's Ambassador to the United Nations , where he sits on the highly sensitive Security Council , began his working life in MI6 but has spent the past 20 years building a career as a diplomat rather than a spy .
Senior politicians said the security lapse raised serious doubts about Sir John 's suitability to head the intelligence service - and raised questions over whether an outsider should have been appointed to such a sensitive role .
Despite the security implications , Lady Sawers revealed on Facebook the location of the London flat used by the couple and the whereabouts of their three children and of Sir John 's parents .
On June 16 , the very day Sir John 's MI6 appointment was announced , she posted 19 pictures of the couple on holiday with their friends in the West Country earlier that month .
The following day , she added a further 26 pictures , including one of Sir John playing on the beach in his swimming trucks , posing with his wife and children and chatting with friends and his mother .
Among those who joined the Sawers on the break were actors Moir Leslie , who plays both Sophie Barlow and vicar Janet Fisher in Radio 4 soap opera The Archers , and Alister Cameron , a character actor who has appeared on The Bill and Footballers ' Wives .
Lady Sawers ' Facebook ' friends ' have also used the account to send messages of congratulations to Sir John on his new job , with one relative joking that he will now be known as ' Uncle C ' .
On the day his appointment was announced , she wrote : ' Congrats on the new job , already dubbed Sir Uncle " C " by nephews in the know ! '
Over the past year , Lady Sawers has been regularly updating anyone who cared to read her page - which could be found via internet search engines - on everything from family parties and holidays to the health of their pets and her views on the crisis in the Congo .
She also posted 22 photographs from Sir John 's mother 's 80th birthday party , showing the future spy chief with his closest friends and extended family , including his 86 - year - old father , his two sons , aged 25 and 24 , their girlfriends , and the couple 's daughter Corinne , 22 , a recent Oxford University graduate who is now an aspiring actress .
Corinne recently began touring with Jenny Seagrove in the play Pack Of Lies , coincidentally about a middle - class household suddenly at the centre of an espionage drama when an MI5 spy turns up at their house .
Among those featured in family photographs on the website is Lady Sawers ' half - brother Hugo Haig - Thomas , a former diplomat .
Lady Sawers met her husband after visiting her brother when he was posted to Yemen in the late Seventies .
She liked the country and decided to stay , landing a secretarial job at the Embassy , where Sir John later succeeded Mr Haig - Thomas .
Mr Haig - Thomas is an associate and researcher for revisionist historian David Irving , who was jailed for three years in Austria in 2006 for ' glorifying the Nazi Party ' because he questioned whether the Holocaust took place .
The historian describes Haig - Thomas as ' a researcher who has done fine work for me ' .
His work includes examining the papers relating to the capture of Heinrich Himmler , the man behind Hitler 's plan to exterminate the European Jews .
A recent post by Mr Haig - Thomas on Irving 's website includes a translation of the testimony of a German officer who claimed to have built fake gas chambers at Sachsenhausen concentration camp on Soviet orders .
But Mr Haig - Thomas said he had never considered his views controversial , nor did he regret his connection with Irving .
He said : ' We are not close friends .
I am interested in history , particularly German history , and I was engaged to carry out research for Irving .
I have also attended several of his talks , but I do not necessarily share his views .
' In my experience , the Foreign Office are very sensible about these things and will see that our connection does not amount to much . '
Edward Davy , the Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman , called on Gordon Brown to launch an inquiry into whether the Facebook disclosures had compromised Sir John 's ability to take up his MI6 post .
He said : ' Normally , I would welcome greater openness in Government for officials or politicians but this type of exposure verges on the reckless .
' The Prime Minister should immediately commission an internal inquiry as to whether this has breached the security of the incoming head of MI6 too seriously to allow him to take up the post . '
And Conservative MP Patrick Mercer , an adviser to Government Security Minister Lord West , said the MI6 chief had left himself open to blackmail .
He said : ' Sir John Sawers is in a very sensitive position and by revealing this sort of material his family have left him open to criticism and blackmail .
' As a long - serving diplomat and ambassador , his whole family have been involved in his line of business for decades .
I would have hoped they would have been much more sensitive to potential security compromises like this .'
The Foreign Office refused to discuss the affair and declined to answer questions , including whether the department warned Ambassadors and other staff about social networking sites ; whether the details Sir John 's family published on the internet had come up in security checks before he was appointed as head of MI6 ; and whether he had made officials aware of his brother - in - law 's links to David Irving .
But Foreign Secretary David Miliband today dismissed allegations of recklessness .
He told BBC1 ’s Andrew Marr Show : ' It is not a state secret that he wears Speedo swimming trunks . '
He added : ‘ He was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6 ; he ’s an outstanding professional who will do a really good job in an outstanding organisation that does a huge amount for this country '
New research , which reconstructs the extent of ice in the sea between Greenland and Svalbard from the 13th century to the present indicates that there has never been so little sea ice as there is now .
The research results from the Niels Bohr Institute , among others , are published in the scientific journal , Climate Dynamics .
There are of course neither satellite images nor instrumental records of the climate all the way back to the 13th century , but nature has its own ' archive ' of the climate in both ice cores and the annual growth rings of trees and we humans have made records of a great many things over the years - such as observations in the log books of ships and in harbour records .
Piece all of the information together and you get a picture of how much sea ice there has been throughout time .
Modern research and historic records
" We have combined information about the climate found in ice cores from an ice cap on Svalbard and from the annual growth rings of trees in Finland and this gave us a curve of the past climate " explains Aslak Grinsted , geophysicist with the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen .
In order to determine how much sea ice there has been , the researchers needed to turn to data from the logbooks of ships , which whalers and fisherman kept of their expeditions to the boundary of the sea ice .
The ship logbooks are very precise and go all the way back to the 16th century .
They relate at which geographical position the ice was found .
Another source of information about the ice are records from harbours in Iceland , where the severity of the winters have been recorded since the end of the 18th century .
By combining the curve of the climate with the actual historical records of the distribution of the ice , researchers have been able to reconstruct the extent of the sea ice all the way back to the 13th century .
Even though the 13th century was a warm period , the calculations show that there has never been so little sea ice as in the 20th century .
In the middle of the 17th century there was also a sharp decline in sea ice , but it lastet only a very brief period .
The greatest cover of sea ice was in a period around 1700 - 1800 , which is also called the ' Little Ice Age ' .
" There was a sharp change in the ice cover at the start of the 20th century , " explains Aslak Grinsted .
He explains , that the ice shrank by 300.000 km2 in the space of ten years from 1910 - 1920 .
So you can see that there have been sudden changes throughout time , but here during the last few years we have had some record years with very little ice extent .
" We see that the sea ice is shrinking to a level which has not been seen in more than 800 years " , concludes Aslak Grinsted .
July 24 , 2009  --
With one in five Gen Yers unable to find work , a new " lost generation " may be in the making in Europe .
Policymakers fear long - term unemployment could diminish the generation 's future prospects on the labor market .
On paper , Jerome Delorme seems like a pretty desirable job candidate .
The 23 - year - old has a master 's degree in European studies from the prestigious Sciences Po University in Grenoble -- once a sure ticket to a top company , even in hard times .
And he spent a year studying in Dublin , speaks fluent English , and has already had several high - profile internships .
But in three months of looking for work , Delorme has been able to land only another internship , at a non-profit organization .
" The crisis has made getting a real job very difficult , " says the native of the southern French city of Valence .
Delorme is typical of Europe 's Gen Y these days .
Most of his friends are also pounding the cobblestones in search of employment -- as are about 5 million other young Europeans , or about 20 percent of the under - 25 population , the European Union estimates .
That 's nearly a third higher than a year ago and well above the 8.9 percent unemployment rate for the EU as a whole .
In some countries the situation is far worse .
Nearly 37 percent of Spain 's Gen Yers can't find work .
In France , it 's 24 percent , vs. 17 percent in the US .
Policymakers worry prolonged unemployment will hurt an entire generation 's ability to compete in the workplace .
When the economy finally recovers , many of the under - 25s will have become over - 25s , and younger rivals will be nipping at their heels for entry - level jobs .
The big fear : Europe 's Gen Yers will suffer the fate of Japan 's Lost Generation -- young people who came of age in the recession - wracked 1990s but lacked the skills to find good jobs even after the economy started to pick up steam .
If that happens , the Continent would struggle to cope with large numbers of jobless young people .
Violent protests over lousy job prospects earlier this year in Eastern Europe made politicians acutely aware of mounting social problems .
" Most countries are moving in the right direction , but there 's still a risk that unemployment will last for years , " says Stefano Scarpetta , head of employment analysis at the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development in Paris .
Governments are spending billions to keep the young busy via college grants and vocational courses until the economy recovers .
On June 29 , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown unveiled a $ 1.6 billion ( €1.1 billion ) scheme to create 100,000 jobs for young people , with a special emphasis on helping those who 've been out of work for more than a year .
And on April 24 , French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced a $ 1.9 billion plan to find work for 500,000 young people by June 2010 .
That includes grants to companies that employ Gen Yers and a 12 percent increase in new government - funded apprenticeships in plumbing , carpentry , and other trades .
Some wonder how much good those programs will do given the severity of the downturn .
" There 's pressure on governments to find employment for young people , but I do n't see how that 's going to happen in the short term , " says Giorgio S. Questa , a professor at City University 's Cass Business School in London .
Business groups , meanwhile , fret that new apprenticeships could take jobs away from older workers and may prove unsustainable if government funding dries up .
Neil Carberry , head of employment policy at the Confederation of British Industry , says similar programs in the 1980s failed because they simply kept young people busy without giving them sufficient skills to land more interesting work when the economy recovered .
" People digging ditches and painting walls just does n't add value , " he says .
Spain's Setback
Lavish welfare systems ease some of the strain for Europe 's Gen Y .
With state - sponsored health care and ample jobless benefits , Europeans have fewer worries than unemployed twentysomethings in the US .
And young Europeans are more likely to bunk with Mom and Dad than their American counterparts are , so it 's easier for them to make ends meet while looking for a job .
In Spain , for instance , more than half of people under 30 still live at home .
But that has done little to ease the pain of the crisis for many Spaniards .
When the country 's construction and real estate industries were booming , under - 25s often skipped college to go straight to work , cashing in on the credit - fuelled bonanza .
Since 2007 , though , the economy has imploded and may contract by 3.2 percent this year .
Many young people were on short - term contracts , so they were first to be laid off when times got tough .
And skipping further education in favor of employment , they often lack such skills as foreign languages , IT know - how , and advanced math that employers demand .
Says Carlos Serrano , a 25 - year - old electronic engineer from northern Spain who has been looking for a job for a year , with no luck : " The crisis has trapped us graduates at the worst possible time . "
For this week 's Photoshop Contest , I asked you to design some summer gadgets that we 've never seen before .
And they all make me want to go outside .

In the last few years , the use of the dedicated hosting server services has increased to a far greater extent than ever .
The companies worldwide have started using these dedicated servers in a massive proportion .
At the very outset , anyone will point at the high proficiency of the servers behind such popularity .
Partly it is true .
But the other thing looked into is the substantial change that has happened in the industrial world in the past few years .
Gone are those days hen the companies were only content with their names mentioned on some websites .
Now they are looking forward to making their websites .
They are walking in this path as the offline market has become static .
Previously most of the companies were concerned more with the offline market .
Be it expansion or launching of the new items , for each of the matters the companies depended to a great extent to the offline market .
But along with time things has .
A lot of new businesses have assembled in the offline market as a result of which steep competition has started .
Not having enough space for expansion and earning revenue there , the companies are moving into the online market which has become technically much superior over the ages .
For the best results in the business ventures , the companies are looking for the dedicated hosting server services .
The companies are finding these servers cheap as well as quite proficient in work .
Though the price of these servers is much lesser than the dedicated servers , they collaborate with the same kind of efficiency .
It is one of the reasons the demand for the dedicated hosting servers services is rising .
Looking the prospects , various companies have now started selling the servers .
The companies are getting all kinds of help from the servers .
Mainly these servers are sold in packages .
Each of the packages consists of various supportive features .
The service providers mostly take care of the server traffic flow as well as the server monitoring .
At the same time , they support the customers if they face any trouble in using the servers at any point in time .
It is not possible for the companies to know all the matters regarding the servers .
So the larger matters regarding the servers are taken care of by the service providers .
At any point in time , the users can call the customer care support of the dedicated hosting server services and ask for assistance which they are bound to provide .
As a result , the companies face no problem in controlling the servers .
However , the experts opine to buy the servers at a justified price .
So it is better not to go for those services that are too cheap .
It is always better to do a proper check up of the servers and find out whether or not the clients will get the promised services or not .
After making a good background check , only the dedicated hosting server services .
SANTIAGO , Chile — Camila Escobar is no ordinary college student .
She goes to parties , studies and hangs out with friends .
But she just spent her winter break doing something many of her peers would never consider : building houses for slum dwellers .
Escobar , 19 , is a volunteer at “ A Roof for Chile ” ( Un Techo para Chile ) , a non-profit organization set up by Jesuit priest Felipe Berrios that constructs emergency housing for slum dwellers .
Camila is one of over 15,000 volunteers who spend their winter breaks and summer vacations building these transitory wooden shacks ( called “ mediaguas ” ) for the most impoverished families in Chile .
Several times a week , she leaves her comfortable home in a wealthy suburb and heads for the outskirts of the capital to visit her designated community .
There , her efforts go beyond construction as she coordinates social programs and guides families in their transition from being the most marginalized of the poor to an organized community fighting for their rights .
The effort began in 1997 , when Berrios gathered a group of university students to help build mediaguas in Curanilahue , an extremely poor coal mining town located almost 400 miles south of Santiago .
He signed up volunteers to spend their winter break there building 350 200 - square - foot wooden shacks .
It was such a success that more students joined and set a goal of building 2,000 mediaguas by the year 2000 .
They achieved it .
That year , A Roof for Chile began a massive fundraising campaign and opened regional offices throughout the country .
From the 106,000 families living in 972 slums registered by the Housing Ministry in 1996 , A Roof for Chile was pivotal in reducing the number to 20,000 families in 533 slums this year .
“ We have First World infrastructure , with families who still live in the Third World .
This has got to change , and it depends on us to change history , ” said Berrios during a recent visit to a newly built housing development for former slum dwellers .
Beyond the volunteers , the real driving force behind A Roof for Chile is a powerful dose of mysticism , group spirit and a deep sense of social responsibility .
“ It ’s not work for work ’s sake .
I do it because I want to help the people I love , and accompany them throughout the process .
You end up becoming friends and I love going there .
More than work , it ’s a life option , ” said Escobar , who is studying speech therapy .
The volunteers do n’t need to be architects or construction workers .
They organize in squads run by someone who ’s built mediaguas before .
“ It ’s not hard .
It ’s tiring , but fun and enriching , because you ’re in contact with the families , you have lunch with them , they participate in the construction , and we create really strong bonds with one another .
We are one of the few institutions people trust , because they realize that we do n’t expect anything in return , ” said volunteer Sofia Wielandt , 21 .
The emergency housing is only a first step toward helping the slum dwellers out of poverty .
The program also builds their communities collectively and by training individuals .
Slum dwellers elect representatives and work with the volunteers throughout the year in what the program calls “ social habilitation , ” which includes assistance and training in health , education , labor and legal matters .
About 85 percent of all donations to A Roof for Chile — mainly monetary , but also in construction material — comes from businesses , the rest from individual donors .
“ The social habilitation is much more important than the house itself , because the goal is not to go from the slum to their new neighborhood in the same conditions : poor education , kids selling drugs , unemployment .
The idea is that they improve their quality of life as a whole , ” Escobar explained .
Rosa Marquez and her extended family used to live like “ little animals , ” as she described it , crammed into a one - room , rundown shack made of wooden posts , cartons and plastic in a slum with no running water or electricity .
Now she has two daughters in college .
“ My husband lost his job and we could no longer afford to pay rent .
So a generous man loaned us some space in a camp where we could stay for a few days , ” she recalled .
They have been there for 15 years .
Ten years ago , volunteers from A Roof for Chile approached Marquez 's community and signed up all the families that needed emergency housing units .
A troop of volunteers went in and in just a few days built mediaguas using what they could salvage of their houses , plus new material .
But that was just the beginning .
Volunteers visit the slums to assist children and teenagers with schoolwork and help with the pre-schoolers .
They also serve as intermediaries with government institutions , network with job training institutes to open slots for slum dwellers , help families obtain loans for micro businesses , and guide them through the legal system so they learn their rights and how to defend them .
With the help of the program , Marquez studied food handling .
“ But more than anything , I went to learn to pronounce and speak well , " she said .
" I only got to fourth grade and did n’t have much character .
But now , thanks to the project , I get by pretty well .
I go to offices , talk to important people , and defend my rights as a woman and a mother . "
Her daughter Carleyn was 9 when the first volunteers arrived at the slum and began helping her with schoolwork .
“ If it was n’t for them , I would have been another pregnant teenager dropping out of school , " said Carleyn , now 21 .
" They were our superheroes .
They would sacrifice weekends with their friends and parents to help us study , and later to talk to us about birth control .
They encouraged us to study and value ourselves as individuals . "
Those volunteers are now lawyers , engineers and journalists — and continue to help her .
When Carleyn graduated from high school they offered to chip in for her university tuition .
" But I got a scholarship for my good grades , so it was n’t necessary , " she said .
Carleyn was recently appointed by A Roof for Chile as her community ’s education director .
The last stage of the process is the construction of permanent homes , with the help of a multi- disciplinary team of professionals that represents the community in obtaining lands , applying for government housing subsidies , and all the related bureaucracy .
The community decides where to move to and what kind of housing it wants .
“ The living conditions in the slums today are the same as in the past , with the difference that before , we were invisible .
We did n’t exist on maps and there were no public policies for us .
Life was more precarious because we were ignored , ” said Cecilia Castro , president of the National Corporation of Slum Leaders , “ We Are Chileans , Too . ” Castro , who started working at age 14 , lived in a Santiago slum for 20 years before moving into her permanent home in 2008 .
Now , Rosa Marquez is rushing to save up the $ 1,000 deposit required to obtain a subsidy by the end of September for her family to move into a solid home , with a front garden , a patio and real windows .
She has gathered half of it by organizing lotteries , bingos and other events in her community .
“ When I get my house , the first people I am going to invite over for dinner are our volunteers .
They are my angels ; they ’ve meant everything to me , ” she said .
A Roof for Chile ’s slogan now is “ 2010 Without Slums . ”
It has launched an intense fundraising and public outreach campaign to eliminate all slums in Chile by the country 's bicentennial celebrations in September 2010 .
And the effort has moved beyond Chile :
The model is now being replicated in 15 countries in Latin America under the name A Roof for My Country .
' Public Option ' or Co - Op ?
Experts Sound Off Experts say past nonprofit co-ops could not compete with private insurers .
Aug. 18 , 2009  -- Murmurs from the White House that the government - sponsored public insurance option could be negotiated or even dropped from President Obama 's health care reform plan in favor of nonprofit cooperatives has left the medical community abuzz and the public a bit confused .
The talk started Saturday after Obama indicated during a town hall meeting in Colorado that publically funded health insurance was not the centerpiece of his reform plan but " only a sliver " of the solution .
And on Sunday , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that co-ops are being considered as an alternative way to fulfill the president 's goal of creating more competition in the health insurance industry .
Many policy experts , however , do n't see co-ops as a simple substitute for the public option .
" Starting up new co-ops across the country that would effectively compete with the mammoth insurers , " said Timothy Jost , a health law expert and professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law , " is like expecting people to start up electric companies in their garages to compete with the dominant regional power company . "
" The public plan is not vital to covering the uninsured , " Jost added , but he said using government money to subsidize the uninsured coverage through private insurers " would be like the federal government abandoning the post office and rather paying subsidies for everyone to use Fed Ex .
Without any competition , anyone to keep them honest , insurance premiums will go through the roof , and with them the federal deficit . "
While politicians are digesting the apparent new turn in the health care debate , doctors and public health experts have gone to great lengths to define the difference between a public option and a co-op and what it means for patients .
What is a ' Public Option ' ?
The " public option " is a proposal to create a new government insurance program similar to other government insurance programs such as Medicare , Medicaid or the Veterans health care system .
But instead of offering the insurance to a select group -- such as the elderly in Medicare , or poor families as in Medicaid -- the idea would be to offer the government insurance program to a wide swath of the public .
Critics of the public option say it would lead to government rationing of health care , a government takeover of health care that would compete unfairly with the private insurance market .
Losing the Public Option : What It Means
Health professionals ' opinions about the massive health care reform proposal have varied widely across the country , especially on whether the bill would result in the government insurance plan negotiating lower pay for doctors .
" Without a public option , there will be no effective cost - control mechanism in the health care reform package , " said Dr. Daniel Blumenthal , associate dean for Community Health at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta .
" Recall that we already pay over twice as much per capita for health care as people in any other developed country .
Without cost control , health care reform will implode in a few years , " added Blumenthal .
Paul Duncan , professor in the department of Health Services Research , Management and Policy at the University of Florida in Gainesville , agreed that the public option was a way to drive down costs , especially health insurance costs .
" The abject , 50 - year failure of the private sector to contain costs and broaden the base of those covered has been so obvious , complete and certain for a half - century , that a ' reformed ' system without a public option is almost certain to continue that failure , " said Duncan .
But not all doctors agreed that Americans would lose out if the White House dropped the public insurance plan option .
" The public plan , I fear , has come to be viewed as a gimmick , one that would save money by paying lower prices to doctors and hospitals .
Doctors and hospitals do n't want that , and private insurers agree with them , " said Alan Sager , professor of Health Policy and Management at the Boston University School of Public Health .
" The public plan in the House bill is already too weak to have much effect on costs , since it is n't an option for most of the privately insured population , " said Joe White , the Luxenberg Family Professor of Public Policy at Case Western Reserve University .
Alternatively ,
White said an " all - payer rate - setting would provide savings for all the employer - sponsored insurance , so would have much greater immediate effects . "
Yet doctors and public health experts also saw the potential loss of a public health insurance plan as a gain for health insurers more than anything else .
" Nobody will benefit from dropping the public option except for health insurance companies , " said Blumenthal .
" The fact that the public option is now on the chopping block is not a reflection of public opinion -- it is a reflection of the power of health insurance lobbyists . "
Others say the public option for health insurance had so little potential to begin with that by dropping it , the nation would not really lose anything at all .
" Nothing will be lost .
The public option would have been a nightmare to design and administer , " said David Dranove , the Walter McNerney Distinguished Professor of Health Industry Management at Northwestern University .
Dranove , however , was n't a fan of the alternative co-ops either .
According to Dranove , state experiments with non-profit co-ops that would have been a testing ground for a federal option have failed to get off the ground .
" Every state has tried to run something akin to a nonprofit co-op , albeit usually with an emphasis on serving small business or high risk enrollees .
Total enrollments nationwide are about 200,000 , " said Dranove .
" Enough said about their success . "
What Is a Co - Op ?
Essentially , a nonprofit insurance co-op is a company owned by its members -- the same people who are insured by the company .
Whereas private insurers must answer to the investors who own stock in the company whether the investors get their health insurance from the private company or not , a nonprofit co-op answers its members .
Few details have emerged about the nonprofit co-ops discussed in the Senate Finance Committee , but it is generally assumed that the government would spend the money to get the co-ops started and then turn them over to the members .
But for many doctors waiting to hear the end result of reform discussions , the devil is in the details .
" It 's somewhat difficult to comment on the specifics of the ' co - op ' option until we see the details .
A critical issue will be whether the co-ops will be nationally based , state - based , or both , " said Dr. Tim Carey , at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill .
Carey explained that state - based co-ops would have " local responsiveness , " but would have a difficult time competing with large health insurers and would therefore be ineffective at driving down insurance costs .
" We do have a long history of co-ops in the U.S. , but their role has been somewhat limited .
Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound is the most frequently cited example , and has a track record of community responsiveness , high quality care , and solvency , " said Carey .
The Co - Op : A Healthy Alternative ?
While a few , small , non -profit co-ops have been successful , many doctors worried that the country lacked funds to build a nonprofit system enough to compete with private health insurers .
" A lot depends on the details of how the coops are set up ( federal , state or local level ) and the regulatory environment that is created by the health reform legislation , " said Pauline Vaillancourt Rosenau , a professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health in Houston .
" Obtaining start - up funds and building an infrastructure from scratch may be insurmountable obstacles , " she said .
Even if the government did find the funds to set up co-ops , other doctors worried that the nonprofit co-ops would want to become private insurance companies like successful co-ops before them .
" We once had private nonprofit insurance cooperatives .
They were called Blue Cross Blue Shield -- legally owned by their members and therefore coops really , " said Uwe Reinhardt , a professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University .
" Most of them have gone for profit on the ground that , to compete with commercial insurers , they must have access to the public equity market .
That 's the ostensible rationale , which I found unconvincing .
These entities are so cash rich that they hardly ever need to go to the equity market to sell equity in return for cash , " he said .
Reinhardt predicted that if Congress sets up co-op insurers , in a few years " their executives will clamor to convert them to regular commercial insurers , like Aetna and WellPoint . "
" One does not have to be a cynic to see that one coming , " he said .
In the meantime , America is waiting for Congress to return from the August recess .

Did you see Michael Sragow 's article " Twitter Effect rattles Hollywood " in the Baltimore Sun ?
Sragow 's thesis is neatly laid out in the first paragraph : " Although word of mouth could always make or break a movie , it usually took days to affect the box office .
But the rise of social networking tools such as Twitter might be narrowing that time frame to hours .
And that has Hollywood on edge . "
Now keep in mind that , as Sragow goes on to note , " Movietickets.com recently ran a home - page poll in which 88 % of the voting sample said Twitter had no effect on them . "
Of course , that means that a little more than 1 in 10 polled moviegoers are using Twitter as something of a movie recommendation -- or non-recommendation -- engine ; pretty remarkable when you consider how new and nichey Twitter still is .
And that should have Hollywood on edge .
Because what if real - time commenter culture -- Twittering and Facebook updating and etc. -- ends up almost instantaneously neutralizing the ability of a studio's multimillion - dollar marketing blitz to get moviegoers to keep going to see a crummy movie in the early days of release ?
Anyway , in keeping with this line of inquiry , this week 's Trendrr Chart of the Week takes a look at the Twitter buzz surrounding the five top - grossing movies of the summer .
A few observations :
Interestingly , the Twitter peaks correlate with where each movie stands in regard to gross .
That said , Harry Potterheads went way overboard in tweeting this summer ; they 're simply gratuitous in their tweetage !
If you look at the peak day of tweeting about " Transformers " ( 137,985 tweets on Friday , June 26 ) it pales in comparison to tweeting about the boy wizard ( 391,805 tweets on Monday , July 6 ) , but " Transformers " is right up there with " Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince " in total worldwide earnings .
Mark my words :
Some day soon somebody 's going to get a Ph.D. in the statistical parsing of Twitter data streams -- high - concept stuff far beyond the purview of the humble Trendrr Chart of the Week .
Because when you think about it , there are so many angles you can take in approaching the raw information contained in tweets .
I 'd like to see , for example , data modeling that dives deep into cloud maps of the words -- negative and positive -- most often juxtaposed with mentions of movies .
Then studios would really know exactly what they 're up against .

Wes Anderson and his pantheon of heroes ( Schulz , Welles , Truffaut )
The Wes Anderson Collection The Life Aquatic
This is the first in a five - part series of video essays analyzing the key influences on Wes Anderson ’s style .
Part 2 covers Martin Scorsese , Richard Lester , and Mike Nichols .
Part 3 covers Hal Ashby .
Part 4 covers J.D. Salinger .
Part 5 is an annotated version of the prologue to The Royal Tenenbaums .
With just five features in 13 years , Wes Anderson has established himself as the most influential American filmmaker of the post - Baby Boom generation .
Supremely confident in his knowledge of film history and technique , he 's a classic example of the sort of filmmaker that the Cahiers du cinéma critics labeled an auteur — an artist who imprints his personality and preoccupations on each work so strongly that , whatever the contributions of his collaborators , he deserves to be considered the primary author of the film .
This series examines some of Anderson 's many cinematic influences and his attempt to meld them into a striking , uniquely personal sensibility .
After the release of his second film , Rushmore , in 1998 , it became obvious that Anderson was , love him or hate him , an idiosyncratic filmmaker worth discussing .
In the decade - plus since then , dissecting Anderson 's influences , and Anderson 's influence on others , has become a bit of a parlor sport among cinephiles .
Sight and Sound and Film Comment have been particularly rich resources .
More recently , the Onion A.V. Club contributed a couple of playful , astute lists .
Anderson himself has gotten into the act by paying tribute to his heroes in interviews and magazine articles .
This series will take the process a step further , juxtaposing Anderson 's cultural influences against his films onscreen , the better to show how he integrates a staggeringly diverse array of source material into a recognizable , and widely imitated , whole .
It will examine some , but certainly not all , of Anderson 's evident inspirations .
Along the way , it may incidentally illuminate why Anderson - esque movies — from Garden State to Son of Rambow — can seem , no matter what their virtues or pleasures , a weak substitute for the real thing .
Anderson ’s scavenger - hunt aesthetic stands him in good company , alongside Quentin Tarantino , David Gordon Green , James Gray , and the other Anderson , P.T .
But what makes Wes Anderson distinctive is the sheer range of art that has fed his imagination — not just recent American and foreign films , but films from 30 , 50 , even 70 years ago , plus newspaper comics , illustrations , and fiction .
The spectrum of influence gives his work a diversity of tone that his imitators typically lack .
It is a style of substance .
Charles Schulz and Peanuts
When I interviewed Anderson for a 1998 Star - Ledger article about A Charlie Brown Christmas , directed by the late animator Bill Melendez , Anderson cited Melendez as one of three major influences on his work , so we ’ll start there .
Anderson told me that he and his screenwriting collaborator , Owen Wilson , conceived Rushmore hero Max Fischer as Charlie Brown plus Snoopy .
He said that Miss Cross , the teacher Max adores and will draw into a weirdly Freudian love triangle with the industrialist Mr. Blume , is a combination of Charlie Brown ’s teacher and his unattainable love object , the little red - haired girl .
Anderson and Wilson even made Max a working - class barber ’s son , just like Peanuts creator Charles Schulz , and gave Seymour Cassel , the actor playing Bert Fischer , glasses similar to Schulz’s .
But Schulz ’s impact manifests itself in deeper , more persistent ways — particularly in Anderson ’s characters who , regardless of age , seem , like Schulz ’s preternaturally eloquent kids , to be frozen in a dream space between childhood and maturity .
Think of how Rushmore ’s Blume pauses during a phone conversation to run across a basketball court and slap down a student ’s would - be layup ; the now - adult children in The Royal Tenenbaums navigating adult emotional minefields within the confines of a childhood home crammed with toys , grade - school art , and nostalgic knickknacks ; Steve Zissou in The Life Aquatic transforming a submarine into a gigantic clubhouse and rec center ; and the brothers of The Darjeeling Limited turning a supposed spiritual voyage through India into a more affluent , adult cousin of a summer camp stint .
Orson Welles
Anderson 's career has a Wellesian quality , and not just because they both started young .
Welles was as much an impresario as a director ; Anderson has inherited Welles 's mix of super - artist 's chutzpah and showman 's swagger .
He exercises Wellesian control over every aspect of his movies ( right down to the choice of a particular font for all signage , Futura ) .
And he tends to cast the same performers in film after film , a floating repertory strategy Welles perfected with his Mercury Theater Company .
( The roll call of actors at the start of The Royal Tenenbaums seems a straightforward lift of the roll call that ends Citizen Kane . )
From Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons through Othello , Mr. Arkadin , Touch of Evil , and Chimes at Midnight , Welles evinced a fascination with the decline of men once thought to be great .
Anderson is similarly intrigued .
Mr. Blume in Rushmore , the whole Tenenbaum clan , Steve Zissou in The Life Aquatic , and the splintered family of The Darjeeling Limited are all wrestling with real or perceived decline .
Anderson and Wilson ’s script for The Royal Tenenbaums contains many acknowledgments of Welles ’s second feature , Ambersons , an adaptation of Booth Tarkington ’s novel about a prominent small - town family in decline .
There ’s a similarly palatial , cone - topped family home , significant action blocked on and around imposing wooden staircases , and a sense of collective anxiety born of the feeling that time has passed a once - important family by and the community knows it .
Both movies feature novelistic third - person narration , by Welles in Ambersons and Alec Baldwin in Tenenbaums .
Both directors prefer to use wide - angle lenses that distort screen space and make it seem almost more figurative than literal .
Most of all , Anderson , like Welles , is a visually bold , wunderkind director who has an affinity — some might say a weakness — for virtuoso shots , shots so logistically impressive that they momentarily and perhaps purposefully take the spotlight off the movie and shine it on the director .
Think of the elevator - style crane shots that rise into the stratosphere of the opera house in Kane — a move that finds its horizontal equal in The Life Aquatic when the camera tracks Steve Zissou across the entire length of his boat , the Belafonte , dollying backward until the captain is a mere speck on the prow .
François Truffaut
Anderson draws much inspiration from French New Wave filmmakers , including Jean - Luc Godard , a clear influence on his cutting , and Louis Malle , whose Murmur of the Heart heavily influenced the tone of all his films .
But towering over the rest is François Truffaut , an impresario in the Welles tradition , but a warmer and more earthbound auteur .
There ’s a Peanuts connection here too .
Truffaut ’s autobiographical Antoine Doinel series maps the internal terrain where childhood and maturity meet , clash , and coexist .
Anderson pays tribute to Truffaut by quoting shots directly , but reversing their screen direction .
Think of the lateral tracking shot through the classroom in The 400 Blows mirrored in the first scene of Rushmore , and from that same Truffaut film , the shot of Antoine in a chain - link cage , an image repeated in the penultimate shot of Bottle Rocket .
There are , of course , other influences beyond those three , and we ’ll look at some of them in future installments of this series , starting with Part 2 , which focuses on Martin Scorsese , Richard Lester , and Mike Nichols .

The floating mart is very popular with the customers
In the sylvan backwaters of India 's southern state of Kerala , a floating supermarket is making waves .
Touted as the first of its kind in India , the Floating Triveni calls at various ports , stacked with some 2,000 items of groceries and provisions .
Among its cargo are rice , grains and cereals , and stationery and toiletries .
More than a million people are in the path of the floating mart which is a big hit with the customers .
Unique service
As the nearly flat boat buzzes along the extensive network of Kerala 's waterways , villagers jostle among themselves to be the first on board .
It can accommodate 20 customers plus eight crew members at any given time .
The vessel sets off every morning at 8 am and replenishments are done during the night halt .
The vessel is well stocked The unique service was launched on 7 June by Consumerfed ( Kerala State Consumer Cooperative Federation ) , which manages the government - backed retail cooperative societies .
It covers different islands of Kuttanad archipelago through its vast network of waterways .
Earlier , villagers on the islands used to make regular trips to the mainland on canoes to fetch supplies .
With the launch of Triveni , the villagers say they are saving up on that time and effort .
The most enthusiastic customers of the floating mart , however , are women who have become less dependent on the men folk for their purchases .
" A big boat laden with essentials , coming to my doorstep , is a novel idea , " says homemaker Yashodha .
" Instead of customers going to shop counters , the big counter is hauling in .
Moreover , the mart offers great discounts too , " she says .
' Thrilled '
On the vessel , manager AK Anoop logs onto the computer , checks the inventory and places orders with the Consumerfed head office for more stocks of detergents which are flying off the shelves .
" Women are simply thrilled .
It 's a novel experience for all of us .
The daily collection has been grossing at 30,000 rupees ( $ 625 ) .
Now there 's no looking back , " Mr Anoop says .
" If we had n't developed Triveni , we would have had to set up retail stores on every island in the Kuttanad archipelago , " explains Riji R Nair , managing director of Consumerfed .
Though small floating boats selling fruits and vegetables are a common sight in countries such as Vietnam , Thailand and Venezuela , Triveni , it owners say , could be the only floating supermarket of its kind in the world .
The owners of the market claim it is the first of its kind in the world Consumerfed has now approached the Guinness Book of World Records to validate the claim .
The idea of a floating barge first met with a lot of scepticism because many feared it would be commercially unviable .
" But we were ready to experiment , " Mr Nair says , and adds that it took three years to build the vessel .
Officials say the business will be expanded soon and the vessel will also deliver home appliances like washing machine or fridge to those who place an order in advance .
It will also have a computer room where children can play games .

Dear Sears ,
While shopping at the Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids Michigan , my husband was approached to receive an estimate on the siding for our home .
On Saturday February 10th , 2007 , my husband and I had one of your estimators come to our home to give us a quote for siding .
At the time we filled out all of the proper information and paperwork , and the salesman Kas Gaigalas , said he would get back with us later in the week .
He did get back with us later in the week , but at that point my husband and I had not been able to talk much , but we had communicated that we probably would n't go through with aloan for the siding on our home , even if we were approved .
Kas called back again Thursday of that week to let us know that we were approved .
I told him I would have to get with my husband about when we would be able to look at paperwork , as we have been taking care of an ill family member .
I did n't call back that day because of this , and because I was at work .
Friday evening , while I was on my way to the hospital , Kas showed up at my home unnanounced .
I was not happy about this , and he had paperwork and the approval on our loan .
I firmly and politely told him I would look it over and show it to my husband at a more convenient time .
He was at my home uninvited , and this did NOT please me .
He also admitted to having driven by my house several times , in hopes to catch Jason or I there earlier in the day !
I spend most of the weekend taking care of my husband 's grandmother , and was not interested , nor did I have the time to review the paperwork .
At this time , my husband and I decided to forgo this , as we needed to focus on family matters at the time .
I did n't think anything of calling to let anyone know , or anything , thinking I could take care of it later .
Tuesday evening February 20th , Kas again stopped at my home , uninvited to ask why we had n't sent out paperwork in , and was extremely pushy with my husband Jason .
To make matters worse , he practically refused to leave , even after Jason told him we were n't interested .
Several times .
I was very upset at this .
Not only was this the first night in nearly a week that I had time to spend with my family , but I do not like salesmen dropping by MY home , on MY time , without permission .
I immediately got on the phone with your customer service people , and let them know how I felt about it .
After being transferred for more than an hour to different departments , I finally spoke with a lovely young girl named Jenny who took my complaint and promised to pass it along to the proper division .
However , February 22 , 2007 , I received a phone call from a strange number .
Not answering , I let it go to voice mail , and did a trace on the line .
Come to find out , it was KAS .... again !
Why should he be calling me ?!
I made it very clear that I did n't want to be bothered when I spoke with your staff February 20th !
And then again , tonight , February 26th , 2007 , my husband was contacted by Kas asking when we were going to get our siding installed .
Furious , he hung up on him , and I again , got on the phone with your corporate office .
This is completely uncalled for !!!
Your staff assured me that they would handle this , and would call his manager and complain .
This is now to a point that is completely unacceptable !
Is this how customers are treated when they invite someone into their home for an " estimate ? "
I expected a sales presentation sure , but not harassment to the point of not wanting to even answer my door in fear that it might be the evil salesman pressuring me again .
I certainly do n't need this when I have other priorities to take care of and consider .
I am very disappointed with Sears Home Improvement salesmen .

In the future , all sorts of things will be possible .
One day we may even get jet packs and flying cars .
We may also be able to re-shape our bodies in all sorts of interesting ways .
It is not unexpected , therefore , to find sex changes featured in many science fiction stories .
But just how relevant are such stories to real transgender people ?
Do these stories portray transgender experiences accurately ?
Could they help non-transgender people understand the issues somewhat better ?
Or is there something else going on ?
Given the amount of science fiction that features sex changes , I 'm not going to be able to cover anywhere near everything .
I 'm also going to restrict myself to books , which is what I know about .
But hopefully I 'll cover a range of different approaches to transgender issues and give you a good idea of what is out there .
Bodies like clothes
Feminist Agendas
What about the boys ?
Beyond the Binary
In some science fiction changing biological sex is as routine as buying new clothes .
You will see characters say things like , " so I decided to spend my next 100 years as a woman . "
But do these books have any concept of gender identity ?
Mostly they do n't .
In fact some of them are very confused indeed .
One of the most famous is Steel Beach by John Varley .
In that book Varley conjectures that what is essential about humans is not their sexual preference or gender identity , but their sexual orientation .
So a lesbian who has a sex change will immediately start fancying men rather than women in order to stay homosexual .
It is as if people got a personality transplant along with their new bodies .
Feminist science fiction writers love covering gender issues , but many of the more famous works were written at a time when feminism was generally suspicious of transgender people .
The Female Man , by Joanna Russ , is a classic of feminist science fiction , and a wonderful book .
It features separate male and female societies and the men , deprived of women to oppress , make their own by surgically converting boys who fail a machoness test .
The whole set - up is very reminiscent of how Janice Raymond talks about transgender people in The Transsexual Empire .
Russ has since apologized for her early antipathy towards transgender people .
Angela Carter takes a rather different line in The Passion of New Eve .
An arrogant young man is surgically transformed into a woman and left to fend for herself in an America suffering social collapse .
Her experience of a real woman 's life is contrasted with idealized views of womanhood as embodied by the Garbo - like film star , Tristessa de St. Ange .
Real trans women , of course , tend to live lives more like Eve's than Tristessa's .
Trans men are much rarer in science fiction , as they are in other media .
One honorable exception is Mission Child by Maureen McHugh .
It tells the story of a young woman who struggles with her gender after disguising herself as a man to escape persecution .
Although Jan finds much of life as a man attractive , and is offered the chance of surgery , she is unsure how to proceed .
In particular she tells her doctor that she had no thought of being male before circumstances required her to disguise herself .
The questions that the doctor asks suggest that McHugh researched the issues well before writing the book , though it is unclear whether she accepts the transsexual viewpoint as valid .
There are many books that feature aliens who are sexless , hermaphrodite or even change sex naturally .

The Left Hand of Darkness is a well known classic that shows the difficulty humans can have in related to someone who changes from male to female in front of their eyes .
But for Le Guin 's aliens the change is perfectly natural and their gender identities must be very different from ours .
I do know of one book that deals with a genuinely intersex human .
Ilario , by Mary Gentle ( published in two volumes - The Lion 's Eye and The Stone Golem - in the USA ) is a fantasy novel featuring a lead character with both male and female sex organs , and a functional womb .
The book is excellent when looking at the social disadvantages faced by Ilario and the unpleasant attitudes of other people ( including Ilario 's mother ) .
However , the book also features something of a caricature of an MtF transsexual in the form of a eunuch who chooses to live as a woman .
Neferet is described as behaving with exaggerated femininity .
She also has a strong sexual relationship with a gay man , thereby advancing the theory that MtFs are " really " gay men who have " gone too far " .
Some recent progress
In River of Gods Ian McDonald describes a character who has undergone surgery to become a " nute " - a person without gender .
Tal has no traditional sexual organs , but is capable of orgasms thanks to especially sensitive parts of yt's skin .
The complex surgery required to become a nute , and the social ostracism that nutes face in society , are clearly based on issues that face transsexuals in the real world .
Finally we have a book that features real transgender people as heroes .
Supervillainz by Alicia E. Goranson tells the adventures of two transgender people ( one MtF , one FtM ) who accidentally become enemies of a group of capitalist super heroes .
Set against a background of the queer community in Boston , it is clearly written by someone who knows the full spectrum of transgender experiences very well .
As I said at the beginning , I have only scratched the surface here .
There are many other books worth discussing - not to mention comics , films and so on .
I suspect a few might appear in comments .
I 'd like to hear of some more positive representations .
Hopefully , as transgender people become more widely known , writers of all sorts will portray them more accurately .
We recently announced the availability of developer tools for Google Chrome .
We are now releasing ChromeDevTools , which enables JavaScript debugging using Eclipse .
You can set breakpoints , inspect variables and evaluate expressions all from within Eclipse .
The screenshot shows the debugger in action stopped at a breakpoint .
The project is fully open sourced on a BSD - license and consists of two components , an SDK and a debugger .
The SDK provides a Java API that enables communication with Google Chrome over TCP / IP .
The debugger is an Eclipse plugin that uses the SDK and enables you to debug JavaScript running in Google Chrome from the Eclipse IDE .
We hope this project will help web app developers and welcome feedback as well as contributions .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department says a man has died after a deputy shocked him three times with an electric stun gun at a subway station .
Sheriff 's spokesman Steve Whitmore says the man , who was not immediately identified , was at the North Hollywood Red Line station Wednesday night when a deputy repeatedly asked if he had a ticket .
The man did n't answer , so the deputy took hold of his hands to stop and question him .
Whitmore says the man broke free , raised clenched fists and charged the deputy several times .
He was Tasered , then shocked twice more when he got up and charged again .
Whitmore says a pipe used to smoke drugs fell to the ground during the scuffle .

Textbooks being written for Texas kids appear to lean to the right History 's first draft : Newt Gingrich but no liberals
Textbooks being written for Texas students appear to lean to the right
And the side that got left out is very unhappy .
As it stands , students would get “ one - sided , right wing ideology , ” said Rep .
Trey Martinez Fischer , D - San Antonio , chairman of the House Mexican American Caucus .
“ We ought to be focusing on historical significance and historical figures .
It 's important that whatever course they take , that it portray a complete view of our history and not a jaded view to suit one 's partisan agenda or one 's partisan philosophy , ” he said .
The State Board of Education has appointed “ review committees ” made up largely of active and retired school teachers to draft new social studies curriculum standards as well as six “ expert reviewers ” to help shape the final document .
The standards , which the board will decide next spring , will influence new history , civics and geography textbooks .
The first draft for proposed standards in United States History Studies Since Reconstruction says students should be expected “ to identify significant conservative advocacy organizations and individuals , such as Newt Gingrich , Phyllis Schlafly and the Moral Majority . ”
Gingrich helped lead House Republicans to their 1994 takeover of Congress and became House speaker .
Schlafly founded the conservative Eagle Forum and became a leading opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment aimed at formalizing women 's equality with men .
The Moral Majority formed in the late 1970s as an evangelical Christian organization that influenced politics and public policy for decades .
Will it pass muster ?
Whether students will also be exposed to liberal examples from the ebb and flow of American politics is hard to predict .
Conservatives form the largest bloc on the 15 - member State Board of Education , whose partisan makeup is 10 Republicans and five Democrats .
David Bradley , R- Beaumont , one of the conservative leaders , figures the current draft will pass a preliminary vote along party lines “ once the napalm and smoke clear the room . ”
But not all conservative board members share that view .
“ It is hard to believe that a majority of the writing team would approve of such wording , ” said Terri Leo , R - Spring .
“ It 's not even a representative selection of the conservative movement , and it is inappropriate . ”
Advocate for both sides
Another board conservative , Ken Mercer , R - San Antonio , thinks students should study both sides to “ see what the differences are and be able to define those differences . ”
He would add James Dobson 's Focus on the Family , conservative talk show host Sean Hannity and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to the list of conservatives .
Others have proposed adding talk show host Rush Limbaugh and the National Rifle Association .
“ I think , at the end of the day , we will want the young students to be able to identify what 's conservative , what 's their advocacy and who are the conservative groups , individuals and leaders .
And what is liberal in contrast , ” Mercer said .
Among liberals to include , Mercer would nominate the National Education Association , MoveOn.org , Planned Parenthood and the Texas Freedom Network — a group that says it promotes “ religious freedom and individual liberties to counter the radical right . ”
“ We do n't think it 's appropriate to be listing groups and people in the standards just because they 're conservatives or liberals , ” said Kathy Miller , the group 's president .
“ The state board should simply stop putting politics ahead of our kids ' education and putting teachers in the position of indoctrinating students with political agendas . ”
The debate will likely intensify in coming months .
Two reviewers have recommended that César Chávez , the late farm workers union leader , be removed from history books because they deem him an unworthy role model .
Board members appoint the review committees and typically choose people who share their philosophies .

In one of the more engaging , convincing and easily understood presentations I 've ever seen , Prof.
James Duane of the Regent University School of Law explains why even angels devoid of the slightest moral blemish should never speak to police officers , tax collectors or other law - enforcement agents investigating crimes .
Duane assumes no malice on the part of the police -- just human failings and motivations .
In a 27 - minute lecture , he details the legal pitfalls people can wander into even by telling the absolute truth .
Of course , " innocence " is relative .
At the very beginning of the video , Prof .
Duane addresses the -- literally -- unknowable extent to which federal laws and regulations have grown , so that even the government itself has no idea how many punishable offenses there are .
It 's very easy for people with clean consciences to admit to violating laws and regulations they never knew existed .
What about the other side of the debate ?
Responding in the same classroom to Prof.
Duane , Office George Bruch of the Virginia Beach Police Department says ... the professor is absolutely right .

Early Fire Use Ignites Discussion about the Evolution of Human Brainpower
Researcher talks about discovery of controlled fire use in Africa
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
Fire - treated silcrete blocks were used in experimental production of these tools .
The raw stone is placed beneath a layer of sand and then a fire is built over the top .
The temperature , which is gradually increased and then slowly cooled to avoid damaging the material , is monitored by the use of a thermocouple and data recorder .
Evidence at Pinnacle Point , Mossel Bay , South Africa indicates that early modern humans living there by at least 72,000 years ago employed fire to engineer tools from stone .

Curtis Marean and Kyle Brown , both paleoanthropologists with the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , say the discovery of fired and flaked stone tools in southern Africa helps the understanding of human behavioral evolution .
Here , Marean says the finding indicates that humans ' ability to solve complex problems may have occurred at the same time their modern genetic lineage appeared some 200,000 - 150,000 years ago , rather than developing later as has been widely speculated .

Evidence reported in the Aug. 14 issue of the journal Science shows that early humans living on the southern coast of Africa 72,000 years ago used a complex heat treatment process to manufacture blades and bifacial tools .
Unheated silcrete ( left ) can show dramatic changes in color and texture after heating and flaking ( right ) .
An international team , including three researchers from the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , note that silcrete is not found closer than 5 kilometers from their excavation at Pinnacle Point , Mossel Bay , South Africa , and that most pieces found are extensively flaked .

While it may seem hard to believe , reports have confirmed that a group of Christians in Iowa have recently been offended .
While initially dismissed as a hoax ( due to the almost unheard of notion of a religious group taking offense at something ) reporters at the scene found overwhelming evidence to suggest that a number of Christians – including some who wield considerable political power – had been offended .
The culprit responsible for this devastating event was identified as a bus which , in a deliberate attempt to cause fear and suffering amongst the citizens of Iowa , rudely dared to acknowledge the existence of atheists .
The banners , sponsored by Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers , went up on buses in the Des Moines area earlier this month but were quickly removed after the transit company was allegedly flooded with complaints .
Des Moines Area Regional Transit ( DART ) issued a statement to the DesMoinesRegister , explaining that the agency ’s board “ had not approved the signs ” and “ that they were put up by mistake . ”
Of course , taking even a brief glimpse at this atheistic advert explains why the otherwise calm and collected Christians felt compelled to break out of character and feel offended : they were clearly provoked .
Governor Chet Culver said of the matter : “ I was disturbed , personally , by the advertisement and I can understand why other Iowans were also disturbed by the message that it sent . ”
While offending Christians is not yet considered a federal offense in the state of Iowa , it is understandably taboo as the resulting onslaught of angry letter writing and overblown media attention can cause numerous health problems to the general public , most notably earache .
Buses in Greek Orthodox Mythology
While this particular bus was valiantly defeated , it is unlikely to be the last we hear of these dangerous double - decker tanks of godlessness .
For centuries , buses have been deployed by Satan in an act to undermine the Christian faith , with each model carrying its own brand of provocative insults and disturbing philosophies .
Early incarnations have included outrageously dogmatic slogans , such as “ There ’s probably no God ” – a chilling glimpse into a Godless world where people are encouraged to “ stop worrying and enjoy their lives . ”
We urge all readers of this article to remain indoors , plug their ears , close their eyes and pray for those who have not been blessed with the great perspective on life God has given you .

Over 200 people gathered on Sunday for a second kiss - in supporting gay couple cited and detained on LDS property last June .
Some protestors clashed with members of the anti-gay / pro-religion group America Forever , who were on hand pushing their pro-religion , anti-gay message .
From the Salt Lake Tribune :
After 20 minutes of shouting between members of America Forever and protesters at Sunday ’s event , several gay couples moved to the plaza for kissing and hand - holding , along with straight couples such as Peter Saunders , a Salt Lake City software designer , and his wife of 37 years , Gerda .
“ There ’s no need for controversy and hatred , especially in a beautiful environment like this , ” said Saunders , raising his right arm toward the temple .
LDS Church members in support of the protest , and troubled by their church ’s support last fall for California ’s Proposition 8 , also made a showing .
One handed out fliers promoting an online petition for reconciliation between the church and the gay and lesbian community .
Another , 25 - year - old Brigham Young University graduate Kate Savage , attended with her boyfriend , Tristan Call .
“ It ’s as if the doctrine of the importance of families we ’re taught is used to destroy other people ’s families , and we do n’t understand that , ” Savage said .
Counter - protesters led by America Forever ’s Sandra Rodrigues held their ground , even if unsuccessful in preventing protesters from entering church property .
“ This is a staged scenario , ” Rodrigues said .
“ These people just want to embarrass the church . ”
Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon meet in Washington on Thursday amid a diplomatic row between Canada and Mexico . ( ( Evan Vucci / Associated Press ) )
Mexico has retaliated against Canada for imposing visa restrictions , saying Canadian officials and diplomats will need visas to enter Mexico .
Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa made the announcement Thursday during trilateral talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon .
She said Mexico would not force Canadian tourists — who number 1.3 million a year and are vital to the Mexican economy — to get visas to visit .
" We stated with a great deal of respect , but also very firmly , that we were in disagreement with this measure , that it was our opinion that this is not something that is going to help to resolve the problem that Canada ’s trying to solve , " Espinosa said .
Ottawa announced earlier this week that travellers from Mexico and the Czech Republic will need visas to enter Canada because of skyrocketing rates of refugee claimants from the two countries .
Czech officials promptly recalled their ambassador and applied visa restrictions on Canadian diplomats .
They also urged the European Union to require visas from Canadians entering all 27 EU countries .
Cannon said the visa requirement on Mexicans entering Canada will remain in place until the two countries can work out a way to lower the number of unfounded refugee claims .
The numbers of " people seeking refugee status are unduly high .
We are in a position where we need to look at and find solutions , " Cannon said .
Kenney on the case
Cannon said senior officials from Mexico and Canada , including Immigration Minister Jason Kenney and his Mexican counterpart , will be working together to " find a way to eventually lift the visa requirement . "
" From now until such time as that occurs , we have to be able to straighten this out , " he said .
When asked whether the government was surprised by the outcry surrounding the decision , Cannon said Canada is " not looking for difficulties with our allies . "
" We reached an unacceptable level .
We had to intervene and act , " he said .
" Canada acted according to what it needs to do . "
He praised the " strong and productive " relationship Canada has with Mexico , saying " relations far supersede the elements of visa requirements . "
Espinosa also said she is hopeful an end to the diplomatic spat could be reached quickly .
1,300 visas issued
Hundreds of people have been lining up outside the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City to apply for visas since the requirement was announced .
Jose Herran - Lima , a minister - counsellor with the Canadian Embassy , said officials issued about 1,300 visas over the past two days .
About 4,000 people have inquired at the embassy , he said .
" The atmosphere is calm .
People are very orderly , " he said .
" We realize that … this is high season for Mexicans going to Canada .
" Our immigration officers … have done an outstanding job in trying to issue visas in what I call a first - serve basis so the people that are leaving sooner are getting attended first , " he said .
" That has been very successful . "
Mexico is the No. 1 source of refugee claims to Canada , with the number almost tripling to more than 9,400 since 2005 , the Immigration Department said in a release Monday .
The figure represents one - quarter of all claims made .
About 90 per cent of the claims are rejected .
The Czech Republic ranks second with nearly 3,000 refugee claims filed since the visa requirement for visitors from that country was lifted in October 2007 .
That compares with fewer than five claims in 2006 , the department said .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Sitting in his small room in northern Baghdad , a pistol nearby and assault rifles stacked under the bed , Khalil Ibrahim is worried over Iraq ’s future .

Six years after the U.S. invasion , Iraqis are contemplating the reality of life after a major milestone -- Tuesday ’s withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from urban centres .
Glancing at his seven - year - old son playing a war game on a computer in the corner , Ibrahim , a chain - smoking former military intelligence officer , said he has two main worries .
“ Iran has good relations with our political parties .
They run militias .
If the U.S. troops complete their withdrawal , Iran will do whatever it wants in Iraq , ” he said , scowling .
Shi’ite - ruled Iran is often accused of arming and funding Shi’ite militias who have killed Sunnis , a charge Tehran denies .
“ Also , if the Americans pull out , al Qaeda will return , ” Ibrahim said .
He knows the Islamist militants better than most .
As leader of a U.S. - backed Sunni Arab guard unit made up of many former insurgents , some of his men fought with the rebels against the U.S. military , before switching sides and helping drive al Qaeda fighters out of much of Iraq .
But as U.S. forces increasingly hand control to Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s Shi’ite Muslim - led government under a security pact that requires them to withdraw completely by 2012 , tensions are rising .
Violence has dropped sharply across Iraq , but militants still launch devastating bombings .
They are usually blamed on Sunni Arab insurgents like al Qaeda , and seem aimed at undermining Maliki ’s administration and tipping the nation back into the sectarian slaughter of 2006 / 07 .
WAVE OF BOMBINGS
The last few days have seen two of the worst attacks in more than a year .
A suicide truck bomb killed at least 73 worshippers leaving a Shi’ite mosque near northern Kirkuk city on June 20 .
Four days later another blast tore through a market in Baghdad ’s Sadr City , a Shi’ite slum , killing 72 people .
The government has warned that bloodshed is likely to intensify ahead of an even more important milestone for Iraq than this week ’s -- a parliamentary election due in January .
With the U.S. withdrawal from cities , many Iraqis from Shi’ite and Sunni sects say they feel exposed to what they say is corruption and incompetence afflicting Iraqi security forces .
“ We ’re afraid of what will happen in the next few days , ” 40 - year - old Shi’ite civil servant Salah Abd told Reuters by the wreckage of the Sadr City blast .
“ We could lose a lot of lives . ”
Others are more optimistic about the U.S. withdrawal , which will see almost all U.S. troops pull back to rural bases .
“ The Iraqi forces will improve , and then they will be better than Americans because they have our best interests at heart , ” said a 44 - year - old Shi’ite woman called Marwa .
She was taking advantage of the quiet weekend streets to shop for a digital camera in the upmarket Karrada district .
U.S. military officials say they have plans in place that will let them redeploy if Iraq asks for their help .
And their main bases in violent northern provinces have all been defined as “ rural ” to allow them to retain a presence .
AL QAEDA IN IRAQ
At his apartment in northern Baghdad ’s run-down Adhamiya neighbourhood , Ibrahim , who also goes by the name of Abu Omar , remained sceptical .
Al Qaeda frequently targets the Sunni guard units , known as Awakening Councils , or Majalis al - Sahwa in Arabic , since they switched sides .
His brother was killed on duty last July , then one son was killed by a Yemeni suicide bomber in August .
A second son was slain by a Shi’ite militia in 2005 .
Lighting another cigarette , he turned to a window overlooking a square beside a Sunni mosque where Saddam Hussein made his final public appearance in Baghdad in April 2003 .
His guards feared the future , Ibrahim said , partly because they no longer had contact with the U.S. military .
Many Sahwas fear Baghdad will turn on them for their insurgent past .
“ I still have good relations with the United States .
I could go and live there , ” he said , as a pair of yellow canaries chirped in a small cage and a rickety ceiling fan revolved overhead .
“ But I was born here , lived here , and I intend to die here .
If I go , others will go , and then who will stay ? ”

It ’s gonna give her an ego and make her think she ’s still got it goin ’ on when at this stage of the game , she ’s should sit back and watch her sex appeal fade and remember that the only dude who wants to see her pussy when she uncrosses her legs and is n’t wearing panties is her doctor lookin’ for pre-cancerous cells on her vagina or some weird dude who has n’t got access to the internet but does have a copy of the Basic Instinct DVD with zoom feature on his remote .

SADDAM HUSSEIN told an FBI interviewer before he was hanged that he allowed the world to believe he had weapons of mass destruction because he was worried about appearing weak to Iran , according to declassified accounts of the interviews just released .
The former Iraqi president also denounced Osama bin Laden as " a zealot " and said he had no dealings with al - Qaeda .
Saddam , in fact , said he felt so vulnerable to the " fanatic " leaders in Tehran that he would have been prepared to seek a " security agreement with the United States to protect it [ Iraq ] from threats in the region " .
Interrogations . . . the deposed Iraqi dictator in 2004 .
Credit :AP
The then US president George Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq six years ago on the grounds that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed a threat to international security .
At the time Bush administration officials strongly suggested Iraq had significant links to al - Qaeda , which was responsible for the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11 , 2001 .
Saddam , who during the interviews was often defiant and boastful , at one point wistfully acknowledged he should have permitted the United Nations to witness the destruction of Iraq 's weapons stockpile after the 1990 - 91 Gulf War .
The BBC has released the trailer for the next Doctor Who special , " The Waters Of Mars , " which showed at Comic Con yesterday .
On second viewing , there 's a lot more to this episode than just wet scabby death .
Spoilers below .
Could we finally be about to get Russell T. Davies ' theory of time travel ?
We 've always had hints that there 's a web of time , and certain events can't be changed or the whole universe comes apart .
And maybe now we 're about to get a bit more elaboration on that theme , which will make our nerdy little brains pulsate .
For my money , the third best episode of Doctor Who season four was " The Fires Of Pompeii , " and I 'm hoping for a bit of a thematic sequel :
Once again , the Doctor knows that history can't change , or it 's all over .
Of course , if his opposite number , the Master , turns up , he might just possibly have a slightly different agenda .

Rather than just being the throwaway adventure on our way to the final two - parter , it 's beginning to seem like " Waters Of Mars " may be a corker in its own right .
Here 's hoping .

The signing deadline for 2009 draft picks is quickly approaching .
For now , we know that C - Wil Myers and LHP - Chris Dwyer have “ officially ” been signed .
Their reported bonuses are the same that have been tossed about in the rumor mill for months ; $ 2 million and $ 1.45 million respectively .
They are the same terms that Jim Callis reported within the last week , and we can now conclude that Bud Selig has successfully screwed the Royals by impacting the timetable of two very talented prospects .
I have no doubt that the Royals agreed with both Myers and Dwyer on the terms of their deals long ago , but since they were significantly above Selig ’s recommended slot values the commish sat on the deals like he has done so frequently this season .
This practice is not just frustrating to Royals fans .
It is impacting all of the teams who drafted based on talent instead on the ability to sign a player for that pick ’s “ recommended ” slot value .
Based on the bonus amounts being announced these days , Selig ’s attempts to hold down the values of the deals seems to have yielded little in terms of results .
The $ 1.45 million bonus Dwyer will receive from the Royals was a record for a 4th rounder until the Athletics gave their 4th round selection C - Max Stassi $ 1.5 million to sign .
In all 6 players taken in the 4th round signed to above slot deals with only Padres ’ pick RHP - Keyvius Sampson unsigned from that round .
In the 5th round , 7 of the signed picks have been given bonuses above slot , while just 2 remain unsigned .
The story is the same in many of the rounds .
If Selig wants to get control over the bonuses being handed out to draft picks , he needs to get a legitimate slotting system included in the next CBA .
Until then he needs to let teams draft , sign , and get their picks on the field and advancing to the major leagues .
Selig ’s practice of sitting on above slot deals hurts small market teams like the Royals and Pirates , among others , who are willing to spend the money to draft and sign the top talent available to them .
Consider that Peter Gammons is now reporting that the San Diego Padres had a deal done with their 1st round pick , Donovan Tate , 5 days ago worth $ 6.7 million .
Afraid that such a deal would impact the demands of other players , the commissioner ’s office , in all its wisdom , has been holding up the announcement of such this .
So Donovan Tate ’s assignment to a Padres minor league affiliate has been pointlessly delayed , Padres fans have been forced to needlessly worry about the status of their top pick for 5 days , and San Diego ’s ownership and management have had to suffer the “ slings and arrows ” from those same worried fans .
What good is Selig doing ?
Players are still going to get their money and teams are still going to pay above slot for the talent and work the system if they can .
Whether Chris Dwyer received $ 1.45 million a month ago or today does n’t matter .
The bottom line is that Dwyer and the Royals agreed that his slot value was $ 1.45 million and not the $ 240,300 MLB recommended .
In the coming days , Dwyer can finally start his career as a professional , and as a member of the Royals organization , but the fact remains that he lost a month of the season .
It is a lost month that rests solely at the feet of Bud Selig .
Frankly the Royals should send him a bill for the month of development time they have lost with Dwyer .
Same goes for Wil Myers whose $ 2 million bonus is well in excess of Selig ’s $ 380,700 slot number .
The Royals made the decision to draft both players knowing they would have to go above slot to sign them , but did so because they were able to get premium talent with their 3rd and 4th round selections .
In the end Dwyer ’s deal is 6 times above slot while Myers ’ deal is 5.25 times above slot , which shows the team ’s willingness to sign the best talent available to them while sticking up their middle finger at Selig and his cronies .
Everyone knows the system is broken , but punishing the teams that are willing to work within the broken system does n’t fix the problem .
The pressure Selig has put on teams to stick to slot has only served to reduce the talent pool of those teams willing to follow his lead .
Fortunately for Royals fans , it appears that the days of this organization blindly following the lead of the almighty commish are in the past .
The deadline is just 10 minutes away and the Royals just lost 8 - 7 to the freaking White Sox .

Brussels , September 28th –
The first conciliation meeting on the Telecoms Package will take place tonight at 7:30 PM .
In this meeting , 27 Members of the European Parliament will decide on the future of Internet in Europe .
They will choose whether to fix or maintain the dreadful anti-Net neutrality dispositions voted in second reading by the Parliament , under the influence of AT&T .
Rapporteurs and representatives of the Swedish Presidency opposed this idea so far .
European citizens only have a few hours to urge MEPs to preserve Europe ’s innovation , competition , and citizen ’s fundamental rights .
The Conciliation Committee delegation of the European Parliament on the Telecoms Package will gather 27 Members of the European Parliament delegation , on Monday , September 28th , at 7:30 PM .
During this procedure , the whole European regulatory framework of the Internet will be negotiated .
In the first meeting , members of the committe will decide on the crucial perimeter of the negotiations .
From this decision will depend the fate of Net neutrality in Europe .
Updated on Mon Sept 28th , 11:15 CEST : the meeting is at 7:30 PM , not 9:30 PM , and is formation meeting for the European Parliament delegation of the conciliation committe , with the 27 MEPs .
So far , the rapporteur Catherine Trautmann and the minister in charge for the Swedish Presidency Åsa Torstensson expressed their will to deal only with the “ amendment 138 ” , which the Council wants to get rid of .
This would mean that the dreadful provisions allowing operators to kill Net neutrality in order to get control of the Internet .
These provisions allowing for limiting access to Internet services and applications , voted in second reading under influence by AT&T , would then become law in Europe .
“ Trautmann and Torstensson are trying to make everyone believe that Net neutrality should be dealt separately , after the Telecoms Package , but this is just a bad excuse .
They know that Net neutrality is already in the Telecoms Package , because AT&T amendments allows operators to kill it to take control of the Net .
They must admit it and do what is best for Europe ’s competitiveness and citizens ’s fundamental rights , at any cost .
Internet is much more important for the future of our societies than the efficiency of the EU legislative process . ” explains Jérémie Zimmermann , spokesperson for citizen advocacy group La Quadrature du Net .
Citizens from all Member States have a few hours left to call all the Members of the European Parliament delegation in the conciliation committee .
They can find arguments in the letter sent to them by La Quadrature along with the Open letter signed by more than 70 NGOs across 15 Member States ( including ISOC , CCC , Reporters without Borders , and major consumers unions ) , in a 2 - pager memo and in a complete 22 - pages dossier about Net neutrality .
“ Conciliation must leave room for a clear legislative statement affirming that the fundamental principles of a non-discriminatory Internet have higher status than the short - term convenience of specific interest business models .
It is very important that citizens who love the Internet act together now .
We need to use this unique opportunity to help European lawmakers avoid making an irremediable mistake .
“ concludes Zimmermann .

Summary : Internal E-mails reveal Microsoft snubbing software patents
PREVIOUS posts on the subject [ 1 , 2 ] showed that Microsoft would appeal to overrule the verdict which put a ban on Microsoft Word ( not effective immediately and only applicable in the United States ) .
As evidence shows , Microsoft not only resorted to arrogance but it also engaged in a form of civil disobedience .
Microsoft officials developing versions of Word that will be banned for sale in sixty days unless the company settles a patent lawsuit or wins an appeal were aware of the plaintiff ’s product and threatened to make it “ obsolete , ” e-mail records connected to the case reveal .
Also see the following posts about i4i and Microsoft :
So Microsoft does not exactly respect software patents when they are used against Microsoft .
Dana Blankenhorn asks , “ when will Microsoft admit the truth about software patents ? ”
Copyright is the best protection for software .
It lasts longer , you do n’t have to make a big filing on it , you do n’t have to open the kimono to win in court .
Just file a case to overturn State Street , or limit your lobbying to a call for an end to software patents .
Here is another new opinion :
So , apparently Microsoft is n’t allowed to use the docx format .
Another company has patent on using XML for documents .
So , when it does not suit Microsoft , then software patents should not be respected .
Similarly , Microsoft thinks the GPL does not apply to it [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] , but risk of lawsuits led it to complying , which makes the GPL victorious .
So Linux users can thank the GPL for not allowing Novell - Microsoft pact to turn into the MicroNovellix distro * now with 10 % more proprietary fork goodness * .
Microsoft may learn the value of pragmatism , but their compliance with the GPL license with regards to Linux is much like forcing oneself to go to the dentist to have a cavity filled , or the State of Alabama or Texas being compelled not to violate human rights by court order .
Necessity and desire are two totally different things .
The necessity of obeying a court order can’t force stupid hicks to cease being stupid hicks , the desire to wish your tooth did n’t ache wo n’t make it so , and the GPL ca n’t force Microsoft to stop being a proprietary software - foisting patent troll .
Take the code contribution for what it is .
Is it not funny that Microsoft eventually complied with the GPL while it still refuses to accept the rules of software patents ?
What does it say about Microsoft ?
And more importantly , what does it say about software patents ? █

Salo has had a colorful history with Australian censorship boards .
It was banned in Australia for 18 years before being re-submitted for a classification with the Office of Film and Literature ( OFLC ) in December 1992 .
It was then banned again by the full board of classifiers .
The distributor at the time , Premium Films , appealed the decision to the Classification Review Board in early 1993 .
This Review Board lifted the ban and granted it an uncut cinema release with an R rating .
It enjoyed a stint at arthouse cinemas in 1993 , and again in 1996 .
The conservative Queensland Attorney - General , who caught wind of this re-release , applied for a review of the film in 1997 with the OFLC .
They initially confirmed its R rating .
The Attorney - General , unhappy with this decision , applied to the Classification Review Board for a complete review of its classification .
This Board decided to ban it again .
A DVD version was submitted in 2010 and passed by the Classification board as an R18 + on the basis of " 176 minutes of additional material of behind - the - scenes footage which served to give the film context and reinforce its fictional nature " , and this R18 + was confirmed by the Classification Review Board .

One of , if not the oldest BitTorrent communities still around today has been targeted by police and anti-piracy officers .
The owner of FileSoup , one the most enduring sites since the introduction of the BitTorrent protocol , was arrested by police and denied his phone call and legal representation for more than seven hours .
After gaining a warrant eleven days earlier , on Monday 27th July at 09:05 police backed up by the MPAA - funded UK anti-piracy group FACT conducted a raid on the home address of the owner of one of the most enduring torrent sites on the Internet .
Founded way back in 2003 – a light year in BitTorrent terms – UK based FileSoup is one of the original torrent sites and has built a solid reputation while keeping a surprisingly low profile , particularly considering its status .
It has already outlived The Pirate Bay by around 9 months and is believed to be the oldest community still around today .
The search warrant for the owner of FileSoup was issued under Section 109 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 and authorized the gathering of any evidence related to the illegal distribution or file - sharing of copyright films .
Notably , since 2005 FileSoup has n’t operated a tracker but links to metadata which links to material hosted elsewhere .
It has never hosted any copyrighted content .
Known online as TheGeeker , the owner of FileSoup was arrested and taken to his local police station .
The charge : Suspicion of downloading copyrighted movies .
He told TorrentFreak that his site had been under FACT investigation since February this year .
“ I asked them [ police ] while still at home if I could contact a member of my family so that someone could come and make sure my dog was catered for , they said that I could n’t .
On the way to the police station I asked if they could contact someone to take care of the dog or if I could make a phone call , they again said I could not , ” he recalls .
But the police ’s lack of sympathy for Geeker ’s pet was just the start .
He says that before being put in a cell he was given a ‘ Notice Of Entitlements ’ sheet , a document explaining how a prisoner should be cared for .
One section explained :
Keeping in touch :
As well as talking to a solicitor and having a person told about your arrest you will usually be allowed to make one phone call .
Ask the police if you would like to make a phone call .
You can also ask for a pen and paper .
You may be able to have visitors but the custody officer can refuse to allow that .
But Geeker soon discovered that things were different in his case .
“ I asked again as I was put in the cell , if I could contact someone or make a phone call , I was told no I could n’t do that , I asked why and was told that the Inspector had put a block on any and all communication from me to anyone . ”
Each time an officer called on Geekers cell , he asked permission to let someone know of his arrest .
He also asked to contact his lawyer .
Seven and a half hours later and both were effectively still being denied .
Around 4:45 pm a policeman appeared in Geeker ’s cell with a 12 page list of items seized from his house , and demanded a signature that would indicate that the items were his .
Of course , it was impossible to say if the items they had in custody were indeed the ones on the list , so Geeker declined and the policeman stormed out of the cell .
“ What do they take me for , a complete idiot ! ” says Geeker .
“ No one in their right mind would have signed to say any of these items were their property , especially if they ’d not been there when it was seized ! ”
At 5 pm Geeker was finally allowed legal representation , where he questioned that surely “ downloading ” was a civil issue , not a criminal one .
However , the movie industry anti-piracy group FACT are known to frame things differently .
In previous cases they have insisted that donations are profit and therefore constitute a criminal copyright offense .
It is probable they have done the same thing at FileSoup and this could be why Geeker was arrested and not sued .
Geeker then had an interview with two police officers which was recorded on a machine which malfunctioned throughout the interview .
In common with other FACT - run cases , the nature of BitTorrent proved difficult for law enforcement to grasp , with Geeker having to explain how everything worked – including what URLs and domain names are .
Upon leaving , Geeker was informed that in common with other cases in the UK such as that against TV Links , the private anti-piracy group FACT was in charge of his seized property , not the police .
Geeker was eventually released on police bail a little after 19:30 with his offense listed as “ Distribute Article Infringing Copyright ” .
He must return to the police station in October .
Geeker says his home was a mess .
“ I got back home just before 8 pm to find my belongings had been turned upside down , the dining room was a like a whirlwind had gone through .. [ ].. they ’d turfed out all the drawers of the desk , chucked back what was of no interest to them , left a pile of paperwork scattered across my desk and table with wires everywhere , talk about a nightmare ! ”
And Geeker ’s dog was pretty upset too .
“ My dog was extremely traumatized , he ’d been barking almost non -stop all day long the neighbour told my Dad when he went over at about 6:30 pm to feed the dog as I had n’t got back yet .
My dog rarely barks at anything , now he barks at the least little thing , I am SO annoyed that they have done this to him ! ”
The FileSoup site remains open .
Stay tuned .
When Katy Perry ’s Girls Gone Semi-Wild For The Sake Of Riling Up Any Men Around song “ I Kissed A Girl ” first made inroads into the pop consciousness , singer / songwriter Jill Sobule — who ’d made a few alt - rock waves with an identically titled , yet 10 % as annoying track 13 years earlier — was semi-diplomatic .
“ Katy Perry ’s song is a kind of catchy party song , ” Sobule told Entertainment Weekly , “ although I will admit that I do smile when a critique mentions my version in a more favorable light .
Is that wrong ? ”
Well , a lot can happen over 14 - ish months , and such was the case with Sobule , who in an interview with the online mag The Rumpus dropped any sense of diplomacy and went straight to name - calling .
Also swearing !
The other thing people inevitably ask about is “ I Kissed a Girl . ”
For those that do n’t know or are very young , I had a song in 1995 called , “ I Kissed a Girl . ”
When Katy Perry ’s version came out I started getting tons of inquiries about what I thought .
Some folks ( and protective friends ) were angry , and wondered why she took my title and made it into this kind of ” girls gone wild ” thing .
Others , including my mother , were excited because they thought I would somehow make some money out of it .
Unfortunately you ca n’t copyright a title… bummer .
As a musician I have always refrained from criticizing another artist .
I was , “ well , good for her . ”
It did bug me a little bit , however , when she said she came up with the idea for the title in a dream .
In truth , she wrote it with a team of professional writers and was signed by the very same guy that signed me in 1995 .
I have not mentioned that in interviews as I do n’t want to sound bitter or petty … cause , that ’s not me .
Okay , maybe , if I really think about it , there were a few jealous and pissed off moments .
So here goes , for the first time in an interview : Fuck you Katy Perry , you fucking stupid , maybe “ not good for the gays , ” title thieving , have n’t heard much else , so not quite sure if you ’re talented , fucking little slut .
God that felt good .
OK then !
I ’m not really sure what throwing the whole “ slut ” thing in there does for the discourse , but I bet it felt good for Jill regardless .

The first thing you are asked to say when you are going in front of a selection meeting to be adopted as a parliamentary candidate is that you are going to live in the constituency .
Since you are also going to spend 60 per cent of your time in London , this means you are going to have to have two homes .
Most people cannot afford two homes .
I could never have afforded two homes .
We do not want to go back to the situation in the middle of the last century when the only people who could afford to be MPs were the very wealthy , on our side , and the trade - union sponsored on the other side , so it is right that the public pays for an MP to have a second home , and for the necessary upkeep .
And I say " necessary " because there is an enormous difference between having a widescreen television , and repairing the central heating .
I never had a television in my second home throughout my 17 years as an MP .
I never had a washing machine – I borrowed somebody else's .
I got the crockery from my brother 's old vicarage , but each room was painted once , and the exterior twice .

I have reservations about David Cameron 's idea of a scrutiny committee , because on balance I would have preferred to have waited for the report from Sir Christopher Kelly rather than have everybody rush in with their own solutions .
It 's not helpful , and it's not as if we are going to have to wait until the second coming for Kelly ; it is only until July .
I have called for a dissolution of Parliament , but there is a genuine worry that if people become disillusioned with all the main parties because of this , they will turn to the extremists .
But I must say having people from the journalist profession passing judgement on anyone 's expenses is a bit like having Satan heading a commission on sin .

But now Hillary does not have to tell stretchers .
She ’s fully qualified for her job and does n’t sound defensive .
Now Sarah has taken up Hillary ’s old habit of keeping grudges and playing the victim and blaming the press for her own mistakes in judgment and gaffes .

If Sarah ’s problem on the trail was that she knew too little , Hillary ’s was that she knew too much .
Before her misty turn in New Hampshire , Hillary ’s wonkiness got in the way of her ability to make people comfortable .
Sarah , lacking Hillary ’s cerebral side , has decided to wing it , Quayle - style , and go only for the visceral .
That ’s why she now sounds like a demagogue , embodying grievances and playing to people ’s worst impulses .
Hillary ’s radiant robustness , on the other hand , even with a sore elbow , makes the dictators in Iran and North Korea we ’re so worried about seem like frail , little creatures .
Obama advisers say privately that the president truly respects the woman he ran against , and that they have a good relationship , so good it has even surprised Hillary .
Certainly , she does n’t have to worry that this president ’s gaze is going to drift over her shoulder to some pretty thing behind her .
In this White House , Barack Obama is the pretty thing who is taken with Hillary ’s serious , smartest - girl - at - Wellesley aura .
In a funny way , he ’s the man of her dreams .
His support of her has allowed her to keep her paranoia in check  even with Richard Holbrooke and Joe Biden biting off parts of her portfolio .
Just to make sure it stays that way , Obama advisers told Hillary that she could not bring on board Sidney Blumenthal , her former aide de camp nicknamed G.K. , “ Grassy Knoll , ” for his tendency to stoke her grievances .
The Ashes , eh ?
Right , glad we got that out of the way .
You did n't come here for the front - page headlines and frankly we'd be in a bit of a pickle if you did .
Since reading in this morning 's Guardian that " senior mandarins " have launched an attack on Labour , the Mill still has n't been able to fathom when or why small oranges got so ornery .
Flipping over to the back pages ( well , the pages just inside the back pages , anyway , or sometimes to the pull - out section in the middle ) , however , we were back in our element .
Football 's own small orange has been getting all defensive over the weekend – telling reporters that he has " never been on a sunbed on his life " .
Perhaps he 'll feel more secure this morning after persuading Geovanni to sign a contract extension at Hull .
No one has ever accused Sir Alex Ferguson of frequenting a tanning salon to perfect his uniquely rosy skin tones , but his face may well darken a shade or two if Manchester United fail to bring in any more new faces before the end of the transfer window .
After being snubbed by Wesley Sneijder , Ferguson has had another look at Real Madrid 's reserve team and decided he will settle for Arjen Robben .
If it seems Ferguson has left his shopping a little late , then he 's still got nothing on David Moyes , whose refusal to accept a penny less than £ 22 m for Joleon Lescott means he now has one week to do all his summer spending .
Moyes has already lined up a £ 10 m deal for Lokomotiv Moscow 's Diniyar Bilyaletdinov , but looks dangerously likely to indulge in a spot of panic buying .
That 's probably the kindest way to view his apparent interest in Philippe Senderos , anyway .
Like Everton , Aston Villa have not had the best start to the new season , which may explain why they , like Everton , are sniffing around Steven Taylor .
Newcastle are said to want £ 6 m .
Elsewhere , Manchester City have been working on a dastardly plot to bring Sylvinho back from the dead , West Ham are close to tying up a loan deal for Eidur Gudjohnsen and Milan have designs on the Schalke wing - back Rafinha .

[ digg - reddit - me ] David Rothkopf – commenting on Goldman Sachs – sees their success as a repudiation of the free market – and I tend to agree with him :
I ’m a dyed - in - the - wool capitalist .
I love free markets .
I hope a free market marries one of my daughters some day .
But if some people have too many advantages and others simply can never catch up , the markets are n’t free , regardless of law or intent .
Even if the advantages are in part derived from talent and hard work , fairness can remain an issue if other components of the success are linked to access , influence , history and other intangibles .
[ my emphasis ]
From this insight comes the inevitable conclusion that – contrary to the doctrine of the right - wing – the government is not the antithesis of the free market , but rather plays an essential role in creating and maintaining it .
Goldman Sachs – with their obscene profits so soon after needing public assistance – demonstrate that our system has become less free and more feudal .
As I wrote several weeks ago :
[ T ]he free market is effective because it prevents any small set of individuals from monopolizing decision - making .
Especially in the world today with so much information available and events moving so quickly , the “ right ” business choices to make are n’t always clear .
A free market – by allowing each business to make its own choice – prevents decision - making from falling victim to individual follies .
But our current economic system – with it ’s enormous corporations – ends up recreating the feudal system in which power is not centered in a single place , but in a handful of powerful “ princes . ”
While these “ princes ” push for free market reforms , it is not in their interest to actually achieve this ideal free market – as Yglesias points out :
As a market approaches textbook conditions — perfect competition , perfect information , etc. —real profits trend toward zero .
You make your money by ensuring that textbook conditions do n’t apply ; that there are huge barriers to entry , massive problems with inattention , monopolistic corners to exploit , etc. George Will himself has pointed out that those “ reforms ” that are passed tend to be of a specific sort , following what Will calls , “ the supreme law of the land … the principle of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs . ”
What free market supporters rarely seem to admit is that the free market exists not in spite of the government , but because of it .
And today , our market is far from free because the government has failed to protect it – and has instead allowed the worst characteristics of capitalism ( exploitation of labor ; externalizing as much cost to society as possible , for eg. pollution ) with the worst characteristics of socialism ( concentration of power and limitation of competition ) to create a kind of modern feudal society .
In this feudal society , freedom is enjoyed by the “ princes ” of finance and industry while the creative ferment of a real free market is formally protected but effectively quashed .
David Rothkopf expresses the same thing with different terminology :
These guys [ at Goldman Sachs ] operate as ultra-citizens in our society , virtually able to tell the government to heel and fetch in ways the rest of us can only fantasize about .
Warren Buffett seems to agree – as he claimed that America is moving from an aspiring “ Ownership Society ” to a “ Sharecropper ’s Society ” – with its suggestions of a feudal structure .
Of course , Buffet now owns a significant portion of the very Goldman Sachs that epitomizes this trend .
Goldman Sachs – along with other major corporate powers – rise by exploiting inefficiencies in the market – and eventually must try to create inefficiencies in the market in order to maintain their profitability ( which is the hyperbolized point of Matt Taibbi ’s recent piece ) .
This contradicts those who see the market as supremely efficient – as Warren Buffet admitted , he would “ be a bum on the street with a tin cup if the markets were always efficient . ”
Goldman Sachs proves – with its successes – that our system is not a truly free market – but a more feudal one – in which those with sufficient money can secure power and tilt the system to their advantage .

The Vatican has started “ two sweeping investigations of American nuns , ” said Laurie Goodstein in The New York Times , and many sisters are bracing for a “ doctrinal inquisition . ”
The church usually only launches such “ apostolic visitations ” when a church community has “ gone seriously astray , ” but this seems more like a move to “ reel in American nuns ” who have moved from the convent and Catholic institutions to academia , social work , and activism .
A nun “ inquisition ” ?
said Rod Dreher in BeliefNet .
It ’s about time .
The Vatican has turned a blind eye to “ heterodox nuns ” for decades , letting them preach about moving to a “ Post - Christian ” spirituality and the like , without “ so much as a peep from Rome . ”
If that ’s what these nuns think Catholicism is , it ’s no wonder the only growing Catholic women ’s religious orders are those practicing “ fidelity and orthodoxy . ”
What growth ?
said Tim Carmody in Snarkmarket .
There are only about 60,000 nuns left in the U.S. , down from 180,000 in 1965 .
So now “ the Vatican wants to start an inquisition into what ’s left of the orders , ’ cause some o’ them ladies just maybe ai n’t been doin ’ what they ’re told ” ?
Thanks a lot , Pope Benedict .

The ship Kaisei which left San Francisco today
The second of two research ships bound for a huge " island " of plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean leaves San Francisco today .
Ocean currents have pushed the refuse together in an area estimated to be larger than the State of Texas .
The expedition , named Project Kaisei , will study the impact of the waste on marine life .
Ultimately the organisers hope to clear the plastic and recycle it for use as fuel and new products .
Speaking from the quayside in San Francisco , waiting for the second ship to leave , Ryan Yerkey , the project 's chief of operations , told BBC News : " Every piece of trash that is left on a beach or ends up in our rivers or estuaries and washes out to the sea is an addition to the problem , so we need people to be the solution . "
" Twenty years from now we can't be harvesting the ocean for trash .
We need to get it out but we need to also have people make those changes in their lives to stop the problem from growing and hopefully reverse the course . "
Five - day journey
The two ships , Kaisei - which left today - and New Horizon from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography - which left on 2 August - will take five days to reach the debris .
They will return at the end of the month .
The vortex of currents which pushes the debris together is known as the North Pacific Gyre .
Ryan Yerkey has sailed across the Pacific twice and has watched the problem build up since the 1980s .
He blames our increased use of disposable products .
He said : " You are talking about quite a bit of marine debris but it 's not a solid mass .
A lot of the items have broken down .
Of course there are larger items out there .
But the items , depending on the density and the state they 're in , can be anything from the surface down to 20ft to 30 ft ( 6 m to 9 m ) deep . "

Religion and Politics : The Ambivalent Majority
Americans embrace a role for religion in the nation ’s political life , but they are conflicted over the extent and contours of that involvement .
Compared to a generation ago , more people are comfortable with churches expressing opinions on social and political matters , yet a solid majority of voters say they are uneasy with members of the clergy espousing their political views from the pulpit .
While seven - in - ten voters believe it is important for the president to have religious faith , there is widespread discomfort over politicians who speak publicly about how religious they are .
Churches , synagogues and other religious institutions are overwhelmingly seen as positive forces in addressing society ’s problems .
Yet the public ’s ambivalence over religion and politics is also reflected in divisions over “ charitable choice ” — an initiative , approved as part of the 1996 welfare reform bill , which permits faith - based organizations to participate in government - funded social service programs .
A narrow majority ( 54 % ) supports funding religious organizations so they can run such government programs as job training or drug treatment services .
There is considerably more backing ( 67 % ) when the issue is recast as allowing such groups to apply for government funding , along with other organizations , for these purposes .
At a time when Joe Lieberman ’s appointment as the first Jew on a major party ’s presidential ticket has cast a spotlight on religion and politics , the latest Pew Research Center survey shows that 77 % have favorable attitudes toward Jews .
That rating has slipped somewhat from 84 % in 1997 , but the current favorability mark for Jews is virtually the same as for Catholics ( 78 % ) .
There actually has been no increase in the number of voters who hold unfavorable impressions of Jews ; rather , slightly more voters say they are unable to give an opinion of Jews compared with three years ago .
The image of evangelical Christians has improved markedly in recent years — as the political visibility , if not the influence , of Christian conservatives has waned .
Overall , some 63 % of voters rate evangelical Christians favorably , compared with just 41 % in 1996 .
Some of the biggest gains have come among Democrats and senior citizens , which are groups that tend to express the most concern about overt expressions of religious beliefs in politics .
Six - in - ten Democrats now have favorable impressions of evangelicals , compared with 27 % four years ago .
More Americans regard the Republican Party as the protector of religious values compared with the Democrats ( 39 % to 30 % , respectively ) .
But the GOP ’s advantage on this issue has declined over the past four years ; in 1996 , 47 % saw the Republicans as protectors of religious values while just 32 % named the Democrats .
In a more positive trend for the GOP , fewer voters now see the party as too closely tied to religious leaders ( 13 % vs. 20 % in 1996 ) .
This survey of nearly 2,000 registered voters , conducted Aug. 24 - Sept. 10 , is a collaborative project of The Pew Research Center and The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
The Forum is a new organization dedicated to research , discussion and debate on the role of religion in civic engagement , politics and public policy .
The Observant Majority
A solid majority of voters ( 61 % ) say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month — and 45 % go at least once a week .
This is little changed from recent years : in 1997 , 59 % of the electorate said they frequently attended services ( at least once a month ) , and virtually the same percentage ( 60 % ) reported frequent attendance in 1996 .
And nearly six - in - ten ( 59 % ) of those who attend services on a regular or even infrequent basis ( at least a few times a year ) say they are involved in church activities .
With the high level of religious participation , it is probably not surprising that most Americans see churches , synagogues and other religious organizations as contributing meaningfully to society .
Fully 72 % say these organizations help solve important social problems ( 28 % say a great deal , while 44 % say some ) .
Just one - in - four believe religious groups do little or nothing to alleviate the nation ’s problems .
Republicans are somewhat more likely to see religious groups playing a positive role .
Fully one - third of rank - and - file Republicans ( 34 % ) say churches , synagogues and other religious organizations contribute a great deal , compared with just 24 % of Democrats and independents .
Democrats Favor Charitable Choice
A majority of voters also support funding religious organizations so they can provide social services , although 44 % are opposed .
Given that George W. Bush has made charitable choice a centerpiece of his presidential campaign ( although it has also been endorsed by Al Gore ) , the partisan divisions on this question — and the related issue of merely permitting religious groups to apply for government funding — are somewhat surprising .
Fully 61 % of Democrats favor funding religious institutions for these purposes , compared with 46 % of Republicans and 52 % of independents .
Support for charitable choice among Democrats is partially driven by strong backing among African - Americans : 74 % of blacks endorse direct funding for these programs ( compared with 51 % of whites ) , while 87 % of blacks favor permitting the churches and other faith - based institutions to apply for government grants ( compared with 64 % of whites ) .
The Center ’s voter typology highlights these unusual political and ideological disparities .
For instance , among Democrat - oriented groups , 74 % of the Partisan Poor — which has a large percentage of minorities and low - income voters — favor the direct funding proposal , compared with 61 % of New Democrats , 56 % of Social Conservatives and just 42 % of Liberals .
Among GOP - oriented groups , majorities of Moderate Republicans and Populist Republicans ( 55 % and 54 % , respectively ) support funding religious institutions so they can provide social services , compared with 41 % of Staunch Conservatives .
While more women than men are more supportive of both charitable choice alternatives , there also is strong backing for these proposals among those under age 30 , who tend to support secular positions on many questions .
Nearly seven - in - ten of those under age 30 ( 68 % ) favor direct government funding for faith - based groups ; just 46 % of those over age 50 agree .
College graduates are among the most likely to oppose charitable choice when the question is posed as direct government help to religious institutions ( just 44 % support this alternative ) .
But when the issue is presented as a question of religious institutions applying for government grants , along with other organizations , support rises to 63 % .
Interestingly , there are not large differences between those who attend religious services often and those who seldom attend on the question of providing direct government funding for church - based institutions .
While 59 % of those who attend services more than once a week support that proposal , 52 % of those who seldom attend ( less than a few times a year ) agree .
Politicians and Religion
Most voters ( 70 % ) want the president to be a person of faith .
But half of the electorate expresses unease with politicians , presidential contenders and others , who talk too much about their religious beliefs .
Overall , women are somewhat more likely than men to want a president with strong religious beliefs ( 74 % vs. 65 % ) .
At the same time , women are slightly less likely than men to feel uncomfortable when politicians talk about their faith ( 46 % vs. 54 % ) .
By contrast , young people and particularly young men , are less concerned about the religious beliefs of the president .
Less than half of men under age 30 ( 47 % ) say it is important that he or she have religious beliefs .
While the Republican - oriented typology groups are fairly unified in saying it is important for the president to have strong religious beliefs , there are divisions among Democrats .
Fully 84 % of the Partisan Poor identify this as an important characteristic for the president , and 82 % of Social Conservatives agree .
That number falls to 67 % among New Democrats and just 34 % among Liberals .
Clearly , the distinction between being religious and talking about religion is more important to some groups than others .
For instance , nearly eight - in - ten senior citizens ( 78 % ) say it ’s crucial for the president to have strong religious beliefs , but more than half ( 56 % ) also say they are uneasy over excessive public expressions of faith by politicians .
Similarly , by a lopsided margin of 79 % - 18 % , African - Americans say it is important for the president to be religious ; by a narrower margin ( 48 % - 43 % ) blacks also express discomfort over politicians who talk publicly about their faith .
Drawing the Line at the Pulpit
Just as Americans are split over questions relating to religion ’s influence on politics , so too they are divided over whether churches and other religious institutions are appropriate forums for political discussions .
Support for religious institutions and clergy expressing their views on politics is higher now than in the mid-1960s — although a substantial number of voters still have reservations .
A slim majority of voters ( 51 % ) say it is appropriate for churches and other religious organizations to make their views known on political and social topics , while 45 % believe these institutions should stay out of politics .
In 1968 , a majority of the public ( 53 % ) said churches should remain on the sidelines in political debates , while just 40 % supported a political role for religious groups , according to a Gallup poll from that year .
But a solid majority ( 64 % ) believes it is wrong for members of the clergy to discuss political matters from the pulpit , while just one - in - three voters ( 32 % ) find that acceptable .
There has been some movement on this question as well , in support of greater political involvement by the clergy .
A 1965 Gallup survey found that 68 % opposed religious leaders expressing their political views , while just 22 % favored such expressions .
African - Americans , white evangelical Protestants and voters under the age of 50 are among the most likely to favor including political discussions as part of church activities .
Fully 61 % of blacks support this , compared with just half of whites .
Nearly six - in - ten of all voters under 50 ( 58 % ) agree that such political discussions are appropriate .
But a strong majority of those 65 and over ( 57 % ) believe that churches and other religious organizations should steer clear of political discussions ; just 36 % of senior citizens are comfortable with such discussions .
And while 63 % of white evangelicals say churches should express their political views , 50 % of white Catholics and 41 % of white mainline Protestants agree .
Partisan differences over this issue are relatively small : 53 % of Republicans , 48 % of Democrats and 52 % of independents say it is acceptable for churches to weigh in on political and social issues .
Many of those who are otherwise comfortable with churches and other religious institutions expressing political opinions draw the line at having members of the clergy discussing politics from the pulpit .
Majorities in every major demographic group — including African - Americans and white evangelicals — find this unacceptable .
But again , senior citizens are among the most reluctant to cross the lines between religion and politics : fully 73 % of senior citizens reject this idea while just 23 % favor clergymen airing their political views from the pulpit .
More Support for Evangelicals
While nearly eight - in - ten voters have positive impressions of Catholics and Jews , and six - in - ten feel the same about evangelicals , just half of voters see Muslim - Americans in a favorable light .
Nonetheless , voters have a far more favorable impression of every religion tested than they do of atheists .
Just 32 % hold a favorable opinion of atheists .
While , on balance , those in every major demographic group hold a negative view of atheists , they are viewed favorably by Liberal Democrats , a group that is the least religious of all typology groups .
Fully 65 % of Liberals have a positive impression of atheists , far more than other groups in Pew ’s voter typology .
Evangelical Christians are now viewed much more favorably by many groups than they were four years ago .
While the percentage of Democrats holding positive impressions of evangelicals has more than doubled ( from 27 % to 60 % ) , more Republicans and independents also have favorable opinions of evangelicals .
In addition , support for evangelicals has increased across every age group .
Democrats Close the Gap
The Republican Party is less identified with protecting religious values than it was four years ago , and this has narrowed the gap between the two parties on this issue ( from 15 points to nine points ) .
Today , 39 % of voters say the GOP is most concerned with protecting religious values , compared with 30 % who name the Democrats .
Much of the shift on this question has come among independents .
In 1996 , 45 % of independents saw the GOP as most concerned with protecting religious values , while 26 % cited the Democrats .
Now , independents are more closely divided , with 33 % citing the Republicans and 28 % pointing to the Democrats .
The two parties attract similar levels of support when it comes to protecting religious freedom .
Some 35 % of voters name the Democrats as most concerned with protecting religious liberty , while 32 % name the GOP .
By large margins , Democratic and Republican partisans see their party as most concerned with religious freedom , while independents are split ( 30 % cite Republicans and 29 % choose Democrats ) .
Most Americans do not see either party as too closely linked with religious leaders .
Still , while only 13 % see the Republican Party in that way ( down from 20 % four years ago ) , sizable minorities in key demographic groups believe the GOP is too closely linked with religious leaders .
For instance , one - in five college graduates ( 21 % ) identify the Republicans in this way , compared with just 5 % who cite the Democrats .
In addition , upper - income voters are more likely to say that the GOP is tied too closely with religious leaders .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The defense secretary will not ban smoking by troops in war zones despite a recommendation to do so by a Pentagon - commissioned study .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he does not want to compound stress in combat zones by banning smoking .
Secretary Robert Gates ' decision stems from concern about the stress troops face , said his spokesman .
" We are fighting two wars right now , using a force that we are demanding more of than we ever have before .
They are under enormous stress and strain , and the secretary does not want to compound that stress by taking away from them one of the few outlets they have to relieve that stress , " Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Wednesday .
A new study commissioned by the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs recommends a complete ban on tobacco , which would end tobacco sales on military bases and prohibit smoking by anyone in uniform -- including combat troops in the thick of battle .
According to the study , tobacco use impairs military readiness in the short term .
Over the long term , it can cause serious health problems , including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease .
The study also says smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral and pancreatic cancer .
Morrell said that Gates has not seen the report and will consider the recommendations to move towards a goal of a smoke - free military .
" There may be things we can do to try to move towards that goal .
But he has been very clear to me , up front , that one of the things he is not prepared to do is to restrict the use of tobacco products in combat zones , " Morrell said .
Anti-smoking activist Richard Daynard said Gates ' decision was logical .
But he predicted that , as smoking is banned on military bases outside combat zones , " then the problem over time will resolve itself , even in combat zones . "
The founder of the Tobacco Products Liability Project likened the situation to that which prevailed during the 1980s , when smoking aboard U.S. commercial airlines was banned .
" There was an exception for the cockpit , at least on some airlines , on the theory that you probably do n't want your pilot , if he 's hooked on nicotine , to be cold - turkey while he 's trying to navigate your plane . "
But , he said , the exception has been phased out .
CNN 's Adam Levine and Tom Watkins contributed to this story .

Patrick Swayze proves he 's beating the odds in his cancer battle ... but he 's STILL smoking
When Patrick Swayze 's cancer first became public knowledge , it was thought he only had months to live .
But the Dirty Dancing star has battled on , even visiting a shop to buy smoking paraphernalia with his brother Donny .
Despite the unhealthy cigarette he was smoking the 56 - year - old , who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer early last year , looked healthier than he has in months .
Defying the odds : Patrick leaves a Los Angeles smoking shop looking better than he has in months
He even appeared to have gained a little weight and had grown some of his hair back , including a new goatee .
Tubes thought to be catheters for his chemotherapy could be seen hanging in front of his shirt , but Swayze was smiling as he picked up a glass pipe from the Los Angeles store .
The pictures were a great contrast to photos taken in April , when he looked frail and thin .
Much improved : A skeletal Swayze in April , left , and smoking in his car last week
Early on in his cancer fight , many fans feared the actor would not last this long .
But it is thought he had an advanced form of radiotherapy which is offering new hope to sufferers .
The CyberKnife technique shoots hundreds of beams of radiation at hard - to - reach tumours .
It moves with the patient 's breathing , meaning it can target tumours deemed inoperable due to their proximity to major blood vessels .
The latest images of Swayze appear to show a distinct improvement in the actor 's condition .
In May the former Ghost star appeared frail and painfully thin during another outing and fears grew that he might not have long to live .
On the evidence of these images however it appears Swayze is not going down without a fight .
NASA will pay you $ 160 per day to lie in bed — and they 've got plenty of takers .
Lying on your stomach at a slight downward angle for months on end used to stand in for the effects of nearly no gravity .
Now , the scientists at NASA 's Human Test Subject Facility in Galveston , Texas , are trying a new type of bed rest to simulate the moon 's gravitational field .
They put you , face up , on a bed tilted up at exactly 9.5 degrees with your feet planted on a panel .
Do the trigonometry , and the experiment places just about the same amount of gravity on your feet as the moon would .
" Obviously , there 's no magic switch to turn off gravity , " said Ronita Cromwell , senior research scientist heading up the project .
" What we 're doing is removing some of the effects of 1 G and achieving one - sixth G along the long axis of the body . "
While previous bed - rest studies have required a commitment to lying in bed for 90 days , the feasibility studies for the lunar analog study only require six days in bed .
If the test subjects can handle it , which they appear to be doing , it will be extended to much longer periods of time .
It 's a novel analog , though , so the team is taking it slow
" Not many people have done it before , and no one has done it in the way that we 're doing it , " Cromwell said .
The effects of lying in bed for months on end are n't pretty .
Our bodies are used to being used .
Astronauts and " pillownauts " as some study participants call themselves , experience muscle atrophy and even some mild bone - density loss .
They also can experience headaches , nausea and a host of other unpleasant symptoms .
It can take astronauts weeks or months to readjust to the Earth ’s gravitational force .
In fact , that 's exactly why NASA runs these bed - rest studies .
They help them to understand the physiological changes that the body undergoes when it 's not being used like a normal human body .
They can try out ways to mitigate the problems that arise .
Cromwell answered most of our functional questions — conjugal visits , food , bone loss — about the bed - rest studies last year , but we 've always wondered what it * feels like * on the NASA bed - rest ward .
Do people have fun ?
Is it boring ?
We spoke with Heather Archuletta , IT specialist , sometime pillownaut , and ardent blogger about her experiences .
Archuletta just completed the lunar bed - rest feasibility study after being chased out of Galveston by Hurricane Ike last year after 50 days of the down - tilted bed - rest study .
Her photos and blog provide a fascinating peak into a community of people united by their duty to stay in bed , tilted in one direction or another .
They do crafts , keep fish , watch movies , read books , sing each other Happy Birthday and , in some cases , form a cohesive community .
It sounds like camp , but just , you know , always lying down and using a bed pan .
" We had this joke that we were all dating , " said Archuletta .
" By the end when we got to know each other , we were doing dinner and a movie . "
That is to say , the nurses would wheel the residents ' prone bodies into the common social area and array them in rows in front of a television for some camaraderie .
Archuletta organized a library of books and DVDs .
And the activities ' coordinator would make sure that they could order new movies from the communal NetFlix account .
While looking for a new job , Archuletta found the bed - rest studies through your favorite science blog , Wired Science .
" If I had n't done it , I would have just gotten another IT job , probably , " Archuletta said .
But she 's a space lover and wanted to contribute to humanity 's return to the moon and Mars .
And maybe do a little something different .
" Something unique , something not in an office environment , " she said .
" It was a chance to confront stillness in a way . "
As it was , Archuletta , who usually works out avidly , subjected her body to intense discomfort , particularly in the first week .
" When they first put me head down that first day — part of it is mental — I had a little bit of a moment right before they put the head at minus six degrees .
I thought , ' Oh my god , my feet are n't going to touch the floor for 90 days , ' " she said .
" But I had committed to it .
Once I was head down , what 's immediate is the blood rush .
All the blood rushes up to your face and you get a little headachey , nauseous . "
After a week , she 'd adjusted and did n't experience much pain .
The nasty surprise came at the end of 50 days of the study , when Ike forced the premature end of her experiment and a readjustment process that had to occur in hours instead of the normal days .
" We all of a sudden got this evacuation order that we had to outrun a storm .
Here 's a storm literally the size of Texas .
We got up in three hours , " she said .
" They monitored our blood pressure and I never lost consciousness , but I did fall twice .
The pain in my feet was so bad .
You do n't realize what your feet feel like after two months off of them . "
After that , you 'd think she would n't have gone back .
But she did , easily completing the much shorter lunar - analog study in May .
" It was absolutely , totally worth it , " she said .

Almost four years since uTorrent had its debut , the development team has now released a version 2.0 Beta of their BitTorrent client with significant improvements and updates .
BitTorrent tracker owners in particular have been looking forward to this release as it finally implements support for UDP trackers , turning it into a ' good citizen ' .
u Torrent for Windows saw its first public release in September 2005 , and soon became the most widely used BitTorrent application by far .
Recent estimates show that uTorrent is the client of choice for more than half of all active BitTorrent users .
Needless to say , all significant changes to uTorrent affect millions of users and the entire BitTorrent infrastructure .
With the release of its 2.0 Beta the client introduces breakthrough changes that offer a helping hand to its users , ISPs and most of all – tracker owners .
In comparison to HTTP trackers , UDP trackers use less resources and put less strain on their servers .
Since almost all public trackers now have a UDP variant , it can save tracker owners a lot of hardware and thus money .
Using UDP is generally a good idea to bring down load on popular trackers , ” said uTorrent developer Arvid Norberg when commenting on the implementation of the newly added feature .
“ We want uTorrent to be a good citizen and not hammer trackers . ”
“ Hopefully client support will be wide spread enough at some point , so that trackers that currently spend 99 % of their capacity on misbehaving clients flooding it with HTTP requests can turn that off , ” Norberg added .
Although Norberg ’s comments suggest that uTorrent is one of the first to implement UDP tracker support , they are in fact quite late to the party .
Vuze , BitComet , Deluge , KTorrent and rTorrent are just a few of the clients that have implemented this feature already .
However , with its massive market share uTorrent is the one that really makes a difference , and this new feature will be welcomed by all major BitTorrent tracker operators .
The benefits of UDP trackers will not go unnoticed by users either since they do not interfere with HTTP traffic , meaning that associated web - browsing slowdowns will be a thing of the past .
Aside from smoother web - browsing , users will notice a few other changes in uTorrent 2.0 .
For starters the new speed guide is a welcome addition .
By using Google ’s measurement lab servers , uTorrent users can now test their connection speed and let the client automatically pick the best settings based on the results .
Unfortunately Google ’s lab servers are all located in the US , which makes the results less accurate for uTorrent users in other parts of the world .
The uTorrent team hopes that they can provide optimal results for these users at a later stage .
“ We anticipate that the server coverage will improve and cover other continents better in the future , ” Norberg commented .
With the 2.0 Beta , uTorrent also enjoys several improvements to its uTP support , which makes the client more network aware hoping to decrease the load for ISPs as well .
uTP support can be enabled or disabled at the user ’s request .
The new Beta has something in store for everyone , and although users are free to play around with it , we should note that this is not a stable release and that bugs and unexpected crashes are possible .
The latest release as well as a feedback thread can be found at the uTorrent forums .
Criminals running an ATM card - skimming scam made a big mistake this week :
They tried to hit the Defcon hacker conference in Las Vegas .
As the conference was kicking off a few days ago , attendees noticed that an ATM placed in the Riviera Hotel , which plays host to the annual event , did n't quite look right , according to a senior conference organizer who identified himself only as Priest .
" They looked at the screen where there would normally be a camera , " he said .
" It was a little bit too dark , so someone shined a flashlight in there and there was a PC . "
The ATM looked like a working system , but when people would put their cards in the machine , it would scan their card information and record the PINs they entered .
He did n't know how long the ATM had been at the Riviera .
Conference organizers notified local law enforcement who hauled away the machine on " Thursday or Friday , " said Priest , who said he works as a " civil servant " in his day job .
Credit card skimmers -- small devices installed on top of card readers to steal information -- and fake ATMs are a common problem .
Once the criminal records the card information and PIN , he can use that to create a fake ATM card and then empty the victim 's account .
Previously unsophisticated criminal gangs are increasingly using these devices , Priest said .
" They 're realizing that this is a great way to make money without getting caught . "
The criminals probably did n't realize that they were installing their ATM in a hotel that was soon going to be flooded with more than 8,000 security professionals , he added .
They were smart enough to place the machine in one of the few spots in the hotel where there was no security camera to catch them , Priest said .
" It was literally right next to the hotel security entrance . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s installed power generating capacity exceeds 800 million killowatts ( 800 gigawatts ) with a new hydropower generator coming on line , state media reported on Sunday .
That puts China just over halfway toward its target of 1,600 gigawatts of installed power generating capacity by 2020 .
The latest addition came from the no .
6 generator at Laxiwa Hydropower Station , the country ’s largest hydropower station on the Yellow River , which has started running , Xinhua news agency reported .
A new study by researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine may reveal how long - lasting memories form in the brain .
The researchers hope that the findings , now available online and scheduled to appear in an upcoming issue of Neuroscience , may one day help scientists develop treatments to prevent and treat conditions such as post - traumatic stress disorder .
" Although many things are known about memories that form from repeat experiences , not much is known with regard to how some memories form with just one exposure , " said Ashok Hegde , Ph.D. , an associate professor of neurobiology and anatomy and the lead investigator on the study .
Scientists do know that people tend to remember extremely happy or sad occasions vividly because of the emotional connection , Hegde said .
Extreme emotions trigger the release of a chemical in the brain called norepinephrine , which is related to adrenaline .
That norepinephrine somehow helps memories last a long time - some even a lifetime .
For example , he said , when a person asks , " Where were you when the 9/11 attacks happened ? " most people can recall immediately where they were and what they were doing when they heard the news .
They remember the moment as if it just happened because a national tragedy arouses emotion and emotion somehow makes memories last for a long time , Hegde explained .
For the current study , Hegde and colleagues looked at how norepinephrine helps female mice remember the scent of their male partners after being exposed to it just once during mating .
The researchers studied the neural circuitry in the accessory olfactory bulb , the part of the brain where memory of the male partner 's scent is stored .
They found that norepinephrine , released in mice while mating , activates an enzyme called Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) , specifically , the " alpha " isoform of PKC , in the accessory olfactory bulb .
The PKC enzyme has about a dozen forms , or isoforms , that exist in the brains of mammals , including humans .
" The fact that PKC - alpha is activated through the release of norepinephrine is an important discovery , " Hegde said .
" It explains how strong memories form for specific sensory experiences . "
In female mice , the information about the partner 's scent is carried by a chemical called glutamate and the fact that mating has occurred is conveyed by the release of norepinephrine , Hegde explained .
Previous studies have found that glutamate and norepinephrine together , but not individually , cause strong memory formation for the male 's scent .
" No one knew how this happened , " Hegde said .
" Our findings indicate that the PKC - alpha enzyme tells the nerve cells in the brain that these two chemicals have arrived together .
PKC - alpha is like the bouncer who lifts the rope blocking the entrance to an exclusive club for strong memories when glutamate and norepinephrine arrive together .
If they arrive alone , they can't get past the velvet rope . "
Hegde explained that , when memory is stored in the brain , the connections between nerve cells , called synapses , change .
Strong memories are formed when synapses become stronger through structural changes that occur at the synapse .
PKC - alpha works with glutamate and norepinephrine to create those changes .
Hegde said that the next step in this line of research is to learn exactly how PKC - alpha can turn genes on in nerve cells .
Understanding the precise sequence of molecules that are activated by PKC - alpha will help researchers block the function of these molecules and test whether they block memory formation .
This future research will not only explain strong pleasant memories , but also how strong unpleasant memories form in instances like post - traumatic stress disorder .

New DHS - NSA - AT&T " Cybersecurity " Partnership
Under the rubric of cybersecurity , the Obama administration is moving forward with a Bush regime program to screen state computer traffic on private - sector networks , including those connecting people to the Internet , The Washington Post revealed July 3 .
That project , code - named “ Einstein , ” may very well be related to the much - larger , ongoing and highly illegal National Security Agency ( NSA ) communications intercept program known as “ Stellar Wind , ” disclosed in 2005 by The New York Times .
There are several components to Stellar Wind , one of which is a massive data - mining project run by the agency .
As USA Today revealed in 2006 , the “ National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans , using data provided by AT&T , Verizon and BellSouth . ”
Under the current program , Einstein will be tied directly into giant NSA data bases that contain the trace signatures left behind by cyberattacks ; these immense electronic warehouses will be be fed by information streamed to the agency by the nation ’s telecommunications providers .
AT&T , in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and the NSA will spearhead the aggressive new initiative to detect malicious attacks launched against government web sites–by continuing to monitor the electronic communications of Americans .
This contradicts President Obama ’s pledge announcing his administration ’s cybersecurity program on May 29 .
During White House remarks Obama said that the government will not continue Bush - era surveillance practices or include “ monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic . ”
Called the “ flagship system ” in the national security state ’s cyber defense arsenal , The Wall Street Journal reports that Einstein is “ designed to protect the U.S. government ’s computer networks from cyberspies . ”
In addition to cost overruns and mismanagement by outsourced contractors , the system “ is being stymied by technical limitations and privacy concerns . ”
According to the Journal , Einstein is being developed in three stages :
Einstein 1 : Monitors Internet traffic flowing in and out of federal civilian networks .
Detects abnormalities that might be cyber attacks .
Is unable to block attacks .
Einstein 2 : In addition to looking for abnormalities , detects viruses and other indicators of attacks based on signatures of known incidents , and alerts analysts immediately .
Also ca n’t block attacks .
Einstein 3 : Under development .
Based on technology developed for a National Security Agency program called Tutelage , it detects and deflects security breaches .
Its filtering technology can read the content of email and other communications .
( Siobhan Gorman , “ Troubles Plague Cyberspy Defense , ” The Wall Street Journal , July 3 , 2009 )
As readers of Antifascist Calling are well aware , like other telecom grifters , AT&T is a private - sector partner of NSA and continues to be a key player in the agency ’s driftnet spying on Americans ’ electronic communications .
In 2006 , AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein revealed in a sworn affidavit , that the firm ’s Internet traffic that runs through fiber - optic cables at the company ’s Folsom Street facility in San Francisco was routinely provided to the National Security Agency
Using a device known as a splitter , a complete copy of Internet traffic that AT&T receives–email , web browsing requests and other electronic communications sent by AT&T customers , was diverted onto a separate fiber - optic cable connected to the company ’s SG - 3 room , controlled by the agency .
Only personnel with NSA clearances–either working for , or on behalf of the agency –have access to this room .
Klein and other critics of the program , including investigative journalist James Bamford who reported in his book , The Shadow Factory , believe that some 15 - 30 identical NSA - controlled rooms exist at AT&T facilities scattered across the country .
Einstein : You Do n’t Have to Be a Genius to Know They ’re Lying
But what happens next , after the data is processed and catalogued by the agency is little understood .
Programs such as Einstein will provide NSA with the ability to read and decipher the content of email messages , any and all messages in real - time .
While DHS claims that “ the new program will scrutinize only data going to or from government systems , ” the Post reports that a debate has been sparked within the agency over “ uncertainty about whether private data can be shielded from unauthorized scrutiny , how much of a role NSA should play and whether the agency ’s involvement in warrantless wiretapping during George W. Bush ’s presidency would draw controversy . ”
A “ Privacy Impact Assessment ( PIA ) for EINSTEIN 2 ″ issued by DHS in May 2008 , claims the system is interested in “ malicious activity ” and not personally identifiable information flowing into federal networks .
While DHS claims that “ the risk associated with the use of this computer network security intrusion detection system is actually lower than the risk generated by using a commercially available intrusion detection system , ” this assertion is undercut when the agency states , “ Internet users have no expectation of privacy in the to / from address of their messages or the IP addresses of the sites they visit . ”
When Einstein 3 is eventually rolled - out , Internet users similarly will “ have no expectation of privacy ” when it comes to the content of their communications .
DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters , “ we absolutely intend to use the technical resources , the substantial ones , that NSA has . ”
Seeking to deflect criticism from civil libertarians , Napolitano claims “ they will be guided , led and in a sense directed by the people we have at the Department of Homeland Security . ”
Despite protests to the contrary by securocrats , like other Bush and Obama “ cybersecurity ” initiatives the Einstein program is a backdoor for pervasive state surveillance .
Government Computer News reported in December 2008 that Marc Rotenberg , the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) said that “ the misuse or exposure of sensitive data from such a program [ Einstein ] could undermine the security arguments for surveillance . ”
And with Internet Service Providers routinely deploying deep packet inspection tools to “ siphon off requested traffic for law enforcement , ” tools with the ability to “ inspect and shape every single packet–in real time –for nearly a million simultaneous connections ” as Ars Technica reported , to assume that ISPs will protect Americans ’ privacy rights from out - of - control state agencies is a foolhardy supposition at best .
The latest version of the system will not be rolled - out for at least 18 months .
But like the Stellar Wind driftnet surveillance program , communications intercepted by Einstein 3 will be routed through a “ monitoring box ” controlled by NSA and their civilian contractors .
Under a classified pilot program approved during the Bush administration , NSA data and hardware would be used to protect the networks of some civilian government agencies .
Part of an initiative known as Einstein 3 , the plan called for telecommunications companies to route the Internet traffic of civilian agencies through a monitoring box that would search for and block computer codes designed to penetrate or otherwise compromise networks .
( Ellen Nakashima , “ Cybersecurity Plan to Involve NSA , Telecoms , ” The Washington Post , July 3 , 2009 )
However , investigative journalist Wayne Madsen reported last September “ that the Bush administration has authorized massive surveillance of the Internet using as cover a cyber - security multi-billion dollar project called the ‘ Einstein ’ program . ”
While some researchers ( including this one ) question Madsen ’s overreliance on anonymous sources and undisclosed documents , in fairness it should be pointed out that nine months before The New York Times the NSA ’s secret e-mail collection database known as Pinwale , Madsen had already identified and broken the story .
According to Madsen ,
The classified technology being used for Einstein was developed for the NSA in conducting signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) operations on email networks in Russia .
Code - named PINWHEEL , the NSA email surveillance system targets Russian government , military , diplomatic , and commercial email traffic and burrows into the text portions of the email to search for particular words and phrases of interest to NSA eavesdroppers .
According to NSA documents obtained by WMR , there is an NSA system code - named “ PINWALE . ”
The DNI and NSA also plan to move Einstein into the private sector by claiming the nation ’s critical infrastructure , by nature , overlaps into the commercial sector .
There are classified plans , already budgeted in so - called “ black ” projects , to extend Einstein surveillance into the dot (. ) com , dot (. ) edu , dot (. ) int , and dot (. ) org , as well as other Internet domains .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has budgeted $ 5.4 billion for Einstein in his department ’s FY2009 information technology budget .
However , this amount does not take into account the “ black ” budgets for Einstein proliferation throughout the U.S. telecommunications network contained in the budgets for NSA and DNI .
( Wayne Madsen , “ ‘ Einstein ’ replaces ‘ Big Brother ’ in Internet Surveillance , ” Online Journal , September 19 , 2008 )
A follow - up article published in February , identified the ultra-spooky Booz Allen Hamilton firm as the developer of Pinwale , an illegal program for the interception of text communications .
According to Madsen , “ the system is linked to a number of meta - databases that contain e-mail , faxes , and text messages of hundreds of millions of people around the world and in the United States . ”
In other words both classified programs , Pinwale and Einstein , are sophisticated electronic communications surveillance projects that most certainly will train the agency ’s formidable intelligence assets on the American people “ using as cover a cyber - security multi-billion dollar project called the ‘ Einstein ’ program , ” as Madsen reported .
AT&T : “ No Comment ”
An AT&T spokesman refused to comment on the proposals and is seeking legal protection from the state that it will not be sued for privacy breaches as a result of its participation in the new program .
“ Legal certification ” the Post reports , “ has been held up for several months as DHS prepares a contract . ”
NSA ’s involvement is critical proponents claim , because the agency has a readily - accessible database of computer codes , or signatures “ that have been linked to cyberattacks or known adversaries .
The NSA has compiled the cache by , for example , electronically observing hackers trying to gain access to U.S. military systems , ” the Post averred .
Calling NSA ’s cache “ the secret sauce …it ’s the stuff they have that the private sector does n’t , ” is what raises alarms for privacy and civil liberties ’ advocates .
Known as Tutelage , NSA ’s classified program can detect and automatically decide how to deal with malicious intrusions , “ to block them or watch them closely to better assess the threat , ” according to the Post .
“ The database for the program would also contain feeds from commercial firms and DHS ’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team , administration officials said . ”
Jeff Mohan , AT&T ’s executive director for Einstein , was more forthcoming earlier this year .
He told Federal News Radio : “ With these services , we will provide a secure portal from the agency ’s infrastructure , or Intranet to the public internet .
There is a technical aspect , which is routers , firewalls and that sort of thing that applies these security capabilities across that portal and looks a Internet traffic that comes from public Internet to Intranet and vice versa . ”
The “ technical aspect ” will also provide federal agencies the ability to capture , sort , read and then store Americans ’ private communications in huge data bases run by NSA .
Mohan said that AT&T will provide the state with “ optional services such as scanning e-mail and placing filters on agency networks to keep malicious e-mail off the network as well as forensic and storage capabilities also are available through MTIPS [ Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Services ] . ”
In addition to AT&T , other private partners awarded contracts under the General Services Administration ’s MTIPS which has a built - in “ Einstein enclave ” include : Sprint , L3 Communications , Qwest , MCI , General Dynamics and Verizon , according to multiple reports published by Federal Computer Week .
Claiming that the state is “ looking for malicious content , not a love note to someone with a dot - gov e-mail address , ” a former unnamed “ senior Bush administration official ” told the Post “ what we ’re interested in is finding the code , the thing that will do the network harm , not reading the e-mail itself . ”
Try selling that to the tens of millions of Americans whose private communications have been illegally spied upon by the Bush and Obama administrations or leftist dissidents singled - out for “ special handling ” by the national security state ’s public - private surveillance partnership !
As the “ global war on terror ” morphs into an endless war on our democratic rights , the NSA is expanding domestic operations by “ decentralizing its massive computer hubs , ” The Salt Lake Tribune revealed .
The agency “ will build a 1 - million - square - foot data center at Utah ’s Camp Williams , ” the newspaper disclosed July 1 .
The new facility would be NSA ’s third major data center .
In 2007 , the agency announced plans to build a second data center in San Antonio , Texas after the Baltimore Sun reported that NSA had “ maxed out ” the electric capacity of the Baltimore area ’s power grid .
The San Antonio Current reported in December , that the NSA ’s Texas Cryptology Center will cost “ upwards of $ 130 million . ”
The 470,000 square - foot - facility is adjacent to a similar center constructed by software giant Microsoft .
Investigative journalist James Bamford told the Current that under current law “ NSA could gain access to Microsoft ’s stored data without even a warrant , but merely a fiber - optic cable . ”
A follow - up article by The Salt Lake Tribune that the facility will cost upwards of $ 2 billion dollars and that funds have already been appropriated by the Obama administration for NSA ’s new data center and listening post .
The secretive agency released a statement Thursday acknowledging the selection of Camp Williams as a site for the new center and describing it as “ a specialized facility that houses computer systems and supporting equipment . ”
Budget documents provide a more detailed picture of the facility and its mission .
The supercomputers in the center will be part of the NSA ’s signal intelligence program , which seeks to “ gain a decisive information advantage for the nation and our allies under all circumstances ” according to the documents .
( Matthew D. LaPlante , “ New NSA Center Unveiled in Budget Documents , ” The Salt Lake Tribune , July 2 , 2009 )
Not everyone is pleased with the announcement .
Steve Erickson , the director of the antiwar Citizens Education Project told the Tribune , “ Finally , the Patriot Act has a home . ”
While the total cost of rolling - out the Einstein 3 system is classified , The Wall Street Journal reports that “ the price tag was expected to exceed $ 2 billion . ”
And as with other national security state initiatives , it is the American people who are footing the bill for the destruction of our democratic rights .

On the right is a macrophage with inadequate vitamin D has become clogged with cholesterol , an early marker of atherosclerosis .

Low levels of vitamin D are known to nearly double the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes , and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis now think they know why .
They have found that diabetics deficient in vitamin D can't process cholesterol normally , so it builds up in their blood vessels , increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke .
The new research has identified a mechanism linking low vitamin D levels to heart disease risk and may lead to ways to fix the problem , simply by increasing levels of vitamin D .
" Vitamin D inhibits the uptake of cholesterol by cells called macrophages , " says principal investigator Carlos Bernal - Mizrachi , M.D. , a Washington University endocrinologist at Barnes - Jewish Hospital .
" When people are deficient in vitamin D , the macrophage cells eat more cholesterol , and they can't get rid of it .
The macrophages get clogged with cholesterol and become what scientists call foam cells , which are one of the earliest markers of atherosclerosis . "
Macrophages are dispatched by the immune system in response to inflammation and often are activated by diseases such as diabetes .
Bernal - Mizrachi and his colleagues believe that in diabetic patients with inadequate vitamin D , macrophages become loaded with cholesterol and eventually stiffen blood vessels and block blood flow .
Bernal - Mizrachi , an assistant professor of medicine and of cell biology and physiology , studied macrophage cells taken from people with and without diabetes and with and without vitamin D deficiency .
His team , led by research assistants Jisu Oh and Sherry Weng , M.D. , exposed the cells to cholesterol and to high or low vitamin D levels .
When vitamin D levels were low in the culture dish , macrophages from diabetic patients were much more likely to become foam cells .
In the Aug. 25 issue of the journal Circulation , which currently is available online , the team reports that vitamin D regulates signaling pathways linked both to uptake and to clearance of cholesterol in macrophages .
" Cholesterol is transported through the blood attached to lipoproteins such as LDL , the ' bad ' cholesterol , " Bernal - Mizrachi explains .
" As it is stimulated by oxygen radicals in the vessel wall , LDL becomes oxidated , and macrophages eat it uncontrollably .
LDL cholesterol then clogs the macrophages , and that 's how atherosclerosis begins . "
That process becomes accelerated when a person is deficient in vitamin D .
And people with type 2 diabetes are very likely to have this deficiency .
Worldwide , approximately one billion people have insufficient vitamin D levels , and in women with type 2 diabetes , the likelihood of low vitamin D is about a third higher than in women of the same age who do n't have diabetes .
The skin manufactures vitamin D in response to ultraviolet light exposure .
But in much of the United States , people do n't make enough vitamin D during the winter — when the sun 's rays are weaker and more time is spent indoors .
The good news is when human macrophages are placed in an environment with plenty of vitamin D , their uptake of cholesterol is suppressed , and they do n't become foam cells .
Bernal - Mizrachi believes it may be possible to slow or reverse the development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes by helping them regain adequate vitamin D levels .
" There is debate about whether any amount of sun exposure is safe , so oral vitamin D supplements may work best , " he says , " but perhaps if people were exposed to sunlight only for a few minutes at a time , that may be an option , too . "
He has launched a new study of diabetics who are both deficient in vitamin D and have high blood pressure .
He wants to learn whether replacing vitamin D will lower blood pressure and improve blood flow .

Is it a coyote ?
Is it a wolf ?
Yes and yes .
It 's a " coywolf . "
The predators that are plaguing Durham Region and showing up in urban areas appear to be an emerging species resulting from wolves and coyotes interbreeding .
The larger , highly adaptable animals " have the wolf characteristics of pack hunting and aggression and the coyote characteristics of lack of fear of human - developed areas , " says Trent University geneticist Bradley White , who 's been studying the hybrids for 12 years .
We 're seeing " evolution in action , " he says .
But that combination of genetic material from both species has spelled trouble for farmers , who are losing a growing number of livestock to predators .
They report attacks by animals that are bigger , bolder and smarter than regular coyotes .
They say hunting in packs to prey on sheep and cattle in broad daylight is becoming a common behaviour .
Durham Region farmers have suffered the most damage to livestock in the province .
Last year the food and agriculture ministry paid out a total compensation of $ 168,000 in the region for 545 dead or injured animals .
Commonly called eastern coyotes , the creatures are actually a mixture of western coyote and eastern wolf that comes from a constantly evolving gene pool , says White , chair and professor of biology in Peterborough .
Going back 100 years , deforestation , wolf control programs and changing habitat , ecosystems and prey conspired to drive down the wolf population .
Meanwhile , the number of coyotes – whose original range was in western North America – grew , thanks to their ability to adapt and reproduce with ease .
The two species started to interbreed , White explains .
" In many ways , this animal is a creation of human impact on the planet , " says White .
Although the coywolf hybrid has only recently been verified through genetic research , White believes they started appearing in southern Algonquin Park back in the 1920s .
Colleague Paul Wilson , a wildlife genetics specialist , says the genetic gumbo from which coywolves emerge produces some that are more wolf - like , while others have more coyote characteristics .
But they 're definitely bigger .
" Some of these are 80 - pound animals , double the size of a typical coyote that used to be 40 pounds . "
But there 's no cause for alarm , says John Pisapio , a wildlife biologist with the Ministry of Natural Resources , which is studying the role of coyotes and wolves in the ecosystem .
Hybrids may be larger but there 's no evidence the population as a whole is more aggressive or prone to aberrant behaviour , he says .
He agrees predation on livestock is a concern – they do kill sheep and smaller animals – but insists attacks on cattle are unusual .

" As a biologist I find it hard to explain how a coyote brings down a 900 - pound steer . "
In some cases , coyotes might just be feeding on an animal that died from other causes , he says .
The population growth is a natural upswing following a mange epidemic that wiped out big numbers eight or nine years ago , he adds .
Pisapio says instances of fearlessness or brazen attacks are usually the result of coyotes that have come to associate food with people and lose their natural fear of humans .
That belief is echoed by Johnny , " The Critter Gitter , " who did n't want his last name used because people do n't like that he kills problem wildlife for a living .
" I kill coyotes .
I do n't sugarcoat it , " he says .
But he feels sympathy for them .
" Humans are to blame for making monsters of them , " he says .
Coyotes are attracted by pet food and garbage left lying around in urban areas , and deadstock on farms .
They 're not all bad and often get the blame when dogs kill livestock , he says .
Johnny also doubts they 're making a regular meal of cattle .
During the 30 years he 's worked in the province , he 's seen only a few cases of " large , healthy animals taken down by coyotes . "
But as coywolves become more urbanized and their relationship with people continues to evolve , city dwellers can expect problems , says
White , suggesting a control program may be needed at some point .
" They will clearly bump into human activities , and there will be pets eaten in Rouge Valley . "

Tapir : Language Support to Reduce the State Space in Model - Checking
The Pentagon has approached Congress to grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel throughout the United States in times of emergency or a major disaster .
This request has already occasioned a dispute with the nation ’s governors .
And it raises the prospect of U.S. military personnel patrolling the streets of the United States , in conflict with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 .
In June , the U.S. Northern Command distributed a “ Congressional Fact Sheet ” entitled “ Legislative Proposal for Activation of Federal Reserve Forces for Disasters . ”
That proposal would amend current law , thereby “ authorizing the Secretary of Defense to order any unit or member of the Army Reserve , Air Force Reserve , Navy Reserve , and the Marine Corps Reserve , to active duty for a major disaster or emergency . ”
Taken together , these reserve units would amount to “ more than 379,000 military personnel in thousands of communities across the United States , ” explained Paul Stockton , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and America ’s Security Affairs , in a letter to the National Governors Association , dated July 20 .
The governors were not happy about this proposal , since they want to maintain control of their own National Guard forces , as well as military personnel acting in a domestic capacity in their states .
“ We are concerned that the legislative proposal you discuss in your letter would invite confusion on critical command and control issues , ” Governor James H. Douglas of Vermont and Governor Joe Manchin III of West Virginia , the president and vice president of the governors ’ association , wrote in a letter back to Stockton on August 7 .
The governors asserted that they “ must have tactical control over all . . . active duty and reserve military forces engaged in domestic operations within the governor ’s state or territory . ”
According to Pentagon public affairs officer Lt. Col. Almarah K. Belk , Stockton has not responded formally to the governors but understands their concerns .
“ There is a rub there , ” she said .
“ If the Secretary calls up the reserve personnel to provide support in a state and retains command and control of those forces , the governors are concerned about if I have command and control of the Guard , how do we ensure unity of effort and everyone is communicating and not running over each other . ”
Belk said Stockton is addressing this problem .
“ That is exactly what Dr. Stockton is working out right now with the governors and DHS and the National Guard , ” she said .
“ He ’s bringing all the stakeholders together . ”
Belk said the legislative change is necessary in the aftermath of a “ catastrophic natural disaster , not beyond that , ” and she referred to Katrina , among other events .
But NorthCom ’s Congressional fact sheet refers not just to a “ major disaster ” but also to “ emergencies . ”
And it says , “ Those terms are defined in section 5122 of title 42 , U.S. Code . ”
That section gives the President the sole discretion to designate an event as an “ emergency ” or a “ major disaster . ”
Both are “ in the determination of the President ” alone .
That section also defines “ major disaster ” by citing plenty of specifics : “ hurricane , tornado , storm , high water , wind - driven water , tidal wave , tsunami , earthquake , volcanic eruption , landslide , mudslide , snowstorm , or drought , ” as well as “ fire , flood , or explosion . ”
But the definition of “ emergency ” is vague : “ Emergency means any occasion or instance for which , in the determination of the President , Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety , or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States . ”
Currently , the President can call up the Reserves only in an emergency involving “ a use or threatened use of a weapon of mass destruction ” or “ a terrorist attack or threatened terrorist attack in the United States that results , or could result , in significant loss of life or property , ” according to Title 10 , Chapter 1209 , Section 12304 , of the U.S. Code .
In fact , Section 12304 explicitly prohibits the President from calling up the Reserves for any other “ natural or manmade disaster , accident , or catastrophe . ”
So the new proposed legislation would greatly expand the President ’s power to call up the Reserves in a disaster or an emergency and would extend that power to the Secretary of Defense .
( There are other circumstances , such as repelling invasions or rebellions or enforcing federal authority , where the President already has the authority to call up the Reserves . )
The ACLU is alarmed by the proposed legislation .
Mike German , the ACLU ’s national security policy counsel , expressed amazement “ that the military would propose such a broad set of authorities and potentially undermine a 100 - year - old prohibition against the military in domestic law enforcement with no public debate and seemingly little understanding of the threat to democracy . ”
At the moment , says Pentagon spokesperson Belk , the legislation does not have a sponsor in the House or the Senate .
There are n’t many places we can see the effects of climate change as dramatically as on the world ’s glaciers .
A few months ago , we asked our friends at the Extreme Ice Survey to send us a video to help 350 supporters visualize what glacial retreat really means .
Using time - lapse and conventional photography and video , they put together this stunning clip of 350 days in the life of the retreating Mendenhall glacier near Juneau , Alaska .
Abstaining from alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of depression according to a new study published in Addiction journal .
It has long been recognised that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to poor physical and mental health .
However , there has been mounting evidence that low levels of alcohol consumption may also be associated with poor mental health possibly due to abstainers having other health problems or being reformed heavy drinkers .
The study utilised data from the Nord - Tr-ndelag Health Study ( HUNT Study ) based in Norway .
This provided information on the drinking habits and mental health of over 38,000 individuals .
Using this data the authors were able to show that those individuals who reported drinking no alcohol over a two week period were more likely than moderate drinkers to report symptoms of depression .
Those individuals who additionally labelled themselves as " abstainers " were at the highest risk of depression .
Other factors , such as age , physical health problems and number of close friends could explain some , but not all of this increased risk .
The authors also had access to reported levels of alcohol consumption 10 years prior to the main survey .
This showed that fourteen percent of current abstainers had previously been heavy drinkers , but this did not explain all of the increased risk of depression amongst abstainers .
The authors conclude that in societies where some use of alcohol is the norm , abstinence may be associated with being socially marginalised or particular personality traits that may also be associated with mental illness .
It should also be noted that alcohol use is associated with many physical health problems , with excessive alcohol consumption being estimated to contribute to over 33,000 death in the UK each year and many more injuries .
The current guidance is for men to drink no more than three to four units each day , and women to drink no more than two to three units .

The Economic Recovery ... Or Lack Thereof
We ’ll start today by heeding some good advice :
“ I urge you to remove the word ‘ consumer ’ from your lexicon , ” James Howard Kunstler told us at the Investment Symposium last month .
“ It ’s degrading .
It suggests we have no duty to our fellow man . ”
While the media have trained us to toss the word around with little concern , we ’re going to make it a point to take on JHK ’s advice , especially today .
“ Consumer ” has this ring to it … as if we were pigs bouncing around in a pen , waiting for nothing more than the next slop bucket to come by .
Americans — despite frequent evidence to the contrary — are smarter than that … just check out the latest Gallup poll :
The average Joe is usually a lousy stock picker , but the overwhelming majority of people can see the economic forest for the trees … even though the government and the media are bombarding us every day with recovery hopes and “ green shoots . ”
“ The head winds against the U.S. economy are pretty stiff right now , ” Addison Wiggin told Fox Business News yesterday .
“ They really are n’t heartwarming toward individual investors .
If the unemployment rate continues to rise , and we expect it to go from 12 - 15 % , you can expect the savings rate to spike even higher and retail spending to go down , and we do n’t have anything to replace that .
“ The government keeps looking for the economy to ‘ get back on track ’ — buzzwords we ’ve been hearing for 18 months now .
But the economy was not on the right rack in the first place — we were spending more than we were taking in and speculating on paper assets .
That ’s not a recipe for a prosperous society . ”
“ I fail to see how anyone can get excited about an economic recovery , ” adds Chris Mayer , “ when the nation ’s banking system looks like Napoleon ’s Grande Armee on its way back from Moscow .
It is taking heavy losses — already 74 bank failures this year , and many more are on the way .
My own guess is that bank failures will run well into the hundreds before this is over .
“ The familiar past is always a good starting point to make a guess about what the unfamiliar future will look like .
And so , if you look back at the big S&L mess , you see bank failures topped 500 .
See this chart below :
“ That seems like a good round figure for a guess this time around too .
This bubble was much bigger than that one .
Another interesting point to note about that chart above is how long it took for the crisis to unfold .
It ’s like a Tolstoy novel .
So again , I do n’t see how people get so worked up over a recovery .
“ We just saw a huge bubble pop , and it ’s not going to be all better with a little spit and a Band - Aid .
This is going to take some years to work through .
“ As an investor , then , it would seem to be bleak .
However , the market is a great creator of opportunity .
It ’s just that the opportunity does n’t always come back to the same nest every year . ”
A German designer cribbed from the slot cars we loved as kids to come with a cool idea for extending the range of electric cars .
Instead of relying on an electric motor under the hood , Christian Förg suggests putting an electric motor under the road .
Förg 's Speedway Transport System concept uses a network of linear electric motors to propel EVs along the highway .
He sees us driving around in futuristic dual - mode EVs with small motors for city driving .
When we 're ready to leave town , a contact - free linear motor would propel the car over long distances with a drifting magnetic field .
Förg says linear motors would work under our existing roadways , complementing – not replacing – existing automotive technology .
" This means that you can use the roads with normal cars and also at the same time for the Speedway system , " he told Wired.com .
The dual - mode design increases the flexibility of the vehicle .
For tooling around town , the car adopts a shorter , more upright stance to save space and improve visibility .
Once you hit the highway – Förg calls it " speedway mode " – the car stretches out like a Lazy - Z- Boy to maximize aerodynamic efficiency and passenger comfort .
If Speedway is ever implemented , the Autobahn could become the top of a giant linear motor .
Instead of spinning a rotor , linear motors create a linear force along a flat stator ( the stationary part of the electric motor ) .
In transporation , the linear motor 's moving magnetic field will repel the opposing magnetic field of a conductor , thereby moving it along .
We do n't have advanced degrees in this stuff , so we like to think of it as a giant slot car track where the pin is replaced by a magnetic field .
Förg says the linear motor also can charge an electric car 's battery so it 's ready for urban travel .
" Only highways for long range distances will need to be upgraded , " he wrote on his website .
" But even with this upgrade , the streets still can be used by conventional cars . "
While the concept sounds far - fetched , linear motors have been around since the 1840s and the first practical models were demonstrated in Germany in 1935 .
Linear motors are used to propel Maglev trains and some urban transit systems .
The AirTrain at New York 's JFK Airport and the Vancouver SkyTrain are two well - known public transit systems that use linear motors from Bombardier , while Maglevs in Shanghai and Japan also use the technology .

Big Brother is to be scrapped by Channel 4 following disappointing ratings this year , according to a report by The Sun .
Barely 2 million have been tuning in to this series of the programme , compared to 8 million only a few years ago .
A telly insider confirmed last night an official announcement will be made as early as Friday , saying : “ The reality is people are BORED with it .
Even at Channel 4 the vibe among staff is that if you like Big Brother you ’re not cool ” .
They continued : “ If the people commissioning the show do n’t think it ’s cool , what hope is there ? ”
The show was launched in 2000 , a “ bold experiment ” in which a number of morons are thrown into a neonified complex , or “ house ” , for the public to scrutinise and ridicule for a predetermined number of weeks .
But year by year the contestants got duller and duller .
There will be one final series next year because of Channel 4 ’s deal with the show producers Endemol – and Celebrity Big Brother fans are likely to get their fix in January .
UPDATED !: C4 director of television Kevin Lygo has just confirmed that next year will be the last for Big Brother , at the network ’s Autumn press launch .
He said : “ We ’ve decided it ’s time to move on ” , adding : “ Big Brother is still profitable for Channel 4 despite its reduced popularity and there could have been the option to renew it on more favourable terms .
“ That ’s what a purely commercial broadcaster would have done , but Channel 4 has a public remit to champion new forms of creativity . ”
Big Brother production company Endemol is now expected to take the show to another broadcaster for 2011 .
ITV has previously expressed interest in acquiring the rights , although Five and Sky1 are also potential candidates .
But where will that leave Davina ?

I make no secret of my hatred for the White Sox , but you have to respect the hell out of GM Ken Williams .
On top of trading for an injured Jake Peavy in the 11th hour of this year ’s trade deadline he has now added the hefty salary of the extremely talented , yet underachieving , Alex Rios for absolutely nothing other than having to pay the remainder of his 7 year $ 69.835 million contract .
Over on Big League Stew the headline of the Rios related post was Oops ?!
White Sox make $ 60 - million waiver claim on Alex Rios .
There was no “ oops ” involved in this waiver claim .
Kenny W. knew exactly what he was getting into and may have just put the White Sox over the top in the AL Central with this move .
One thing is certain , Williams is not afraid to take chances , and big chances at that , to improve his team .
There is no doubt in my mind that this move was calculated , thought out , and intentional .
There is also no doubt in my mind who Rios will be replacing .
Scott Podsednik has had a moderately successful season but has a limited set of skills and limited value to a MLB organization .
Scotty
Po has turned in an OPS + north of 100 only one time in his career and that was back in 2003 with a mark of 116 .
This season despite the perceived success , Pods has an OPS + of just 92 .
He ’s not league average and in 9 ML seasons has a career mark of just 86 .
Alex Rios , on the other hand , has a career OPS + of 104 and in his 3 seasons prior to 2009 turned in marks of 120 , 122 , and 111 respectively .
This year has been viewed as a disappointment by a lot of people as big things were expected of Rios .
Fairness in conversation , I did spend my 1st round draft pick on Alex Rios in my 14 team keeper league to add him to my protected core of Morneau , Longoria , Hanley Ramirez , Greinke , and Lester .
His BA , OBP , and SLG are all down , but he does have 14 HR and 19 SB on the season so he has n’t been a complete bust .
It is impossible to predict how Rios will deal with the managerial stylings of Ozzie Guillen , but in addition to risk - taking moves , Ken Williams is clearly able to identify players that will fit into the experience of Oz .
My prediction is that Rios will rachet up his production for the Sox thanks to a hitter - friendly ballpark , fiery manager , and his own sense of pride .
Since the Blue Jays just let him go , the latter of those reasons may be the most important .
If Rios ever needed a chip on his shoulder , he has one now .
Despite the thoughts of others online , I do n’t see Rios battling for playing time .
Ozzie may be crazy , but he knows baseball .
He knows that Rios is a more valuable player than Podsednik , he knows
Thome is old and slow , and he knows that Quentin is prone to injury .
Alex Rios will play everyday mostly at the expense of Podsednik , but Scotty Po as a 4th OF will get plenty of ABs with his ability to play all 3 OF positions effectively .
You might be asking yourself what this has to do with the Royals , or why I am piling up the word count discussing a move that my second least favorite team just pulled off .
If you are pondering this thought , a pat on the back for you .
Aside from the obvious fact that the Royals season has been in the tank for some time , I thought it would be nice to write about a GM taking a high profile , potentially high reward risk .
I sure hope Dayton Moore is paying attention to what Ken Williams has done this season and in past seasons .
Maybe as Royals fans we could take up a collection to send Dayton to a “ How to Be a GM ” seminar with Ken Williams as the keynote speaker .
The White Sox took a huge risk on an unknown managerial candidate and ended up with Ozzie Guillen .
The Royals took a risk on an unknown managerial candidate and ended up with Trey Hillman .
One of them is a walking sound byte who speaks from the heart and does n’t give a damn about political correctness .
The other one is a monotone bore afraid to stray from the company line or show any of his personality .
There is no evidence that Trey has a personality , but I am betting there is one in there somewhere .
It is an interesting contrast when you think about it .
Ken Williams is a shrewd risk taker who comes up on the winning side of the deal more often than not .
He is coupled with a borderline insane manager who leads a team willing to run through a wall for him .
Williams and Guillen do n’t always see eye to eye , a fact that has gone public a number of times , but they use all the resources at their disposal to improve the White Sox organization .
Dayton Moore by contrast is clearly delusional .
He expects fans and players to trust the process even though there is no real definition of that process .
Sure he has discussed it from time to time , but he also frequently sends mixed messages .
On one hand he discusses the importance of guys who get on base and then goes out and adds guys like Olivo and Jacobs to a roster largely devoid of OBP guys .
On one hand he talks about pitching being the currency of baseball , then trades off Howell , Nunez , Ram - Ram , Cortes , Saito , etc. to acquire marginal players .
He has attached himself to a manager who is unable to command respect in his own clubhouse and is afraid to rock the organizational boat .
Together Moore and Hillman both share the same aversion to sabermetrics and basic statistical analysis .
Ken Williams has a manager willing to speak his mind , voice his opinion , and stand up for what he believes in .
Moore has a manager that is little more than a “ vanilla ” yes man .
Setting aside the descrepancy in payrolls , is there any doubt why the White Sox have been successful and the Royals have not ?
Money surely helps , but there is little doubt in my mind that a Williams / Guillen combo could run rings around Moore / Hillman if the payrolls were reversed .
The final tally : Royals acquire Yuniesky Betancourt and Josh Anderson , White Sox acquire Jake Peavy and Alex Rios .
Damn , now I am depressed .
 Chariots of the Gods , Erich Von Daniken couldnt have said it more clearly .
I have always been a hard core realist : if there is no proof , if you cant measure it or there is no mathematical formula ; it just doesnt exist .
That has always been my opinion about FLYING SAUCERS and GOD .
The above artwork was created by space artist , David A Hardy .
You can find more of his fine work at www.spaceart.org
Then , Erich Von Daniken opened A WHOLE NEW REALITY , something I could accept , that made sense , and the proof was in the scriptures .
The strange thing about it was that as I studied flying saucers , I realized that I had already had three sightings as a child , but did not know what I was looking at then .
If God is driving a flying saucer , there has to be a reason why they gave us religion .
I have studied all religions for the past 30 years , and it has led me to more than one enormous conclusion .
Man was not smart enough to write any of the religions , and I mean the Eastern Spiritualism ( the - self ) , Western Religions ( God , - which I always have referred to as the  Extraterrestrial ) or American Creationism ( Nature itself , including man ) .
One of the oldest religious text  The Egyptian Book of the Dead ( 1* ) dates back more than 3000 BC .
When writing was invented and the scribes and artists first wrote down what the priests had used in their prayers and litanies , they were very perplexed and hardly understood the text .
What I am getting at is that all religions were not composed by humans at the time they were created .
And even the Bible is very specific in that : 2 Tim. 3:16 ALL scripture is inspired by God ,  the key word here is inspired , irrespective of who wrote it down .
SO WHO INSPIRED THE PROPHETS ?
That brings me to the next question .
If there is a God , why would there not be just ONE book , ONE religion , and ONE clear answer to all human questions ?
Just look at the Bible ; it is written in such a way that it can be interpreted a dozen different ways , and if you do not know how to THINK , you read the Bible literally : Mt 13:13 - 15  This is why I speak to them in parables , because - - -. I have the impression that it was purposely written in this manner to create as much division as possible among humans .
And with great success ; how many wars has the world seen , how many people have died ? ; all in the name of God or religion .
So with all the different religions and every religion with hidden meanings and parables to confuse anybody , I asked myself , is it all hocus - pocus ; - what if there is no God ; - then , who would be the God that inspired the scriptures ?
How would Aliens fit into the picture , and why ?
After all , there is vivid description of flying spaceships in the Bible ; just read the book of Ezekiel in the Old Testament ( See accompanying excerpt ) .
YES , spaceships have been around for thousands of years .
I have a few mottoes to go by :  There is a reason for everything in this world , -  How I phrase the question is very important , - and ,  Dont ever lie to yourself .
Before I tell you some of my ideas about Aliens , you better understand my concept about them ( the Aliens ) and remember , I have no proof that my ideas are right .
These are not facts , it is not fiction either , it is an OPINION based on all the UFO reports and MY interpretation of all the religions .
Civilizations from other worlds have visited our world for thousand of years .
They are mentioned in mythology and scriptures from EVERY Continent .
They are all friendly Aliens ; if they wanted to take over this world , they would have done so before humans invented weapons .
I suspect there are a multitude of Alien civilizations visiting this Earth based on the variety of space vehicles being reported .
The Aliens could have experimented with apes and changed their genes some million years back and produced the Human Race .
Take heed you creationist and evolutionist , there is a third possibility , you could both be right .
And it is quite obvious that the Aliens are still experimenting with the human race because of all the abduction reports .
The Aliens transverse the heavens in huge , self - contained mother ships , ships big enough to recycle liquid , gas ( air ) , food , and enough power to run for centuries , or at least be able to mine the fuel from asteroids or other worlds .
The mother ship is so huge that they are unable to park it on a planet and shut - down the antigravity ; it will collapse under its own weight .
For them to shut down the power they have to park the ship in an orbit to keep it weightless .
Of course , with the mother ship come all sort of scout , work - and exploratory vehicles , which are the ones we usually see flying around our landscape .
The crew of the mother ship has to be fairly large and I can imagine them to sign on for most of their life .
Even traveling at the speed of light , to explore space within 25 light - years of your own world will take a long time .
These Aliens would truly be Gods to us humans .
Their civilizations could be millions of years old , they know exactly how this macrocosm works .
They might have seen other worlds come and go , ( destroy themselves ) .
They know the evolutionary steps cognition has to go through , and that is the crucial point for the Aliens , they want to protect our beautiful Universe from harm .
After all , when you have become God , you dont want to see your world being destroyed .
And that brings us to the crux of religion .
As an Alien , you dont come to Earth very often but you like to keep track of the evolution on the planet when you fly by .
That is especially true when you have a race ( humanity ) that show form of intelligence and have developed speech .
And any evolving cognizance go through certain steps in their evolution , and at what point in their development is the human race .
Is there some kind of barometer that will measure cognition ?
YES , what better way than to give them religion , and the more the better .
With religion , you have intellectual concepts , abstract ideas which is totally emotional .
And as long as we humans cant see beyond our own nose , we will be in a perpetual battle on whose religion is the right one , or the best .
 I worship the only true God , - my religion is better than yours , -  I worship Creation itself , -  the Self is the Way .
You fly by our Earth once ; seeing all the different temples and all the killing and wars going on , any Alien realizes very fast how primitive humanity is .
We ( us humans ) have no respect for life , ideas , other races and cultures , we are not masters of our emotions .
Unable to govern ourselves , the Aliens have absolutely no wish to show themselves openly , we could emotionally not acknowledge another species .
And that brings me to my final point ; with us humans pointing a cannon at anything different from ourselves , the Aliens will not allow us to transverse the Universe .
We have an idea of how the atom works , and if we ever develop spaceships using antigravity , they do not want us to explore space pointing a cannon at everything alien to us , especially if we dont master our emotions .
This article came about because of a story I read in UFO * BC ( 2* ) in which three people were abducted .
Tom , one of the humans abducted , asked the Aliens 
What is the true religion on earth ?  to which the Alien answered ,  There is no correct religion on earth .
So after all is said , what is the purpose of religions ?
As I mentioned at the beginning of this article , we have four major religions .
One about God , another about Creation itself , one about Self , and one about the afterlife , covering more or less all aspects of the universe .
If you want to be spiritual , why limit yourself to only a small part of religion .
In order to become God , ( in a spiritual term ) you have to understand all the religions , no one is the correct one , you have to take them all on an equal term .
Then , when you understand , when you become master of your self and your emotions , then you are at our next step in human evolution : Peace and Creativity , you become God , the Bible even says so .
Only then will the ( Gods ) - Aliens reveal themselves .
Footnote : Crop Formations ; is that the Aliens newest form of barometer ?
It used to be plain Crop Circle , but the official scientific explanation was so fictional that it sometimes bordered on stupidity , I didnt know whether to laugh or cry .
The Aliens were probably wondering how primitive the humans were , so they improved their design and gave us Alien Graffiti , crop formations that could not possibly be made in any natural way .
Now the official voices have become quiet and at the same time try to tell us they are man made .
The Aliens are trying to tell us they are here , but nobody has the guts to come out and say  Yes , we know you are here , talk to us .
Since the Aliens are so well informed about our reaction to their sightings , I dont think they are just flying by any more , they are probably here permanently .
Why look for intelligence in outer space , try to find it here on Earth .

The Book of Ezekiel
1:4 to 1:21
1:4 And I looked , and , behold , a whirlwind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber , out of the midst of the fire .
1:5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures .
And this was their appearance ; they had the likeness of a man .
1:6 And every one had four faces , and every one had four wings .
1:7 And their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot : and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass .
1:8
And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings .
1:9 Their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
1:10 As for the likeness of their faces , they four had the face of a man , and the face of a lion , on the right side : and they four had the face of an ox on the left side ; they four also had the face of an eagle .
1:11 Thus were their faces : and their wings were stretched upward ; two wings of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
1:12 And they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
1:13 As for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , and like the appearance of lamps : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright , and out of the fire went forth lightning .
1:14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
1:15 Now as I beheld the living creatures , behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures , with his four faces .
1:16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl : and they four had one likeness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
1:17 When they went , they went upon their four sides : and they turned not when they went .
1:18 As for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
1:19 And when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
1:20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go , they went , thither was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
1:21 When those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .

I read he article and think it is reasonable and makes much sense

I have always thoght the u.f.os have been around .
I really see them here during the pyramid building days and before .
It explains so much about this planet , if your mind is open to all of this .
It really is facinating , to think we may be realatives of some sort in this huge galaxy .
I feel they wont hurt you but are curious to see how we turned out .
In fact Ive heard of them helping our planets for quite awhile , not harming us , including getting medeors out of our way .
I may be open minded but it all falls into place .
Its very interesting ,
Take Care ,

I am very convinced that this is the case .
what you postulate is highly probable .
the idea of GOD as many conceive it ( omnipotent whole and one ) is just an abstract like the rest of the scriptures ; subject to interpretation .
still I cannot conclude the purpose of installing a device like religion .
For our enlightenment and conscious development , or for the ETs anonymous existence .
the ET s are referred to as the fallen ones -- rebelling against the harmony - possibly seeking to be gods through knowledge -- POLYTHEISM .
but then why Moses , why the order to worship the one GOD ? is this helping the ETs become anonymous , or is this a clue from beyond the ETs veil of illusion .
There is an idea that Consciousness gets ever bigger and ever smaller within the universe .
IT IS ALSO HIGHLY PROBABLE that there are conscious entities living an existence on a much grander scale than we are .
the Sun could be a conscious entity living a radically different existence .
Could this be the one GOD .
a consciousness so vast that its bodied is the milky way galaxy .
IF the ETs installed religions then why the many -- why the subject to interpretation --- why not the absolute truth - - if its for our own good that is .
I think the ETs are crafty , but they are not GODS , not even close .
A GOD or the GOD is something on a scale far beyond what we can perceive -- living in a multidimensional ( hyperspacial ) existence that we are a part of .
I like to say that THE TRUTH can always be found within the connection ( similarity ) of the micro and macrocosmic aspects .
A human is a whole made of many parts -- and the individual parts experience a radically different existence than the whole .
same goes for the earth .
the galaxy .
the universe .
Each individual cell in an organism performs all the same functions that the whole body can perform .
Each atom ( not really tangible - - but quanta ) performs all the same functions as the solar system performs ( I believe to be composed of wave forms -- nothing is truly tangible ) .
to rap it up because this is getting long ....... I think ETs are out there -- they are here right now --- but they are not GOD .
I think GOD is out there --- and GOD is here right now --- but GOD composition ( parts ) is so immense that we cannot conceive GOD as we conceive ourselves .
What if the Aliens are connected to a different GOD than us Humans and are trying to undermine The GOD we are ( a piece of ) connected to ?
What if our behavior as a species ( fighting for diversified religions in the name of god ) is a microcosmic reflection of what is happening on a bigger level --- GOD fighting Other GODs , or dare I say -- GOD fighting ITself .
I say , put an ET at a desk in the United nations !
that would be the day !

I like your theories on mankind , although to some they may seem far fetched you need to keep an open mind .
I myself do n't believe in god but evolution .
but that does n't say that it started evolving on earth or even that it was created naturally .
Dean 15 - Nov-2005
No major commentary here .
I just want to say that I think you ’re on the right track .
People refuse to think deeper than their respective religions taught or allow them to .

Very well written opinion .
I too have had the same thoughts about the subject of religion and how it may or may not tie into aliens .
I have studied a lot of religions as well in search of answers of why or how .
Here 's an example of people giving form to something they cant explain .
If in fact aliens have come to earth people would not have known how to explain these beings so they gave them the status of GOD , but then again what is a god ?
Anything that is a higher form of life than we are ?
recently there have been slaughters of cattle in Mexico and no one can explain who or what is killing the cattle so here comes the explanation , " chupacabre " no one has ever seen one of these creatures but because they lack the knowledge of what is killing the cattle they invent a killer to appease themselves .
Once again very well written thoughts and should you like to talk further please contact me .

I just want to comment on this article that it is one of the best in its kind .
Thank you all for taking the time to create such great work .

I think that you answered the biggest question everyone asks about UFO’s .
Why are they here , why have n’t they contacted us ?
I have only recently begun giving any credence to aliens and UFO ’s , and those were my major questions .
The most obvious answer to me was very similar to yours .
We are trigger - happy barbarians with no respect for life whatsoever .
Until we evolve past this archaic age of an eye for an eye , I do n’t think we have a chance of having formal communication with interstellar neighbors .
I often wondered if religion was their way of trying to give us the basic rules of how to behave in a civilized society , and we just did not understand , or accept it .
Thanks for the article .
It was very well written .

Hi , My Name Is Michael and I just finished reading Hans ' article entitled : " Did Aliens Bring Religion to Earth ? " and I could n't have wrote a better article or explained it better than he did !
I have been trying to put together in the most simplest , rational , elementary words a way to explain my concept of how and why religion exists and how and why we exist and without getting long winded , ( or perhaps long worded would be a better way to say it ) , it would seem to me that he has read my mind .
I am sure there is a reason why I have come across this at this time in my life but I want to say Thank You ! and Bravo ! for a well put together concept of aliens and religion .
I am sure at this point if I were to write this down or publish such an article I would find it very difficult to put it in any better way than Hans has written and I would n't want to be accused of copying someone else 's work .
I would like to know if anyone has permission to use Hans ' article freely or is special permission needed .
I am not a professional writer so I am unclear on copyright issues and would appreciate your help in clarifying this request as soon as you are able .
Again Thank You Hans for this great great and well written article !
Sincerely ,
Michael 8 - Sep -2006
Great stuff on Ezekiel .
Did you here of the raelians , there are a new religious movement that speaks on extraterrestrial life and stuff exactly like you are , Awesome stuff .
I did't know if you know this but , in the hebrew texts it says elohim created the heavens and the earth .
Not God ! elohim in hebrew means gods .
But they are human like us , let us create man , behold man has become like one of us , all that , including Ezekiel .
they were mistaken for angels , or aliens .
But in fact , they are scientists since they created life , and hope soon we can become like them in creating .
Yahweh was actually their leader on another planet , who helped them create life also .
How primitive the church is to say there is n't any other life out there , when Ezekiel proves it , genesis proves it , acts 10:30 and moses seeing God 's back parts ?
I thought a spirit does n't have a body ?
lol .
And how can heaven be on a cloud ?
when clouds are made of vapour !
it is obviosly on the elohim 's planet , whom they choose to re-create if good .
if wicked people , dust they shall return , and be forgotten forever .
They are the elohim , and are coming soon .
Do research if you want .
COUNT ON IT .
Your parents will be re-created on their planet for speaking the truth about their creators .
peace be upon them .

I have read this and was like wow I have been saying this for years only to the laughter of my friends but it is the same as I believe .
I just hope to live long enough to be proven right .
Trevor 13 - Nov-2007 Hi ;
I stumbled across your article and wanted to comment briefly .
Before I talk about this subject any further I would like to distinguish between what I believe and what I consider a strong possibility ...
Belief to me implies a personal philosophy , religion or spiritual guidance people receive and which governs their lives as human beings .
I think this article while fascinating and satisfying an intense human curiosity ... , should not be the basis for one 's beliefs and that person 's approach towards life in human society .
If it was then I would never be able to sleep well at night .
At the same time I do not dismiss these theories as pure fiction .
I do strongly believe that there is a strong measure of truth to what Hans is suggesting in his article .
I question his conspiracy theory approach though .
As someone very successfully treated for bipolar disorder which I have lived with the last 9 years of my life , I can tell you first - hand that I have experienced the flood of emotions and fears during some of my manic episodes in which I believed a nearly identical set of beliefs which Hans is describing here in his article .
Over time I learned to put these thoughts into perspective .
I did not dismiss them entirely , but I realized that in order to live as a productive and well adjusted member of society , that I would have to put these ideas into an acceptable context that I could live with .
A context which gives me peace and at the same time promotes a healthy level of curiosity and scientific discovery into the paranormal .
I needed to weave these experiences and theories into my faith in such a way that I could leave all the worrying and paranoia behind and believe that God " The Supreme Being " can reach each and every one of us and reassure us if know how to look for it .
I can strongly agree with Hans ' suggestion that highly advanced extra-terrestrial entities after observing humanity over thousands of years would conclude that it would be dangerous and disruptive to our world if they were to manifest themselves openly .
If you 're a Star Trek fan , you undoubtedly heard of Starfleet command 's " prime directive " or " 1st General Order " .
It reads , " It is forbidden to interfere with the normal development of any culture or society .
All losses are tolerated as long as they are necessary to observe this General Order . "
Sound familiar ?
Actually if you read through the entire list of Starfleet directives you 'll see that Gene Roddenberry and co were really way ahead of their time were n't they ? :)
Imagination is a healthy thing but it can go too far .
One man 's imagination can be put to good creative use writing a story for a sci- fi blockbuster movie while someone else 's can lead to madness ...
I just want to say that I believe in a divine order .
I will go out on a limb and say that I believe in aliens that are advanced enough to visit our planet and communicate their intentions and influence human history through highly advanced cognitive methods .
However I also believe that God , " The Supreme Being " has dominion over these beings and all orders of intelligent life below and above .
And I believe that on some level these beings if in fact they exist acknowledge a Supreme Being as well .
And that is ultimately my point .
Is that God is not an all - knowing scientist .
God is an artist .
As long as you live your life benevolently and not be counted with the self - righteous and self - destructive religious people you can sleep soundly at night .

In the jewish holy bible called the Torah it is written in Gen 1:1 in the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the Earth .
Elohim in hebrew means Mighty one /s in other words " those that came from the sky "
The Elohim are a race of Aliens that created us !
They also created other beings and put them on other planets .
Why ?
Because the Elohim love to create .
Yahweh is the name of chief scientist of this race of aliens which most people today call GOD .
And God ( Elohim ) is a God or being of Love who loves to create life and many other things to !
read the book " intelligent design message from the designers " on this website http://www.raelianews.org/news.php.
Yes , Yahsuha which in English is Jesus was part Alien or should i say part Elohim .
Please write back and tell what you think !

Before reading this article I found a first hand account of an alien abduction .
It really opened my eyes and clarified many of my inquiries of religion and extraterrestrial visitations ...
Not to mention totally blew my mind !
21 - May - 2008
The article written by Hans was truly beautiful to read and very eye - opening .
The ideas he wrote about have been going through my head a lot lately , and it has often made me wonder why people can believe in some faceless
God yet not believe in alien life ?
It makes sense , due to evolution , that aliens would be millions of years older than us and thus very highly advanced .
It also makes sense that , in a way , the aliens created us and are monitoring us .
This explains so much that it seems irritating others can not grasp it .
I just wanted Hans ' son to know , if ever he gets to read this feedback , that his father will always be considered a pioneer of real truth in my heart .
His message needed to be said and I strongly believe in what he wrote .
His father 's memory will also always be remembered by those who carry those beliefs with them .
Thank you Hans for a wonderful article ... it saved me and reinforced my faith in alien life .

Most politicians and religious leaders are members of secret societies .
Masonry and the Vatican control the power of the world .
These societies and the Vatican practice satanism .
They have created international terrorism with the purpose of creating the third World War .
They want to make it appear that all conflicts have been caused by conflicts and divisions between world countries and religions to establish a one world government and religion ruled by a leader who will claim to be the prophesied Messiah and to rule by divine authority .
They will quote Bible verses to deceive people into thinking this is the Kingdom of God , and they will make all kind of signs and wonders .
The UFO phenomenon and New Age Movement have been created for this purpose .
This is the kingdom of the beast prophesied in the Bible in which all nations will gather .
All people will worship the beast and all true followers of Yeshua will be persecuted .
The aliens are fallen angels and hybrids , the gods worshipped by the ancient civilizations .
Of course they will present great benefits to the population and they will relase new technologies and promises of peace and prosperity but do not believe their lies , this will be a fascist government , where all the people will be implanted with mind control chips and the useless eaters put to death .
But their days are numbered and his kingdom is a passing illusion .
They have planted many lies to keep us away from the truth .
God is not of any religion or denomination , because all are controlled and have substituted God because they claim to be the Truth , the Way and the Life .
God is in our heart and teaches us individually , we must only understand and do what He commands .
The Only Way is Yahshua the Messiah .
What the majority believes is always the lie .
Where the carcass is ( false Christ ) , the vultures will gather ( multitudes ) .
GHAZNI , Afghanistan ( Reuters ) - The Taliban have warned Afghans that possessing pictures of “ unrelated women and handsome boys ” was against Islamic law and owning “ shiny new phones ” runs contrary to their religious dignity .
The Taliban have been posting “ night letters ” in the volatile southeastern province of Ghazni , reminding Afghans of their religious obligations and reiterating warnings that they will attempt to disrupt crucial presidential elections on Aug. 20 .
In a restatement of the Taliban ’s austere interpretation of Islam , one letter warned people , especially the young , against using hi-tech gadgets such as cell phones with photography and video functions .
“ People with camera cellphones must not have pictures of unrelated women and handsome boys in their phones , which is against Islamic sharia , ” reads one letter , obtained by Reuters on Monday .
Sharia is Islamic religious law .
“ People should think of their Afghan dignity rather than buying shiny phones , ” it said .
Mobile telephones also should not have “ immoral video clips ” , ring tones with verses of the Koran , or derogatory messages against individuals or tribes .
It regarded such offences as “ a serious crime ” that would be punished severely , the letter said .
The “ night letters ” have been springing up overnight in mosques and on the walls of Ghazni villages since last Friday .
The Taliban also warned voters in Ghazni to stay home from the day before the Aug. 20 election or face serious consequences .
With attacks escalating across Afghanistan in recent weeks , the Taliban ’s leaders last week vowed to disrupt the poll , urging voters to boycott the ballot and “ join the trenches of jihad ” .
The letters in Ghazni have even been distributed by hand in one district , telling voters polling stations will be targeted .
“ In order that this illegitimate process faces failure , the fighters will intensively attack polling centres , and ( we ) warn voters to stay home one day before , ” read another letter .
The use of “ night letters ” and similar threats are a common tactic in the south and east , long Taliban strongholds .
WORSENING VIOLENCE
Attacks across Afghanistan this year had already reached their worst level since U.S. - led Afghan forces toppled the Taliban in 2001 and have risen further since U.S. and British troops launched offensives in southern Helmand last month .
The election , Afghanistan ’s second direct vote since 2001 , is consequently being fought against a backdrop of increased violence despite thousands of extra U.S. troops being poured into the country this year , in part to secure the poll .
The letters were distributed in Ghazni ’s Qara Bagh district , the same area where Taliban insurgents ambushed a convoy of campaigners working for President Hamid Karzai on Saturday .
One bodyguard was killed .
One district official , who asked not to be identified , said such letters could have a big influence on residents even though most cannot read or write .
“ People just obey the Taliban no matter what the letters say , ” he said .
The Aug. 20 poll is seen as a critical test of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s new regional strategy to defeat the Taliban and secure Afghanistan , as well as of Kabul ’s ability to stage credible and legitimate elections .
San Francisco Police Inspector " Dirty " Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) and his new partner , Earlington " Early " Smith ( Felton Perry ) have been temporarily reassigned from Homicide to Stakeout Duty .
Meanwhile , those of the city 's criminals who manage to avoid punishment by the courts are nevertheless being killed by unknown assassins .
Callahan begins to investigate the murders despite orders from his superior officer , Lieutenant Neil Briggs ( Hal Holbrook ) .
A man has to know his limitations .

CAMP LEATHERNECK , Afghanistan – The Marines in southern Afghanistan have largely left the roads , to avoid improvised bombs .
But they 're still getting hit as they carve tracks through the desert .
Now a reporter - turned - lieutenant may have found at least a partial answer : off - the - shelf GPS units , combined with a British tactic from the counterinsurgency in Northern Ireland .
Former Wall Street Journal reporter Matt Pottinger came up with the answer earlier this year , working for the Marines ' Combat Logistics Battalion 3 , based out of Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province .
The battalion was driving as much as 110 kilometers off - road to resupply outlying bases .
To keep from getting attacked , they tried to vary their paths through the desert .
But the Taliban always seemed to know where they were going to be next .
So Pottinger hooked the battalion 's vehicles up with commercial Garmin GPS trackers , to record where they were driving .
After a few runs , he plotted the routes on top of military - imagery databases .
" You ’d get this spaghetti network of track , and they 'd converge in these places , " he says .
Turns out the Marines were n't changing up their routes nearly as much as they thought they were .
Small , almost imperceptible changes in the terrain were forcing the battalion 's vehicles into natural choke points .
Near the town of Jamal Ghar , for example , there appeared to be nearly 3 kilometers between a mountain and an irrigation ditch .
But Pottinger saw that all the vehicles were driving right on top of each other ; most of those 3 kilometers was taken up by farmland .
The Taliban had a natural point where they could plant bombs .
And they did , attacking the Marines repeatedly .
Once the battalion realized they were going through ambush points , they began sending bomb - clearance teams to sweep the area for explosives .
They found 69 percent of the bombs that were in their path .
And they set up sniper teams , to target any militants looking to set an ambush .
Pottinger calls the tracks " honesty traces . "
It 's a term he borrowed from the British .
Troops on patrol in Northern Ireland used tracing paper to sketch out where their vehicles were driving – and getting hit by the IRA .
By anticipating the patterns they themselves were making , they could anticipate the attacks , too .
" It 's simple , Hansel - and - Gretel - type s**t .
Just leaving breadcrumbs .
Amazingly , no one was doing it , " he says .
The Marines already had military - grade GPS terminals in their Humvees .
But those " Blue Force Trackers " could n't record a vehicle 's route .
So he turned to the commercial GPS units instead .
Now , at least two other battalions have purchased similar units .
They , too , are running " honesty traces . "

Just got back from an excellent time at Bridge Pedal .
Peter Koonce and family
rolling up to the Broadway
Bridge .
I did n’t do as much riding on the course as I usually do , but from what I saw , it was a very smooth event .
This is the first year I can recall not seeing any bad crashes on the notorious downhill sections .
I also did n’t notice any bottlenecks or major congestion points .
I started with the 11 Bridgers early this morning .
It was a thrill gliding down I -405 through Northwest Portland and then joining with the 8 Bridge riders just prior to the Marquam Bridge .
My trip in the helicopter was exhilarating and something I ’ll never forget .
It was awesome to see so many people waving ( I event recognized several of you and wanted to shout … but then realized how silly that would have been ) , and seeing all the highways and bridges free of cars and filled with bikes was inspirational beyond words .
After the chopper ride I melded in with the 6 Bridgers .
What a great group of people !
So many kids and families and older folks .
I think Bridge Pedal really nailed it this year by keeping much of the families and kids totally separate from the 8 and 11 Bridge rides .
Big crowds at start
of 11 Bridge Ride .
Seeing little ones ride carefree on the carfree roads and bridges always warms my heart .
And how about that Hawthorne Bridge !?
It was so great to see a full lane taken up by people on bikes … sort of makes you wonder what that would be like in real life , does n’t it ?
I ran into Bridge Pedal staffer Sarah Bailen - Smith at the rest stop near Widmer Brewery and she was pumped .
I think the big high - 5 she gave me pretty much summed up how she felt about the day .
I only heard two bits of downer news .
A friend of mine said that a 7 - year old kid had lost his grandpa and — Mr. Bridge Pedal himself , Rick Baumann — reported that vandals had tipped a few porta-potties .
But on a ride with upwards of 20,000 people that shuts down the city for half - a - day , it ’s pretty amazing how it all comes together .
How was your ride ?
Did you see anything interesting / amazing / memorable ?
While you think about it , sit back and watch the slideshow below ( or browse the gallery ) .

Advertisement Police in Peru have fired tear gas to disperse protesters blocking a highway near Pisco - the southern town that was ravaged by an earthquake in 2007 .
The demonstrators were denouncing what they said was a lack of action on the part of the government of President Alan Garcia to rebuild the town .
More than 500 people were killed and some 75,000 homes destroyed in the region by the 8.0 - magnitude earthquake .
But two years later , many people in the region still live in tents and shacks .
' Desperation and anger '
On Saturday , riot police used tear gas to disperse protesters who had blocked a section of the Pan - American highway leading to Pisco .
Demonstrators pelted police with stones .
There is still grief in the town but also desperation and anger directed at the government for what many see as its failure to deliver on promises of a rapid reconstruction , the BBC's Dan Collyns reports from Pisco .
Only 25 % of the planned reconstruction has taken place in Pisco , the worst - hit town in the area , our correspondent says .
Some 40,000 people in the region are still living in tent cities or one - room pre-fabricated shacks .
Many local residents say millions of dollars in reconstruction funds have never reached them , accusing officials of corruption and inefficiency .
" The president [ Alan Garcia ] and the [ Pisco ] mayor are all liars .
They have n't done anything , " local resident Nilda Solis Miranda was quoted as saying by Reuters .
Fellow resident Aria Loayzo said : " All the streets are destroyed .
There are no completed homes .
There is n't a good administration for the donations of money sent from other countries for our province . "
Mr Garcia , who has seen his approval rating drop to under 30 % in recent weeks , had promised a speedy rebuilding of the region after the quake .
Peru 's fourth housing minister in three years , Francis Allison , admitted there had been mistakes and said some regional authorities had been working incredibly slowly .
Meanwhile , town mayors insist they never received government money promised to rebuild basic infrastructure and homes .

In Berlin last year I had the honour of meeting Jennifer Lyon Bell , an American filmmaker with a compelling vision for erotic film .
Her film Matinee is a gorgeous work of art , well written , masterfully acted and beautifully filmed .
It is a wonderful addition to the growing canon of well - made , female - focused erotic films and I consider it to be part of the new wave of sex - positive movies that are forging a new path in porn .
Naturally this means the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification has banned it .
Matinee was due to screen as part of the Melbourne Underground Film Festival over the weekend but the OFLC told MUFF it would be illegal to show the film in public , effectively banning it .
The film has not been officially classifed by the panel ; they merely made a brief decision based on … well , I ’m not sure what .
They have n’t actually seen the film .
They found out it had real sex in it and that was enough , I suspect .

MUFF and Jennifer have issued statements regarding the decision and they ’re currently on the front page of the MUFF site .
The organisers rightly point out that the OFLC did n’t have a problem with Lars Van Trier ’s Antichrist , which disturbingly depicts a scene of female genital mutilation and seems to be misogynist in intent .
Jen ’s film , which only shows two people having nuanced , meaningful , tender sex , is apparently more offensive than that .
MUFF says :
MUFF opposes the OFLC ’s decision on the grounds that it represents a hypocritical and troubling suppression of transgressive female - centric sexuality on film .
The modus operandi of Blue Artichoke Films , Bell ’s production company , is to create films which portray realistic sexual intimacy , depict empowered female characters , possess artistic merit and strong narratives , and do not fall back upon the damaging and often dangerous stereotypes of female sexuality that the Western media is accustomed to .
In other words , Bell is looking to produce films about sexuality which women can enjoy , free of masculine control .
MUFF are considering a “ civil disobedience ” screening as a way of protesting this ridiculous decision .
Jen writes :
Seriously ?
It ’s just two characters enjoying sex in a realistic way that fits with their characters ’ personalities .
Consensual sex , nothing weird .
Why on earth would that be dangerous to watch ?
What ’s weird is that mainstream movies spend hours building up the characters in a story , then mangle the lovescene with brusque camera cutaways and awkward sheet - covering bedroom choreography as soon as the moment arrives .
You never see James Bond have sex ; after a few witty double entendres it ’s fade - out then fade - up with a lit cigarette … and this is considered a perfectly acceptable depiction of sex on film .
Frankly , I ’d like to know more about how James Bond does it .
Is he a true sexual connoisseur , able to quickly divine each woman ’s preferences and feel from her subtle reactions whether she wants her G - spot stroked or her hands deliciously pinned to the bed ?
Or is he an arrogant Casanova who uses some weird abrasive “ patented technique ” on every woman he sleeps with , smugly congratulating himself “ They all love it when I do that ” ?
I ’d like the movie better as a whole because it ’d tell me a lot about who he is .
Plus , if he was good , it ’d be really fun to watch , would n’t it ?
The films that inspired me to mix explicit sex with story and character – Ken Park , 9 Songs , Shortbus – have all had rough roads .
But I hoped that outside of America , my loving but prudish home country , everything would be easier .
As it turns out , New York was no problem at all , and neither was Amsterdam ( my current home ) .
Strasbourg and Berlin festivals are happily screening it this fall .
But Australia has a problem .
It ’s depressing but not surprising that Matinee has been banned .
It ’s becoming increasingly apparent that our country ’s ridiculous censorship laws are applied in an ad hoc manner and that they are out of touch with what most Australians think .
How is it that grown adults are prevented from seeing a film because it contains sex ?
And why are n’t we up in arms about this ?
There are no reports in the major newspapers about this issue .
I ’m hoping to contact Margaret Pomeranz for a statement on where she stands with this .
She was willing to be arrested for Ken Park in 2003 … will she also speak out for Matinee ?
Find out more about Matinee and Jennifer at the Blue Artichoke Films site .
Edit : Tony Comstock gives his view on the issue here .
If any of you knew anything about this car you 'd realize that it needs to be up in the air , and the belly pan ( which covers the entire underbelly of the car ) needs to be removed .
It 's not a one man job until you get that off .
You'd be better invested in a car lift and offer the neighbor a beer to help .
I 'm sure they would n't mind for a GT .
Yeah , like most VW / Audi dealers it 's just a check ripoff that any lamebrain can do themselves .
You 'll pay them to check your tire pressure ?
Come on .. you have to really be incompetent or not care about your car .
As for the $ 1.5 k for the timing job on a TDI , that 's a ripoff too .
I 've had the Porsche dealer do a 2.7 A6 for $ 750 - the works .
This place had a carrera GT in the bay also .
Taking the front end off is easy , messing the timing up will be too .

On the right of resistance " by Ramzi Kysia
We live in an era defined by its brutality .
Our challenge is whether to accept this - or to take the risks necessary to transform our world .
A year ago , 44 people from 17 countries sailed to Gaza in two small wooden boats .
We did what the world would not do - we broke through the siege of Gaza .
Over the last year , the Free Gaza Movement organized seven more voyages , successfully arriving to Gaza five times .
Ours remain the only international ships to reach the Gaza Strip in over forty - two years .
But it is only the beginning of attempts to resist the brutal occupation of Gaza .
It 's been more than six months since the end of Israel 's murderous assault on the Gaza Strip .
They killed over 1,400 Palestinians including 400 children .
The continuing failure of the international community to enforce its own laws and protect the people of Gaza demands that we , as private citizens , nonviolently intervene .
We must act because our governments refuse to do so .
So , join the Free Gaza Movement , the International Solidarity Movement , and the BDS Movement .
Join us and other campaigns in the struggle for justice for Palestine .
Become part of the resistance .

On the Right of Resistance
Written by Ramzi Kysia | 27 July 2009
" If you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . "
- Desmond Tutu
We live in an era defined by its brutality .
Our challenge is whether to accept this - or to take the risks necessary to transform our world commons in beloved community .
A year ago this August , forty - four ordinary people from seventeen different countries sailed to Gaza in two , small wooden boats .
We did what the world would not do - we broke through the siege of Gaza .
Over the last year the Free Gaza Movement has organized seven more voyages , successfully arriving to Gaza on five separate occasions .
Ours remain the only international ships to reach the Gaza Strip in over forty - two years .
In the Middle - East , the struggle for justice is an uncertain endeavour in the best of times .
On all sides human rights workers are beset with difficulties and distress .
The Arab states are tyrannies , their peoples subject to secret police , arbitrary arrest , torture , and oppression .
Within their societies , the Arab world is equally fractured by ethnic and class tensions , poverty , and political stagnation .
From the outside , from the West , the Middle - East faces both open and covert acts of intimidation , intervention , economic destabilization , and even war , invasion , and mass killings .
Standing astride all these troubles , blocking near every attempt at progress in the region are the twin colossi of big oil and Israel .
Seldom have a people been cursed with burdens more bitter , more devastating , and seemingly more intransigent than have the Arabs with oil and Israel .
Nowhere is this truer today than in Gaza .
In 1999 , British Gas discovered huge natural gas fields , worth billions of dollars , in Palestinian territorial waters off the coast of Gaza .
Israel has already built a horizontal pipeline to siphon off gas from at least one of these fields .
If there is an unspoken reason for the siege of Gaza - this is it .
Israel maintains effective control of all points of entry and exit to Gaza , as well as de facto control of Gaza�s revenues and economy .
As such , and despite the closure of settlements in Gaza in 2005 , Israel remains an occupying power in Gaza as in the rest of Palestine .
As an occupying power , Israel is responsible for the well - being of the people it occupies and cannot legally impose a blockade , particularly one the collectively punishes the entire population of Gaza .
These are clear crimes and the Israeli government and military should be prosecuted for them .
For the last three and a half years the Israeli siege has become increasingly ruthless .
Less than twenty percent of normal trade is allowed into Gaza today .
The siege has caused the local economy to collapse , leading to steep increases in unemployment , poverty and childhood malnutrition rates .
Because of Israel�s siege there is little fuel to run Gaza�s power plant - so electricity is scarce and intermittent .
Without electricity , water and sanitation systems do not function .
On March 27 , 2008 two elderly women in their 70s , a teenage girl , and two babies were killed by a flood of sewage in Umm Naser .
Last year alone , well over 16 billion litres of raw sewage had to be dumped in the sea , turning the Mediterranean into a toilet and creating a public health disaster .
Gaza is a tiny coastal plain , barely twenty - five miles long by four to seven miles wide .
It does not have the ability to independently support the one and a half million human beings who live in one of the most densely populated places on the planet .
Two - thirds of Gaza�s people are refugees , driven out of historical Palestine during Israel�s founding war in 1948 .
Over half the population are children .
Israel has a long history of violence against Palestinian children .
A few examples :
In December 2004 , the IDF shot and killed seven - year old Rana Siyam .
Earlier that year , nine - year old Raghda Alassar was shot and killed in her school while she was taking an English test .
Thirteen - year old Iman al - Hams was shot seventeen times by the IDF as she was walking home after class in Gaza .
An Israeli captain went up to her corpse and shot her again in the head � " dead - checking " the schoolgirl .
The IDF prosecuted him , but not for murder .
He was charged with " illegal use of his weapon , " and - despite admitting that he emptied his entire magazine into a little girl - he was found " not guilty . "
Over the summer of 2006 , the IDF killed three - year old Bara Habib , three - year old Rajaa Abu Shaban , six - year old Rawan Hajjah , nine - year old Aya Salmeya , and over thirty - five other children just in Gaza alone .
On January 16th , 2007 , the IDF killed ten - year old Abir Aramin , the daughter of a Palestinian peace activist , as she was walking home from school .
These are only a handful of cases .
The Israeli human rights organization B'tselem estimates that over 900 Palestinian children were killed by the Israeli military between 2000 and 2008 .
Israel has already recreated the worst aspects of the Warsaw Ghetto in Gaza - transforming this small strip of land into the world�s largest open - air prison , and the humanitarian condition of the one and a half million men , women , and children illegally incarcerated in Gaza is now at its worst point in the last forty - two years of Israeli occupation .
But there are darker histories waiting to be reborn .
The simple and terrifying truth is that Israel is pushing the world on a path towards genocide .
We are all en route to the slow - drip destruction of the Palestinian people .
This reality must be forcefully confronted and fully overcome before it�s too late .
It 's now been more than six months since the end of Israel 's latest assault on the Gaza Strip , which led to the killing of over 1,400 Palestinians , and the people of Gaza are still living in rubble .
Israel 's hermetic closure has created a man-made and deliberately - sustained humanitarian catastrophe .
The continuing failure of the international community to enforce its own laws and protect the people of Gaza demands that we as private citizens directly intervene to take action commensurate with the crisis .
We must act because our governments refuse to do so .
Regardless of Israeli threats or intimidation , Free Gaza volunteers intend to continue sailing unarmed boats to Gaza .
Now more than ever � we need the people of the world to join with us .
The siege of Gaza only serves to strengthen authoritarian structures on all sides of this conflict , entrenching centralized control , rallying people against a common enemy .
The isolation of Gaza reinforces a belief that the world has forgotten Palestine , and little cares how Palestinians are forced to live or even whether they live or die .
In contrast , civil resistance and citizens � action movements are not only aimed against the injustices that we face - they are also strategies for social change .
Nonviolent resistance empowers everyone with the knowledge that any among us can reach out , organize , and act to change the entire world .
Time and again , history demonstrates that even the greatest of tyrannies can crumble to the ground when confronted with an organized and determined resistance .
Join us , whether in whole or in part .
Join the Free Gaza Movement , the International Solidarity Movement , and the BDS Movement .
Join us and other campaigns in the struggle for justice for Palestine .
We need volunteers to do research and writing , web updates , translation , graphic design , local organizing in their communities , and much more .
Become part of the resistance .
We are often told that resistance is either unwarranted or impossible .
Liberal apologists for Israel , such as Thomas Friedman , are constantly demanding that Palestinians lay down their arms , all the while exhorting Israelis to pick them up in ever increasing acts of violence and degradation .
When faced with violence in our world , our elites tell us that we have two - and only two - choices : capitulate to the violence , or go to war .
Of course , which of these two choices is the right and proper course of action depends on who you are .
Faced with Palestinian violence , Israelis must , rightly and properly , go to war .
Faced with Israeli violence , Palestinians must , rightly and properly , capitulate .
In Tel Aviv and Washington D.C. this is called " moral clarity : " the supposed necessity of pursuing Israeli security through deliberately creating massive insecurity among Palestinians .
This is lunacy .
But even mainstream " peace " movements in the West try to delegitimize resistance by calling on both Palestinians and Israelis to renounce overt acts of violence , equating Palestinians who commit suicide bombings with Israelis who send F - 16s , D9 military bulldozers , and Apache attack helicopters to level entire neighborhoods .
The problem is that the usually random and individual acts of violence by Palestinians against Israelis are not equal to the myriad structural oppressions and cruelties imposed on Palestinians through Israeli government policies .
No Palestinian fighter jets bomb Israeli cities - because Palestine has no fighter jets .
No Palestinian bulldozers demolish Israeli homes - because Palestine has no military bulldozers .
No Palestinian soldiers invade Israeli neighbourhoods , terrorizing the populace - because there is no Palestinian army .
The conflict in Palestine is a war of Israeli state terror against a largely unarmed and defenceless civilian population .
Even immoral and self - defeating acts of violence against Israeli civilians ( such as some suicide bombings are ) cannot be equated with the daily humiliations , terror , and death that Israel inflicts on Palestinians by deliberate policy .
Contrary to its presentation in the mainstream media , this conflict is neither a righteous war against evil Arab terrorists , nor a religious or ethnic dispute between two opposing and equally self - justified groups of people .
The Israeli / Palestinian conflict is the struggle of two irreconcilable and unequal causes : the struggle of an oppressed people for freedom , justice , and self - determination against their oppressors � struggle to maintain ( and even expand ) their domination .
Under these circumstances resistance is not only a right - it's a moral imperative .
This is not to say that any and all acts of resistance are acceptable .
Clearly they are not .
But it grows tedious to continually hear well - meaning , but otherwise clueless , Westerners try to equate the two sides of this conflict .
I am past tired of hearing white people passively whine , or shrilly demand , " Where is the Palestinian Gandhi ? "
With respect , just because some people have chosen to remain ignorant of the long and deep history of Palestinian nonviolent resistance - from the 1936 Boycott to Bil�in today - does not mean that it does not exist .
The Free Gaza Movement struggles in solidarity with an already vibrant Palestinian civil resistance .
Similarly , the other criticism of resistance - that it is futile - is equally mistaken .
There is a widespread delusion among many that Israel and the Israeli lobby are simply too powerful to be challenged , let alone defeated .
This is not the case .
On June 30th 2009 Israeli Occupation Forces forcibly boarded one of our boats , the SPIRIT OF HUMANITY , and kidnapped 21 human rights workers and journalists who were on their way to deliver much needed humanitarian and reconstruction supplies to besieged Gaza , including Nobel peace prize laureate Mairead Maguire and former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney .
They were held in jail for a week before being deported .
Though we were stopped on this particular voyage , it was not a " failure . "
In the month after our boat was hijacked , over 100,000 news stories , essays , blog entries , action alerts , and radio and television segments were made on Israel�s violent response to our mission .
It �s true that the ordeal of our 21 volunteers pales in comparison to the 11,000 Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli prisons .
The seizure of our small cargo of 3 tons of medical aid and reconstruction kits is insignificant in light of the $ 4 billion ( USD ) of aid promised to Gaza - aid that has not and will not be delivered because of the Israeli blockade .
But that too misses the point .
By choosing to violently confront and kidnap unarmed human rights workers on a mission of mercy , Israel publicly demonstrated both the illegality and the absurdity of the Gaza siege .
The siege is abjectly not about " security . "
No one could possibly have believed that our small boat was a physical threat to Israel ,
This public demonstration of the siege�s illegality resulted in record action at the governmental level as well .
Both the Irish and Greek governments formally intervened to protect their citizens and property .
Despite having no diplomatic relationship and refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Israel 's government - the King of Bahrain personally & successfully intervened to force Israel to immediately release the five Bahraini human rights workers kidnapped from the SPIRIT .
The British parliament held a formal debate on the issue , and even the U.S. State Department was forced to hold a national conference call on for family and friends of the kidnap victims , as well as for Arab - American civil rights groups .
This was unprecedented , but it�s not enough .
The Free Gaza Movement started our small part in this struggle in 2006 .
We began on hope alone .
Many thought it couldn�t be done , yet we did it .
We broke through the Israeli blockade .
We will sail again , and we are absolutely determined to reach the Gaza Strip on our next voyage .
We intend to non-violently escalate our response .
By sending a cargo ship , we will escalate the challenge to the blockade by bringing in significant amounts of banned reconstruction materials .
By sending more boats on our next mission , we will significantly escalate the logistical difficulties Israel faces should they decide to violently attack us again .
By sending even more parliamentarians , dignitaries , journalists , and human rights workers to accompany the boats , we will significantly escalate the political difficulties Israel faces should they decide to violently attack us again .
The journey to Gaza is dangerous .
The Israeli navy rammed our flagship , the Dignity , when we attempted to deliver medical supplies to Gaza during their vicious assault in December / January .
In June , they hijacked our small boat and kidnapped everyone on board .
Israel has even threatened to open fire on our unarmed ships , rather than allow us to deliver humanitarian and reconstruction supplies to the people of Gaza .
But the risks we take on our voyages are insignificant compared to the risks imposed every day upon the people of Gaza .
The purpose of nonviolent direct action and civil resistance is to take risks - to put ourselves " in the way " of injustice .
We take these risks well aware of what the possible consequences may be .
We do so because the consequences of doing nothing are so much worse .
Any time we allow ourselves to be bullied , every time we pass by an evil and ignore it - we lower our standards and allow our world to be made that much harsher and unjust for us all .
Israel can threaten our boats and passengers - we will keep coming .
Israel can illegally disrupt our communications and navigation systems - we will keep coming .
Israel can open fire around our boats , or attempt to ram and sink them .
Israel can choose to forcibly board and highjack our boats , and abduct our volunteers .
It doesn�t matter .
We will keep coming .
Armed only with the love of justice , and in the rite of resistance - we will go to Gaza again and again and again , until this siege is forever shattered and the people of Gaza have free access to the rest of the world .

Cannabis fights cancer ( Image : Mykel Nicolaou / Rex Features )
Compounds similar to those found in cannabis have been shown to stop prostate cancer cells from multiplying .
Two cannabinoid compounds , JWH -015 and MET , stopped prostate tumour growth in human prostate cells in Petri dishes and also in mice with the disease .
They halted the cell - division cycle and killed the cancer cells , and had the greatest effect on aggressive prostate cancer cell types , which do not respond to hormone treatments .
Some 192,000 men in the US alone are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year , and researchers Inés Díaz - Laviada Marturet at the University of Alcalá , Spain , and her colleagues say the results could offer hope to those affected .
But before you go looking for a dealer , New Scientist answers a few questions .
Does this mean that smoking dope can protect against prostate cancer ?
Advertisement
No .
The findings do not imply that smoking cannabis can prevent or treat prostate cancer .
Even aside from the harm to health that is associated with dope smoking , the cannabinoid compounds that this study tested are synthetic chemicals not found in cannabis plants , so no conclusions about the actual stuff can be drawn .
So if I should n’t smoke cannabis to fight cancer , how can I use cannabinoids ?
The chemicals that have been tested could eventually be used to develop prostate cancer treatments .
These treatments would not be the same as cannabis – they would simply contain cannabis - like chemicals as the active ingredients .
Would cannabis - derived drugs make patients feel stoned ?
No .
No drug developed from these compounds would affect the mind as cannabis use does .
There are two types of receptor in the prostate to which cannabinoid compounds can attach .
Both types are found in the brain but only one is associated with the psychotropic effects of using cannabis .
Díaz - Laviada Marturet ’s research looked specifically at cannabinoid compounds that attach to the CB 2 receptor – the one not associated with psychotropic effects .
Have n’t cannabis chemicals already been found to protect against cancer ?
There is a long list of cancers for which cannabinoids are thought to have a therapeutic benefit .
This list includes leukaemia , lung and colon cancer .
So when will we see cannabis - derived anti-cancer drugs on the market ?
Prostate cancer treatments based on these cannabis chemicals are still a long way from clinical trial .
The chemicals tested have been shown to be effective both in cell cultures and in mice , but a lot more needs to be found out about these chemicals before anti-cancer drugs can be developed .
The Prostate Cancer Charity advises a healthy diet and lifestyle and recommends that as the symptoms of prostate cancer and other prostate problems can be similar , it is important to get a proper diagnosis because other treatments are already available .

Advertisement Finnish police say a ransom demand has been made for a missing Russian - manned cargo vessel , the Arctic Sea .
The demand - which has not been confirmed as genuine - was put to the ship 's Finnish owners , Finland 's National Bureau of Investigation said .
A Finnish radio station said it had been told the 15 crew members ' lives would be at risk if it was not paid .
Mystery surrounds the location of the Arctic Sea , last sighted in the Bay of Biscay on 30 July .
The 4,000 - tonne Maltese - flagged vessel , which had been carrying timber , went off radar after passing through the English Channel .
A recent sighting off Africa 's Cape Verde islands is still to be confirmed .
Click here for a map charting reported sightings of the Arctic Sea
There has been huge speculation over the reason for the ship 's disappearance , ranging from pirates to a mafia dispute to a commercial quarrel .
The matter is being jointly investigated by Finnish , Maltese and Swedish police .
Radar contact with the Arctic Sea was lost after it left the English Channel A Finnish police spokesman , Mikko Paatero , said that he was unable at this stage to say whether the ransom demand made to the ship 's owners , Solchart Management , was genuine .
" The police cannot really speculate , " he said .
" We need to base our investigation on existing criminal reports , and in this case there are reports of hijacking and aggravated blackmail . "
Markku Ranta - Aho , of the National Bureau of Investigation , told Finland 's YLE national radio that the demand was for " a largish amount of money " .
He said he would not give further details or say where the ship might be located for fear of endangering the crew .
Cape Verde officials say they think the ship is 400 nautical miles ( 740 km ) off one of the islands .
But the Russian ambassador to Cape Verde , Alexander Karpushin , said he had not been officially informed of any sighting and told Russia 's RAI news agency the information was " not true " .
A source linked to the Cape Verde coastguard told AFP news agency the Arctic Sea was outside its territorial waters .
The coastguard was informing maritime officials about the ship 's movements , the source said , adding : " When the ship enters our jurisdiction , we will decide in consultation with our partners what actions to take . "
Some reports have put the ship 400 nautical miles north of the Cape Verdean island of Sao Vicente .
French intelligence said it had found a ship matching the Arctic Sea 's description in the area .
The Portuguese military would not confirm one of its planes had flown over the vessel .
Last known contact Carrying timber reportedly worth $ 1.8 m ( £ 1.1 m ) , the Arctic Sea sailed from Finland and had been scheduled to dock in the Algerian port of Bejaia on 4 August .
It would seem that these acts , such as they have been reported , have nothing in common with ' traditional ' acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea
Martin Selmayr
EU Commission
Speculation rife over missing ship
The crew reported being boarded by up to 10 armed men as the ship sailed through the Baltic Sea on 24 July , but the intruders were reported to have left the vessel on an inflatable boat after 12 hours .
There are also reports of the ship being attacked a second time off the Portuguese coast .
However the ship 's operators said they had no knowledge of the incident and Portugal said the ship was never in its territorial waters .
The last known contact with the crew was when the Arctic Sea reported to British maritime authorities as it passed through the Dover Strait .
On Friday , European Union Commission spokesman Martin Selmayr said : " From information currently available it would seem that these acts , such as they have been reported , have nothing in common with ' traditional ' acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea . "

Recently by Gary North : Broken Links in a Chain Letter on Illegal Immigration .
On This Divisive Issue , Trust No One. Verify Everything
For several months , there have been news reports of announcements by bureaucrats in China and politicians in Russia about the need for a new reserve currency to replace the U.S. dollar .
One suggestion : substitute the non-currency known as the SDR ( special drawing rights ) of the non-governmental , non-central bank IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) .
No bureaucrat or politician recommends that his own nation ’s currency replace the dollar .
This is strange , on the face of it .
The United States possesses a unique series of advantages as a result of its reserve currency status .
These include the following :
The government can rely on the Federal Reserve System to create money out of nothing to buy U.S. Treasury debt , and then repay foreign central banks with this newly created counterfeit money .
Americans can buy imported oil in newly created dollars .
There is a huge market for its
Treasury debt ( at about 0 % per annum ) , corporate debt , and even stocks , which foreigners and foreign central banks buy , thereby funding the nation ’s gigantic trade deficit .
The world ’s commodity futures markets are priced in dollars , making it more costly to trade in other currencies .
National governments possess the advantage of being able to pay off their domestic creditors with fiat money .
Why would n’t they all love to do the same to foreign creditors ?
The United States has been doing this since about 1940 .
Why let the United States retain this monopoly of creditor - stiffing ?
I can think of one obvious reason why no politician recommends his nation ’s currency .
The suggestion would be greeted with howls of derisive laughter .
“ Use the [ ] ?
Is he serious ? ”
Then the critics would publish a laundry list of reasons why no one in his right mind would use that nation ’s currency as its primary foreign currency holdings .
The critics would be correct .
The U.S. dollar got its position fair and square : by staying out of World War II until the British government was clearly broke economically .
Hitler then committed the second stupidest political decision of the 20th century : he declared war on the United States on December 11 , 1941 , which he was not obligated to under the Axis defensive pact , since Japan had attacked the U.S.
( The stupidest decision was Hitler ’s decision to attack the USSR in June of 1941 . )
This let the United States enter on the side of Britain , knowing that the U.S. would replace the British Empire as the dominant player in international affairs after the war .
Roosevelt self - consciously scuttled the British Empire , and Truman completed this policy .
( The best book on this is Otto Scott ’s long - neglected masterpiece , The Other End of the Lifeboat , published a quarter century ago by Regnery . )
THEN THERE IS GOLD
There are no reports of any bureaucrat , politician , or central banker who recommends a return to gold as the world ’s reserve currency .
There is a reason for this .
Gold served as the world ’s reserve currency prior to World War I .
It kept national governments and central banks in check .
When they inflated , gold flowed out .
Their monetary bases declined in response to the outflow of gold .
This transferred control over domestic monetary policy to foreign central banks , gold speculators , and foreign currency users , such as commercial bankers and specialists in international trade .
This transferred sovereignty over money from the nation state to international speculators who put their own money at risk for forecasting incorrectly .
They could make large profits by correctly forecasting a nation ’s devaluation of its currency .
When they believed a nation ’s monetary policy was becoming inflationary , they would pull the plug .
They would exchange currency for gold .
Central bankers hated this when it happened to them .
But they put up with this system from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in the summer of 1914 .
Stable money reduced the risks of currency depreciations .
World trade grew rapidly as a result .
Prices were approximately the same in 1914 as they had been in 1815 .
The price of this price stability was the reduction of control over currencies by politicians and central bankers .
This was a political price that politicians always resented .
It interfered with their ability to use newly created money to buy votes and weapons .
No central banker or national political leader is calling for a return to the gold coin standard , where citizens and foreigners can pressure governments to stop their legalized counterfeiting .
Nevertheless , it is possible for the central government of any large trading nation to establish its currency unit as the world ’s primary reserve currency .
The dollar ’s position has not been based on gold since August 15 , 1971 .
On that day , Nixon unilaterally took the United States off the gold - exchange standard .
There would be no more gold sales to foreign governments and central banks at $ 35 per ounce .
I offer this strategy to any national political leader and his successors .
THE CRUCIAL PRESS RELEASE
Let us assume that the head of a central bank decides that his bank will become the next Federal Reserve System : the dominant central bank on earth .
He issues an announcement .
Beginning tomorrow , this central bank of will no longer buy or sell the debt of our government or any other government .
It will also not buy or sell any other form of debt or equity .
We are freezing the bank ’s currency operations .
To verify this , we have created a new Website that makes available all information relating to the bank ’s asset holdings and daily operations .
The bank has shut down its currency - trading desks , domestic and foreign .
The employees have been offered an opportunity to take an early retirement at full pay .
Any of them who refuse the offer will no longer get a pay raise .
They will be assigned the task of answering inquiries by staff members of the Parliament and the media .
The central bank will no longer attempt to influence interest rates , long or short .
Since the bank will no longer buy or sell assets , it has no way to back up its official announcements on what the overnight inter - bank interest rate ought to be .
The central bank will no longer lend to commercial banks that offer collateral .
This policy is permanent .
It will take five to ten years for us to prove this , but prove it we will .
We will fund existing internal operations from the interest received on present holdings .
It is our intention to replace the United States dollar as the world ’s reserve currency .
To prove that we are serious , we have removed all of our gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and had it shipped to our national vault .
This will confirm the rumors to this effect that began six weeks ago .
All that is necessary to establish a currency as the world ’s reserve currency is a central bank that is immune to domestic politics and which follows the press release to the letter on a permanent basis .
The same result could be achieved even more rapidly by a joint press release by the head of the central bank and the Prime Minister .
The news of this press release would have leaked out for weeks .
This would merely confirm the rumors .
THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT
Initially , most investors would not believe the press release .
They would assume that the central bank will buckle , i.e. , knuckle under to government pressure .
The nation would soon be in a recession .
Interest rates would climb .
There would be no counter - cyclical policy .
Commercial banks would go bankrupt .
These would include the largest banks .
The economy would contract .
Labor unions would call strikes .
Production would fall .
Unemployment would rise .
The bad investments that had been made in terms of the assumption of monetary expansion would produce losses .
As banks went under , there would be monetary contraction .
Solvent banks would face a domino effect , since they keep deposits in other , insolvent banks .
There would be no bailouts .
The national equivalents of Bank of America , Citigroup , and J. P. Morgan would close their doors .
There would be a money panic .
There would be a run on the bad banks .
The economy would be in a serious recession and maybe depression within six months .
When it became clear that none of this forced the central bank to go back to its old ways , money would begin to flow into the solvent banks .
These banks would gain the reputation of being survivors .
The pain of recession has been too great for any political regime or any central bank to resist since 1933 .
This is why we live in an age of price inflation .
Resistance to market - adjusted prices is universal , especially among economists , whether Keynesian , Chicago , or supply - side .
They all preach salvation by inflation .
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS
The U.S. dollar would begin to fall against the reformed currency .
There would be ups and downs , because no one would really believe that any central bank and its government would stick to such a scheme .
The reformed currency would move toward a new status : “ paper gold . ”
That is what the original IMF SDR ’s were called in the early 1970’s .
This was dismissed by one hard - money writer as the equivalent of glass diamonds .
So SDR ’s have proven to be .
The national government would be forced on domestic saving and international demand to sell its debt .
On the one hand , investors would expect the new plan to be abandoned as soon as the government runs out of low - interest buyers .
But if the bank stuck to its guns , investors would change their view .
On the other hand , foreign central bankers might decide to buy the debt of the reformed currency nation .
The nations ’ export sectors would want to sell more goods abroad .
By creating new money domestically , the foreign central bank would lower the value of its currency , making its exports even more attractive .
This would lead to a beggar - thy - neighbor competition among rival central banks .
That would make reformed currency look even better .
It would become apparent over time that the reformed currency ’s value is due to supply and demand for an asset with a fixed supply .
This might take two years .
It might take five years .
But , year by year , word would get out : this currency is the equivalent of gold .
Investors will not have their wealth undermined by the central bank ’s policy of monetary expansion .
Private investors seek a profit .
An appreciating currency lures in private capital .
Currency futures markets would begin to adopt the new currency .
If the oil - exporting nations began to sell in the reformed currency as well as the U.S. dollar , the world ’s marketers would see an advantage .
“ Buy the reformed currency and wait for its appreciation to lower the price of oil . ”
Those holding dollars would suffer comparative losses .
Central banks are not profit - seeking .
The directors do not own the banks , nor do they represent profit - seeking investors .
They are not under pressure to buy high - yielding assets .
At some point , however , central banks would move out of depreciating dollars into the reformed currency .
Why ?
Because of political pressure .
Word would get out that the dollar is a loser ’s game .
Central bankers do not want to be identified as losers .
THE COST OF REFORM
The reason why the BRIC nations — Brazil , Russia India , and China — do not want to see their currencies replace the dollar is because central bankers and politicians are Keynesians .
They believe in salvation by inflation .
The few Chicago School economists in the staffs are convinced that the central bank can and should inflate to forestall a recession .
That was Milton Friedman ’s main legacy to the modern world as far as the modern world ’s leaders are concerned .
He blamed the Federal Reserve System for not inflating , 1930 — 33 .
This is why we see no candidates to replace the U.S. dollar .
Any of the BRIC nations could establish policies that would elevate its currency to number - one status .
But the price is too high .
It is as high as adopting the gold coin standard .
It would mean the end of monetary intervention .
The modern world believes in salvation by inflation .
So has every civilization except one : the Byzantines , who had a stable gold currency for a thousand years after 325 A.D .
The cost of reform is too high for central bankers and politicians .
That cost is the restoration of monetary freedom .
None of them is willing to pay that price .
CONCLUSION
The IMF ’s non-currency cannot replace the dollar in the world ’s currency markets .
So , every currency is counterfeit .
The investor has to decide which fiat currency will be best over his lifetime .
They are all bad choices .

It 's not enough that humans gave robots a place to congregate to plan our demise , now we 've adapted them with the ability to extract fuel from the very nectar of life .
All that innocent experimentation with fuel cells that run on blood has led to this , a flesh - eating clock .
This prototype time - piece from UK - based designers James Auger and Jimmy Loizeau traps insects on flypaper stretched across its roller system before depositing them into a vat of bacteria .
The ensuing chemical reaction , or " digestion , " is transformed into power that keeps the rollers rollin ' and the LCD clock ablaze .
The pair offers an alternative design fueled by mice , another contraption whose robotic arm plucks insect - fuel from spider webs with the help of a video camera , and a lamp powered by insects lured to their deaths with ultraviolet LEDs .
Man , this is so wrong it has to be right .

Might oil hold the key to tackling Brazil 's poverty ?
Brazil has unveiled plans to bring more state control to its oil industry and take advantage of offshore reserves .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has proposed switching to a system which would see the government own a part of all oil produced .
Currently , companies bid to win the rights to explore for oil in blocks .
President Lula said the rules , if approved by congress , would see a " new Independence Day " for Brazil , helping tackle poverty and fund education .
It is thought Brazil 's reservoirs of oil could see it become a producer nation to rival some Opec countries such as Venezuela within a decade .
However the location of the oil , about 500 km ( 311 miles ) off its south - eastern coast , means huge investment will be needed .
GARY DUFFY , BBC BRAZIL CORRESPONDENT
" Brazil is a developing nation that faces enormous challenges and any windfall from the recent significant oil and gas finds off the Brazilian coast is undoubtedly welcome .
President Lula has called it a passport for the future - an opportunity to be seized in terms of combating poverty and investing much needed funds in education .
Part of the task is to ensure that the government secures a bigger share of the profits without alienating foreign companies who could play an important part in extracting this oil and gas .
The Brazilian government says the state run oil company Petrobras is a globally respected partner and that its new profit sharing model still offers excellent investment opportunities .
That is important , as the oil and gas lies deep between the ocean , and under a thick layer of rock and salt , and will not be cheap to extract .
So partners with big pockets will be very useful . "
National oil firm Petrobras said it would be the sole operator of the new subsalt fields - and would have a minimum 30 % stake in consortiums set up to drill for the oil in the fields - which were found in 2007 and are estimated to contain 50 billion barrels of oil .
There have been suggestions that the changes to rules will see foreign firms getting reduced access to Brazil 's oil industry .
Self - sufficient President Lula will present his plan to congress later , saying he wants to use income from the oil to tackle poverty and propel Brazil to developed status .
Brazil 's discovery of new reserves was " a passport to the future , " if handled properly , he said .
" We do n't have the right to take the money we 're going to get with this oil and waste it , " he said in his weekly radio address .
" What we want ... is to use this oil to make Brazil a wealthier country , to make it more developed . "
The country is currently self - sufficient in oil - producing enough to meet its consumption needs .
Environmentalists have expressed worries that Brazil - seen as a forward - thinking nation - will take a big leap backward to focus on crude oil .

Mehrere Bundestags - Abgeordnete haben ihre Mitwirkung in Vereinen verheimlicht , die der Rüstungslobby nahe stehen .
Es sei ein Skandal , dass diese Lobbyisten im Parlament " immer wieder bestimmenden Einfluss ausüben können " , sagt Grünen - Chefin Roth .
Die fünf Abgeordneten von SPD und FDP werden nach Informationen der Deutschen Presse - Agentur zum Teil seit Jahren bei der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Wehrtechnik ( DWT ) und dem Förderkreis Deutsches Heer ( FKH ) als Präsidiumsmitglieder geführt .
Nach der Geschäftsordnung des Bundestags müssen solche Tätigkeiten angezeigt und veröffentlicht werden .
Dieser Pflicht kamen die Abgeordneten jedoch nicht nach .
Die Mitglieder des Verteidigungsausschusses Elke Hoff ( FDP ) , Rainer Arnold und Jörn Thießen ( beide SPD ) sitzen im Präsidium der DWT .
Auf dpa-Anfrage gaben sie an , sich der Veröffentlichungspflicht nicht bewusst gewesen zu sein .
Die beiden SPD - Abgeordneten Gerd Höfer und Johannes Kahrs sind Mitglieder im Präsidium des FKH , ohne dass sie dies gemeldet hätten .
" Der eigentliche Skandal "
Grünen - Chefin Claudia
Roth zeigte sich wenig überrascht : " Es ist eine traurige Wirklichkeit , dass direkte Rüstungslobbyisten im Bundestag sitzen .
Dass sie dabei nicht unbedingt das Licht der Öffentlichkeit suchen , verwundert mich nicht " , erklärte Roth gegenüber n- tv.de .
Der eigentliche Skandal bestehe jedoch darin , " dass sie in ihren Fraktionen und im Parlament immer wieder bestimmenden Einfluss ausüben können , wenn über die Verwendung von großen Summen für die Rüstungswirtschaft und über Rüstungsexporte entschieden wird " .
" Bei der FDP als parlamentarischem Arm aller möglichen Groß- und Rüstungskonzerne ist sowieso klar , wie tief sie hier involviert ist " , so Roth weiter .
" Die Verstrickungen der Union sind mit dem Fall Schreiber gerade wieder deutlich geworden .
Bei der SPD verwundert allerdings schon , wie ungestört sie einen ausgemachten Rüstungslobbyisten wie Johannes Kahrs agieren lässt . "
" Durchgerutscht "
" Die Mitgliedschaft im Präsidium ist ehrenamtlich .
Weil kein Geld gezahlt wird , ist es mir durchgerutscht " , sagte Thießen .
Inzwischen haben der SPD - Politiker und seine beiden Kollegen ihre Vereinsfunktionen angezeigt .
Höfer und Kahrs bestritten sogar , dass es eine Veröffentlichungspflicht gebe .
" Die Tätigkeit ist ehrenamtlich , braucht also nicht angezeigt werden " , sagte Höfer , der ebenfalls im Verteidigungsausschuss sitzt .
Kahrs betonte , er habe im Verein keine Funktionen wie Schatzmeister oder Vorsitzender inne .
Daher müsse er die Präsidiumsmitgliedschaft nicht anzeigen .
Nach Angaben des Bundestags haben aber auch diese beiden SPD - Abgeordneten ihre Funktionen inzwischen nachgemeldet .
Geschäftsordnung ist eindeutig
Die Geschäftsordnung des Bundestages ist in dieser Frage allerdings eindeutig .
In den Verhaltensregeln ( Paragraf 1 , Anzeigepflicht ) heißt es , Abgeordnete müssten ihre " Tätigkeiten als Mitglied eines Vorstandes oder eines sonstigen leitenden oder beratenden Gremiums eines Vereins (...) mit nicht ausschließlich lokaler Bedeutung " dem Präsidenten des Bundestages schriftlich anzeigen , damit dieser sie veröffentlichen kann .
Bei Verstößen droht ein Ordnungsgeld bis zur Hälfte der Höhe der jährlichen Abgeordneten - Entschädigung .
Abgeordnete des Bundestags erhalten derzeit im Monat 7668 Euro Diäten .
Andere Abgeordnete halten sich an die Meldepflicht
Die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Wehrtechnik wurde bereits 1957 gegründet .
Den Förderkreis Deutsches
Heer gibt es seit 1995 .
Beide Vereine haben sich eine bessere Verständigung zwischen Politik , Öffentlichkeit , Bundeswehr und Rüstungsindustrie auf die Fahnen geschrieben .
In den Führungsgremien sind neben Rüstungslobbyisten und Offizieren mehrere Abgeordnete und auch Regierungsmitglieder tätig .
Dazu gehören zum Beispiel der Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Verteidigungsministerium , Thomas Kossendey ( CDU ) , als DWT - Vizepräsident sowie Landwirtschaftsministerin Ilse Aigner ( CSU ) , die im Präsidium des FKH sitzt .
Die SPD - Politikerin Ulrike Merten , die im Falle eines SPD - Wahlsiegs neue Verteidigungsministerin werden soll , ist Vorstandsmitglied der DWT .
Alle drei haben ihre Tätigkeit pflichtgemäß veröffentlicht .
Mehr als ein Kavalierdelikt
Lobbyismus - Kritiker sehen in den Verstößen der anderen Politiker mehr als nur Kavaliersdelikte .
" In den Vereinen finden sich Firmen wieder , die sich von der Bundeswehr Aufträge erhoffen " , sagte Ulrich Müller von der Organisation LobbyControl .
" Insofern muss die Mitgliedschaft in Gremien solcher Lobby - Plattformen für alle erkennbar sein . "
Müller gibt auch der Bundestagsverwaltung eine Mitschuld , weil sie gegen Abgeordnete zu selten Sanktionen verhänge .
Bundestagspräsident Norbert Lammert ( CDU ) behandele das Verschweigen von Nebentätigkeiten immer noch als Kavaliersdelikt .
" Er hilft den Abgeordneten , die gegen die Verhaltensregeln verstoßen haben , das stillschweigend zu korrigieren . "
Auf diese Weise würden die geltenden Transparenzregeln untergraben .
After two months on store shelves and achieving almost chart - topping NPD numbers , UFC 2009 : Undisputed was a real bread - winner for THQ .
But now with the success of the series on the consoles , THQ is looking to spread their franchis ’s popularity onto portable platforms .
THQ confirmed that the UFC series is going to be expanding to every platform on the market –including portable platforms .
While the platforms it would be expanding to were not specifically mentioned , we can easily foresee a UFC title coming to the PSP with the big push sparked by the PSP Go , as well as the slew of new titles set to coincide with the hardware ’s release this Fall .

Obesity could cost Texas $ 15.6 billion next year
Whatever Washington does this year to try to lower medical spending almost certainly will be swamped by the nation 's rising weight .
Obesity lurks behind the top chronic illnesses — heart disease , diabetes , stroke and colon , breast and prostate cancers , among many others — whose treatments routinely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars .
In two decades the obesity rate in Texas has more than doubled — 29 percent of Texans in 2007 were obese .
Every third child born in 2000 is likely to wind up diabetic .
Obesity strikes hardest at the poor and minorities ; black women are nearly 40 percent more likely to contract heart disease than white women .
Two out of three adults are overweight in Texas and nationwide .
Obesity is causing “ death and illness on a massive scale , ” according to a new study by University of Virgina and Urban Institute researchers .
And it is all but impossible to treat .
“ Rising obesity rates are increasing health care expenditures per person in a way that is going to be very difficult to finance , ” said Jay Bhattacharya , a doctor and health economist at Stanford University 's Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research .
“ Unless there is some vast improvement in the efficiency of the health care system — and I mean vast — we 're going to be spending a lot more just because a lot more people will have diabetes ” and other obesity related diseases .
Prevention is the only cure .
If obesity - prevention efforts are not implemented , Texas will have more than 15 million obese adults by 2040 , according to projections by Texas State Demographer Karl Eschbach .
Yet while health care legislation in Congress would raise spending on prevention of chronic disease , it does little to tackle the underlying obesity epidemic directly .
In fact , most of the bills are silent on what many health professionals contend would be one of the most effective weapons : a tax on soda .
Junk food taxes are part of a growing consensus among public health experts to adapt the successful fight against tobacco to the more complex obesity epidemic .
Food , unlike tobacco , is necessary to life , and cheap food has all but eliminated hunger among the poor .
Yet there are parallels with smoking .
Texas getting help
The Texas Legislature has not seriously considered politically controversial junk food taxes .
Instead , the state and health groups are focusing on education and community strategies to fight excess weight from birth .
The Texas Department of State Health Services will receive $ 4.7 million over the next two years to support obesity - prevention programs , including a “ Texas ! Bringing Healthy Back ” initiative that was launched last year .
Since 2000 , Texas has been one of 25 states also receiving funds from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight obesity .
Lindsay Rodgers , a health department prevention specialist , said the CDC has urged sending money to communities for vegetable gardens , sidewalks and work site wellness programs and to hospitals to make them baby - friendly so more mothers will breast feed , one way to reduce obesity risk in children .
Statistics indicate that African - Americans and Latinos have higher obesity rates than Anglo Texans .
But experts say that obesity prevention programs have not successfully targeted minority residents .
Texas Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio said education programs that have tried to teach kids about eating nutritious foods have “ backfired ” because they made the food their families cooked for them seem bad .
“ We love Mexican food in this state , ” Van de Putte said , adding that there are ways to prepare it to be healthier .
More can be done , she said , like tax incentives for workplace wellness programs .
“ The government can't be a nanny to someone , but if we continue to ignore ( obesity ) , we all pay the price . …
It 's not a moral imperative , it 's a financial imperative . ”
A mixed performance
Mitchell Gibbs , a Texas Health Institute spokesman , said the Legislature 's record on obesity issues is mixed .
In the past session , lawmakers agreed to encourage healthy food in schools and funding for physical education programs .
But bills allowing the use of food stamps at farmers ' markets , banning unhealthy trans fats in restaurants , and requiring menu labels at chain restaurants failed .
What 's more , the Legislature made high school health class optional and reduced physical education requirements from 1½ semesters to one .
In Washington , Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee mocked proposed jungle gyms and bike trails in health reform legislation , yet studies show such efforts help .
“ It does n't sound crazy if you start looking at the causes of the problem , ” said Kelly Brownell , an obesity researcher at Yale University 's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity .
“ In poor neighborhoods there is low access to healthy foods , high access to calorie - dense , nutrient - poor foods , and when healthy foods are available , they 're more expensive . ”
Fast food on every corner
The same holds for physical activity , where crime , poor facilities and parents working multiple jobs limit opportunities for safe play and exercise .
The obesity problem took hold over one generation , a short period in the history of public health .
“ Every successful public health movement , whether it was sanitation or air pollution or drunk driving or tobacco , has shown that people can only be healthy if there are policies in place that support them in making healthy choices , ” said Harold Goldstein , executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy .
“ We put fast food on every corner , we put junk food in schools , we got rid of PE , we put candy and soda at the checkout stand of every retail outlet you can think of , ” he said .
“ The results are in .
It worked . ”

Whether you are an astronomy student or just interested in learning more about those points of light in our sky , Wolfram| Alpha contains star data that will help you get started and understand what you ’re seeing up there .
Wolfram|
Alpha not only charts the stars from your location , but offers detailed information including their distance from Earth , color , size , and much more .
To figure out which stars are the most visible to you , simply enter “ 10 brightest stars “ .
The query ’s results indicate that the brightest stars as seen from Earth are the Sun , Sirius , Canopus , Arcturus , Rigel Kentaurus A , Vega , Capella , Rigel , Procyon , and Betelgeuse .
Pods show comparisons of the stars ’ size , their equilateral locations , and their locations in the current sky ( not necessarily the night sky — unless you specify a time / location , Wolfram| Alpha assumes the current time from your current location ) .
The bright stars Capella , Betelgeuse , and Arcturus are all visible at night or before sunrise from Champaign , Illinois , USA , depending on the season .
If you enter “ Capella , Betelgeuse , Arcturus ” into Wolfram| Alpha you ’ll get a comparison of the three stars .
It can tell you , for instance , that Betelgeuse , a super giant , is the largest of the three , and that Arcturus , which is found in the constellation of Boötes , is much closer to Earth than either Betelgeuse or Rigel .
Capella and Betelguese are most easily seen on winter nights , whereas Arcturus is most easily seen on a spring night in the Northern Hemisphere .
So repeat your query as time progresses to get current information .
You can also add a date to your query to see where a star was , or will be , on a specific date .
Wolfram|Alpha is a fast and simple tool on your computer or mobile device to help you become more familiar with astronomy and stargazing .

I was heartbroken to hear that John Hughes passed away :
Not only had Hughes shaped my generation in the 80s , but even today teens are rediscovering his films and identifying with them .
It ’s a bit too early to tell , but to me this hints that some of those films will without a doubt be seen as future classics in the years to come .
And maybe that ’s because there ’s something for everyone to identify with in those films , the Breakfast Club is a great example of this which featured almost every teen archetype of the era .
So without further ado here are ten reasons I admired John Hughes :
Hughes was at home in his time :
Many boomer directors seem to be caught up in showing their coming - of - age experience , but Hughes set all of his films in the period that they were shot in .
This made them speak much more to their audience who did n’t feel like they were being lectured too .
Hughes did n’t go Hollywood :
Watching his films you knew that they were shot on location in the Midwest and not on some set in Hollywood , that gave his films a down to earth quality which made you identify with the characters and the situations in the film .
Hughes gave breaks to unknowns :
Hughes sense of casting was just amazing , but beyond that he found some very talented young actors and knew how to showcase their talents .
Hughes had a gentle sense of humor :
In an age of sarcastic cynicism Hughes never made you feel like you were laughing at his subjects , but rather laughing with them .
He did n’t go for a cheap shot at the expense of a character , and that made you identify with a character .
Hughes made the outcast into the hero :
If you look at the protagonists in his films they ’re always in second place !
The best example is that in Sixteen Candles Molly Ringwald plays the younger sister who is n’t getting married , yet she ’s the star of the film .
Hughes knew how to break the forth wall : A trademark of his films is that the characters would talk to the audience , which gave the audience a reason to identify with the protagonist on the screen .
Hughes had great taste in music : I ca n’t think of the Breakfast Club without Simple Minds singing “ Do n’t You Forget About Me ! ”
It ’s important that the music was never in a Hughes film to be cool and of the moment , but it always expanded the storyline .
And like his actors he tended to pick unknowns that you would n’t have heard before .
This was so true that I found myself buying the soundtrack to She ’s Having a Baby just to get one song off the album !
Hughes knew how to mix comedy with drama :
While he did comedy films , the magic of Hughes teen films is that they ’re a wonderful mix of serious situations and humorous moments .
In fact I think Hughes was at his best when he mixed it up , which why his comedy films were n’t quite as strong .
Hughes was n’t afraid to try something new :
By 1987 Hughes had six solid teen films under his belt , he could have gone on making those for the rest of his life but instead he tried straight up comedy and even films for kids .
Those films were n’t always his strongest but at least he was willing to try , which is something that most Hollywood directors would never do .
Hughes was a damn good writer even when he was n’t directing :
His writing credits stretch all the way from Mr. Mom in 1983 to Maid in Manhattan in 2002 .
All those films are just a bit better for having him involved , it gives them that extra spark which otherwise would n’t have been there .

Right wing talk show host G. Gordon Liddy was on Hardball today claiming that Barack Obama was born in Kenya .
Liddy said that Obama ’s parents intentionally posted a false birth announcement in the Hawaii newspaper , and that Obama is an illegal alien .
Host Chris Matthews smashed through this crack pot theory .
Check out the video .
Here is the video :
Advertisements
Liddy first made the bogus claim that you ca n’t get a passport with a certificate of live birth , which Matthews shot down .
Liddy ’s whole theory is based on a so called deposition from Obama ’s step grandmother that she was present while he was born in Kenya , and the claim a certificate of live birth is not a birth certificate .
Liddy said , “ The preponderance of the evidence is as follows you ’ve got a deposition which is a sworn statement from the step grandmother which says I was present and saw him born in Mombasa , Kenya .
You ’ve got the certificate of live birth , that they have here , not a birth certificate , says right on it certificate of live birth . ”
He also tried to explain away the birth announcement , “ Well , I would want my child born in the United States , or I would want people to think he was born in the United States so that he could have all the advantages of being a United States citizen . ”
Using Liddy ’s logic , Matthews concluded that if Obama was n’t born here , and not naturalized , then he is here illegally .
Liddy called Obama an illegal alien .
Matthews asked the key question .
Why would everybody lie going back to 1961 , and no one gave away the story ?
Matthews other guest E. Steven Collins pointed out that if Obama was an Irish - American , Polish - American , or German - American , there would be no discussion of his citizenship .
He said many people in this nation still ca n’t accept the fact that an African - American is the Commander in Chief .
G. Gordon Liddy certainly sounded like a crazy crack pot old man .
He had absolutely no evidence that Obama is n’t a citizen , and appeared to have never seen the actual evidence that Obama is .
More so , he did n’t seem to be aware that a certificate of live birth is a legally accepted document .
I think we all know how Chris Matthews is .
He is going to run this story into the ground .
What I want to know is where Matthews , MSNBC , and CNN were when these theories were running wild last year ?
The biggest albatross around the neck of cannabis in every arena – from the study of cannabinoids , with its monthly and even weekly discoveries , to political legislation and medical usage – has always been its falsified reputation as a substance that will lead to the use of harder drugs .
Every drug- prevention warrior at some point rolls out the old “ gateway drug ” carpet and manages to wrap it around the entire marijuana debate .
Like many people , as a teen I was presented with this hypothesis , and even then the reasoning seemed to smell funny .
With no experience to base it on , and thus no real bias either way , it simply seemed like an unprovable argument : even if an adult user of hard drugs used marijuana first , how can it ever be confirmed that the first action caused the other ?
Today ’s scientific consensus seems equally confused ; it ’s easy to find reputable research that backs up both sides of the argument , usually clutched in the hands of the accompanying activists from either camp .
Strangely enough , there is yet another facet to the discussion : the experiences of people who say that cannabis has , in fact , been a gateway out for them , a way in which they have managed to get off harder , more addictive substances .
Greg Ballantine * was what the medical establishment termed a “ functional addict ” in that he managed to hold down various regular jobs in his hometown of Vancouver while also maintaining a daily habit of smoking heroin .
After smoking marijuana by chance one day , he started to wonder if cannabis had a positive effect on his addiction .
“ It makes me so mad when people call cannabis a gateway drug because I felt it was like the exact opposite .
It made me think , ‘ what are you doing ?
This is heroin , a dangerous , addictive narcotic !’
Cannabis was like the voice of reason . ”
Ballantine believes this is one part of why cannabis began to function as a replacement for heroin – the fact that it encouraged introspection about his habit .
Victoria Adams * is a distinguished career woman who quit smoking cigarettes by using marijuana brownies .
She started smoking cigarettes as a teenager and was up to several packs a day , but says pot made her think twice .
“ It transformed my mind so I did n’t think about cigarettes .
That ’s what I like about it – it makes you stop and think , to stand aside and look at yourself .
It gives you such clarity , really . ”
With a habit as strongly addictive as cigarettes or heroin , some additional insight into one ’s habit is beneficial but hardly enough to kick the physical symptoms of withdrawal .
However , both Adams and Ballantine say that cannabis helped them in this respect , as well as others .
Ballantine describes it as working on several levels .
First , “ it distracts your mind from whirring on this one track of ‘ I want to get loaded ’ .
” Then , he says , it worked on the physical symptoms of withdrawal , settling his stomach and relaxing the frenzy of drug craving .
“ It alleviates the stress associated with cigarettes , ” agrees Adams , saying that it treated both the tensions of quitting smoking and the other stresses that cigarettes had helped her deal with before .
Cannabis Substitution Treatment
Adams and Ballantine ’s revelations are nothing new .
Doctors have referenced the use of cannabis for the treatment of addiction as far back as the late 1800s , when cannabis treatments were in vogue for everything from pain relief to menstrual complaints , headaches , and even rabies .
Two notable medicinal examples include Dr. William O’Shaughnessy , who experimented with cannabis substitution for more harmful drugs at the University of Edinburgh in the 1840s , and Dr. E. A. Birch , who published an article in the medical journal The Lancet in 1889 concerning the use of cannabis in the treatment of opiate addiction .
By 1850 , cannabis was listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia as being useful for alcohol and opiate addiction , among a long list of diseases and complaints .
Perhaps a more surprising account of the successful treatment of morphine and heroin addicts with tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) came in 1944 from a report commissioned by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia of New York City .
Initiated under the auspices of the New York Academy of Medicine as a response to increasing accounts of unfounded and hysterical marijuana hype in the media , the report aimed to be “ a thorough sociological and scientific investigation . ”
One of the tasks of the subcommittee was to administer 56 morphine and heroin - addicted prison inmates with either THC , no treatment , or Magendie ’s solution ( morphine sulphate ) .
The report ’s findings were remarkable , stating that it was the subcommittee ’s impression that “ those who received tetrahydrocannabinol had less severe withdrawal symptoms and left the hospital at the end of the treatment period in better condition that those who received no treatment or were treated with Magendie ’s solution .
The ones in the former group maintained their appetite and in some cases actually gained weight during the withdrawal period . ”
They made specific note of the potential ?
benefits of marijuana in assisting with some of the mental distress experienced during withdrawal .
The findings of the LaGuardia Commission became part of a greater contention between Mayor LaGuardia and the first commissioner of the United States Federal Bureau of Narcotics , Harry Anslinger .
Anslinger built a career on being rabidly anti-marijuana , infamously declaring it an “ assassin of youth ” , though it is debatable as to whether even he truly believed the scare stories he planted in the media .
Following the blow dealt to his credibility by the LaGuardia Report , it was Anslinger who first invented the “ gateway drug ” hypothesis in his desperation to give marijuana a new dangerous edge .
He sought to link it to heroin , despite the fact that he had previously testified before Congress that a marijuana user does not graduate into harder drugs like heroin .
His campaign was largely successful , with the Boggs Act being passed by the US Congress in 1951 , a legislation that essentially lumped marijuana in with narcotic drugs for the first time .
Official research into the anti-addictive potential of cannabis then languished somewhat until the 1970s , when an enterprising American doctor named Tod H. Mikuriya had an alcoholic patient tell him that she did n’t feel the need to drink if she had marijuana available to smoke .
?
For Mikuriya , this was part of a pattern that began to emerge in his practice regarding cannabis usage and its effect on alcoholics – and when the method was sanctioned by his encouragement and assistance , it often met with great success .
By 2002 , six years after Proposition 215 passed in the state of California ( allowing medical marijuana ) , Mikuriya had prescribed 92 patients cannabis for both for their addiction to alcohol and its attendant problems .
In a fascinating 2004 report for the Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics , Mikuriya methodically details the journey of these patients , concluding that the substitution of cannabis for alcohol is much more than simply ‘ swapping one drug for another . ’
He asserts that when one looks at the role alcohol plays in auto accidents and damage to the body ’s organs , there is virtually no comparison with cannabis ’ “ benign ” side effects .
On top of this , he touts the beneficial influence of cannabis on sleep cycles , appetite and energy levels , and the easing of pain and muscle spasms for the recovering alcoholic .
Considering the potential benefits versus the risk , cannabis seems like a likely first option in treating addiction .
There are few alternatives for most addicts ; those dependent on opiates have little recourse but to get on a “ maintenance program ” of more addictive and side - effect - riddled Methadone .
Reward Pathways and the Endocannabinoid System
Dr. Robert Melamede , an associate professor of biology at the University of Colorado and an expert in the field of cannabinoids , says much of the official reluctance to treat addiction with cannabis has to do with the interpretation of how addiction works within the body ’s endocannabinoid system .
Melamede describes the endocannabinoid system , which he says was only discovered in the early 1990 ’s , as a thermostat - like regulating body composed of chemicals “ that we produce in our bodies out of essential fatty acids . ”
These chemicals function within the endocannabinoid system to turn on “ receptors that change biochemical pathways , and then [ turn ] off the chemicals that turn on those receptors to establish a kind of balance .
Everywhere you look , we see that the endocannabinoid system has very protective properties .
That ’s what makes marijuana such a unique drug . ”
Melamede continues , “ It ’s the only plant material out there that can tap into our universally functioning endocannabinoid system , and in doing so , mimics the effect of the way the body works .
This is why it has so many activities , because the endocannabinoid system winds up literally regulating everything in our body .
Among the ‘ everythings ’ that it regulates seems to be the reward behavior associated with various drugs of abuse . ”
This profound connection between the endocannabinoid system and addictive drugs has intrigued scientists , says Melamede , because they have observed that “ a lot of the rewarding properties associated with those drugs can be blocked by blocking the endocannabinoid system . ”
Some scientists believe that simply ‘ turning off ’ the endocannabinoid system is the way to combat addiction , something that Melamede says “ is the stupidest thing imaginable to me , because your cannabinoid system has so many critically important roles in your health .
If people are addicted to different drugs , the reason they got addicted was that stimulating those pathways provided something that their bodies needed .
What I would say is that rather than using addictive drugs that are funneling through the cannabis pathways , why not just use the cannabis , which we know that in so many circumstances is actually beneficial for people ? ”
Other scientists are beginning to agree with Melamede , at least in part .
Daniele Piomelli , Professor of Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry at the University of California , Irvine , is finding in his research that “ blocking reward pathways exacerbates drug - related problems , ” and although he agrees a different approach is needed that could include “ the stimulation of endogenous cannabinoid pathways , ” he believes much more research is needed .
Prescription Drugs and Cannabis
With so much political controversy and debate existing around drug addiction , it is easy to assume that illegal drugs are the problem , conveniently overlooking the harm and dependence wrought by legal psychotropic pharmaceutical drugs , with which cannabis may also have potential applications .
Sharon Heys * is a young mother who , in high school , had “ fairly serious substance abuse tendencies ” and developed a dependence to crystal methamphetamine .
Deciding to quit all drugs and alcohol ‘ cold turkey ’ , and only smoke copious amounts of cannabis , Heys says she managed to stay clean .
She admits , however that she basically did nothing but “ work , go home , and smoke pot . ”
For Heys , it was a period in her life that was marked by severe depression that , coupled with running away from home , was the reason she says she ended up having a drug problem .
“ If I was in Middle America or where pot is n’t available , I definitely would have been put on – and probably needed – antidepressants because I was not well . ”
Heys felt pot was a far better option than antidepressants , because the pharmaceuticals are “ really habit forming [ and ] have a lot of side effects .
People have told me it changed their personality so much that they did n’t feel like themselves anymore . ”
Victoria Adams , who quit cigarettes using marijuana brownies and a toke here and there , had similar findings following a car accident when she was put on Paxil to deal with her anxiety .
“ [ My husband ] said I was like a dead person – no spark in me at all . ”
She quit the pharmaceuticals and successfully used marijuana again , finding it also worked “ like a tranquilizer , but it put my personality back in , my spark . ”
Another favorite claim of anti-cannabis crusaders is that marijuana is itself an addictive substance .
Although there is not much evidence of pot being physically addictive , there is some research that suggests a small percent of the population can develop an intense psychological dependence on it .
“ From almost any angle , marijuana is a more benign drug than alcohol , ” asserts Dirk Hanson , author of the upcoming book The Chemical Carousel : What Science Tells Us About Beating Addiction .
“ But lost in this argument , as usual , is the fact that marijuana is an addictive drug for a minority of users .
It is not a risk - free substance in that respect – though from a societal standpoint , I would substitute pot for booze in a heartbeat . ”
No methodology is without its potential drawbacks .
But when the risks of cannabis substitution are weighed against the crushing physical , mental , emotional , economic , and social agony that addiction causes , the promise cannabis holds for a relatively safe way out is more than tantalizing .
From the inducing of introspective reflection about the distress that is the very source of one ’s addiction , to the easing of physical and mental pain caused by withdrawal itself , marijuana may be a viable option in helping hard drug addicts find a gateway out .

Satellites track Indian water loss
Water is being used faster than nature can replenish supplies in Northern India , with new satellite data suggesting the rate of depletion is faster than previously feared .
But data from a NASA satellite that can ' see ' water stored deep underground has suggested that the problem is more pressing than suspected , with water levels dropping by a metre every three years .
The two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) satellites orbit the earth around 130 miles apart and the slight changes that they track in gravitational pull can be analysed to assess the amount of groundwater beneath the surface .
Put simplistically , they act like fishing floats on the surface of a lake , and when one bobs , the other takes note and records the strength of the pull from below .
The satellites can be used to pinpoint potential water shortages around the world and assess their urgency .
" Using GRACE satellite observations , we can observe and monitor water changes in critical areas of the world , from one month to the next , without leaving our desks , " said NASA scientist Isabella Velicogna .
" These satellites provide a window to underground water storage changes . "
Hydrologist Matt Rodell , who is based at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland , said : " If measures are not taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage , consequences for the 114 million residents of the region may include a collapse of agricultural output and severe shortages of potable water .

First it was the giant panda , then the polar bear , now it seems that the grizzly bear is the latest species to face impending disaster .
A furious row has erupted in Canada with conservationists desperately lobbying the government to suspend the annual bear - hunting season following reports of a sudden drop in the numbers of wild bears spotted on salmon streams and key coastal areas where they would normally be feeding .
The government has promised to order a count of bears , but not until after this year 's autumn trophy hunts have taken place .
It has enraged ecology groups which say that a dearth of salmon stocks may be responsible for many bears starving in their dens during hibernation .
The female grizzlies have their cubs during winter after gorging themselves in September on the fish fats that sustain them through the following months .
" I 've never seen bears hungry in the fall before , but last year they were starving , " said British Columbian wildlife guide and photographer Doug Neasloss .
" I noticed in the spring there were n't as many bears coming out , but I felt it was premature to jump to conclusions . "
But now , he said , " there just are n't any bears .
It 's scary . "
It was the same story , he said , from other guides over 16 rivers where once they would have been encountering dozens of grizzly bears .
" There has been a huge drop in numbers .
I 've never experienced anything this bad . "
Reports from stream walkers , who monitor salmon streams across the vast territories , have been consistent , according to the conservation group Pacific Wild – no bears , and more worryingly , no bear cubs .
" There are just no bears out there , I 'm hearing that from every side now , " said Ian McAllister from Pacific Wild .
He said that because a few grizzlies have been wandering close to centres of human habitation people thought there were plenty of bears around .
" In fact it 's the shortage of food that 's driving them into town .
They 're starving , " he explained .
In one river alone , the Fraser on Canada 's west coast , 10 million sockeye salmon were expected back to spawn there this summer .
Only one million turned up .
Canada 's Ministry of Environment announced in July that it would ban hunting of grizzly bears on an additional 470,000 hectares , bringing the total protected area for grizzlies and black bears to 1.9 million hectares .
The news came after Jane Goodall , the renowned wildlife campaigner , added her voice to the campaign against the hunts , which are for trophies , not meat .
" I 'm very distressed and shocked that the bear hunt – grizzly bear and black bear – is continuing in a country like Canada , " she said .
" These bears are such amazing , magnificent creatures and there are so many secrets still to discover about their lives . "
Grizzlies once roamed across most of North America and the Great Plains until European settlers gradually pushed them back .
Only 1,000 remain in the contiguous US , where they are protected , but the number is less clear in the vast wilds of Canada and Alaska , where they are prized by hunters who shoot hundreds of the 350kg giants every year , providing a lucrative income for provincial governments that license the hunts .
" It 's appalling wildlife management , considering the widespread concern for coastal bears at the moment , " said McAllister .
Indigenous groups have added their voice to the call to save the bears , pointing out that trophy hunting is against their traditions and threatens tourism , which is a vital source of income for the remote areas of Canada .
But a senior biologist with the US National Wildlife Federation said the evidence remained anecdotal and called the reports " alarmist " .
Bears would not starve so quickly because of the decline in salmon while there were other food sources , such as berries , around , Sterling Miller told reporters .
He said the long - term impact of the salmon decline on bears was a serious issue , but several years of data would need to be compiled to reveal a change in population trends .
A report released last week showed species numbers to have fallen dramatically in the province of Alberta , where local officials have decided to suspend the annual hunting season despite intense lobbying from hunters .
" There 's no question that bears are worse off now than 20 years ago – both in numbers and range , " said Jim Pissot , of the group Defenders of Wildlife .
Snap pickoff throws to first are less important than throws to third  as Torre put it , “ The runners only go in one direction ”  and on the latter , right - handed hitters would impede a left - handed - throwing catcher .
But Distefano brushed that back , too .
“ When I had to throw to third , I cheated a little bit  I sat a couple of inches farther back and my left foot was a little open , ” he said .
“ I did n’t have to shuffle my feet because I had good arm strength .
And when guys steal third , 9 of 10 times it ’s on the pitcher anyway . ”
Distefano offered two explanations .
Bunts toward third base , he said , cause problems for left - handed catchers .
In scampering to grab the ball , transferring it to their left hand and throwing to either first or second base , their bodies get closed and clumsy .
Throws for right - handers are far more open and natural .
But the primary problem Distefano encountered was with plays at home .
Because his glove was on his right hand , every accurate throw to the runner ’s side of the plate would have to be reached for backhanded , impeding a quick tag .
And on outfielder throws up the first - base line , reaching out with his right hand would leave his throwing shoulder wide open to the runner .

“ If there ’s going to be a bang - bang play , the left - handed catcher ’s going to get hurt , ” he said .
Distefano did manage to parlay his newfound versatility into a better - paying job in Japan in 1990 .
He attended the Houston Astros ’ spring camp in 1992  with the pitchers and catchers  and made the team in part because he could serve as emergency catcher .
He never got into a game behind the plate , but they needed an extra body with Craig Biggio moving to second base .
Come to think of it , speaking of second base , why do n’t any lefties get to play there , either ?
And not at shortstop , nor at third ?
The omens look better than they have some time .
The Americans have withdrawn from Iraq 's cities , which means Afghanistan will have its full focus in a way it has n't had since the initial invasion in 2001 .
Pakistan appears to have finally realised the Taliban and al - Qaeda threaten its existence as a state and no longer feels so passionately that it 's " America 's war . "
More importantly , Pakistan 's armed forces appear to have reached the same conclusion after a series of bloody attacks on its major cities .
Yesterday , it moved its forces up to the Afghan border to capture Taliban militants fleeing the American advance .
Finally there appears to be evidence of the joined up thinking President Obama 's new " Af - Pak " policy promised .
People often approach a divorce , paternity or custody matter with a clear vision of what they want , and they are willing to fight for it .
Unfortunately , this approach often results in a mountain of legal bills and a decision handed down by a judge who is not intimately familiar with the circumstances and needs of the participants .
We approach these issues like a puzzle , patiently putting together each piece and achieving an outcome that our clients can comfortably live with .
A satisfactory outcome in a family law matter will not give either party everything they want ; there will be give and take .
But a good outcome will allow everyone to move on to the next phase of their lives and put this chapter behind them .

It has held books upright in millions of rooms around the world for 30 years .
As Ikea 's Billy bookcase enters its fourth decade , why do we display our reading material rather than just store it away ?
Billy is a behemoth of the bookcase world .
Designed by only the fourth employee for Ikea , 41 million have been sold since 1979 .
The factory where the bookcases are made knocks out 15 Billys a minute ; 3.1 million a year .
Many households in the UK have one of these no -frills , building - block style bookcases nestled in a corner somewhere , which means there are a lot of books sitting on its simple shelves .
But not every Billy owner will be paying upwards of £ 25 to fill the space with improving literature .
CDs and DVDs will find a home there too .
The continued popularity of such a mass - produced piece of MDF has led to less hand - wringing from designers than you might expect .
It 's not Eames or G - Plan but it does what it says on the tin , according to interior design writer Leslie Geddes - Brown .
" It 's nicely simple and good value .
What 's more , you can take it with you when you move , unlike built - in shelves , " says Ms Geddes - Brown , author of Books Do Furnish a Room .
Its sheer plainness is what makes it so successful , says furniture designer Matthew Hilton .
He says the Billy is one of the most developed yet anonymous furniture products ever .
" It is ubiquitous , modernist , industrial design taken to the ultimate conclusion . "
It is meant to be easy to construct ( if you 're a dab hand with dowels and a diagram ) and is thoroughly inoffensive to all but the most critical aesthete .
Bonnet busters
Above all , it is designed to be fit for purpose - supporting and displaying books .
It 's not about the finesse of the furniture - it 's a means to an end .
A bookcase is like a picture frame - the real design is about what you put on it .
' The first thing I see when I wake up ' - Peter Sandico's bookcases
But why are we so keen to show off our books - necessitating all these shelves and swelling the already bursting coffers of Swedish furnishers ?
Books are n't essential - you do n't need them to sit on or eat off ( unless you are a student ) .
If you want to read , or check a reference , there are libraries .
And all those bonnet busters by the likes of Jane Austen and George Elliot - they can be called up at the touch of a mouse thanks to the numerous websites which reproduce out - of - copyright books .
It 's not the same as curling up with a paperback - but how often do you really re-read the old classics ?
When Penguin issued its first paperbacks in the 1930s , they were designed as an impulse purchase - for the same price of a packet of cigarettes .
And no one keeps them after they are spent .
Books were immensely prestigious .
Not only did they show how very learned you were but they were also very expensive
Leslie Geddes - Brown
Interior design writer
Trashy book amnesty
Surely books should be temporary , disposable items ?
And yet , more than 500 years after the invention of the printing press , the importance and value of keeping books is showing no sign of waning .
The internet was supposed to spell the end of the printed word - instead one of its earliest success stories was an online book shop , Amazon .
It 's hard to escape the theory that there is an exhibitionist side to our bookcase obsession - it's about showing off how much you have read , or plan to read , or pretend to have read .
You are subtly suggesting that you are the sort of person who keeps Finnegans Wake handy , for example , just in case you ever fancy dipping in for a quick , albeit incomprehensible , catch - up .
HOW TO ORGANISE A BOOKCASE ?
Problem with alphabetical is forgetting the author or title Organise by subject , like gardening , cooking , novels Tall books at the bottom Paperbacks nearer top Books you never read out of reach Source : Leslie Geddes - Brown Ever since manuscripts were first bound , books have had a hallowed air .
" Books were immensely prestigious , " says Ms Geddes - Brown .
" Not only did they show how very learned you were - you could read - but they were also very expensive .
At one throw , you proved your intellectual and monetary value . "
Peter Sandico is a firm believer in books as an extension of the self .
A book blogger , who is collecting photos of readers ' shelves in his " bookcase project " , he says the magic of book display is the ease with which they can be manipulated to present a certain front .
" The books we choose to display in our bookcases say a lot as to how we want others to see us , " says Mr Sandico .
" People who want to appear to have serious or academic reading tastes display their classics , while keeping popular novels at the back of the bookcases . "
The minimalist approach - bookcase , but no books
If you are more relaxed about the presentation of your shelves , they can give an insight into an owner 's character , he says .
" Books somehow reflect an aspect of our personality that people do n't easily see .
I have a friend who has a reputation for being an ice queen , but when I went to her place , I noticed all these cheesy romantic novels in her bookcases . "
There 's also a magpie aspect to our bookcase love .
Books , like anything that can be bought in quantity , appeal to our collecting , acquisitive , instinct .
Classic novels are always being re-issued with new cover designs and in different boxed sets .
Historical reference sets can be beautiful , leather bound and often extremely expensive .
Faking it
They are meant to be looked at and admired , says Mr Sandico .
" Being a bibliophile myself , I like to take a peek at what other bibliophiles have in their shelves .
It 's the same thing as any collection - if you 're into shoes , you 'd get giddy looking at other people 's shoe collection .
With a book collection , there 's always something surprising to see .
You never know what 's tucked in the shelves . "
Is bookcase wallpaper better than the real thing ?
When bookshelves are n't giving away our deepest secrets or providing browsing or boasting opportunities , they can be decor essentials in their own right , says Ms Geddes - Brown .
In fact , bookcases occasionally have nothing at all to do with reading .
" People definitely buy books to fill up bookcases ; sometimes they cover up the bindings to get an overall , supposedly elegant , effect .
And interior designers sometimes order books by the metre to fill up a library , if there is one in the house . "
But do n't despair if you do n't have your own interior designer styling your shelves .
If you long for the library look but do n't have the necessary number of novels , there are companies who make fake books to fill the gaps ( in your shelves if not your knowledge ) .
There are even ranges of " bookcase " wallpaper , which recreate the well - stocked effect for a fraction of the effort .
Although , as Ms Geddes - Brown points out , " the repetition of the same books does give the game away " .
For many of us , of course , the problem can be more about being book - rich , shelf - poor .
When this occurs and the charity shop rejects a box of your well - thumbed tomes , it might be comforting to know that you can get a " height extender " for the ubiquitous Billy .
I recently resorted to it - but then I keep two copies of Finnegans Wake , just in case visitors miss the first one .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I only ever buy books by authors I enjoy .
Maybe a literary snob might recoil in horror at my countless bookshelves of mystery thrillers , novels by Terry Pratchett and Robert Rankin and Mangas but I had fun reading every one of my books and I 've read most of them several times .
Who with a bookshelf only populated by " classics " can claim that ?
Only a few of the supposed ' classics ' truly are .
Oll Lewis , Woolsery , UK
Oh dear I have really just took a good look at my very neglected bookcases - full of books piled up on top of each other , drawing material , ornaments and knick - knacks and my dead cat 's ashes .
I even have a sumo wrestler stress ball .
Perhaps I am just a hoarder , but to me , these cases speak my language .
Overcrowded and chaotic .
Vera Kelly , Islington London Shortly after moving into a new flat with a downstairs " Billy " and an upstairs built - in bookshelf .

Needless to say , we are no longer a couple !

A long time ago , I read that as long as a house has books on the shelves and art on the walls , it 's a home .
That counsel has served me pretty well .
But Ayn Rand is always a deal - breaker .
Whenever I visit someone 's home for the first time , I scan the bookcases .
If I see any Rand , I glance anxiously at my watch , and announce that I 'd almost forgotten that I was expected elsewhere and really , really must be going .
JR , Brooklyn , USA I have three different book cases spread over the house .
In my living room I have a 6 foot by 6 foot case holding all the novels that I have been collecting from childhood from my beloved Roald Dahl complete collection to my trashy Stephen King horror novels and my collection of classics like 1984 and my wife 's true life novels and loads of play scripts .
In the Kitchen I have two small shelves with my cookery books on then , and my dining room is lined with shelves holding all my comic books ( over 30000 ) , graphic novels ( over 500 ) and Star Wars novels ( I'm a mega nerd ) .
I keep the books in order by genre and the comics in numerical order .
I love my books and probably spend too much money on them but when you hear guests remark on how lovely the cases are and how nice they look full of books it justifies the expense and having a varied collection always leads to interesting conversations and gives you a chance to introduce your friend to books they may have not read or even heard about .
Ciaran , Belfast I try and leave my books arranged in the order I read them .
My bookshelves have now taken on diary - like qualities for me - I can look over them and remember where I was , who I was going out with , or what frame of mind I was in when I read certain books .
A book collection is definitely an extension of self - the kind of book you pick up in a bookshop says a lot about you !
Laurie , London
As a family we have lots of books ( many in Billy bookcases ! ) and they are NOT on shelves for display , they are there so that we can easily find interesting reading matter .
I read and re-read books , many have been read seven or eight times and will be again .
Most days all four of us sit at dinner with a book next to our plates - our worst family bad habit !
Helen , Nottingham , UK I feel there is something inherently wrong about throwing away a book , to me throwing away a book is tantamount to burning it .
Ben , Rickmansworth
The article carries an implication that storing books in a bookcase ( rather than " just storing it away " ) is an affectation .
It is not .
Books may need to be referred to at any time following a discussion , article in a newspaper on TV or the radio .
The obvious solution to the need for easy access is to have them conveniently stored , spine visible .
Philip Smith , Stockport I own a set of book shelves .
It 's in my bedroom .
As a result no one sees it but my wife and I .
So why display them ?
For us .
It reminds us of what books we have and invites us to consider reading them .
After all , what 's the point in a book if you do n't read it ?
And it may be a case of out - of - sight - out - of - mind .
And in the event of an impulse read it 's right there to hand .
But then I work in a Library and believe books should be accessible .
Luke Cranenburgh , London I checked - I have 37 meters of bookshelf ( all completely full ! ) in my flat
Harry Andrews , Edinburgh
Of course serious bibliophiles use proper wall - mounted shelves .
If you have lots of books you need to consider floor loadings when using bookcases .
Mind you I do know of one couple who have the proper sliding book - stacks in an annexe to the house to cope with their collection .
Rupert Moss -Eccardt , Cambridge I love books and have more books than bookshelves .
When at the house of a friend I peruse their shelves , noting the books we have in common , the books they have that I do n't and judging them on what is on their shelves .
I am suspicious of people who do n't have books and very wary of people that do n't look at the books on my shelves .
Kay , Toronto , Canada
Just reading your piece on book cases has made me realise i might have a book problem - I can't seem to stop buying them and as i only have a small flat I have run out of room for bookcases - at the moment I have three large and two small ones in my front room - but the books are piled three deep and I need at least another one - there really is something comforting about being surrounded by books - and mine are by no means intellectual - I have among the better tomes more trash than a rubbish tip - but books are books .
Woody , Glasgow I often buy books - usually finding an author that I like - read all that they have written and then move on to search for a new author .
I give books to charity shops - but do keep books that have been particularly entertaining .
My book cases contain a strange mixture including Enid Blyton ( The Famous Five ) , Sherlock Holmes , Agatha Christie , war poetry by Wilfred Owen - all reflecting different periods in my life .
Reading a book , is for me the ultimate escapism - I love to immerse myself in another world .
Television and computers will never replace the joy of reading a book
J Murray , New Malden , Surrey
My bookcases are the even cheaper , but rugged , Ikea " Sten " real pine shelf system - sanded smooth .
They currently overflow with nearly 2,000 books .
Many of these are no longer available , or only at eye - watering prices .
This week I bought three books online about Peter Scott 's sculptor mother , Kathleen , which were published 1938 , 1949 / 51 , and 1995 .
The latter was offered on Amazon from £ 4.55 to £ 131.39 !
Chris JK , UK I love books - always have and always will .
I will read most anything put in front of me and admit that I peruse the bookshelves of other people .
One of my fondest memories of childhood is the anticipation of seeing what " hidden " gem I could uncover in the local library and the smell of a library book still gives me a thrill .
My bookcases have always been crammed and , as I 'm a person who loves to revisit a good story , hold many a beloved and tattered novel .

In the summer of 1998 or thereabouts -- dates are difficult to differentiate in the whorl of undergradute years -- I found an orange kitten huddled underneath my back porch .
It was winter and the kitten seemed starving , so I did what I could to introduce it into my household , which at the time consisted of one very angry and possessive woman who was having none of this interloper , so when my neighbors mentioned having lost their kitten the next day , it was better for everyone involved that he return home .
Two years and two kittens later -- the latter having been semi-almost - successfully integrated into the household -- my wife and I were returning from an ill - timed trip to the grocery store .
The Louisiana rain did as Louisiana rain does , soaking everything beyond the telling of it and as my wife and I shuffled our groceries out of the car and into the house , a wet orange ball followed us in .
Without even bothering to introduce himself , the cat who would be Finnegan walked over to a food bowl and began eating .
His silence -- as we would soon learn -- was unusual .
He had , it seemed , been hungry for some time , so we took him in for the night .
I checked with the neighbor the next day to see if she had misplaced her orange cat again , only to discover that my neighbor had moved .
Finnegan had not been welcome there anymore for reasons anyone who ever knew him would be incapable of understanding .
Granted , he did enjoy chewing through wires -- and the more expensive the equipment they were attached the better .
But the attention being paid to the noises in the headphones was better spent on him and he needed you to know that .
But he was n't sure you did -- so he asked you questions .
Finnegan always asked everybody questions , his voice rising into an interrogative with every subsequent mew .
Because he was never satisfied with any answer and would engage you in an endless interrogation into matters only he understood fully .
I mention this because the house is so quiet and unquestioned since his passing .
I walk around wondering why the world 's allowed to just exist and am reminded of the absence of its inquisitor .
Most of the time I think he was asking whether this or that inedible substance was edible .
We sometimes referred to him -- with love -- as " the Finnegoat " because he would eat anything and did so with evident relish .
It was his waning appetite that clued us in to the fact that something was wrong , and that something , as is often the case with elderly cats , fell to his kidneys .
We managed his condition with medication for almost five months -- five months in which I should have spent more time with him -- but in the end he let us know his time had come with his silence .
The bright boy who once questioned the world quieted his investigative assault and we knew what we had to do .
Not that that made it any easier because nothing makes losing someone who had been a part of your daily life for fifteen years any easier .
Some mornings I swear I hear him demanding of the staircase knowledge of its steepness or inquiring of a cabinet a reckoning of its contents .
And so as I write this a few months after his passing , I can only ask myself -- exactly as he would have asked me -- what took you so long and why are your eyes leaking and I saw a thing and is it time to eat ?
Australia 's abundant methane gas reserves found in coal seams could help power the world , according to a gas industry consultant .
Addressing a major offshore oil and gas industry conference in Darwin this week , Tony Regan of Tri-Zen International says there are also rich reserves of methane gas within coal seams in the Gladstone and Bowen Basin region of Queensland .
" These are large world scale projects , expect to see some consolidation , " he said .
" But at the moment , we have got five projects , potentially 28 million tonnes within five years .
That 's more than existing Australian northern production . "
Mr Regan says that globally there are more reserves of coal methane than conventional natural gas reserves , and Australian reserves represent about 40 per cent of the world 's proposed new projects .
" CBM [ coal - bed methane ] in Australia is very , very significant , " he said .
" Australian energy development is hugely significant .
Those projects there represent about 50 per cent of the total global proposed new capacity . "

" What are you in for ? " the inmate of Lee County jail asked the new prisoner .
" Rolling through a stop sign in my subdivision , " answered the new inmate , to gales of laughter from others languishing in the same cell .
As they laugh , crumbs from their hard , dry sandwiches — distributed by the wardens twice per day — flew from their mouths to add to the debris of filth on the floor that was ground up by the cracked plastic sleeping mats and absorbed by the old , thin blankets inmates use to keep warm in this cold and wet 8x8 room .
The new inmate today joined the 500 prisoners , among whom were some of the most violent threats to society — but also people who , like Inmate 501 , are no threat to anyone .
He had been trying to make his one phone call , to which you are supposedly entitled when you land in the big house .
The phone would only call collect , even for local calls .
That meant that it could n't call cell phones .
Most local services do n't even have collect - call options anymore .
So you dial and dial but the phone might as well be a prop on the wall .
There is no way out .
There is also no way for you to be called , by anyone .
You have no cell phone .
No laptop .
No book .
No watch , and there is no clock on the wall .
No one knows what time it is .
No one who does know will tell you .
Not even a single scrap of paper are you allowed to take into the cell after your arrest .
You can only stand there in your paper - thin prison clothes and plastic sandals .
" Man , this is jail , " someone screamed as the new inmate tried to dial for the tenth time .
" Jail !
Phones do n't work in JAIL ! "
So Inmate 501 stood for an unknown number of hours , hoping that he would be bailed out by his wife and kids who had seen him handcuffed and dragged away from home after Sunday brunch .
He also hoped that this would happen before he needed to use the toilet , which was filthy and frontally exposed to everyone , including the women coming and going .
The saga began last October , when he rolled through the same stop sign in front of a private swimming pool that he and fifty others roll through several times per day .
He thought he had paid the ticket but he had n't , and the court date came and went .
He received no other notices .
But something interesting was brewing in local politics after he received the ticket .
The local newspapers ran a series that claimed to unearth ticket - fixing going on in the Auburn city government .
It seems that some friends of powerful people were getting their tickets dismissed .
Auburn was already known for its lax enforcement but this had the whiff of corruption .
The papers lacked details but there were hints that the whole story was a result of a dispute between an elected official and an appointed city manager .
The city manager later resigned or was kicked out .
The suggestion of corruption was enough to attract the attention of the FBI , which made some inquiries .
The combination of the media pressure and FBI curiosity was enough to force a change in city policy .
The new policy in Auburn would be total crackdown on ticket violators , particularly those that did n't pay and did n't show up to their court dates .
Now , usually people who do n't show up for court dates for petty issues such as this are just contacted and eventually pay .
But technically , they can also be arrested , just as this person was .
When the city government is under pressure to show that it is not corrupt but good and clean and tough on crime , the result is that the fine print becomes a license for just about anything .
So in the last several months , the city has been busy issuing warrants for people who have outstanding tickets of any sort .
Cops have been tracking down people in their workplaces , homes , on the streets or anywhere , and treating them all like violent offenders .
The new prisoner , for example , who had never been arrested in his life , still had discolored marks on his wrists where the handcuffs had been slapped on .
We tend to think of the law as some sort of oiled machine that works according to the regulations .
The truth is that the law is administered by people with a great deal of discretion over how others are treated .
The wardens and correctional officials can choose to humiliate a person in whatever way they want .
They can put you in prison clothes that fit or in some that are way too tight .
They can tell you the time or not .
Leave you to languish or make a call for you .
They can insult you and lie about your status or be kind .
The only sure way to elicit something approaching humane behavior from them is to crawl and beg like a dog .
You are worse than a slave , because you have nothing of value to offer your new owners .
You are worse than an animal in a zoo because you are of no value to your captors .
They really do n't care if you live or die .
Those who do care cannot help .
No one has more discretion than the judge , who holds your life in his hands .
You are dependent on his mood of the moment .
If he lets you off easy , he considers himself benevolent .
If he sentences you to 10 years or a life in prison , he is only doing his job .
It 's always your fault for not having been sufficiently subservient at the outset .
The dramatic change in Inmate 501's life occurred in the course of minutes .
All it took was a knock on the door .
It mattered not at all that the supposed crime was completely innocuous .
Once you are on the wrong side of the law , your life is officially worth nothing to anyone but those who can do little or nothing to help you .
People talk of government compassion .
But there is no compassion in jail , which is where anyone who resists the state — even in the smallest way — ultimately ends up .
People talk of social justice but to implement it means requiring everyone to make a choice : obey or face humiliation and servitude .
Yes , people can " file grievances " or " sue , " and that is always the first thought of anyone who finds himself in the hands of captors .
But to whom do you appeal ?
Whom do you sue ?
You are here again appealing to the same class of people , the same group of coercive agents , who have robbed you of your freedom .
Your rights extend only as far as your masters allow them to extend .
People who criticize government as nothing but beating , killing , and hanging — to use Mises 's phrase — are sometime accused of using exaggerated and hyperbolic language .
Surely government is more than that and is not always that .
Something as simple as a stop sign does n't beat you or kill you !
And yet , what the critics of government mean is that all law , even that which appears to be a mere guideline and a help , must ultimately be enforced at the point of a gun .
It represents a threat to obey or lose all freedom .
This insight applies to all law , whether it results from a Constitution , legislation , or appears out of nothing more than a regulatory body .
Every regulation , no matter how small is enforced at the point of the gun .
Every tax can result in handcuffing and jailing and even killing those who fail to fork over .
Hidden behind each mandate is an armed tough in jackboots and a bulletproof vest who is prepared to beat and kill to serve the state and its laws .
As legislation extends , so does the coercive arm of the state , its police powers , its jails , and its reach over society .
It is like a poisonous fog that descends and grows more by the day , seeping into every nook and cranny of life : schools , businesses , homes , churches .
Nowhere is exempt .
The sound of the jailer 's key rattling grows louder and more ear - piercing .
The culture of the jail , where people are treated worse than animals , proliferates .
You can't move without risking life or limb .
At some point in his day , Inmate 501's heard someone holler out his name .
The electronic click on the bars sounded and the door opened .
He had been bailed out , $ 500 in cash having been extracted from his bank account and forked over to the city police .
He was now free — pending payment of the ticket and another court date .
He left behind 500 others who are not so fortunate .
Some of them are hardened criminals .
Others are in jail for smoking pot .
Others were in the same boat as he : a minor traffic violation gone wrong .
None have rights .
All are captive , like citizens in an occupied city where there is only violence and no law .
But how free is he really ?
He lives in a society where nothing takes place outside the purview of the state , which is to say that he will always live one step away from the prison cell that was his home for a day .
One or two wrong moves and he has lost it all .
All of society is not yet a jail such as you find in totalitarian societies or a society under occupation due to military conquest , but with every expansion of the state , the jailers get that much more power over all of us .
Their power is not always overt but it always lies in waiting .
This was triggered by a zealous cop looking to fill a ticket quota , and an attempt to clean up government from corruption — prompted by a media - driven non-scandal that attracted the attention of the Feds .
It resulted in personal catastrophe .
We really do n't get all the government we pay for , and thank goodness .
Lord protect us on the day that we do .
MINDGUARD PUBLIC LICENSE ( MGPL ) Version 0.1 , May 2000 Copyright ( C ) 1999 - 2000 Zapato Productions Intradimensional lyle at zapatopi dot net http://zapatopi.net/
Planet Earth
All persons not affiliated with evil mind - control agencies are hereby granted permission to copy and distribute unaltered copies of this license in its entirety .
Preramble
The licenses for most software are designed by memetic engineers to take away your freedom to think independently through engramatically harmonized semantics , legalistic hypnosyntax , and spirit - breaking CAPITALIZATION ( in all senses of the word ) .
By contrast , the MindGuard Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to think -- by guaranteeing your freedom to use , alter , and share free anti-mind - control software .
This Public License applies not only to MindGuard , but also to any other program whose authors commit to using it .
This includes you , assuming you are not an evil mind - control agent .
When I speak of free anti-mind - control software , I am referring to freedom of thought , not price .
This Public License is designed not only to make sure you have the freedom to think , but to also allow you to freely express your thoughts through the distribution of copies of free anti-mind - control software ( with service charge if you wish ) and the availability of said software 's source code , that you may change it or use parts of it in new free anti-mind - control programs .
For what is source code but thought logically expressed and haphazardly indented ?
To protect your mind from those that would subvert anti-mind - control software , restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you or ask you to give up your rights must be made .
These restrictions mean responsibilities for you if you distribute or modify copies of the software .
These responsibilities include giving all the rights that you have under this license to any recipients of copies of the software , regardless of whether any fee was involved or not ; making sure that they can get the source code , if they so choose ; and making sure that they know their rights as outlined in this license .
Your rights are protected by copyrighting the software and / or using this license which gives you legal permission to copy , distribute and / or modify the software .
Also , to protect anti-mind - control software authors from waves of bogus lawsuits by the psychotronically controlled puppets of the evil mind - control agencies , it is important that everyone understands that there is no warranty ( NO WARRANTY ) for this free anti-mind - control software .
If the software is tampered with by evil mind - control agents so that it , say , causes epileptic seizures in its users , those users should know that they were the victims of the evil mind - control agencies so that these crimes against Humanity do not reflect negatively on the original author nor cause people to stop using free anti-mind - control software .
Finally , any free anti-mind - control program is threatened constantly by those with political powers who are the very agents that this software was created to protect you from .
To avoid the danger that they will use their sway with patent offices to claim ownership of the software and thus make it proprietary and untrustworthy , any patent must be licensed for the free use of all non-evil mind - control agents or not licensed at all .
The mind - numbingly ( but not mind - controllingly ) precise terms and conditions for copying , distributing and modifying follow .
MINDGUARD PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING , DISTRIBUTING AND MODIFYING
0 .
The MindGuard Public License ( hereinafter referred to as " This License " or " this License " depending on its sentential positioning ) applies to any work ( hereinafter referred to as the " Program " ) which contains a notice placed by its copyright holder under his , her or its freewill ( " freewill " hereinbefore and hereinafter being defined as not being under the influence of any form of mind - control ) stating that said work may be distributed under the terms of this License .
A " work based on the Program " hereinafter means either the Program itself or a work containing a portion or the totality of the Program either with or without modifications , translations , transliterations , or transformations .
( Hereinafter , the term " modification " shall include , without limitations , the last four terms of the previous sentence excluding the term " or " unless " or " is used to refer to a boolean function applied to modify the Program or any part of it . )
Each licensee is addressed as " you " , as in the statement " You are a licensee " .
( The statement " You are not a licensee " will hereinafter have no logical meaning . )
Copying , distribution and modification are the only activities covered by this License .
If you are interested in other activities , please read another License and stop wasting both of our time .
You may run the Program free of restrictions .
The product of running the Program or a work based on the Program ( hereinafter referred to as the " Output " ) is covered by this License only if it constitutes , in whole or in part , a work based on the Program ( excluding consideration that it was made by running the Program ) or the Program itself .
This only applies if it happens to apply .
1 . unaltered copies of the Program 's source code as you received it may be copied , distributed , and / or posted , in any medium or mediums , so long as each copy contains an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty with excessive capitalizations ; that all notices that refer to this License and to the lack of warranty are kept intact and not modified ; and that any and all recipients of the Program or the Program 's source code are given a copy of this License included with the Program .
Fees may be levied for the act of distribution or transference of copies of the Program .
However , no fees of any sort shall be levied against a recipient of the Program for any Program related activities after it is has been transfered to him or her or it .
A fee for warranty protection may be offered , but a recipient must be under no obligation to accept the warranty .
Fees for support services may also be offered , but again no obligation to purchase those services shall be placed on the recipient of the Program .
( Hereinafter such practices as prohibited in the two previous sentences shall be referred to as " Naughty " . )
2 . You may modify any or all of your copies of the Program or any portion of said copies , thus forming a work based on the Program .
You may copy , distribute , or post such modifications or work as per the terms of Section 1 above , provided that the following conditions are met : a )
All modified copies of the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified them and the date of any modifications .
b)
Any work based on the Program , in whole or in part , that you distribute , publish , or post must be licensed as a whole under the terms of this License at no charge whatsoever to anyone .
c)
If the Program in its modified form runs interactively , it must be caused by you to print or display in its normal usage an appropriate notice as to its copyright and lack of warranty ( or if a warranty is offered as per Section 1 above , that it make notice of said warranty ) and that it notify users that it may be redistributed under the terms of this License and that it inform users on how to attain or view a copy of this License .
( Exception : if the Program on which your work is based does not do the above , your work based on the Program is not required to either . )
d)
You are not now , nor have you ever been , nor will you ever be an agent or sycophant of an organization or group , formal or informal , that aims , in whole or in part , to practice mind - control on any sentient or semi- sentient organism or entity for any purpose whatsoever ; or to subvert any form of anti-mind - control in any way whatsoever , including works based on the Program .
Nor shall you be an independent agent working toward those goals stated herein this Subsection 2d .
All hereinbefore terms apply to the modified work as a whole .
If parts of the work not based on the Program can be reasonably considered to be separate works independent of the parts based on the Program , then those parts are not covered under the Terms of this License provided that you distribute them as separate works .
Data files or separate module files not covered by the terms of this License that may be opened , read , or run by other works not covered under this License may be distributed with works under this License without this License applying to them .
If the above is not the case and the parts not based on the Program are distributed as a whole work with the Program or parts based on the Program , the distribution as a whole must come under the terms of this License , and those terms for and rights granted to licensees must extend to the whole entire work and every little part of it regardless of authorship , excepting such parts as you are not licensed or permitted to include in the whole work , which would presumably be there by an act of violation of copyright laws on your part .
Shame on you .
This section has no intention of claiming rights for or contesting your rights to work created entirely by you .
The intent of this section is to exercise the right to control the distribution of modified , collected , or derived works based on the Program .
The simple inclusion of a work or part of a work covered by this License , as delineated hereinbefore and hereinafter , on a storage or distribution medium does not bring any other works on said medium not covered by this License under the terms of this License .
If this paragraph was n't here , the Internet as a whole would fall under this License .
Are n't you glad I included it ?
3 . You may copy , distribute or publish the Program or work based on the Program in object code or executable form ( both hereinafter referred to as the " Binary " ) under the terms in Sections 1 and 2 hereinbefore , provided one of the following conditions is also met : a )
The Binary is accompanied with the complete corresponding machine - readable , non-encrypted source code , distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 hereinbefore on a medium normally used for the exchange of software by users of the intended computing platform or platforms of the Program ; or , b ) The Binary must come with a written offer , valid for at least pi years , to give any third party , for a fee no greater than the actual cost to you of source code distribution , a complete copy of the corresponding source code as described in Subsection 3a hereinbefore to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 hereinbefore on a medium as described in Subsection 3a hereinbefore ; or , c ) The Binary must come with the offer to distribute the corresponding source code that you received when you received the Binary .
( This option only applies to noncommercial distributions and only if the binary you received came with such an offer as described in Subsection 3 b hereinbefore . )
Hereinbefore and hereinafter , the " source code " for a work shall mean the form of the work preferred for making modifications to it by sane programmers or what passes for sane programmers in normal situations .
For Binary distributions , complete source code means all the source code for all the Binary files it contains , plus any associated files , scripts or data needed for the compilation and installation process of the Binary files .
Files included in the distribution but not covered by this License , as described in Section 2 , shall be excepted from the previous condition .
Also excepted shall be anything that is normally distributed ( in either source or binary form ) with the major components of the operating system or environment which the Binary runs on or with , unless that component itself is distributed with the Binary .
If the Binary distribution is made by offering access to copy from a location , either physical or cyberspatial , then offering the exact same access to copy source code , even if third parties are not compelled to do so , satisfies the conditions of this Section .
4 . You may not copy , modify , distribute , post , or sublicense the Program except as described under the terms of this License .
Any attempt to do anything with or to the Program that is counter to the word or intent of this License is void , and will automatically terminate all your rights under this License , you jerk .
However , any party who has received copies or rights from you under the terms of this License shall not have his , her or its licenses terminated so long as he , she or it remains a good little licensee and follows the conditions and terms of this License .
5 . There is no obligation for you to accept this License , as you have not signed it .
However , you have no rights under the Law , outside of this License , to copy , modify , or distribute the Program or create works based on the Program .
By doing any of the above actions , you are implicitly agreeing to accept all the terms and conditions of this License for all actions it covers .
6 . Every recipient of the Program or any work based on the Program automatically receives a license from the original licensor to do any of the actions covered in this License under the terms and conditions of this License .
You may not impose on any recipient any further terms or conditions or restrict any recipient 's exercise of their rights as granted herein .
You have no responsibility for enforcing the compliance of others to the terms and conditions of this License .
You are not your licensee 's keeper .
7 . If any reason whatsoever causes you to be unable or unwilling to abide by the exact and complete terms and conditions of this License , be it court judgments on ( but not limited to ) patent and / or copyright issues ; financial , physical , mental , and / or any other disability ; and / or any form of personal disagreement with the letter and / or intent of this License and / or with any and / or all licensors and / or licensees ; then you may not distribute the Program at all as long as said reason and / or reasons still apply , or other similar reasons surface .
For example : if you are under the influence of mind - control that compels you to alter the Program such that it serves to subvert any anti-mind - control properties of the Program and / or help the evil forces of mind - control in their bid to destroy the freewill of Humanity and subjugate Humanity to mental slavery as per Subsection 2d hereinbefore , then the only way you could satisfy this License would be to not distribute the Program or the work based on the Program at all .
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance , then all the rest will still apply and the section as a whole will apply in any and all other circumstances .
This section does n't intend for you to do any bad things ; it only desires that you do good and / or legal things .
The purpose of this section is to protect the integrity of the free anti-mind - control distribution system by making sure that only those willing and / or able to abide by this License in its entirety , at all times , attempt to exercise any or all rights granted herein .
8 . If the distribution and / or use of the Program is restricted in certain political bodies by copyright or patent concerns , the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may explicitly exclude distribution in those geographical or political bodies , such that distribution is limited to only those geopolitical bodies not thus excluded .
If this is so , said distribution limitations shall be considered as if included in the body of this License .
Restrictions on distribution and / or use of the Program for purely political reasons ( such as , but not limited to , governmental interest in mind - control hegemony ) shall not -- for the greater good of Humanity - - be considered as reason for geopolitical distribution limitations .
Fight the Power !

Such new versions will be similar to the present version in general intent , but may differ in details .
Each version is to be given an unique version number .
The following terms explain which version is applicable for the Program : a )
If the Program specifies a specific version , then the Program is licensed only under that version of the License . b)

If the Program does not specify a version , then you may follow the terms of any version of the License ever published as per Section 9 , Paragraph 1 herein . d)
If the Program specifies that it is licensed under the " most recent version " , then only the terms and conditions of the most recent version of the License applies and the terms and conditions of all previous versions shall be considered void .
Voidification of previous terms and conditions only applies for actions after the release date of the most recent version of the License and shall not be retroactive , however it shall extend to all spawned licensees as per Sections 2 , 6 , and others hereinbefore .
If the Program gives an option , as per Subsections 9 b and 9c hereinbefore , as to which version of the License may apply , that option must also be extended to all licensees of copies of the Program or works based on the program .
10 .
You may not incorporate the Program or parts of the Program into other works whose distribution and licensing conditions differ from this License unless the author of the other work gives you explicit permission to , which must include unconditionally agreeing to the conditions of this License ; or the resulting work is for personal , private , non-distributed use only .

YAY !
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix : Lets Apply These Terms to Your New Program !
If you developed new anti-mind - control software and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to Humanity in its struggle against the Forces of Evil , the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that everyone can redistribute , but only non-evil people can modify , under these terms .
To do so , attach the following notices to the program , preferably to the start of each source file , making sure that the NO WARRANTY notice is annoyingly prominent .
At the very least , the copyright notice and a pointer to the full notice should be included .

NEW HAVEN , Conn . |
A majority of Americans surveyed think dropping atomic bombs on Japan during World War II was the right thing to do , but support was weaker among Democrats , women , younger voters and minority voters , according to a Quinnipiac University poll .
The poll , released Tuesday , found 61 percent of the more than 2,400 American voters questioned think the U.S. did the right thing ; 22 percent called it wrong , and 16 percent were undecided .
The first bomb was dropped Aug. 6 , 1945 , on Hiroshima .
An estimated 140,000 people were killed instantly or died within a few months .
Tens of thousands more died from radiation poisoning in the years following .
Three days later , another bomb was dropped on Nagasaki , killing about 80,000 people .
Japan surrendered less than a week later .
“ Sixty - four years after the dawn of the atomic age , one in five Americans think President Harry Truman made a mistake dropping the bomb , ” said Peter A. Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
The poll asked a single question : “ Do you think the United States did the right thing or the wrong thing by dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ? ”
Among voters over 55 years of age , 73 percent of those surveyed approved the decision , while 13 percent opposed .
Sixty percent of voters 35 to 54 approved , while 50 percent approved among voters 18 to 34 years old , according to the poll .
“ Voters who remember the horrors of World War II overwhelmingly support Truman ’s decision , ” Mr. Brown said .
“ Support drops with age , from the generation that grew up with the nuclear fear of the Cold War to the youngest voters , who know less about WW II or the Cold War . ”
Only 34 percent of black voters and 44 percent of Hispanic voters approved the decision , according to the poll .
But Mr. Brown cautioned that the polling sample was smaller for those groups , so officials said the margin of error was 8 percentage points for blacks and 10 percentage points for Hispanics .
Support for Mr. Truman ’s decision was much stronger among Republicans than Democrats and among men than women .
Among Democrats surveyed , 49 percent approved , while 74 percent of Republicans supported his decision .
Among women questioned , 51 percent supported the bombing , compared with 72 percent of men surveyed .
The poll showed about 70 percent of white Protestants , Catholics and evangelical Christians supported the bombing , while 58 percent of Jews approved .
The margin of error was 12 percentage points for Jewish voters , officials said .
Quinnipiac surveyed 2,409 registered voters from July 27 to Aug. 3 . The poll has a margin of error overall of 2 percentage points .

However , with 650,000 + posts being published daily and the obvious risk of tag spam , Tumblr has included a sliding filter that allows you to narrow down these results based on " likes " ( the site 's internal favorites feature ) and " reblogs " .
The company also claims to have developed " Built - in throttling ... [ that ] prevents monopolization by individual blogs . "
First Step to Real - Time Search
In short : Tumblr is getting into the real - time search game , allowing users to contribute to a tag channel and find others who share their interests .
It 's a move that makes Tumblr more public : in its early days it was a fairly closed community .
The move could pave the way for a more robust real - time search , too , and perhaps even a search API ala Twitter .
Access to such a stream would provide another source of real - time data for real - time search providers like OneRiot .
Facebook Integration
Separately , Tumblr is also releasing Facebook integration : photo posts , audio posts , videos and quotes are all properly styled to post properly to Facebook pages .
The changes come after a successful July for the company : 255 million pageviews were served that month .
Police are trying to find the owner of a motorbike who assaulted a 39 - year - old man after he stole and crashed his Harley - Davidson .
Police say the man stole the bike at Greenwell Point near Nowra on the New South Wales south coast yesterday afternoon and was taking it for a ride around the township when he lost control of it .
Police say the accident caused the bike to cartwheel down the street , while the rider ended up in a garden bed with a stake embedded through his right arm and out of his back .
Police say the owner of the bike found the man a short time later and took his bike back , but not before punching him in the face and pulling the stake out of his torso .
Ambulance paramedics arrived shortly after to treat him .
He was then airlifted to Sydney 's St George Hospital with a broken nose and internal injuries .

As seen on Famitsu .
Nearly two years ago we published a list of ten things that we either do n’t think have a name , or do n’t use the correct name for .
Today we are looking at another 10 English words that describe things we are all aware of , but do n’t have a word for .
Let ’s see if anyone can use all ten in a sentence .
10 Petrichor
Use : “ Nothing beats the petrichor in the morning as the dew fades . ”
Petrichor is the name of the smell of rain on dry earth .
The word comes from the Greek words “ petros ” which means rock , and “ ichor ” which means the fluid that runs through the veins of the gods .
The smell derives from an oil exuded by certain plants during dry periods , whereupon it is adsorbed ( another word you probably did n’t know – definition ) by clay - based soils and rocks .
During rain , the oil is released into the air along with another compound , geosmin , producing the distinctive scent .
9 Elflock
Use : “ After the bitch - fight , her head was full of elflocks . ”
An elflock is a lock of hair which has become tangled .
The word originates from the 16th century and is simply a combination of the word “ elf ” and the word “ lock ” .
Elf either refers to the mythical creature or the number eleven , so its use in the word “ elflock ” does n’t seem entirely obvious to me .
8 Nidor
Use : “ The kitchen is filled with the nidor of lamb . ”
Nidor is the smell of burning animal fat .
More broadly ( going back to its Latin root ) it can be used to refer to the steamy smell of anything cooking in a kitchen .
The word seems to be derived through the Latin from the Greek “ kniddia ” which I cannot find a definition for – perhaps someone can fill in the blanks for us .
7 Salmagundi
Use : “ Tonight mom is making a salmagundi – it is my favorite stew ! ”
The word salmagundi originally meant a stew of mixed meats , fish , herbs , and vegetables cooked in vinegar or wine .
It can also be used to refer to a mixture of ingredients in general .
In a corrupted form , the Australians use the word “ hashmagandy ” to refer to an outback stew .
The origins of the word appear to be from old French “ salemine ” which ultimately led to the modern French “ salmigondis ” which means seasoned salt meats .
6 Scree
Use : “ We are going to climb that scree in the distance . ”
Scree is the word for a pile of rubble found at the bottom of a cliff .
It is also sometimes known as talus ( French meaning slope ) , though talus generally refers to larger chunks of debris , while scree refers to small chunks such as loose gravel .
It comes to English from Old Norse “ skritha ” which means “ landslide ” .
5 Don Juanism
Use : “ The majority of teenaged males on the internet suffer from Don Juanism . ”
Don Juanism is the term used to describe an obsessive preoccupation with sexual gratification or conquest which often leads to transient and sometimes exploitative relationships .
The term comes , of course , from Don Juan , the legendary libertine who spends much of his time trying to seduce women .
4 Tenesmus
Use : “ Can I please use your bathroom ?
I have a serious case of tenesmus . ”
Tenesmus is the uncomfortable feeling one has when needing to poop .
It also refers to the feeling of having not emptied the bowel fully or the need to strain to do so .
To put it more simply , tenesmus is a distressing but ineffectual urge to evacuate the rectum or bladder .
The word , appropriately , comes to us from the Greek “ teinesmos ” which means “ to stretch ” or “ to strain ” .
3 Podsnap
Use : “ Kanye West is a total podsnap – he thinks he is awesome when he is actually a douche . ”
A podsnap is a person who is self - satisfied and can’t face up to unpleasant facts .
The word is an eponym ( the name of a person after whom something else is named ) for the character Mr John Podsnap in Charles Dickens ’ “ Our Mutual Friend ” – needless to say Mr Podsnap has the characteristics from which his name is taken .
2 Hibernaculum
Use : “ As winter approaches , the bear goes in search of its hibernaculum . ”
Hibernaculum is the name given to the cave or area in which an animal hibernates .
The word is a Latin one which means “ tent for winter quarters ” .
It is now also an English word but has moved its frame of reference from the human world to the animal world .
1 Muliebrity
Use : “ Rosie O’Donnell has all the muliebrity of a block of wood . ”
The term muliebrity means “ womanly attributes ” .
For example , it might be said that Michael Jackson had a touch of muliebrity while Rosie O’Donnell lacks it .
The term can also be understood as the state of being an adult woman .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Gertrude Baines , the world 's oldest person , has died in Los Angeles , California , at the age of 115 , according to the home where she lived and Guinness World Records said Saturday .
Gertrude Baines said she attributed her longevity to not drinking or smoking .
Gertrude Baines passed away at the Western Convalescent Hospital at 7:25 a.m. ( 10:25 a.m. ET ) Friday , Guinness World Records said .
Born in 1894 , Baines became the world 's oldest person in January after the death of another 115 - year - old , Maria de Jesus , from Portugal , Guinness World Records said .
At her 115th birthday party in April , Baines shook her head in disbelief when presented with the certificate saying she was now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's oldest person .
" She told me that she owes her longevity to the Lord , that she never did drink , never did smoke , and she never did fool around , " her doctor , Dr. Charles Witt , said in April .
Baines , whose grandparents were slaves , worked as a maid in Ohio State University dormitories until her retirement , and lived at the Los Angeles convalescent home for more than 10 years .
Last November , she became the oldest African - American to vote for President Obama and received a letter from him on her 115th birthday , Guinness World Records said .
Witt said Baines planned to vote for Obama again in 2012 .
Asked why she voted for Obama , Baines said it was because " he's for the colored people , " according to footage from The Los Angeles Times .
She said she never thought a black man could become president .
" Everybody 's glad for a colored man to be in there sometime , " Baines said .
" We all are the same on the skin .
It 's dark , and theirs is white . "
Baines had few complaints , her doctor said .
She fussed about the bacon not being crisp enough and the arthritis in her knees , Witt said .
The smooth skin on Baines ' face belied her 115 years , but she did n't attribute that to any anti-wrinkle cream or miracle product , according to her best friend , Lucille Fayall .
She said Baines simply washed her face in cold water .

Surprisingly enough , the process of getting a divorce does not have to take months and years .
If your spouse does not contest the articles of the divorce , you can complete the proceedings in as little as twenty - four hours .
Of course , you may need to travel or make some additional arrangements in order to take advantage of these options .
Quick Divorces in the United States
Unfortunately , getting a quick divorce in the United States is not as simple as getting one overseas .
In the US , the guidelines for obtaining a divorce differ from state to state .
Even though you may be able to get a divorce without proving your spouse did something wrong or immoral , you may still have to be separated for a certain amount of time before the divorce can be finalized .
Typically , this time period is one to two years .
If your spouse contests the divorce terms or there are disagreements about how to divide financial assets , the time period can be much longer .
Online Divorces
The legal fees associated with a divorce can be huge – and out of reach for many people .
Fortunately , you can draft the forms to file for a divorce online .
There are many websites available to help you fill out the necessary forms in order to file in your state .
All you ’ll need to do is print them out and file them in the appropriate divorce court .
That said , if you suspect your spouse will contest the divorce , it ’s best to have a lawyer to protect your interests – divorce templates found online may not offer you the specific provisions you want .
If you opt to file for a divorce using internet - based form paperwork , you ’ll still need to meet the guidelines for your state .
These may include having reasonable grounds for a divorce or going through the mandatory waiting period .
While this form of divorce may be easier to file for , it can be just as time consuming as going through a lawyer .
Getting Divorced Overseas
Every country has different guidelines for getting a divorce , and – in some cases – you can get a divorce faster overseas .
However , before embarking your trans -Atlantic adventure , you ’ll need to make sure that the state you ’re living in recognizes the legality of your divorce .
For example , in the Dominican Republic , all you ’ll need to do is agree that you and your spouse are not compatible – there ’s no need to prove that one partner committed adultery or any type of fraud .
As long as one spouse goes to court , the other can simply be represented by a lawyer .
Typically , if you elect to go to the Dominican Republic , your divorce will be finalized within twenty - four hours .
In many cases , these divorces are recognized as legal in the United States .
Statistically speaking , almost 50 % of new marriages will end in divorce .
While this unfortunate trend has an enormous impact on families , it ’s important to realize that some people simply are n’t meant to be together .
In some cases , you and your spouse may agree that it ’s best to end the marriage as quickly as possible .
If you do n’t want to go through an extensive waiting period or if you ca n’t shell out thousands of dollars involved in legal fees , consider some of these options for a cheap and easy divorce .
How to Stay Sane During a Stressful Divorce
If you are undergoing a completely amicable separation and divorce , where there are no children involved , and there is complete agreement on both sides respecting the division of assets , you may find your divorce relatively stress - free .
However , where there are disputes regarding child custody or support , spousal support and / or the division of assets , separation and divorce are likely to be very stressful events .
In addition to the stress regarding the resolution of the above issues , there may also be stress manifested from other factors which may come into play : your extended family may be conflicted over the situation , your own friends may feel uncomfortable with you in familiar social settings , your financial situation may become unstable and so on .
If you have a stable , long - term position with extended benefits , you may be able to take a paid stress - leave .
For those women that cannot take a break from their usual responsibilities for work , child - rearing and more , there are nonetheless certain steps that can be undertaken to help lower your level of stress , so that you can keep your sanity during a difficult separation and divorce .
Set the intention to take a short “ time out ” each day to sit quietly , and during this quiet time , inform your mind that you are the master of your own destiny , ( even if you do n’t quite believe it ) .
Envision your future in the manner that you desire .
Spending time worrying about undesirable outcomes is understandable , but it is a futile exercise .
When you start to roll over negative thoughts in your head , recognize that the worry is hurting you , and it ’s not helping to resolve any problems .
If you are concerned about specific issues , jot them down into a “ worry journal ” and concentrate on releasing the thoughts until you can discuss them with an appropriate professional , or a competent and trustworthy friend .
Find something that makes you happy , whether it is a favorite song , or a picture ( the “ mood - shifter ” ) .
When you start to feel sad thoughts creeping into your consciousness , make a concerted effort to shift your mood by thinking of the mood shifter .
If you find yourself getting angry over your situation , use this emotion in a positive fashion .
Anger can be used constructively , to give a person the motivation and initiative necessary to accomplish incredible tasks .
Conversely , if allowed to expand without constraint , anger can destroy a person .
Keep your negative emotions harnessed , but realize that they can be powerful tools for helping you to overcome incredible odds .
To re-gain a sense of control in your life , start setting a daily goal which is small , simple and easy to attain .
Accomplishing this goal will give you a sense of pride , and as you slowly increase the size and complexity of your goal , you will re-gain your sense of control over your life that is otherwise being robbed by the uncertainty of your situation .
Become educated on the legal process of separation and divorce , in your locale .
If consultations with your family lawyer are cost - prohibitive , ask the family law division of the Court in your locale , for free , easy - to - understand , and informational resources , for this purpose .
Accept the fact that , at times , your stress may be difficult to manage , and you may become emotional , however , also remember that the passage of time will make the situation better .
Connect with other persons who are undergoing similar experiences .
If your personal situation is making your work or personal life impossible to manage or is seriously interfering with your ability to work , or care for your family , please consult a specialist .
Iranian authorities released a French researcher from Tehran ’s Evin Prison into the custody of diplomats Sunday , even as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the West for the mass protests that followed his disputed reelection in June .
The Iranian leader also named a hard - line loyalist with strong ties to the Revolutionary Guard and the pro-government Basiji militia to oversee the country ’s vast intelligence infrastructure .
The release of Clotilde Reiss , 24 , eases strains between the Islamic Republic and Europe .
The Persian - speaking scholar was arrested July 1 and charged with undermining Iran ’s national security by participating in demonstrations after the June 12 election .
She appeared before television cameras last weekend to confess in court to taking pictures and sending an e-mail to friends and colleagues about unrest in the city of Esfahan .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke briefly with Reiss , who was “ healthy and in good spirits , ” according to a statement released by his office .
He stressed the role of Syria , a strategic ally of Iran , in helping secure her release .
Reiss must remain in Iran pending a verdict in her case , though Sarkozy called on Iran to drop the charges against her as well as those faced by a French - Iranian dual citizen employed by the French Embassy in Iran .
Iranian hard - liners have repeatedly blamed the West for triggering the postelection unrest .

“ You have openly meddled in Iran ’s domestic affairs , ” Ahmadinejad said of the West in a televised speech Sunday to religious scholars .
“ With your immature thoughts you believed you could damage the establishment of the Islamic Republic .
But the Iranian nation does not care about you .
The noise that you are creating in the world is not a sign of your strength but of your weakness and downfall . ”
Iranian authorities cracked down on dissent in the face of the protests , but that has failed to quiet government opponents .
On Sunday , a group of Iranian clergy released a letter , published on reformist websites , calling for the removal of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei because he had violated the constitution by allowing “ flagrant violations of the law ” in the postelection period .
Ahmadinejad has already taken de facto control of Iran ’s Intelligence Ministry after purging it of officials deemed insufficiently loyal .
On Sunday , he nominated Heydar Moslehi , a mid-ranking cleric , to lead the ministry , which controls a vast trove of data on Iranians as well as an extensive human and electronic surveillance infrastructure .
Moslehi served as an advisor to Ahmadinejad on clerical affairs and is close to Khamenei .
The Iranian president also proposed two women for Cabinet posts : Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi for the Health Ministry and Fatemeh Ajorlou to head the nation ’s vast Welfare and Social Security Ministry .

Y aurait - il dans l'ADN gaulois un gène qui empêcherait de parler , voire de comprendre l'anglais ?
A l'heure où la génétique aide à comprendre les dégénérescences et autres blocages , on aimerait qu'elle nous explique pourquoi les Français restent irrémédiablement imperméables à la langue de Shakespeare .
A moins que le vrai problème ne soit notre système éducatif et que les étudiants qui remontent la moyenne ne fassent partie des 170 000 jeunes favorisés qui partent chaque année en séjour linguistique à l'étranger ?
Is there a gene in the Gaulish DNA that could prevent one from speaking , even understanding English ?
Now that genetics helps explain degeneration and other mental blocks , maybe it can tell us if the French are irremediably impermeable to the language of Shakespeare .
At least it might tell us that the real problem is not our educational system and that the students that raise the average are not among those privileged 170,000 young people who leave to study English abroad each year ?
Le Monde reports French educationalists are soul - searching over French students ' poor showing in an international TOEFL league table .
France ranked 69th out of 109 countries in prowess at speaking , reading and understanding English .
And , even worse , these were the ' better ' ones , those who were trying to get into university in an English - speaking country .
It must surely irk former Education Xavier Darcos , whose quixotic long - term plan was to produce bilingual students ( in the main speaking English as a second language ) by the end of their schooling .
Le Monde wonders if the problem might not lie with the educational system at all :
It 's a typically French pre-occupation to search for the rot in the educational system rather than elsewhere , and by way of a rather strained syllogism , if the fault lies not there , it must lie in the constitution of the average Frenchman or woman .
The answer is rather simpler and has little to do with schooling or education .
There 's nothing particularly unusual in French teenagers being unable to speak English well upon leaving school - English speakers rarely master a foreign language through school alone .
But of course , France being France , coming so far down the table behind smaller , less prestigious countries rankles .
And if the Netherlands or Sweden or Norway can command so many good English - speakers , why ca n't France ?
The problem though has little to do with education , or even teaching .
Scandinavian and other smaller countries usually speak languages unique to themselves or only one or two others .
So the need to speak a( and these days that is , for better or worse , English ) is more pressing .
People from small countries are also usually more outward - looking than those from larger ones , and only Germany in this test scored highly as a big country .
Finally , children in countries where English is understood and spoken widely , such as Scandinavia , the Netherlands , Finland and Portugal , learn relatively little from teachers , few of whom are native speakers in any case .
They learn at home , through direct , daily exposure to English ; in those countries American films and TV programmes are subtitled rather than dubbed .
In France , the vast majority of imported product goes out inA language is only as good as how useful it is to you , and if one relies on artificial situations concocted in a classroom isolated from the language as it is genuinely spoken , the necessity to learn is weakened and inhibition built up .
It 's ridiculous to say that French people are genetically or culturally indisposed to learning English ; I know many that speak good English , and it usually follows on from an interest in Anglophone culture , be it film , music , literature , fashion or sport .
And , needless to say , in none of these is this interest at the expense of an interest in their own native culture .
If France wants to get serious about its citizens learning English ( and the way the world is going , it 's probably in its best interests to ) it should break with its isolationist linguistic protectionism .
Ban imported film and television being dubbed into French and make people watch them in the original language with subtitles .
It 's a harsh measure but after only a few years the difference would be noticeable , and France would even be spared the feared deluge of ' Anglo - Saxon ' culture .
But that 's unlikely to happen and , in 30 years ' time France will still be plodding along with middling English and wondering why the linguistic gods cursed them with a genetic inability to learn .

In his speech at the BIS conference in Basel , Switzerland , the president of the New York Federal Reserve , William Dudley , argued that asset bubbles pose a serious threat to real economic activity .
He holds the view that the US central bank should develop effective tools to counter this menace .
As things stand at present , said Dudley , a monetary policy that relies on short - term interest rates is not well - suited to deal with the emergence of bubbles .
According to Dudley , it should be the role of the Fed to stop the expansion of the bubble while it is still in the making .
For instance , he argues :
Let 's take the housing bubble as an example .
Housing prices rose far faster than income .
As a result , underwriting standards deteriorated .
If regulators had forced mortgage originators to tighten up their standards or had forced the originators and securities issuers to keep " skin in the game , " I think the housing bubble might not have been so big .
Hence , argues Dudley ,
I think that this crisis has demonstrated that the cost of waiting to clean up asset bubbles after they burst can be very high .
That suggests we should explore how to respond earlier .
Defining Bubbles
During his speech , the New York Fed chief executive never presented his definition of what a bubble is .
We suspect that by bubble he means a very large — that is , strongly above the historical average — increase in asset prices .
If we adopt this view , it would appear that the Fed has nothing to do with bubbles , and that ( if anything ) the US central bank is here to confront and eliminate this menace , which poses a threat to the well being of the US economy .
According to this way of thinking , the present economic crisis occurred on account of the bursting of a gigantic housing bubble , and were it not for Fed chairman Ben Bernanke , the outcome of the bust could have been catastrophic for the US economy .
We have seen that according to popular thinking , an asset bubble is a large increase in asset prices .
A price is the amount of dollars paid for a given thing .
We may just as well say , then , that a bubble is a large increase in the payment of dollars for various assets .
As a rule , in order for this to occur there must be an increase in the pool of dollars , or the pool of money .
So , if one accepts the popular definition of what a bubble is , one must also concede that without an expansion in the pool of money , bubbles cannot emerge .
If the pool of money is not expanding , then people — irrespective of their psychological disposition — simply do not have the ability to generate bubbles in various markets .
However , once the pool of money begins to expand , various individuals who have access to the new money can divert various assets to themselves by bidding asset prices higher .
Furthermore , once the suppliers of goods observe that the prices of their goods are starting to go up , they begin to boost production .
The increase in the production of goods is made possible by securing bank loans , which are expanded out of thin air — that is , through fractional reserve lending .
" How can massive monetary pumping and bottom - level interest rates possibly prevent an economic disaster ? "
Note that credit out of thin air enables the borrowers to attain various resources by bidding their prices higher .
This leaves fewer resources at the disposal of the genuine wealth generators .
Now , the key source in the expansion of the pool of money is the Fed 's monetary pumping and commercial bank fractional - reserve lending .
Of these two sources , the greater force is the monetary pumping of the central bank .
Without the central bank creating new money , banks cannot expand credit out of thin air .
Note that an increase in the growth momentum of asset prices implies an increase in the growth momentum of the money supply .
If , for whatever reason , the central bank slows down on the monetary pumping , this leads to a decline in the growth momentum of asset prices .
Consequently , some market players are likely to start locking in their profits by selling assets .
Once more and more players begin trying to protect their profits , their actions quickly lead to a bursting of the asset bubble .
Note that the trigger for the burst is actually the decline in the growth momentum of money supply .
Again , as a rule the decline in the growth momentum of money supply is set in motion by a decline in the monetary pumping by the Fed .
So how can the central bank stop the emergence of asset bubbles ?
By not creating money out of thin air .
Examining the Evidence
Is it true , as Dudley maintains , that the Fed under Bernanke has prevented another economic depression in the United States ?
And what exactly did the Fed do to prevent the disaster ?
Under the guidance of Ben Bernanke , the US central bank has lowered the federal funds rate from 5.25 % in September 2007 to the current level of 0 % .
Since September of last year , the Fed has boosted the pace of money pumping through an aggressive expansion of its balance sheet .
( The Fed has been buying assets and paying for this with money out of thin air ) .
As a result , the yearly rate of growth of Fed 's balance sheet jumped from 3.9 % in August 2008 to 152.8 % by December of that same year .
The size of the balance sheet climbed from $ 0.9 trillion in August 2008 to $ 2.1 trillion by April 2009 .
In response to all of this pumping , the growth momentum of monetary measure AMS has accelerated .
The yearly rate of growth jumped from 1.8 % in August 2008 to 14.3 % by June of this year .
The question that needs to be addressed is this : how can massive monetary pumping and bottom - level interest rates possibly prevent an economic disaster ?
Careful analysis shows that all these actions can do is to redistribute existing real savings — that is , real wealth — which is necessary to support economic activity .
All that aggressive Fed policies have actually achieved is weakening of the process of real wealth formation .
This , in turn , has only weakened — and not strengthened — the economy 's ability to grow .
The only reason why the US economy did n't fall into a depression is because the pool of real savings is still holding its ground .
Conclusion
According to William Dudley , the US central bank should pay much closer attention to asset bubbles .
The New York Fed chief holds the view that these bubbles pose a serious threat to real economic growth .
He holds that , by means of its policy tools , the Fed can suppress bubbles in their early stages of emergence .
He believes this to be an important factor in preventing unnecessary , deep recessions .
At no point in his speech did Mr. Dudley raise the possibility that the main source of asset bubbles could be the US central bank itself .
We suggest that the best way to prevent the emergence of asset bubbles is to stop the Fed from pushing massive amounts of money to the economy .
In a high profile press conference in the city of Zahedan , Iran , international media gathered to hear a statement from Abdolhamid Rigi , a high ranking member of the Balochi separatist movement Jundallah who is awaiting execution by the Iranian government for his role in a series of murders .
Abdolhamid Rigi
Rigi , whose brother Abdolmalek Rigi is the leader of the militant group , addressed a wide variety of topics and made several claims regarding long - suspected links the group has to various international organizations .
In particular , Rigi confirmed that Jundallah previously had ties with al - Qaeda for operations in Pakistan , and that the groups split in 2003 over differences of opinion about strategy in Iran .
Not long after severing its ties with al - Qaeda , the group started a relationship with the United States government .
That fact has never been disputed , indeed US officials have repeatedly confirmed that the government has secretly encouraged and advised Jundallah as it fights the Iranian government .
But Rigi insisted the US ties went well beyond encouragement .
Rigi insisted that five years ago when the relationship began the US government gave the group $ 100,000 and promised to provide it with “ everything we needed . ”
He also claimed that the US was directing the group ’s attacks , saying “ they told us whom to shoot and whom not to .
All orders came from them . ”
Previously US officials had insisted the government was deliberately avoiding direct funding to avoid Congressional oversight , but the Bush Administration did funnel considerable money into “ covert ” operations against the Iranian government .
As Jundallah has been launching high profile suicide bombings for years , any verification of direct US funding or ordering of the movement is likely to produce a considerable scandal .
Washington ’s punditocracy is in mourning over the death of right - wing columnist Robert Novak , with many warm remembrances about his outsized personality and his supposed love of reporting .
But Novak often served as a dishonest propagandist and would have been condemned in a healthy journalistic world .
For instance , not only did Novak disclose the identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame in 2003 – in line with a White House campaign to discredit her husband , former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson , for criticizing the deceptions behind the Iraq invasion – but Novak continued a jihad of lies against Wilson and Plame for the next several years .
In one such attack on March 22 , 2007 , Novak reprised right - wing myths that had been disseminated about the Plame - gate case to protect the political flanks of President George W. Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and other participants in the anti-Wilson campaign .
Despite containing a litany of lies , Novak ’s column was uncritically published in the Washington Post ’s editorial section , which even cribbed from Novak ’s disinformation for use in the Post ’s own ugly attacks on Wilson , whose principal sin appears to have been that he was the first Washington insider to accuse Bush of having “ twisted ” the WMD intelligence on Iraq .
The March 22 column stands out as a particularly notable measure of Novak ’s dishonesty because it came almost four years after Wilson began challenging Bush ’s false claims about Iraq allegedly seeking yellow - cake uranium from Niger .
Novak ’s article was not some early rendition of a story that was n’t fully understood ; it was a premeditated act of lying in defense of a cover-up .
For one , Novak could n’t seem to let go of a favorite right - wing myth – that Plame was n’t a " covert " CIA officer overseeing a sensitive network of spies informing the United States about weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .
That right - wing lie – insisting that she was n’t “ covert ” – was exploded at a March 16 , 2007 , hearing of the House Oversight Committee when Chairman Henry Waxman , D - California , read a statement approved by CIA Director Michael Hayden referring to Plame ’s former status as “ covert , ” “ undercover ” and “ classified . ”
The Hayden - approved statement added that “ Ms. Wilson worked on the most sensitive and highly secretive matters handled by the CIA ” and dealt with “ prevention of development and use of WMD against the United States . ”
In the column six days later , Novak reported that Hayden ’s statement shocked Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan , a hard - line Bush loyalist who had chaired the House Intelligence Committee when the Republicans were in control .
According to Novak , Hoekstra called Hayden , who reaffirmed the statement that Plame indeed had been “ covert . ”
But Novak then resumed the right - wing quibbling over whether Plame would qualify as “ covert ” under the special definition of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 .
This legal technicality apparently was so important to the Post ’s editors that they headlined Novak ’s article , “ Was She Covert ? ”
But the column , like an earlier Post Outlook article by right - wing legal expert Victoria Toensing , gummed up how the law actually defines a “ covert ” agent who qualifies for special legal protection from exposure .
Toensing , who depicted herself as one of the law ’s authors , said a “ covert ” agent must be “ stationed ” abroad during the previous five years to be covered .
In testimony before the House Oversight Committee , she slipped in another definitional word , saying that “ the person is supposed to reside outside the United States . ”
In his column , Novak reverted back to Toensing ’s earlier word “ stationed . ”
However , for all the interest in this legal technicality of whether Plame was “ covert ” under the narrow provisions of the 1982 law , Novak , Toensing and the Post ’s editors shied away from actually quoting from the law .
Covert or Not ?
There was a reason for this lack of precision and curiosity about how “ covert ” is defined .
The Intelligence Identities Protection
Act of 1982 makes it a crime to willfully disclose the identity of a U.S. intelligence officer if the identity is classified and the person “ has within the last five years served outside the United States . ”
The verb is “ served ” – not “ stationed ” or “ resided ” – a modest but significant difference that would appear to alter the determination of whether the law would apply to someone like Plame , who was based in the United States but who testified that she had undertaken covert missions abroad in the previous five years .
Under the Toensing - Novak language , it presumably would be okay to divulge the covert identity of a Special Forces soldier who was “ stationed ” at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and who “ resided ” in Fayetteville but risked his life by conducting clandestine counter - terrorism missions in the Middle East .
The decision to insert a different word in the law ’s definition is what lawyers would call “ probative ” in assessing whether Toensing and Novak were intentionally lying .
And beyond playing games with definitions , Novak , Toensing and the Post editors also obscured the larger issue of the damage done by blowing a CIA agent ’s cover – and putting in jeopardy the lives of people who have supplied information to the CIA and who clearly do live overseas .
Novak had been caught lying about Wilson / Plame before .
For instance , in an Aug. 1 , 2005 , column also published in the Post , Novak claimed that “ the Senate [ intelligence ] committee reported that much of what he [ Wilson ] said ‘ had no basis in fact . ’ ”
However , the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2004 – although then controlled by the Republicans – did not conclude that Wilson ’s statements about Iraqi intelligence “ had no basis in fact . ”
That was a phrase that Novak culled from the “ additional views ” of three right - wing Republican senators – Pat Roberts , Orrin Hatch and Christopher Bond .
The full committee had refused to accept that opinion from Roberts , Bond and Hatch – yet Novak left the false impression that the phrase was part of what he called “ a unanimous Senate intelligence committee report . ”
Novak ’s misleading claim proved so appealing that Washington Post editorial - page editor Fred Hiatt adopted the falsehood as one of his own .
In a March 7 , 2007 , editorial , the Post trashed Wilson for his statements about Bush ’s “ twisted ” WMD intelligence , asserting that “ a bipartisan investigation by the Senate intelligence committee subsequently established that all of these claims were false . ”
Work at Headquarters
In the March 22 column , Novak also resurrected other silly arguments that had circulated widely on the Right , such as the assumption that if CIA employees work at headquarters in Langley , Virginia , they must be public , not covert .
As Post editors and Novak certainly knew , many CIA employees who work at Langley and at other CIA facilities around Washington are still covert .
It was ludicrous – if not highly offensive – for the Post to run Novak ’s rhetorical question : “ How could she be covert if , in public view , she drove to work each day at Langley ? ”
Novak added other questions that he felt should have been addressed at Waxman ’s hearing , such as “ What about testimony to the FBI that her CIA employment was common knowledge in Washington ? ”
But Novak did n’t bother to identify who gave that testimony or whether it was part of the self - interested defense from Bush administration officials like Cheney ’s aide I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice regarding the Plame leak .
Libby , for instance , claimed that he had learned of Plame ’s CIA identity from NBC bureau chief Tim Russert , an assertion that Russert testified was false .
Novak revived other canards about Wilson that had long since been debunked .
Novak wrote that “ claims of a White House plot [ to punish Wilson by exposing his wife ] became so discredited that Wilson was cut out of Sen.
John Kerry ’s presidential campaign by the summer of 2004 . ”
What Novak was doing there was recycling a baseless report from Talon News ’ former White House correspondent Jeff Gannon , whose real name was James Guckert .
On July 27 , 2004 , Gannon / Guckert reported that Wilson “ has apparently been jettisoned from the Kerry campaign . ”
The article based its assumption on the fact that “ all traces ” of Wilson “ had disappeared from the Kerry Web site . ”
The article reported that “ Wilson had appeared on a Web site www.restorehonesty.com where he restated his criticism of the Bush administration .
The link now goes directly to the main page of www.johnkerry.com and no reference to Wilson can be found on the entire site . ”
That was the extent of Gannon / Guckert ’s “ proof . ”
But Peter Daou , who headed the Kerry campaign ’s online rapid response , told me that the disappearance of Wilson ’s link – along with many other Web pages – resulted from a redesign of Kerry ’s Web site at the start of the general election campaign , not a repudiation of Wilson .
“ I was n’t aware of any directive from senior Kerry staff to ‘ discard ’ Joe Wilson or do anything to Joe Wilson for that matter , ” said Daou .
“ It just got lost in the redesign of the Web site , as did dozens and dozens of other pages . ”
A GOP Plant
Gannon / Guckert , who wrote frequently about the Wilson - Plame case in 2003 - 2004 , came under suspicion as a covert Republican operative in January 2005 when he put a question to Bush at a presidential news conference that contained a false assertion about Democrats and prompted concerns that Gannon / Guckert was a plant .
Later , liberal Web sites discovered that Gannon was a pseudonym for Guckert , who had posted nude photos of himself on gay - male escort sites .
It also turned out that Talon News was owned by GOPUSA , whose president Robert Eberle was a prominent Texas Republican activist .
As a controversy built over the Bush administration paying for favorable news stories , Gannon / Guckert resigned from Talon News and its Web site effectively shut down .
But his spurious claim about Wilson getting booted by Kerry 's campaign was reprised in 2007 by Robert Novak .
Novak finished that column by spinning new conspiracy theories implicating Democrats and suggesting that CIA Director Hayden deserved White House retaliation .
Hayden ’s approval of Waxman ’s statement about Plame ’s covert status “ confirmed Republican suspicions that Hayden is too close to Democrats , ” Novak wrote .
“ When Hayden ’s role was pointed out to one of the President ’s most important aides , there was no response . ”
Novak had moved from acting as a Bush propagandist attacking an Iraq War critic to serving as an instigator for reprisals against a public official who was n’t sufficiently loyal to Bush .
So , as the Washington pundit class goes into mourning this week over the death of a beloved colleague , it might be worth remembering who Robert Novak really was – and what the weepy eulogies say about the Washington media ’s disdain for real truth - telling .

$ 30 billion home loan time bomb set for 2010 THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN

Thousands of Bay Area homes have a ticking time bomb embedded in their mortgage .
The homes were purchased with loans known as option ARMs , short for adjustable rate mortgages .
Next year , many option ARM payments will begin to readjust , slamming borrowers with dramatically higher monthly mortgage bills .
Analysts say that could unleash the next big wave of foreclosures - and home - loan data show that the risky loans were heavily used in the Bay Area .
From 2004 to 2008 , " one in five people who took out a mortgage loan ( for both purchases and refinancing ) in the San Francisco metropolitan region ( San Francisco , Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin and San Mateo counties ) got an option ARM , " said Bob Visini , senior director of marketing in San Francisco at First American CoreLogic , a mortgage research firm .
" That 's more than twice the national average .
" People think option ARMs ( will be ) a national crisis , " he said .
" That 's not really true .
It 's just in higher - cost areas like California where you see their prevalence . "
Of the 10 metro areas nationwide with the most option ARMs , three are in the Bay Area , according to Fitch Ratings , a New York research firm .
They are the East Bay counties of Alameda and Contra Costa , the South Bay area of Santa Clara and San Benito counties , and the counties of San Francisco , Marin and San Mateo .
Together , these areas account for the second - most option ARMs in the country , although they are still far behind the greater Los Angeles area ( including Los Angeles , Riverside , San Bernardino and Orange counties ) , according to Fitch data .
Understated data
First American shows more than 54,000 option ARMs issued here with a value of about $ 30.9 billion .
Fitch shows more than 47,000 option ARMs here with a value of about $ 28 billion .
Both say their data underestimate the totals .
Why are so many option ARMs clustered here ?
" In markets where home prices were going up rapidly , more and more borrowers needed a product like this to afford something , " said Alla Sirotic , senior director at Fitch Ratings .
Option ARMs were designed for savvy real estate investors and people whose income fluctuates , such as those paid on commission .
Instead , the loans became a tool for regular people to " stretch " to buy homes that were beyond their means .
That 's because option ARMs let borrowers choose to make very low payments for the first five years .
During that initial period , borrowers can pick their payment option - they can pay interest and principal , interest only , or a minimum monthly payment that does n't even cover the interest .
Fitch said 94 percent of borrowers elected to make minimum payments only .
The shortfall gets added to their loan balance , which is called negative amortization .
The amount they owe can grow substantially .
The mortgages ' recast '
After five years , or once the loan balance reaches a certain threshold above the original balance , the mortgages " recast " and borrowers must make full principal and interest payments spread over the loan 's remaining life .
Fitch said that new payments average 63 percent higher than the minimum payments , but could be more than double in some cases .
" When option ARMs recast , the payment shock is much more intense than we 've seen ( with other types of loans , such as subprime ) , " said Maeve Elise Brown , executive director of Housing and Economic Rights Advocates in Oakland , a consumer advocacy group .
" That makes them potentially much more damaging . "
Unlike subprime loans , which were more commonly used for entry - level homes , option ARMs started out with high balances .
In the five - county San Francisco area , option ARMs average about $ 584,000 and were used to buy homes averaging $ 823,000 , according to an analysis of First American data .
That means they 'll spawn foreclosures among upper - end homes .
" The mid- to high - end real estate market is already stranded right now , " said Mark Hanson , principal of Walnut Creek 's the Field Check Group , a mortgage consultant .
" Any sort of extra inventory is not going to be welcome for that market whatsoever . "
Option ARMs became widespread starting in 2005 , which is why the recasts and higher payments will hit starting in 2010 , five years later .
Joey Amacker of Newark , who works as an account manager for a catering company , refinanced his home with an option ARM for $ 624,000 so he could pull out money to build an addition .
The friend who sold him the loan assured him that an option ARM was a safe and affordable product , he said .
Amacker said he initially made only the minimum monthly payment of $ 1,800 , which covered part of his interest and none of the principal .
The amount he owed grew to $ 660,000 by November 2008 , according to loan documents .
Meanwhile , payments that would cover both interest and principal also escalated above his reach , said Amacker , a single father of twin teenage boys .
Although he wanted to pay more than the minimum , " it was a struggle , borrowing from Peter to pay Paul , " he said .
His 21 - year - old daughter moved in to help out , and he rented out the addition he 'd built .
But he could n't keep up with the payments .
He 's been trying to get his bank to modify the loan , but says it does n't get back to him .
The bank did not respond to a request for comment .
Between the negative amortization and his missed payment and penalties , Amacker 's total debt has ballooned to $ 725,000 , while the house is probably worth about $ 500,000 , he said .
" I feel so ashamed of how I could have gotten myself in such a bad situation , " he said .
Like Amacker , most option ARM borrowers owe much more than their homes are worth , so they cannot refinance their way out of trouble .
' Significantly underwater '
" The average option ARM borrower is significantly underwater , so much that they do n't think they 'll get out , " Sirotic said .
On average nationwide , option ARM borrowers started out with loans for about 79 percent of their home 's value ( the other 21 percent may have been covered through a down payment , a second loan or a combination of the two ) .
But now , on average , the amount these borrowers owe is 126 percent of their home 's value , based on depreciation and not including the effects of negative amortization , Sirotic said .
That means , for instance , someone with a $ 600,000 mortgage might have a home now worth only $ 476,000 .
That could explain the ominously high default rates .
Even though most option ARMs have not yet adjusted higher , 27 percent of option ARM loans in the five - county San Francisco metro area are at least 90 days past due or in foreclosure , First American said .
The option ARM scenario will unfold over several years , which offers some hope that there may be time to avert a deluge of foreclosures .
The bulk of option ARMs recast dates are spread out from 2010 through 2012 .
Especially for the loans that recast later , it 's possible that a solution will arise , either through rising home prices allowing them to refinance , or through extra intervention from the government or lenders to help these borrowers .
" This will be another factor keeping home prices from recovering , " said Cynthia Kroll , senior regional economist with the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC Berkeley 's Haas School of Business .
" It should be a message to policymakers in Washington that there is a big group out there that falls outside the parameters of what 's being addressed by current policy . "
Bay Area option ARMs From 2004 to 2008 , almost one - fifth of all mortgages , for both home purchases and refinancing , in the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas were option ARMs - more than double the national average .
Option ARMs were even more common in the suburban counties of Sonoma ( 25 % of home loans ) and Solano ( 28 % ) .
Though most option ARMs have not yet recast and hit borrowers with higher payments , they are going into default at extremely high rates .
One quarter or more of all option ARMs in the regional areas are more than 60 days delinquent or already in foreclosure .
Analysts say option ARM borrowers are so underwater that they may be choosing to walk away .
Metropolitan statistical area % of all home loans originated 2004 - 08 that were option ARMs % of 2004 - 08 option ARMs that are 60 - plus days delinquent or in foreclosure San Francisco - Oakland - Fremont ( San Francisco , Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Mateo counties ) 19.52 % 27.23 % San Jose - Sunnyvale - Santa Clara ( Santa Clara and San Benito counties ) 19.32 % 28.36 % Santa Rosa - Petaluma ( Sonoma County ) 25.31 % 24.94 % Vallejo - Fairfield ( Solano County ) 28.12 % 36.91 %
Now , Mr. Archer is among 330 dealers , calling themselves the Committee of Chrysler Affected Dealers , who are contesting the company ’s action .
Next week and on June 3 , the bankruptcy judge handling Chrysler ’s case will consider their objections .
Many of those fighting the hardest are dealers who recently spent huge amounts of money to stay in the company ’s good graces , who sacrificed their own profits to help keep the company intact or who otherwise thought they had bent over backward to ensure that Chrysler could survive , only to learn that they were the ones who would not .

While departing Chrysler , Dodge and Jeep dealers slashed prices , General Motors tapped Treasury for another $ 4 billion .

“ I ’m mad at myself for being duped all these years by them and going along with all of the things they wanted me to do , ” said Homer Cutrubus , a Chrysler dealer in Utah since 1969 .
“ If I treated my customers like Chrysler treated me , I would n’t have any business . ”
For years , Chrysler had been urging Mr. Cutrubus and other dealers to combine dealerships with just one or two of the company ’s brands into “ alpha ” stores selling all three : Chrysler , Dodge and Jeep .
It stepped up that pressure in February , he said , and in April he finally agreed to move his Dodge store in Layton , Utah , into a Chrysler - Jeep showroom half a mile away , even though he thought the change made little sense financially and had to be done at his own expense .
New research carried out by the University of Hertfordshire reveals some shocking and some surprising statistics .
The survey , carried out on behalf of UK Music , reveals that 61 % of 14 to 24 year - olds use file - sharing networks , with each amassing an average of 8,000 tracks on their computers .
UK Music is an umbrella organization representing the interests of various elements of the UK music industry , from artists through to record labels , publishers , producers and collecting societies and counts the BPI among its members .
A new study carried out by the University of Hertfordshire for UK Music reveals some interesting statistics – and some surprising ones .
Of those questioned in the 14 to 24 year old bracket , it was revealed that on average they have amassed music collections on their computers which exceed 8,100 tracks , an amount that most people could never afford .
Little wonder that 68 % of respondents said that they use their computers every day to listen to music .
From the 1,808 people surveyed , 61 % admitted to downloading music using P2P networks including BitTorrent with 83 % of these admitted doing so on a weekly or daily basis .
A significant 86 % admitted that they had copied CDs for their friends .
While many admitted uploading using P2P , other methods of sharing were also utilized – 75 % admitted to sending music by email , instant messaging services or Bluetooth .
Of those who admitted using P2P to obtain music , 85 % said they would welcome an “ all you can eat ” download service for a fixed monthly fee , but just 57 % said that access to such a service would stop them from illegally sharing files .
In recent months , streaming services such as Spotify have been touted as a possible weapon to combat illicit sharing .
However , of those surveyed for this report , 78 % said they had no interest in paying for such a service , while 89 % said they would prefer to own music , rather than stream it .
More than half of those surveyed said that companies that manufacture digital music players and mobile phones should pay fees to artists to compensate them from losses due to copies made on their devices .
UK Music CEO , Feargal Sharkey commented : “ Clearly , the shape of our entire business will continue to evolve .
However , we will achieve nothing if we do not work with music fans , and young music fans in particular .
They are hugely demanding in their needs , but collectively we must rise to that challenge .
We ignore engagement at our peril .
That message is loud and clear . ”
Strangely , in this world of 8,000 track hard drive music collections and the rampant uptake of digital music players , 77 % of those surveyed said they would carry on buying physical CD albums even if they were subscribing to an “ all you can eat ” download service .
Getting paid twice for the same music , digital and physical ?
Sounds like a model the music business can get excited over , although in reality no - one else will .
We ’ve all been down that route before with the industry , one way or another .
Climate campaigners show their support for the Vestas workers .
Below is the text of a speech written by a Vestas worker for delivery at trade union and environmental movement meetings .
It gives an excellent insight into the background of the struggle , and its wider political significance .
It first appeared at http://savevestas.wordpress.com.

I ’ve come today to speak about a little factory called St. Cross on the Isle of Wight – otherwise known as Vestas ; you may have heard about it before …
It is currently in occupation as it ’s due to close ...
Around 625 jobs will be lost at the three plants of St. Cross ( Newport ) , Venture Quays ( East Cowes ) and Merlin Quays in Southampton ( just across the water on the English mainland ) .
There is also a resin factory called Gurit opposite us which is reliant on Vestas and is currently discussing its options , although they do not look good .
Many other industries will suffer if Vestas ups and leaves and many more jobs will go .
The island ’s fragile economy will be plunged back twenty years into reliance upon the tourist trade with its low - paid , season jobs .
We want to keep these factories open , even expand them and build new ones .
But not because of our love for Vestas .
A few things about Vestas :
Vestas bought out NEG Micon in 2003 , and since that time things just got worse as it tried to squeeze the last drop of work out of everyone , sapping them dry .
Long hours in a highly stressful environment and fear of repetitive strain injury amongst other conditions have given it a very high staff turnover .
It is extremely anti-union and some workers who have joined unions in the past have been singled out and fired on various grounds .
The nearest thing to a union is a consultation network imposed by European law , where supposedly elected representatives ( but in reality hand - picked by management ) attend meetings where they have no input whatsoever , and are forced to simply absorb and relay management diktat to the rest of the workers .
The workers have been given an offer of a pitiful redundancy payout for all their years of conscientious labour , and this has not even been confirmed in writing .
This is classic of these multinationals , and the feelings of everyone on the Isle of Wight are running high .
Everybody threatened with unemployment for no reason other than one or other corporation ’s desire to move their capital around the world , or find the cheapest sources of non-unionised labour , or the newest set of government subsidies , is by necessity obligated to take action and stand up with their brothers and sisters , or else fall by the wayside and be complicit in the exploitation of them and theirs .
A change in mindset is spontaneously taking place all over the world , from South Korea to Enfield , from Paris to Chile .
For too long have the corporations imposed their will on the common worker and driven them down without a care for their personal security and livelihoods , their families and their dignity .
There is a change that is happening as rapidly as we have seen .
Now is the time , and achieving action is easier – far easier – than we would ever have imagined .
Let ’s look at how our factory occupation began .
Redundancy threat
At the end of April , the Vestas employees were gathered together and told they would all be at risk of redundancy , and the factory was due to stop production at the end of July 2009 .
Naturally we were all shocked and upset at this news , that came out of the blue .
We had been told we were the most profitable factory Vestas had !
Everyone carried on working as normal ; we felt powerless and confused .
A few activists from Workers ’ Climate Action began leafleting the factory gates and talking to workers .
A public meeting was called .
From this , a small group of workers formed a committee and began talking about occupying the factory to prevent closure .
These workers began recruiting other workers to the plan , all the while trying to keep it secret from management .
Managers heard about possible direct action and went to one of the sites to attempt to persuade workers to sign a document against any such action .
Only two workers signed .
We heard of this and decided to strike quickly .
Meeting up , 30 of us split into three groups and slipped into the factory unopposed .
Working quickly , we secured our chosen area – the management and administration offices at the front of the building .
We had successfully outflanked the managers !
We had an ex-union legal man outside who liaised with the police and managers , reminding them of the law and that this was a peaceful protest .
We spent the first night sleeping in three - hour shifts .
The next day the crowd started to gather outside ; workers coming to work were turn away but stayed to show us support , the crowd building by the hour .
The managers and police started to give us two - hour deadlines to leave , telling us trespass was a criminal offence .
We knew it was a civil matter and they would need a court injunction to remove us .
We were threatened with private thugs storming the building and “ being heavy handed with us ” .
The factory manager Paddy Weir then threatened to go to a DIY store and buy boltcutters to remove us .
We laughed at him as the police told him he could n’t !
By the end of the first day , things had calmed down as the police and managers had exhuasted their threats with no effect on us .
The police then promised not to storm the building after video footage of riot cops was sent by us to the media .
The factory manager then appeared outside , accompanied by security guards , to talk to the media .
He dipped his head and spoke into the two microphones in front of him in the quietest voice possible .
Only the media could hear him , none of the workers who were pressed around straining their ears could hear a word .
The workers in the crowd booed and jeered as he scuttled back inside the factory .
Supplies were running low by lunchtime of day two .
A big crowd had gathered outside to deliver food , demanding to be let through the police and private security lines .
When they heard the police would not stop them , they rushed to us throwing food up to the balcony .
Food stopped
On day three , a seven - foot fence was erected around the site to stop food coming in .
The managers were not providing food at this point .
We responded by hanging a banner out accusing the management of trying to starve us .
This looked bad for them as local and national media were outside with a sizeable crowd , now in a semi- permanent camp .
Then , suddenly , they announced that they would take responsibility and provide food to us .
When this food arrived , however , it turned out to be peanut butter sandwiches , snack bars and fizzy drinks in minimal quantities .
On day three , Bob Crow – the leader of the transport workers ' trade union RMT – arrived and gave a rousing speech .
He even told us of a helicopter on standby ready to air - drop food to the occupiers .
At 7.30 pm , an aeroplane flew low and circled trailing a banner which read “ Save our jobs , save our community ! ”
The rally now numbered more than 300 , consisting of workers ’ families and local supporters .
At the same time , an injunction was served on the occupiers .
The RMT pledged to handle this in court with its legal team .
A mass demonstration has been planned for the day of the hearing – Wednesday July 29 , outside the Magistrate ’s Court in Newport between 9 and 10am .
On day four , a march set off from Newport town centre .
Six hundred people made their way up to the factory site in a show of support .
Meanwhile , two workers travelled to London giving a speech at University College London to trade union officials , environmentalists and other groups .
Sharing the platform was Chris Baugh , the deputy head of the PCS union , Jonathan Neale , the international coordinator of the Campaign against Climate Change , and Seamus Milne , a freelance journalist and regular contributor to The Guardian .
We raised almost a thousand pounds .
On day five , the occupiers were suffering from the lack of a hot meal .
This was relayed to the crowd at 6 pm .
They spontaenously surged forward , shaking the fence and shouting for food to be let in .
Within 15 minutes , a hot meal of spaghetti bolognese had been provided by management .
The total arrests now stood at seven people , mainly for suspicion of breach of the peace – whatever that means …
This brings us up to the weekend of the July 25 - 26 .
As you can see , there have been a few things that have been very important to this occupation .
Number one – having a group of committed workers with the courage to take action to defend their jobs .
Two – having someone with legal training immediately available on the outside , to negotiate with the police and management in the first hours and early days of the occupation .
Three – using the media to full effect , providing video footage and interviews from inside the occupation .
This occupation is ongoing , and the support is building every day .
What we desperately need from everybody is continued pressure on both the government and Vestas to retool this factory and keep it in operation .
It is the only blade manufacturer of wind turbines in Great Britain .
The technology we have been so proud of developing is being shipped to the USA , where Vestas will enjoy Barack Obama ’s apparently more serious and determined commitment to clean , green energy .
We cannot afford to let this happen .
We must stop it now .
None of us involved in this occupation ever thought we would take part in anything like this .
We quickly realised that we were at the centre of a perfect storm ; we had a golden opportunity to seize the factory and force the issues of green energy , massive job losses and corporate responsibility into the international spotlight .
We knew we had to step up and take action , as this was bigger than all of us put together .
Anyone that joins us in this action through coming along and supporting us in person , online or through taking direct action themselves in their own workplace is participating in a much wider , greater movement .
A movement that is truly global , sweeping across the planet and uniting environmentalists , workers and union movements as one force .
The ecological movement and the trade union movement have long been divided by one ’s desire to protect all jobs , and the other ’s desire to scrap some and create others .
Now they have come together to demand the maintenance and creation of green jobs for all .
The Vestas factory occupation combines the two wills in one fight – for a cleaner , safer future .
A future with jobs for all .
Part 1 . Congressman Scott Murphy ( D - NY0 )
I personally told Scott Murphy on behalf of Progressives everywhere and the Daily Kos community that a Robust Public Option is the only true reform , short of Single Payer .
I have told him that Co - Ops are a joke and unacceptable .
I also offered him our support in the future , should he support us in return .
Police officers were visible in the crowd .
I told one anti-socialist that Police officers are socialists who work for the Government , and I asked why he hated police officers .
I do n't think he got the joke .
Representative Murphy handled the crowd perfectly .
He was very well informed and never stumbled for an answer , no matter how absurd the question .
Very few of the questions asked pertained to health care reform , other than those from the left .
Rather , I felt like we were debating whether we even need a Government at all .
Congressman Murphy , while standing by his wife and children , told us a story of how he took one of his daughters to the dentist to remove five cavities .
They had to make six visits , one to make sure there really was five cavities and then another one for each cavity .
He explained how this is a huge part of the problem , and why we should reform health care in order to avoid waste just like this .
Sadly , I can not report that Scott Murphy has stated his support for a Public Option during the town hall , but he has stated in the past that he does .
He is very much in support of reform , but he will not say so in certain terms .
Despite this , I believe he will do the right thing in the end and vote for Health Care reform bill in the House .
I am just not sure what type of reform he is for , but he is certainly for doing something .
I am just not sure if that is enough .
The words Co - Op and Options were used by Representative Murphy .
I do not know if this is the message coming from the WhiteHouse , or if this is a Democrat in a Red District trying to avoid stoking his constituants already paranoid fears .
NY - 20 is a red district .
Politically , I can understand why Scott Murphy did not go all in on a public option in the face of scared and stupid Republicans .
Democrats were outnumbered at the Town Hall , but held their own .
In a crowd of 100 - 200 the screamers were few , but the message from the Right is clear .
That message is NO .
No to everything , No to government , No , and greed , and I got mine , screw you .
Still , I feel like we should strongly support Freshman Democrats in red and tight districts .
As much as I hate the Blue Dogs ( of which Re. Murphy is NOT a member ) , I understand how much better they are than Republicans .
If we cannot support Freshman Dems like Murphy who won by 200 + votes or Rep. Kratovil or others , we are going to lose .
We should make sure that does n't happen by supporting them when we can and when they deserve it .
Part 2 : The Pictures , Worth a thousand words
A few progressives did show up , but seemed to be outnumbered in this red district .
Still , we held our own , and when necessary , we Yelled Louder , so Fuck you Rahm .
This needs to be said to the NO on everything crowd .
But , of course , they just do n't get it .
Fishsticks , man .
Why can't you just get it ?
This is a wingnut video shot from the Town Hall , and it portrays best the willfull ignorance of the Know Nothing party
These are the dopes we are dealing with .
Single Payer advocates , rest assured your voice was heard .
So were other health care reform advocates .
A nurse who I spoke to who wished to remain anonymous had this to say .
" Health care ( reform ) has to be done now .
My main thing is the donut hole for prescription coverage and the co-payment . "
Many others from the left agreed and made many other statements which are too many to catalouge , but speak to the urgency with which we need reform now .
But we were outnumbered by the wingnuts .
Their message is clear , and it is No ! and I do not know how or even why we should still debate them anymore .
Gov'ment cannot " care " - I want to frame this and put it on my wall .
Let 's play count the No's and Negative messages
Meet the hardest working person in America
I saw old people who opposed reform crying .
Why , I am not sure even they knew .
People were yelling about Barney Frank and Nancy Pelosi .
When one person yelled out about Pelosi I Yelled Louder that she should have Impeached George W. Bush , which got a bunch of laughs .
These people are afraid .
Of what ?
Everything .
And why ?
Well , I think there might be a reason .
Part 3 : The Lobbyists , hiding in plain sight .
Within minutes of arriving at the town hall a person who had shouted " They have n't even read the whole bill ! " was kind enough to hand me a helpful flyer explaining HR 3200 .
The flyer , which I am holding in my hand right now , is a 10 page explanation of why we are all going to die if this bill passes .
You can read the whole piece here and at the link at FreeRepublic.com
The top 10 dumbest of these , in my opinion , are listed below .
# 10 The government will establish a National Medical Device Registry .
Will you be tracked ?
# 9 . Government will cover marriage and family therapy .
Government intervenes in your marriage . # 8 . The Public Health Workforce Corps includes veterinarians .
Will animals have health care , too ?
# 7 School Based Health Clinics will be intergrated into the school environment .
More Government brainwashing in school .
# 6
Government will have direct access to your bank accounts for electronic funds transfers # 5 HC will be provided to ALL NON - US citizens # 4 This Home Visitation Program includes the government coming into your home and teaching / telling you how to parent !
# 3 Doctors in Residency government will tell you where your residency is , thus where you 'll live .
# 2 YOUR HEALTH CARE WILL BE RATIONED and finally , the Number # 1 dumbest reason anyone might belive that health care reform is the devil himself .
# 1 Government will establish school based " health " clinics .
your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted !
Liberty Counsel takes credit for this atrocious piece of Conspiracy Theory stuffed misinformation .
Liberty Counsel is a " Religious Civil Lberty Law Firm " that says nothing about torture , but is very clearly anti LGBT rights and opposed to hate crime legislation , which tells me that they are pro-hate crimes .
For those who recall , Rachel Maddow covered this morans in an expose about the CT going around that Health Care reform will mandate compulsory sex changes .
So , Sarah Palin is n't that smart .
She did n't make this shit up , she was just reading straight from the lobbyists playbook .
The 10 page printout sites ACORN , abortion , euthanasia for the elderly rationing and taxes , as well as other and even dumber bullshit .
Now here is the crazier thing .
People on the right actually believe this shit .
Part 4 : In conclusion
The Republican party and it's rabid base are the dumbest fucking people in this country .
They are easily scared , easily decieved , grossly misinformed , racist , not intellectually curiius , not intellectual at all , slow , stupid and certain they are right .
There can be no debate with someone who does n't believe in reality .
I have said it before , but if you look at these equations it is easy to understand .
Idea + NO = FUBAR Legislation Stupid + Bipartisanship = FAIL
I had a long conversation with a Republican banker about economics and progressive taxes .
I tried to tell him his ideas have failed over and over again for more than 100 years .
I have come to the conclusion that our bankers have no frigging idea what they are talking about .
I did learn a great technique in dealing with Republican stupidity .
Talk about George W. Bush .
It makes their heads explode .
Republicans will say in a knee jerk response " Do n't blame Bush " , and this goes to the heart of the doublethink which is required to be a Republican today .
They KNOW he fucked up , but they do n't want to admit it , and they would rather blame Obama .
We should use this as much as we can .
Sadly , Godwin died a terrible death yesterday .
I actually watched a Republican WWII vet tell Representative Murphy that this is what Hitler did .
He gave all Germans , including the Jews , government run health care .
I watched , stunned by the enormity of teh stoopid .
It is like talking to a meth addict .
No , there are no monsters in the shadows .
No , there are no spiders on you .
No , you can not fly , and there are no underpants gnomes .
I wonder what the political version of delirium tremons is .
The fact is , the GOP hopes Obama fails , from top to bottom .
They hate you and Government , they believe whatever they are told as long as it reaffirms what they already think .
These are the people who voted for McCain / Palin .
If we are depending on these clowns to compromise with us , we might as well wait for the Rapture with them .
If the bought off wing of the Democratic party does not give us real reform but pass a watered down FUBAR reform they will have succeded in pissing off everyone on both sides while accomplishing nothing .
Real Progressives need to stand up , get out there , and campaign all over again for this reform . , because every fight we have is going to be just like this one for the next 3 1/2 - 7 1/2 years .
Fox News and the Right Wing Noise machine has convinced these loons and full mooners that the end is nigh .
The lobbyists love it .
We need to fight back and stand up for the mandate we won in the election of 2008 .
This is my opinion .
At the end of the town hall , Congressman Murphy asked the crowd to vote on whether Government should be involved in any health care programs at all .
To my amazement , they cheered loudly and said NO !
But then , maybe I should n't be surprised .
This is the Know - Nothing party of No !!!
I should have expected as much .
Per a comment by Andrew C White which can be found below .
As you said , most of this had nothing to do with health care and everything to do with fear and stupidty .
I disagree however that they out numbered us .
I think we out numbered them but it was close .
They are simpy louder and better organized than we are at this point .
At the end when he did his informal survey single - payer followed closely by the public option received the most votes .
It is also VERY worth noting that while the original vote for no government involvement in health care was large and loud it got a heck of a lot smaller when he made it clear that he meant ... no Meedicare , no Medicaid , no VA , no Tri-Care , nothing .
That received a very small vote .
These are the people who just do n't get it .
This clip from South Park is intended to illustarte the people who JUST DON'T GET It .
In no way is this meant to advocate for violence or Kanye West , nor is it intended to be insulting to Carlos Mencia , latinos , rappers or gay fish .
They will never get it .
Time to stop trying and just make them take their medicine .
A BIG hat tip to fellow Kossack mad cow without whom this diary and my attendance at the NY - 20 town hall could not be possible , and more hat tips to Kossacks nyceve and slinkerwink who always inspire with their dedication and hard work .
I take this as further proof that this communtiy and progressives everywhere truly ROCK !
My gratitude also goes to progressives and others who fight hard here and elsewhere on a daily basis .
Without you there can be no change .
In conclusion , screw Rahm ! and screw bipartisanship .
get out there , be heard , and if necessary , " YELL LOUDER "
I might add that I feel the event was a great success , , and would encourage other Democrats to attend these events when they can , and to watch , and be seen , and be heard .
Thank you ,
MoT

The Eagles did n’t take long in finding another signal caller to fill out their depleted roster after Kevin Kolb suffered an MCL sprain .
Coaching intern and former Arena League quarterback Matt Nagy was pegged by Reid and Heckert to serve as exhibition game tackling dummy until Big Kev ’s boo boo heals .
So , who exactly is Matt Nagy ?
Have no fear Iggles fans , I ’ve got the lowdown .
I dusted off my investigative reporter hat and dug into the past of this mystery man named Nagy .
You may be shocked at my findings , but I stand by the evidence uncovered .
It is my contention that this native New Jerseyan and Delaware Fightin ’ Blue Hens alum is not who he claims to be .
First , a little backstory .
From 2002 - 2008 , Nagy played for the following Arena League squads : New York Dragons , Carolina Cobras , Georgia Force , and Columbus Destroyers .
Do you see a pattern ?
Well , I sure as hell do .
Dragons and Cobras are frightening creatures known to kill .
Force and Destroyers are very aggressive nouns ; they represent power and destruction .
These action oriented “ team ” names bear a close resemblance to movie titles .
Eyebrows raise — hand rubs chin — wheels inside head turn .
After careful deliberation with myself , I have concluded , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that Matt Nagy is in fact … martial arts expert and Hollywood action star , Jason Statham .
Perhaps you ’re a bit skeptical .
It ’s understandable , I guess .
However , I ’m confident you ’ll come over to my side once you read the super - secret transcript of an interview I conducted with Nagy Statham last night .
If you ’re unfamiliar with Statham ’s body of work , I took the liberty of using bold text to highlight blatant references to his movies .
Here are his responses to my queries about how he learned of his promotion and how he feels about his new role with the Eagles .
Get ready to be baffled :
“ Well , it happened real fast .
I was talking with a friend on my cellular about purchasing a new revolver , when Tom Heckert tapped me on the shoulder .
He took me into his office and sat me down .
I asked if he had any luck finding another QB and he pointed at me and said , “ You are the one . ” I could n’t believe it .
I mean , it ’s like a dream come true to play in the NFL .
I snatched at the opportunity provided me by the Eagles organization .
I ca n’t wait to get started .
I realize the next couple days are going to be complete chaos , but I think I ’m ready for the challenge .
That first game under center will probably feel like some sorta crazy death race .
I ’ll be nervous , but as long as I do n’t crank up my adrenaline too much , I should be okay . ”
I rest my case ladies and gentlemen .
Quarterback or action star ?
You be the judge .

What happens when a hemp activist has his stash confiscated by officers at the U.S. Capitol ?
He calls for a " beer summit , " of course .
A Vote Hemp legislative assistant said Capitol Police seized his samples of industrial hemp fiber on Monday at a Rayburn Building checkpoint .
Ben Droz said he was going to use the fiber , along with hemp seeds , hemp hurd and a hemp cinder block , for a scheduled presentation to congressional staffers on the Hill .
" It 's ironic that the very items I was using to clear up confusion became the subject of contraband and were confiscated , " Droz said .
The hemp activist said officers took the seeds because no food is allowed in the Capitol , and would n't return the fiber , even though they knew it was " just hemp " and has no munchie - craving properties .
The officers eventually gave back the block and the hurd , but Droz told Roll Call that when they refused to return the fiber he gave up and left because he was going to be late for a meeting .
Droz said this was an example of the confusion between industrial hemp and marijuana , a " distant cousin also from the Cannabis family . "
So now what ?
Vote Hemp wants its fiber returned .
Oh , and they 'd also like a beer at the White House .
" We hope for the return of Vote Hemp 's property , an apology , and perhaps , a Capitol Hill beer summit or Congressional hearings to discuss our differences with the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , " said Vote Hemp President Eric Steenstra .
That sounds all well and good .
Just leave the stash at home .
Nothing defines a manager more than how he behaves on the occasion of his greatest disappointment , and on Tuesday night Arsène Wenger demonstrated a generosity of spirit that sets him apart .
He said that Manchester United deserved their victory ; he said it twice , in case you missed it the first time , and he acknowledged the contribution of Cristiano Ronaldo without qualification or recrimination .
In those few minutes in the Emirates Stadium press room you were reminded why Wenger remains such an important part of English football and why those whose faith is wavering need to examine a few basic points .
It reminded you of that game in November when an Arsenal team that had already lost to Fulham , Hull and Stoke beat United 2 - 1 , and those of us who had wondered if Wenger really had lost the plot were obliged to make our apologies .
The same mistake should not be made twice .
The supporters who gather round the " In Arsène we trust " banner at the stadium every week are not entitled to be selective about when they extend that trust .
Even now , five years on from their last league title and four years from the FA Cup final win over United – Arsenal 's last trophy – the Wenger project has to be trusted .
His team may have felt light years behind United at times on Tuesday but this is no time for Arsenal to abandon their faith in Wenger .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I know exactly how he feels , " Ferguson said of his managerial adversary , " because prior to this everyone put that kind of criticism on me .
When you work as long and hard as he has , you deserve success .
The problem for Arsène and me is that the longer you are in the game the more labels you attract .
Success or failure : there 's no inbetween , no grey area .
If you are not winning you are useless ; if you are , you 're great . "
So let 's explore the grey area .
Kieran Gibbs slipped for United 's first goal ; the referee gave a soft free - kick for the second and within 11 minutes it was all over for Wenger 's team .
Those were the micro-factors in defeat .
What about the bigger picture ?
Wenger has had the misfortune in the last five years to face the most successful Chelsea team of all time ( 2004 - 2006 ) , arguably the best United team of Ferguson 's 23 years ( 2006 - present day ) and the best Liverpool team since 1990 .
Just as the competition in the Premier League left Wenger 's side as the only credible challengers to United from 1996 to 2004 , so it has conspired in the last five years to provide some daunting opposition .
There are factors that give reason for complaint : most people would cite the absence of an established holding midfielder in the side .
Wenger would counter that Denilson or Alex Song will be that player , given time .
If there is a distinction to be made between Ferguson 's current success and the relatively lean recent years of Wenger , it is that on Tuesday , for all their relative ability , Arsenal were tactically out - thought .
The deployment of Wayne Rooney on the left was a masterstroke by Ferguson ; so too Ronaldo 's role as a lone striker .
By contrast Arsenal looked stale .
Theo Walcott was not switched to the opposite wing to test John O'Shea when he was shackled by Patrice Evra .
Robin van Persie drifted around in areas where he never seemed likely to damage United .
A thought occurs : in his 22 and a half years at United , Ferguson has employed a series of bright young coaches on his staff .
From Brian Kidd to Carlos Queiroz and on to one of the current incumbents , the well - regarded Dutchman Rene Meulensteen .
Even dear old Steve McClaren , in the seat from 1999 to 2001 , must have given him a different perspective .
Ferguson might be dictatorial in some respects but he evidently enjoys being surrounded by young coaches with fresh ideas .
Wenger has stuck with Pat Rice and Boro Primorac , an old managerial peer from his days in France , and while these are evidently two venerable servants of the club , would the Arsenal manager not benefit from such fresh input ?
He is ever willing to give a chance to the youngest players in his squad , how about doing the same among his backroom staff ?
Among the kind things that Ferguson said about Wenger on Tuesday , most worrying for him was the United manager 's prediction that next season he considered Arsenal " one of the biggest threats because they have potential " .
It is worrying for Arsenal because that is what Ferguson says about Tottenham Hotspur every August before sending them away with a patronising pat on the head .
Arsenal and Wenger are better than that , and those who fear the Frenchman is losing it should remember that only in his 13th season at United did Ferguson win the Champions League .
Wenger is just at that stage himself so he is not too far behind schedule .
For Ferguson , the challenges became even greater after he turned 60 in 2001 and in time he met them all .
Wenger turns 60 in October and having come this far there is no shame in believing that the best may yet be to come .
The best league in the world is back .

Have you ever been stuck in traffic and thought of all the things you could be doing that would have been more productive ?
A new study has confirmed your suspicions .
A Reason Foundation report released Thursday found that reducing traffic congestion and improving travel times could boost the Salt Lake area 's economic output by up to $ 700 million a year .
The report examined the impact that population growth and longer commute times will have on five key locations across the Salt Lake area by 2030 .
They are the downtown business district near EnergySolutions Arena , Brigham Young University , Fashion Place Mall , American Fork and Salt Lake City International Airport .
Of those locations , the Reason study said the biggest economic gains would come from eliminating severe congestion around suburbs such as American Fork .
" Essentially what you do … is to allow people … to significantly increase the reliability of their travel times , " David Hartgen , co-author of the report , senior fellow at the Reason Foundation and professor of transportation at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , told the Deseret News .
The Reason Foundation is a nonprofit think tank that develops nonpartisan public policy research promoting choice , competition and a dynamic market economy , according to its Web site .
Hartgen said that among the eight cities in the study , Salt Lake had the least traffic congestion and had the fewest road capacity needs over the next 20 years .
The study took an in - depth look at traffic and economic growth in Atlanta ; Charlotte , N.C. ; Dallas ; Denver ; Detroit ; Salt Lake City ; San Francisco ; and Seattle .
" Reducing traffic congestion by 10 percent improves productivity by over 1 percent .
One percent may sound small , but in a city like Salt Lake , it can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in economic gains , " Hartgen said in a release .
" The biggest gains come from enhancing mobility around suburbs , universities and malls . "
He added that relatively modest expenditures , such as removing bottlenecks in high - congestion areas throughout the region , could significantly reduce travel times , particularly if the congestion is relatively concentrated geographically .
Hartgen noted that shorter overall travel times result in lower buffer times , " the time you stick on the front of your trip in order to be sure that you arrive on time . "
" For some trips , that buffer time is very small , " he said .
" No one really cares when you arrive for the beer party .
But for work , an airport flight or school , the buffer times are a substantial portion of travel times . "
The study stated that adding road capacity around the rims of cities and investing in suburban accessibility often offers very good return rates .
The report estimated the cost of relieving congestion woes at $ 1.2 billion for Salt Lake City , compared with $ 10 billion for Denver .
The report found that urban areas with less congestion , such as Salt Lake City , would not experience dramatic improvements in productivity —
Denver 's could rise by 31.6 percent , compared to Salt Lake 's 1.4 percent , it said .
But Salt Lake would still benefit as the accumulation of improvements in travel flow boosted the overall regional productivity .
" You have to relieve those bottlenecks because those bottlenecks are actually costing you money , " Frank Gray , Salt Lake City director of community planning and development , told the Deseret News .
He said the Utah Department of Transportation and the Utah Transit Authority are working diligently to focus their planning efforts on controlling congestion in the area 's fast - growing suburban cities like American Fork .
" They are always shifting and balancing the dollars between the core areas ( like Salt Lake City ) and the suburban areas , " he said .
" You 're seeing a greater and greater tilt to the suburban areas . "

Marc Maiffret used to be a computer hacker .
Now he gets paid to break into the systems of Southern California businesses , testing for security weaknesses .
His client today is a major Los Angeles auto dealer , which sells fancy luxury cars to celebrities and corporate execs .
The head of the company wants to check on the safety of his customer data .
It ’s not an idle worry .
Just days earlier , a 28 - year - old Miami man was charged by federal authorities with hacking into multiple computer systems and stealing 130 million credit and debit card numbers -- the largest computer crime ever prosecuted .
Nearly 10 million Americans were victims of identity theft last year .
One recent study put annual losses related to ID theft at $ 48 billion .

Maiffret , 28 , wearing hipster eyeglasses and a black T - shirt , and with one eyebrow pierced , focuses on the Vaio laptop on his desk .
It takes just a few keystrokes to penetrate the auto dealer ’s network .
Maiffret runs some software .
He uses it to locate the dealer ’s main computer server and to give himself administrator - level access .
He now has the run of the system .
“ That took just 60 seconds , ” Maiffret says , grinning .
“ And there was nothing abnormal about this client ’s system .
This is how it is in most cases . ”
Advertisement
He moves quickly through the dealer ’s network to access its customer files .
Maiffret stops on a screen showing that the chief operating officer of a Fortune 500 company recently paid almost $ 250,000 for a sweet new set of wheels .
The screen includes the man ’s name , address , phone number , e-mail address , Social Security number , employer and job title -- a one - stop shop for big - time identity theft .
“ You could sell all that for a lot of money , ” Maiffret muses .
“ Maybe $ 50,000 . ”

Earlier this week , Radisson Hotels & Resorts said its computer system was accessed without authorization .
It did n’t say how many hotel guests were affected by the security breach .
In the case involving 130 million stolen credit and debit card numbers , authorities say the suspect , Albert Gonzalez , accessed people ’s personal information pretty much as much as he liked from 2006 to 2008 .
An unspecified number of stolen card numbers were sold online and used to make fraudulent purchases and bank withdrawals , according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court .
Jason Lidow , founder of the L.A. computer security firm DigiTrust Group , says most people and businesses have no idea how easy it is for a cyber - thief to make off with sensitive data .

DigiTrust is the company that unleashes Maiffret on paying customers .
Lidow says clients typically pay anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars for an attack on their system -- in hopes that this will help protect them from real hackers .
“ You can never be 100 % safe , ” Lidow says .
“ That ’s not a message we hide from clients .
No one can make you 100 % secure .
“ The target should be figuring out how you ’re most likely to be accessed and then to block that access . ”

Hackers can plant viruses and malicious software in people ’s computers simply by getting you to open a PDF file attached to an e-mail , or by luring you to a legitimate - looking website where watching a video might sneak some spyware into your system .
Stan Stahl , head of Citadel Information Group , another L.A. security firm , says social - networking sites like Facebook and Twitter also have become hunting grounds for cyber -criminals .
He recalls one case in which a hacker took control of someone ’s Facebook page and sent an e-mail to all of that person ’s friends that looked like it was from the Facebook member .
It said she ’d just had her cash and passport stolen while visiting London -- please wire some money right away .
“ And people sent money to the hacker , ” Stahl says .
“ It ’s a whole new world out there .
You do n’t know who to trust . ”
Advertisement
There was a time when you could n’t trust Maiffret .
He says he spent much of his teenage years hacking business and government networks .
His come - to - Jesus moment came when he was 17 and the FBI took an interest in his activities .
“ I was n’t arrested , ” Maiffret says .
“ But that ’s when I understood this was n’t a lifestyle I could keep . ”
So now he hacks on the side of truth , justice and the American way -- and a steady paycheck .
After compromising the auto dealer ’s computer network , Maiffret sits down with the company ’s chief marketing officer , whose expression darkens as Maiffret cycles through screen shots of the various files he accessed .
Advertisement
The exec ’s eyes go wide as a shot of one of the customer files comes up .
“ You got into that ? ” he asks .
“ The highest level of access ? ”
Maiffret nods .
“ Did you see the names of any movie stars ? ” the exec asks nervously .
“ We tell them that their information is secure . ”
Advertisement
It ’s not .
The exec says he ’ll have to think about this .
Afterward , I ask Maiffret how often he comes across a client ’s computer system that he ca n’t hack .
He smiles sheepishly .
Never ?
Advertisement
“ Never , ” he says .
That ’s great for Maiffret .
Very bad for the rest of us .

Craig Anthony Miller earned brief fame by screaming something about the Constitution in the face of Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter .
A woman followed with the same scripted rant .
The subject of the meeting in Lebanon , Pa. , was to be health care , and the goal of the organized mobs was to disrupt it .
A Republican - turned - Democrat , Specter is not universally beloved in either party .
But there he stood , straight - backed and square - jawed , before all the hollering .
He even tried to respond to the shreds of coherence detectable in the attacks .
Specter looked good .
Lazy pundits have portrayed such scenes at this month 's town hall meetings as evidence of a growing army of opposition to the proposed health - care reforms .
Polls do show some slippage in support following an onslaught of untruths over what reform to do .
But the public remains pretty much divided on the matter .
After much too much time on the sidelines , President Obama is finally entering the fray .
If Obama 's smart -- and we know he is -- he 'll counter the lies but let the vitriol work for him .
The right wing has launched another of its red -faced crusades .
When that happens , the loser is ultimately the Republican Party .
Sure , obnoxious behavior gets a lot of attention .
So do car wrecks .
Back in 1998 , Republican activists determined to sink Bill Clinton staged an impeachment carnival that froze the American government for months .
Their excesses turned a population shocked by Clinton 's sexual misconduct into one feeling sorry for him .
What was the political fallout ?
That November , Republicans lost five House seats .
( The party count in the Senate did n't change . )
Remember the Elian Gonzalez affair in 2000 ?
Elian was a Cuban boy whose mother died while taking him to Florida .
His father in Cuba wanted his son back ( as was his right under international law ) , and Republicans tried to stop that from happening .
Some pushed a bill to make Elian an American citizen .
When federal agents forcibly removed Elian from his relatives ' house in Miami , Republicans called them " storm troopers . "
The right wing had turned this family conflict in a titanic battle between capitalism and communism .
What most Americans saw was a dad denied his son .
His " crime " was being a Cuban who wanted to live in Cuba .
Later that year , Republicans lost two more seats in the House and four in the Senate .
Americans gave the Democratic candidate for president , Al Gore , 500,000 more votes than the " victor " George W. Bush .
And Clinton left office with the highest approval rating of any president in a half - century .
In 2005 , Republicans tried to make hay out of the Terri Schiavo tragedy .
Loud protests had convinced them of wide public opposition to letting Schiavo 's husband remove her from a feeding tube after she had spent
15 years in a vegetative state .
The demonstrators prayed , shouted insults at Michael Schiavo and provided a feast for the television cameras .
When someone finally did a poll , it was revealed that Americans by a more than two - to - one margin sided with the husband and disapproved of the Republicans ' meddling .
The more important poll took place in November the following year , when Republicans lost 31 seats in the House and five in the Senate .
Other factors influenced these outcomes , of course .
But politicians now facing the wrath of enraged right - wingers should note that similar unruly outbursts in the past probably worked against the Grand Old Party .
Come November 2010 , voters are not going to punish Democrats or the Republicans who work with them on health reform , if the product is well designed .
" Every scarecrow has a secret ambition to terrorize , " the Polish poet Stanislaw Lec wrote .
Health reformers , be not afraid of scarecrows .
Attorney General Eric
Holder has decided not to bring any criminal charges against a former Bush administration official who lawmakers said lied to them in sworn testimony .
An inspector general 's report found that Bradley Schlozman , the former head of the civil rights division , misled lawmakers about whether he politicized hiring decisions .
Criminal prosecutors eyed the matter but decided not to file any criminal charges for his under - oath denials of making personnel decisions based on politics .
TVNL Comment : Wake up folks ... Democrats and Republicans are part of the same criminal cabal .
The rest is all smoke and mirrors to distract you .

Fadela Amara said France was a beacon for an enlightened Islam A ban on the wearing of the burka in France would help stem the spread of the " cancer " of radical Islam , one of its female Muslim ministers has said .
Urban Regeneration Minister Fadela Amara told the Financial Times that a veil covering everything but the eyes represented " the oppression of women " .
Ms Amara said she was " in favour of the burka not existing in my country " .
The comments come as French MPs hold hearings on whether to ban the garment , which covers the body from head to toe .
The National Assembly set up the 32 - member commission after President Nicolas Sarkozy said the burka was " not welcome " in France , home to Western Europe 's largest population of Muslims .
The burka represents not a piece of fabric but the political manipulation of a religion
Fadela Amara , French Minister for Urban Regeneration Mr Sarkozy said it was unacceptable to have women who were " prisoners behind netting , cut off from all social life , deprived of identity " .
In 2004 , France controversially banned Muslim headscarves and other " conspicuous " religious symbols in state schools and by public employees .
' Male chauvinism '
In an interview with the Financial Times on Saturday , Ms Amara said she was in favour of an outright ban on the burka , even though it might be difficult to apply .

" The burka represents not a piece of fabric but the political manipulation of a religion that enslaves women and disputes the principle of equality between men and women , one of the founding principles of our republic , " she said .
France was a beacon for an enlightened Islam at ease with modernity , so it was necessary to fight the " gangrene , the cancer of radical Islam which completely distorts the message of Islam " , she said .
Ms Amara , who is of Algerian descent , argued that banning the burka would help women to stand up to the extremists in their communities .
" The vast majority of Muslims are against the burka .
It is obvious why , " she said .
" Those who have struggled for women 's rights back home in their own countries - I 'm thinking particularly of Algeria - we know what it represents and what the obscurantist political project is that lies behind it , to confiscate the most fundamental liberties . "
She added that the 2004 ban on headscarves in schools had helped Muslim women face up to male chauvinism in their communities .

“ Please rebase on top of master and we ’ll merge your pull request ” .
“ Can you please squash your commits together so we get a clean , reversible git history ? ” .
“ Can you rewrite your commit ’s message to describe better the problem it solves , and how it solves it ? ” .
Questions like these are commonly asked in pull requests .
Let ’s see why they exist , how to perform them , and their possible problems .
One of the simplest history rewrites we can do with git is changing the last commit message .
Let ’s say right after making a commit you find a typo in its description , or you find a better way of describing the changeset .
To make the correction you run :
git commit -- amend
It will open an editor with the last commit message , so you can modify it .
After saving , a new commit will be created with the same changes and the new message , replacing the commit with the previous message .
This can be useful to include files you forgot to track , or include modifications to the files you just commited .
To do so , you can add the changes and then perform the amend :
git add README.md config/routes.rb git rm notes .
txt git commit -- amend
Aside from editing the commit message , the new commit will contain the changes specified with git add and git rm .
You can also edit the author .
For example :
git commit -- amend -- author = " Tute Costa and Dan Croak < tute+dan@thoughtbot.com > "

You can now change the last commit of your repository to include newer changes to the files , and / or to improve the commit message .
But do n’t start amending all - the - things before understanding the last section of this blog post titled “ DANGER ” .
Would love to speak about this now , but we need to understand a more general tool before .
Stay tuned !
Everything else will be easier once we read about …
git rebase re-applies commits , one by one , in order , from your current branch onto another .
It accepts several options and parameters , so that ’s a tip of the iceberg explanation , enough to bridge the gap in between StackOverflow or GitHub comments and the git man pages .
An interesting option it accepts is -- interactive ( - i for short ) , which will open an editor with a list of the commits which are about to be changed .
This list accepts commands , allowing the user to edit the list before initiating the rebase action .
Let ’s see an example .
Let ’s say I want to reword any of the last 4 commits of this blog .
I then run git rebase -i HEAD ~4 , and here is what I see :
pick 07c5 abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage pick de9b1eb Fix PostChecker :: Post#urls pick 3e7ee36
Hey kids , stop all the highlighting pick fa20 a f3 git interactive rebase , squash , amend # Rebase 8db7e8b..fa20af3 onto 8db7e8 b # # Commands : # p , pick = use commit # r , reword = use commit , but edit the commit message # e , edit = use commit , but stop for amending # s , squash = use commit , but meld into previous commit # f , fixup = like " squash " , but discard this commit's log message # x , exec = run command ( the rest of the line ) using shell # #
These lines can be re-ordered ; they are executed from top to bottom .
# #
If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST .
# # However , if you remove everything , the rebase will be aborted .
# #
Note that empty commits are commented out
We see the four last commits , from older to newer .
See the comment below the list of commits ?
Good job explaining , git ! pick ( p for short ) is the default action .
In this case it would reapply the commit as is , no changes in its contents or message .
Saving ( and executing ) this file would make no changes to the repository .
If I say reword ( r for short ) in a commit I want to edit :
pick 07c5 abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage pick de9b1eb Fix PostChecker :: Post#urls r 3e7ee36
Hey kids , stop all the highlighting pick fa20 a f3 git interactive rebase , squash , amend
When I save and quit the editor , git will follow the described commands , landing myself into the editor again , as if I had amended commit 3e7ee36 .
I edit that commit message , save and quit the editor , and here is the output :
robots.thoughtbot.com tc - git - rebase % git rebase -i HEAD~4 [ detached HEAD dd62a66 ]

Now Caleb says in his commit message “ Stop all the highlighting ” , whether you are a kid or not .
Achievement Unlocked !
You can now change the message of any commit you want .
You may do so , just make sure you understand the “ DANGER ” section .
Two other commands rebase interactive offers us are :
squash ( s for short ) , which melds the commit into the previous one ( the one in the line before )
( for short ) , which melds the commit into the previous one ( the one in the line before ) fixup ( f for short ) , which acts like “ squash ” , but discards this commit ’s message
We ’ll continue to work on the rebase example we worked before .
We had four commits , my own for this blog post , and three others from Caleb , which were related to his previous post on PGP :
pick 07c5 abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage pick de9b1eb Fix PostChecker :: Post#urls pick 3e7ee36
Hey kids , stop all the highlighting pick fa20 a f3 git interactive rebase , squash , amend
Let ’s say I want to meld Caleb ’s commits together , because they belong to the same logical changeset , and so we can git revert it easily if we find we prefer not to have those changes in this repository .
We ’ll want to keep the first commit message , and squash the two subsequent commits into the previous one .
I change pick to squash where appropriate :
pick 07c5 abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage s de9b1eb Fix PostChecker :: Post#urls s 3e7ee36
Hey kids , stop all the highlighting pick fa20 a f3 git interactive rebase , squash , amend
Save , and I land into the editor to decide the commit message of the melded three commits ( see how they are concatenated one after the other ) :
# This is a combination of 3 commits .
#
The first commit's message is : Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage Besides demystifying a relatively complex tool , protocol , and etiquette , this post is intended to help with problems such as the one outlined in this tweet : > Emailed sensitive info to someone with PGP .

You are currently editing a commit while rebasing branch ' tc - git - rebase ' on ' 71d4789 ' .
I decide to remove the third commit message , and add a more relevant note to the second commit message .
Save the editor , and the four commits were transformed into two : the one from Caleb , and mine after .
Good !
We could have used the fixup command , if we had seen earlier that we want the changes , but not the commit message , of the third commit .
In that case , the commands would have looked like :
pick 07c5 abd Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage s de9b1eb Fix PostChecker :: Post#urls f 3e7ee36
Hey kids , stop all the highlighting pick fa20 a f3 git interactive rebase , squash , amend
When saved , the editor would have included the third commit message already commented out for us :
# This is a combination of 3 commits .
#
The first commit's message is : Introduce OpenPGP and teach basic usage Besides demystifying a relatively complex tool , protocol , and etiquette , this post is intended to help with problems such as the one outlined in this tweet : > Emailed sensitive info to someone with PGP .

You can now merge commits together .
As always , be mindful of the DANGER section .
We fork an open source library , start working on a feature branch , and master in the upstream project moves ahead .
Our history looks like :
A---B---C feature / D---E---F---G upstream / master
The library maintainer asks as to “ rebase on top of master ” , so we fix any merge conflicts that may arise between both branches , and keep our changeset together .
The maintainer would like to see a history like :
A '-- B' -- C ' feature / D---E---F---G upstream / master
We want to reapply our commits , one by one , in order , onto upstream ’s master .
Sounds like the description of the rebase command !
Let ’s see what commands would land us into the desired scenario :
# Point our `upstream` remote to the original fork git remote add upstream https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl.git #
Fetch latest commits from `upstream` ( the original fork ) git fetch upstream # Checkout our feature branch git checkout feature #
Reapply it onto upstream 's master git rebase upstream / master #
Fix conflicts , then `git rebase -- continue` , repeat until done # Push to our fork git push -- force origin feature
Achievement Unlocked !
Your feature branch will be applied on top of latest master of the original fork .
And so we get to …
See the -- force in the last git push command ?
That means we are overwriting repository ’s history .
This is always safe to do in commits we do n’t share with other team members , or in branches that belong to us ( see my initials in the example of this blog post ) .
But if you force push editions that were already shared with the team ( commits that exist outside of my repository , like the changes I made to the PGP commits that have been already shared ) , then everyone ’s branch gets out of sync .
Rewriting history means abandoning existing commits and creating new ones , that may be very similar but are different .
If others base work on your previous commits , and then you rewrite and force - push your commits , your team members will have to re-merge their work ( if they notice the potential loss ) .
At thoughtbot we prefix our branches with our initials , signaling that those commits may get rewritten and others should n’t add commits to the branch .
When those commits land into master or a shared branch we never rewrite them again .
So rewrite git history , provided rewritten commits exist only in your repository , or you and your team know that no one else should base work off of them .
Achievement Unlocked !
You now know how to rebase while being a good citizen .
The scientist who concluded that organic food is no healthier than conventional produce has been bombarded with abusive messages from zealous environmentalists .
Dr Alan Dangour , a nutritionist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , told The Independent that hundreds of people had contacted him since his work was published , with many accusing him of dishonesty and incompetence in emails peppered with swear words .
" A lot of them have been unpleasant reading , " said Dr Dangour , whose controversial study found no evidence that organic food was significantly healthier than food produced using chemicals .
" They were saying I 'm a quack [ and that ]
I should do something else and stop wasting my time , but also a lot of stuff saying I must have been funded by Monsanto or big industry . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The academic said that , although he was not upset by the correspondence , he was surprised by the strength of feeling on the issue .
His research , funded by the Food Standards Agency , could hit the £ 2 bn - a - year organic industry , which is already losing sales in the recession .
In another blow to its reputation yesterday , John Mackey , the boss of Whole Foods Market , criticised his US company 's flagship British store in Kensington , west London , for selling too many fatty organic products .
" We sell a bunch of junk , " he said , admitting the need to concentrate on health at his UK division , which lost £ 36 m last year despite the considerable public interest in organic produce .
Research shows that nine out of 10 British shoppers buys organic , but debate has long raged about whether it is healthier for shoppers as well as better for the environment .
Dr Dangour 's study , published last week in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , has polarised opinion between those for whom it has confirmed long - held suspicions and those who believe it was one - sided .
In an article in The Daily Mail the food writer Joanna Blythman , branded the study a " cancerous conspiracy " .
Dr Dangour , whose team reviewed 50 years of scientific papers , estimated he had been sent between 250 and 300 emails , with hundreds more arriving at the FSA and his university .
Among the more printable comments were : " Shame on you and this bogus so - called study , " and : " To the quacks who wrote the study and concluded that organic foods have no health benefits over conventional foods : you blokes are freakin ' whacky . "
Dr Dangour , who said he found the abuse " mildly entertaining " , added : " I have received an awful lot of emails .
Half have been positive , saying we really needed this , and I have received a lot of negative emails , some of which have been abusive .
I 'm not sure I expected that .
I was quite taken aback .
" Some have questioned my integrity and independence ; whether I am funded by big agriculture or industry .
It 's professionally hurtful for people to say : ' You must be funded by industry or otherwise you would n't have come up with that finding ' . "
Organic supporters have complained that Dr Dangour 's study should have looked at the impact of pesticides on health , while others pointed out that the work did not nullify the environmental benefit of organic farms , which are generally acknowledged to be good for wildlife .
Others said they bought organic food because it tasted better .
The Soil Association , Britain 's main organic certification body , pointed out that while all 162 relevant studies reviewed found organic to be higher in many nutrients such as beta - carotene , the review concluded there were no important benefits from only 55 " high - quality " studies .
Dr Dangour called the group unfair , saying : " They obviously have their own point of view but in certain circumstances the way they tried to make their point has not been entirely appropriate .
If you pull random numbers from the report and claim that they are significant , that is not helpful . "
Peter Melchett , policy director of the Soil Association , distanced the organisation from any personal attacks .
But , in a sign that the public debate on the topic is unlikely to be quelled soon , he described the study as " bad science " .
" It is the nature of science that bad science does n't last and I 'm convinced that this is bad science , " he said .
" Over the weekend , a number of scientists around the world have read the papers , and the fury that 's building against the study from serious and reputable scientists is enormous . "
The Soil Association has long suspected that the FSA is anti-organic , a view fuelled by criticism of the organic movement by the agency 's first chairman , Sir John Krebs .
Yesterday , the FSA stood by its research , describing it as " the most scientifically rigorous , independent review of research ever carried out in this particular area " .
" Opinion has , at times , been rather polarised , " it added .
" The FSA is neither pro- nor anti-organic food and recognises that people choose to eat organic for many different reasons . "
One source in the organisation said that it had been surprised by the " near religious " tone of some of the criticisms of its research .
Dr Dangour insisted : " I 'm not pro- or anti-organic .
I 'm a scientist and I pulled together a leading team of nutritionists for this research .
We have done it entirely properly and correctly and it has been peer - reviewed . "
He said he would have liked to have included new EU - funded research into organic nutrition by Newcastle University published in April last year – after the February cut - off date for his research period set by the FSA .
Another report from the EU study , which has provisionally found that organic food is healthier , is due to be published in an academic journal later this year .
Dr Dangour said the existing evidence was robust enough to come to a judgement about the nutritional content of organic food and said the number of studies was better than for many other meta-analyses .
Professor Anthony Trewavas of Edinburgh University , an ardent critic of organic food , backed him , saying : " The trouble is that ideologues have propounded the idea that organic must be better for you simply because it 's more natural .
Nothing really could be further from the truth . "
Conclusive proof about the differences between the two farming systems could come only from cohort studies of illnesses over a long period of time – like the 200 studies done to prove the link between diet and cancer – and these were unlikely to be funded , added the Professor Trewavas , an expert in plant biochemistry .
" If you are eating the recommended diet of five portions of fruits and vegetables a day that is designed to saturate you in minerals and vitamins , there is no benefit from eating more , " he said .
" The fact is that the five a day from conventional farming is perfectly adequate for our health . "
Nutritionists pointed out that , whatever the truth of the organic debate , Britons still ate too few portions of fruit and vegetables .
Adults eat an average of 2.7 portions a day against a Government recommendation of five .
Helen Tracey , of the British Dietetic Association , said studies showed that some organic products , such as milk , were significantly higher in nutrients .
" We do n't always recommend organic as better , " she added .
" We say it is much better to have a good range of fruit and vegetables that you can afford . "
Organic food :
Is it worth it ?
* Shoppers buy organic food for several different , sometimes overlapping reasons .
Some say it is healthier on the basis that it contains extra vitamins and minerals , or because it uses fewer pesticides than other food , which can contain pesticide residies .
Others feel organic is better for the environment , because organic farms do not use nitrogen fertiliser derived from petro-chemicals or they are richer in wildlife .
Others say it tastes better .
* The FSA 's 50 - year review of scientific literature deals with only one of these reasons , albeit an important one : nutrients .
The study concluded that there were no important health benefits of organic food in relation to vitamins and minerals .
To the anger of some , the study did not address the controversy surrounding pesticide residues .
The official Government position is that the vast majority of pesticide residues are safe for human health
* One significant drawback of the research is that its period of analysis meant that it did not take account of a four - year EU study , which has provisionally found that organic food is significantly richer in vitamins .
Organic debate : The shoppers ' verdict
Frank Naba , 17 , student
I eat organic food about four or five times a week .
Mostly vegetables , chicken , eggs – that stuff – it's healthier .
My mum has always given me organic food since I was a baby .
Now , the older I get , the more organic food I want .
It 's healthy .
It builds me up strong .
Well , I thought it was healthy until recently when they said it made no difference .
Jim Rogers , 34 , business and finance manager
I do eat organic food .
Generally , it tends to be better quality .
If you want to eat organic chicken , you have to pay the price .
There 's always a level of concern about how organic the food really is .
But still , regardless of what they say the health benefits are , you can eat that meal and know that nothing artificial has gone into the process of making it .
Wendy Parker , 28 , council worker
I try to buy organic food .
Fruit and veg mostly .
I try to cut down on how much meat I eat – just a couple of times a week now so I can afford the organic stuff .
I think it 's healthier and I think it tastes better .
It 's better for the farming economy and the environment as well .
From what I 've read previously , I certainly have the feeling organic would be better for you .
Lillie Nodar , 50 , manager of a software company
The taste is different , obviously , and there are too many poisons around anyway .
It 's good for the earth and there are no chemicals used in the production cycle of organic food , so it 's win-win .
I 'm not really surprised [ by the FSA findings ] .
It 's to do with perception .
There 's a lot of brainwashing that goes on .
It 's a fashionable way of doing things .
Jane Parks , 64 , Retired
I do n't eat organic food .
There 's so many arguments for and against , and there 's a risk of some of it not actually being organic .
Some things , frankly , do n't obey trade descriptions .
It 's too expensive and it 's pointless .
It is n't any better for you .
I do n't think it 's any worse .
If you want to be precious , be vegan , but you 're taking the joy out of life .

For those still clinging to quaint notions of the American ideal , these have been a faith - shaking 10 years .
Just as evolutionary science once got in the way of creationists ’ catechism , so has politics now undermined patriots ’ naive belief that the United States is a functioning democracy .
The 21st century opened with a handful of Supreme Court puppets appointing George W. Bush president after he lost the popular vote — and we all know the costs in blood and treasure that insult wrought .
Now , the decade closes with another cabal of stooges assaulting the “ one person , one vote ” principle — and potentially bringing about another disaster .
Here we have a major congressional push to fix a health care system that leaves one - sixth of the country without coverage .
Here we have 535 House and Senate delegates elected to give all 300 million of us a voice in the solution .
And here we have just 13 of those delegates holding the initiative hostage .
In the Senate , both parties have outsourced health care legislation to six Finance Committee lawmakers : Max Baucus , D - Mont. ; Kent Conrad , D - N.D. ; Jeff Bingaman , D - N.M. ; Mike Enzi , R - Wyo. ; Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , and Olympia Snowe , R - Maine .
The group recently announced it is rejecting essential provisions like a public insurance option that surveys show the public supports .
Meanwhile , seven mostly Southern House Democrats have been threatening to use their Commerce Committee votes to gut any health care bill , regardless of what the American majority wants .
This , however , is n’t about the majority .
These lawmakers , hailing mostly from small states and rural areas , together represent only 13 million people , meaning those speaking for just 4 percent of America are maneuvering to impose their health care will on the other 96 percent of us .
Census figures show that the poverty rates are far higher and per capita incomes far lower in the 13 legislators ’ specific districts than in the nation as a whole .
Put another way , these politicians represent exactly the kinds of districts whose constituents would most benefit from universal health care .
So why are they leading the fight to stop — rather than pass — reform ?
Because when tyranny mixes with legalized bribery , constituents ’ economic concerns stop mattering .
Thanks to our undemocratic system and our corrupt campaign finance laws , the health care industry does n’t have to fight a 50 - state battle .
It can simply buy a tiny group of congresspeople , which is what it ’s done .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , health interests have given these 13 members of Congress $ 12 million in campaign contributions — a massive sum further enhanced by geography .
Remember , politicians trade favors for re-election support — and the best way to ensure re-election is to raise money for TV airtime ( read : commercials ) .
In rural America , that airtime is comparatively cheap because the audience is relatively small .
Thus , campaign contributions to rural politicians like these 13 buy more commercials — and , consequently , more political loyalty .
The end result is an amplifier of tyranny : Precisely because the undemocratic system unduly empowers legislators from sparsely populated ( and hence cheap ) media markets , industry cash can more easily purchase tyrannical obstruction from those same legislators .
In this case , that means congresspeople blocking health care reform that would most help their own voters .
Of course , there is talk of circumventing the 13 obstructionists and forcing a vote of the full Congress that cannot be filibustered .
Inside the Washington palace , the media court jesters and political aides - de - camp have reacted to such plans by raising predictable charges of improper procedure , poor manners , bad etiquette and other Versailles transgressions .
But the real crime would be letting the tyrants block that vote , trample democracy and kill health care reform in the process .

The ayatollah said Iran 's enemies had been ' given a slap in the face '
Iran 's supreme leader says he has seen no proof that opposition leaders blamed for the post-election unrest were agents of foreign powers .
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments contradict accusations which have frequently been made by hardliners .
A number of senior opposition figures are currently on trial in Tehran accused of conspiring with foreign powers to organise unrest .
But the ayatollah appears to be trying to reduce tensions , say correspondents .
" I do not accuse the leaders of the recent incidents to be subordinate to the foreigners , like the United States and Britain , since this issue has not been proven for me , " said Ayatollah Khamenei , in a statement read out on Iranian television .
But he said there was " no doubt " the mass demonstrations , in which at least 30 people died , had been planned in advance , " whether its leaders know or not " .
" This plot was defeated , since fortunately our enemies still do not understand the issue in Iran , " he said .
" Our enemies were given a slap in the face by the Iranian nation , but they are still hopeful and they are pursuing the issue . "
' Suspicions and rumours ' Opposition leaders say dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested during the protests after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner of the presidential election .
IRAN UNREST 12 June presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled , alleging poll fraud Mass street protests saw at least 30 people killed and foreign media restricted
Profile : Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Q&A : Election aftermath Trials are taking place of some of those allegedly involved in the unrest , but they have been dismissed by critics as show trials .
Hardliners are calling for the arrest of the two leading opposition candidates in the election - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - as well as former President Akbar Rafsanjani .
They accuse Mr Rafsanjani of being part of a plan by the US and Britain to destabilise Iran .
But Ayatollah Khamenei said : " One can not move based on suspicions and rumours in issues with such high importance .
" Everyone can be sure that crimes will not be tolerated , but in such important issues the judiciary should judge based on strong reasons and evidence . "
A senior cleric , Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , has attacked the actions of Iran 's ruling elite .
" The biggest oppression ... is despotic treatment of the people in the name of Islam , " said Ayatollah Montazeri in a statement posted on his website .
" I hope the responsible authorities give up the deviant path they are pursuing and restore the trampled rights of the people . "
The BBC's Kasra Naji says Ayatollah Khamenei appears to be seeking to restrain his followers .
There are indications that the trials - in which some of the accused have allegedly confessed to being part of a foreign - instigated plot - are pushing Iran into more uncertainty , our correspondent adds .

During last year ’s campaign , Barack Obama stressed that while he wanted to withdraw from Iraq , he was no pacifist .
“ As president , ” he said on July 15 , 2008 , “ I will make the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be .
This is a war that we have to win . ”
He began to make good on his word on March 27 when he announced a “ comprehensive new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan ” that included 21,000 additional troops .
The goal , he said , was to “ reverse the Taliban ’s gains ” and “ prevent Afghanistan from becoming the Al Qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11 . ”
On Aug. 30 , the president ’s handpicked commander in Afghanistan delivered a plan to do just that .
Implementing his counterinsurgency strategy , Gen. Stanley McChrystal wrote , “ requires more forces . ”
If extra troops are not sent , and soon , the “ likely result ” would be “ failure . ”
One would expect , based on his past statements , that Obama would rush to give McChrystal the forces needed to win what the president described in August as a “ war of necessity . ”
Yet that ’s not the case .
The White House has been sitting on the general ’s report for a month , refusing to allow him to submit his resource request or testify to Congress and leaking to the news media that the president may decide to downsize the entire war effort .

Why this sudden hesitation after so many months of resolute rhetoric ?
Surely the president cannot be getting cold feet simply because of rising American casualties .
Losses are tragic but expected in a tough fight .
Maybe he ’s panicking over falling public support for the war , especially among his liberal base .
Yet this war remains far more popular than the one in Iraq was in 2006 when President George W. Bush approved the “ surge . ”
If Obama asks for more troops , Congress is unlikely to oppose him .
Perhaps the fraud - marred presidential election has caused Obama to doubt whether it ’s possible to build a legitimate government in Kabul .
That ’s a real concern , but it is being addressed by the Afghan electoral authorities , who are reexamining ballots cast in hundreds of precincts where fraud was alleged .
Even if President Hamid Karzai ultimately prevails , that ’s hardly the end of the world .
He remains popular with many Afghans , especially the Pashtuns , who make up the base of the insurgency .
He has at least as much credibility as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki did in 2007 at the start of the surge , and he can increase his support still further if he does a better job of delivering basic services and fighting corruption -- something coalition forces can push for if they receive more resources .
Admittedly , improving governance will be a tough task .
The same may be said of the other “ lines of operation ” that McChrystal ’s strategy envisions , from growing the Afghan security forces to improving population security , strategic communications and detainee operations .
But what ’s the alternative ?

Vice President Joe Biden favors a smaller - scale strategy that would employ high - tech weapons and special forces to kill terrorists from afar .
But such a strategy has rarely , if ever , succeeded .
It has been employed by Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah .
The result : Hamas controls Gaza , and Hezbollah controls southern Lebanon .
It has been employed by the U.S. in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The result : The Taliban controls western Pakistan and large swaths of eastern and southern Afghanistan .
There is no reason to expect , given its long record of failure , that this strategy will work , and no one knows that better than McChrystal , who was in charge of special operations forces hunting terrorists in Iraq for years .
Such operations are useful but not decisive , because terrorist leaders can always be replaced .
Only by placing security forces among the population can a government prevent terrorists from creating havens .
In Afghanistan today , that must be a job primarily for NATO because the Afghan security forces are simply too small .
Afghanistan is bigger in area and population than Iraq , yet its army and police are less than one - third the size of Iraq ’s ( 170,000 versus 600,000 ) .
Sending more U.S. troops today can push the insurgents back and create breathing room for the expansion of the Afghan forces .
Conversely , if we start downsizing , our NATO allies are sure to beat us to the exits .
The result will be the further unraveling of security in Afghanistan .
In such an environment , it is hard to know how we could generate the intelligence needed to successfully target terrorists or the stability needed to train Afghan forces .
The presence of American trainers or special forces requires a substantial support base to keep supply lines open , safeguard bases and rescue Americans who are in danger of being overrun .

Gains for the Taliban would be not only a human rights disaster but a strategic disaster , because of the close links between the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
As a little - noticed passage in McChrystal ’s leaked report notes : “ Al Qaeda ’s links with HQN [ the Haqqani network , one of the leading insurgent groups ] have grown , suggesting that expanding HQN control could create a favorable environment for AQAM [ Al Qaeda and associated movements ] to reestablish safe havens in Afghanistan . ”
We do not have to create “ Jeffersonian democracy ” in Afghanistan .
But we do have to keep it from becoming a terrorist haven .
The only way to achieve that minimal objective is with a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy .
If Obama blinks now , he will be doing grave damage not only to U.S. security but to his own credibility .

10 Craziest Baseball Rules
The guy in the photo above is Alexander Cartwright , and he ’s credited with inventing the modern game of baseball .
Only problem is that those initial rules from the 1840s were pretty messed up , in comparison to how baseball is played today .
We ’ve lauded a lot of these old timey baseball guys with handlebar mustaches in the past , but we might have to take it all back .
In the 1800s , baseball was a goofy game with a lot of stupid rules .
These guys would probably crap themselves if they had to face guys like Justin Verlander or Alex Rodriguez today .
*****
My great great Von Paris grandfather was a big fan of baseball .
When he arrived in Baltimore in 1892 as a young German immigrant , the ( 5 - 0 - 1 ) : Boston Beaneaters ( 102 -48 ) had beaten the Cleveland Spiders ( 93 - 56 ) in the 1892 Championship Series .
My great great grandfather meanwhile began a small business to help people move their belongings as their jobs relocated around Baltimore .
One hundred plus years later , Von Paris Moving and Storage is known as the best Baltimore movers bar none if you want the most reliable , professional service to transport both residential and business goods from point A to point B .
The business has remained in the family with third , fourth and fifth generation family members continuing to provide outstanding service as “ The Mover with the Gentle Touch . ”
And I want you to know we are all baseball fans .
In fact Von Paris has moved many professional sports teams including the Balitmore Orioles !
Here are The 10 Craziest Baseball Rules You Would Never Believe Existed .
Besides the whole “ no minorities ” thing that we ’re glossing over , that is .
10 . Pitchers Could Cover Balls With Just About Anything
Before 1920 , pitchers could cover the ball with spit , Vaseline , road kill , Nickelodeon slime or whatever the hell else they wanted .
It apparently worked .
That Babe Ruth guy did n’t start hitting a billion home runs a year until they outlawed it .
We do n’t actually know for a fact they used road kill , but that whole ‘ Dead Ball Era ’ thing would make more sense if they did .
9. Balls And Strikes Didn’t Really Exist
When baseball started , hitters just kind of stood at the plate whacking away until they hit the ball somewhere in fair territory .
That created a question of what constituted a walk ( see Rule Four ) or a strikeout .
In 1887 , walks were even considered hits .
And that was also the first year that batters were awarded first base if they got hit by a pitch .
Called strikes did n’t even exist until 1858 .
And until 1863 , base runners would run advance on foul balls .
And as you ’ll see in Rule Three , they did n’t necessarily run to the correct bases .
Have you ever seen a Little League game with 6 - year - olds ?
It ’s pretty terrible .
That ’s how we imagine old timey baseball must have looked .
We even picture an old farmer so terrible at hitting , that his coach has to bring out a tee .
8. Catchers Had Zero Protection
See that old timey idiot in the picture below ?
It ’s not his fault .
Chest protectors were n’t introduced into baseball until 1885 .
It was n’t until six years after that when catchers got to wear padded mitts .
These poor bastards just had to stand there in a dumb stance and wait to get their goddamn faces blown off with a foul tip .
But , then again , you ’ll see from # 1 that these guys were n’t really facing ‘ the heat ’ from pitchers until 1883 .
It ’s just amazing it took the rules committee two years to realize that catching was a fairly dangerous job .
7. Pitchers Used To ‘ Throw ’ From 45 Feet
You ’ll notice in the picture below that the pitcher ( who is n’t even on a mound ) looks crazily close to the batter .
That ’s because the whole 60 - feet - 6 - inches thing did n’t exist until 1893 .
But hey , that ’s 15.5 feet shorter to hurl your heavy - as - hell Vaseline / spit / pubes ball towards your poor bastard catcher .
6. Hitters Had Flat Bats
For some reason that we can’t figure out , hitters used to have flat bats until 1893 .
They really took their cricket influence seriously .
Why did they want to use paddle bats ?
Maybe they wanted to spankthe ball .
Sounds pretty lame to us .
4. Hitters Got Nine Balls Before They Walked
We said in Rule Nine that baseball rule makers had a real hard time with balls and strikes , but in 1879 it was decided that nine balls made a walk .
How bad did a pitcher have to be to walk somebody in 1879 ?
You would ’ve had to be blind .
It was n’t until 1889 that the number was finally whittled down to four .
3. Base Runners Did n’t Have To Touch Every Base
From 1858 – 1864 , base runners did n’t have to touch every base in order .
Did they also play the “ Benny Hill Show ” song while these goofballs ran all over the field ?
2. Batters Could Call For The Type Of Pitch They Wanted
From 1867 - 1887 , batters had the privilege of calling for a low pitch or a high pitch .
What was the point of pitching ?
Did the pitcher also have to wipe the batter after they went to the bathroom ?
1. Pitchers Threw Underhand
That should blow your mind .
Major League Baseball officially started in 1876 , but it was n’t until 1883 that pitchers were allowed to throw overhand .
The initial rules of baseball stated that pitchers had to throw the ball as if they were pitching a horseshoe .
So these old batters got to call for their pitch and get it thrown to them underhand .
They could n’t step towards the plate .
No wonder the pitchers covered the balls in battery acid and pig manure .
Love baseball ( or battery acid and pig manure ) ?

The 8 Ugliest Baseball Uniforms Of The 1970’s
The 1970 ’s were a dark era for the baseball uniform .
Just look at that douchey Phillies uniform above .
The classic logos and button - down looks took a back seat to loud disco-era colors and the aesthetics of a psychedelic sleepover .
Or something .
They just looked bad .
And you thought this year ’s NBA All - Star jerseys looked stupid .
Here are The 8 Ugliest Baseball Uniforms of the 1970’s .
8. 1969 -1971 Oakland Athletics
Really , Oakland A’s ?
Sleeveless with a big yellow electric banana suit ?
We know you had Reggie Jackson and Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers , but that does n’t give you an excuse to dress like Jimi Hendrix during road games .
7. 1978-1981 Chicago Cubs
The baby blue road jerseys of the late ’ 70 ’s were bad enough without adding white pinstripes .
The sight of Bill Buckner and Dave Kingman on your team is bad enough .
6. 1971 -1972 Baltimore Orioles
Somebody tell Charlie Brown that The Great Pumpkin did exist .
5. 1977-1979 Pittsburgh Pirates
They actually won the ‘ 79 World Series looking like school buses .
The pillbox hat was a nice touch .
They actually brought these uniforms back from 1981 - 1984 , right before the skinny Barry Bonds era .
At what point do you stop looking like pirates and start looking like you ’re in your p.j. ’s after a night at Studio 54 ?
4. 1979 Philadelphia Phillies
Poor Mike Schmidt .
He ’d have to wait a whole year to win the World Series , the MVP Award and not look like a ketchup bottle for part of the season .
3. 1975 -1977 Cleveland Indians
Throughout the ’ 70’s , the Indians always had pretty awful jerseys .
They did manage to keep Chief Wahoo hidden for the most part , but when they went to the wacky font and an all red road jersey , that ’s when they were most offensive
2. 1976-1981 Chicago White Sox
If disco died at Comiskey Park in 1979 , sh*tty uniforms had to wait until 1982 to meet their death on Chicago ’s South Side .
The Good Guys did n’t wear black until 1990 .
And from 1976 - 1981 the Good Guys wore sailor suit softball pajamas .
1. 1972-1973 San Diego Padres
At 6′6 ″ Dave Winfield ’s 1973 rookie uniform was a whole lotta barf - and - diarrhea - colored fabric .
1972 and ‘ 73 were definitely two years that San Diego did not keep it classy
The 8 Worst Baseball Trades Of The Past 25 Years
As the trade deadline inches closer in Major League Baseball , we thought we ’d take a look back at some of the trades over years ( with 20 / 20 hindsight ) to talk about the worst trades on the books .
How would the now - defunct Expos have looked with Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez ?
How bad would the George W. Bush - run Rangers love the Sammy steroid years ?
We ’ll never know .
But here are The 8 Worst Baseball Trades of the Past 25 Years .
8. 1989 : The Rangers Trade Wilson Alvarez , Sammy Sosa and Scott Fletcher to the White Sox for Harold Baines and Fred Manrique
This is the trade that George W. Bush calls the biggest mistake of his adulthood .
So you know it has to be bad .
Alvarez pitched a no hitter in his first start with the Sox .
And Sammy went on to be a superstar .
It was almost as if he was on a crapload of steroids .
But it should n’t be that bad considering Harold Baines is no chump .
That ’s pretty bad , but not quite as bad as …
7. 1992 : The White Sox Trade Sammy Sosa and Ken Patterson to the Cubs for George Bell
George Bell was a flat out smelly turd for the White Sox .
George W. Bush should be happy he did n’t make this call .
6. 1993 : The Dodgers Trade Pedro Martinez to the Expos for Delino DeShields
Remember when Delino DeShields was a hotshot young player ?
We kinda do .
Put Pedro would go on to win the first of his 3 Cy Young Awards with the Expos before they decided they did n’t want to play baseball in Montreal anymore .
5. 1991 : The Orioles Trade Curt Schilling , Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley to the Astros for Glenn Gavis
Schilling was n’t amazing on the Astros , but he did end up winning 3 rings and immortalizing the bloody sock .
Harnisch was an All - Star for the Astros and Finley would go on to two All - Star Games .
Glenn Davis would break his jaw fighting other sumbags in a bar .
His 13 home runs in ‘ 92 were the most he’d hit the rest of his lousy career .
4. 1989 : The Expos Trade Randy Johnson , Gene Harris and Brian Holman to the Mariners for Mark Langston and Mike Campbell
Hey Expos , do you want a future 300 game winner ?
Do you want a one - two punch of Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez ?
No ?
Okay .
No wonder you do n’t have a team anymore .
3. 1997 : The Mariners Trade Derek Lowe and Jason Varitek to the Red Sox for Heathcliff Slocumb
It ’s not like Derek Lowe and Jason Varitek are bona fide Hall of Famers , but that trade is two really good players for Heathcliff motherf * cking Slocumb .
Varitek and Lowe have gone on to a combined 5 All - Star Games .
Slocumb washes cars in our parking lot .
2. 1990 : The Red Sox Trade Jeff Bagwell to the Astros For Larry Andersen
Back when the Red Sox hated winning , they got the mediocre Andersen to ‘ help out ’ in the bullpen .
Pete Gammons huffed and puffed abut the Red Sox trading away a future batting champion .
He ’s not in the Hall of Fame for nothing .
Bagwell would win the 1991 Rookie of the Year , win the 1994 MVP and play in 4 All - Star Games in 15 years with the Astros .
1. 1987 : The Tigers Trade John Smoltz to the Braves for Doyle Alexander
8 All - Star Games and a Cy Young later , Detroit NATIVE John Smoltz is still rubbing it in the Tigers ’ faces .
Doyle Alexander ?
Come on .

The commemorative 2009 Pittsburgh Penguins Stanley Cup Champions DVD will be released tomorow , July 7th .
And somehow , we have a sneak peak for you a day early .
Coming up on the 15th , those of us that turned Foley ’s into a Penguins - fan heaven will be getting together to celebrate the championship by watching the DVD .
I was already pumped for our celebration , but this leaked clip of the DVD just makes me that much more anxious to watch it .
Tell me you did n’t almost cry during this brief 1 minute and 25 seconds … I dare you .
Looks like your One From The Heart and Against The Odds VHS tapes are getting some much needed company .
* UPDATE *
Now with better quality video , courtesy of Pens TV .
I thought I perhaps was cherry - picking in my last post on Chuck Colson ’s idea that health - care reform would lead to government - sponsored eugenics .
A couple of days later , it looks like a trend : there ’s Tony Perkins laying out “ The bottom line is that health care rationing is n’t coming — it ’s here .
And until euthanasia is specifically prohibited in the legislation , the only thing that should be humanely killed is the plan to encourage it . ”
And there ’s the FRC claiming reform will deny care to “ our greatest generation . ”
Then there ’s Randall Terry and the talk - show hosts .
And the Christian Worldview Network .
Even Fred Thompson tries to get in on the game , though he says he ’s just trying to make sure there wo n’t be “ undo consideration given to cost - cutting ” in any reform package .
Seems like everywhere you turn somebody ’s saying that Obama wants to snuff your Granny .
The motherlode of crazy , though , was surely struck by none other than Pat Buchanan , a man who has been huffing fear and paranoia from a spray can since the Nixon administration at least .
Buchanan thinks Obama has it in for your Grandpa , actually , based on …well , I ’m not entirely sure .
Something about back pain in England or something .
But he ’s pretty sure he knows what the bottom line is :
Now , twin this story with the weekend Washington Post story about Obamacare ’s “ proposal to pay physicians who counsel elderly or terminally ill patients about what medical treatment they would prefer near the end of life and how to prepare instructions such as living wills , ” and there is little doubt as to what is coming .
The Post portrayed the controversy as stoked by “ right - leaning radio ” using explosive language like “ guiding you in how to die ” and government plans to “ kill Granny . ”
Yet , is not the logical purpose of paying doctors for house calls to the terminally ill , whose medical costs are killing Medicare , to suggest a pleasant and early exit from a pain - filled and costly life ?
Let us suppose the NICE plan in Britain is adopted .
And an 80 - year - woman , living alone , with excruciating persistent back pain , is visited by a physician - counselor .
What is he likely to advise ?
What conclusion would Grandma be led to by a doctor who sweetly explains what treatment she may still receive , what is being cut off , and what her other options might be ?
What other options are there ?
Examples of how to “ die with dignity ” are at hand .
In other words , Buchanan wants you to fear health care reform because it might use standard end - of - life care .
Millions of Americans have living wills or other legal documents directing the medical care they wish to receive .
There are nursing homes that wo n’t admit residents without them .
But according to Pat Buchanan , they are instruments of kill - happy government bureaucrats .
Wait , it gets crazier from there .
After a brief detour through Swiss euthanasia practices , we hit this :
This is the way of de-Christianized Europe .
For years , doctors have assisted the terminally ill in ending their lives .
Indeed , it has been reported that indigent , sick and elderly patients who could not make the decision for themselves had it made for them .
So here we have euthanasia tied to the Islamic takeover of Europe , all facilitated by the continent ’s failure to properly fight the Clash of Civilizations .
This is deeply , richly , nutty , sort of like if you ’d taken a Salted Nut Roll , slathered it in peanut butter , caramel , macadamias and cashews , then deep - fried it in coconut oil .
This is wingnuttery on a stick , the kind of batshit insanity that can only be found at the State Fair wedged in between the sheep pens and the carnies ’ after - hours bar .
This , my friends , is the kind of craziness that you just ca n’t buy in stores .
And we ’re not done yet .
Because Buchanan ,
God bless his black little heart , thinks that this sorry state of affairs reveals the greater war on Judeo - Christian values , as evidenced by — I crap you negative — Nazi Germany :
In Weimar Germany , two professors published “ The Permission to Destroy Life Unworthy of Life , ” which advocated assisted suicide for the terminally ill and “ empty shells of human beings . ”
Hitler ’s Third Reich , marrying Social Darwinism to Aryan racial supremacy , carried the concepts to their logical if horrible conclusion .
Revulsion to Nazism led to revival of the Christian ideal of the sanctity of all human life and the moral obligation of all to defend it .
But the utilitarian idea — of the quality of life trumping the faith - based idea of the sanctity of life — has made a strong comeback .
And the logic remains inexorable .
If government intends to “ bend the curve ” of rising health care costs , and half of those costs are incurred in the last six months of life , and physician - counselors will be sent to the seriously ill to advise them of what costs will no longer be covered , and what their options are — what do you think is going to be Option A ?
Now , we might note , as Ed Kilgore does , that Weimar Germany was hardly of a piece with the Nazi regime .
We might also note — as Kilgore does —
Buchanan ’s neat trick of setting up the most reactionary of Christian ethics over and against a strawman concept of “ secularists and atheists , ” as if there were no moral ground between Bishop Lefebvre and Peter Singer .
We might also agree with Steve Benen that it is remarkable that this intellectual thug will probably be back on MSNBC spewing the same crackpot theories in days , if not hours .
But most of all , we will note , as does Fred Ward , that if you have to set yourself up as better than an elder - murdering Islamocommunist Nazi regime , you have set a pretty low bar .
Because what Buchanan ’s column demonstrates at the last is how weak a hand he and Colson and Perkins and Terry and all the rest are playing , politically , socially , even theologically .
These tinhorn dysangelists have proclaimed a God of fear and brute authority for decades , and now , at long last , their protection racket is about to run dry .
It reminds me of the scene late in the run of the Sopranos where two of Tony ’s goons try to shake down a coffee franchise , only to be turned away with the message that all the money is accounted for at headquarters down to the last bean , and even if the manager cooperated , he ’d just be fired and replaced with someone else who would n’t .
The lead goon staggers out of the shop baffled and wondering what the neighborhood has come to .
That ’s Pat Buchanan ’s God rammed up against the immovable object of health care reform .
If Democrats ca n’t see that two - bit deity for the idol of hollow men that he really is , they have no business running the nation .
But if they do , it will surely turn out to be the holiest and most satisfying of irony .

The mistake was blamed on a clerical error .
After he was fired , Kauppila accepted a job as a contractor at Bechtel Nevada Corp. , a research company that works with Los Alamos and other national laboratories .
He was also working on a new Scatter Reduction Grids in Megavolt Radiography focused on metal plates or crossed grids to act to stop the scattered radiation while allowing the unscattered or direct rays to pass through with other scientists : Scott Watson ( LANL , DX - 3 ) , Chuck Lebeda ( LANL , XTA ) , Alan Tubb ( LANL , DX - 8 ) , and Mike Appleby ( Tecomet Thermo Electron Corp . )

The family believes foul play was involved in his disappearance .
A celebration of Darwin ’s life was held in Idaho Falls and Moscow on the one - year anniversary of his disappearance .
The services included displays of Darwin ’s work and thank you letters from school children and teachers .
Memories of Darwin were shared by at least a dozen speakers from around the world and concluded with the placing of roses and a memorial wreath in the Snake River .
A candlelight vigil was also held that evening on the banks of the Snake River .
Darwin was declared legally dead the first week of March 2004 and now the family is in the process of obtaining restraining orders against several companies who saw fit to use his name and photos without permission .
His brother David is legal conservator of the estate and his sister Rebecca is handling issues related to Eagle Rock Research and ongoing research projects .
Media help in locating Darwin is welcome .
Continuing efforts to solve this mystery include recent DNA sampling .
Stories about his disappearance continue to appear throughout the world .
Issues surrounding missing adult investigations have received new attention following the tragedies of 911 .

L'affiche sème le trouble aux Etats - Unis .
Placardée sur les murs de Los Angeles , elle représente Barack Obama grimé en Joker à la manière de Heath Ledger dans le dernier épisode de Batman .
Pour l'instant , personne ne sait exactement d'où vient le poster et son étrange légende , " socialism " .
Apparue pour la première fois en janvier sur le compte Flickr d'un certain khateeb88 , l'image est reprise le 25 avril sur le site Bedlam Magazine , qui dénonce un détournement " raciste " et " provocateur " .
Depuis quelques jours , elle a gagné les rues de Los Angeles et Atlanta , et se répand massivement sur la Toile .
Des internautes ont même poussé le détournement jusqu'à superposer la voix de Heath Ledger à l'affiche :
Des T - shirts portant l'effigie sont déjà en vente .
Mais si certains y voient une " guérilla artistique " contre la réforme du système de santé américain et le plan de relance du secteur automobile voulus par Obama , beaucoup s'interrogent sur le message envoyé par l'auteur .
" Le Joker était plusieurs choses , mais certainement pas un socialiste , note Robert Dougherty sur Associated Content .
Tous ceux qui ont vu The Dark Knight [ Le Chevalier noir ] le savent , (... ) le Joker est un partisan de l'anarchie . "
Cela n'a pas empêché la blogosphère anti-Obama d'en faire ses choux gras .
Le site Free Republic conseille aux " Américains épris de liberté " de réimprimer l'image et de la diffuser massivement par courriel .
" Il y en aura de plus en plus .

New details of Bill Clinton 's triumphant North Korean rescue mission leaked yesterday have revealed that the former president had help from a dazzling array of high - level contacts – including the billionaire Hollywood producer Steve Bing .
Bing , an erstwhile playboy and certified FOB , or Friend of Bill , lent Mr Clinton the all - white plane that ferried him across the Pacific .
And nor was Bing the only player to help make a mission of huge value to the American government into a credible freelance operation .
Yesterday 's revelations on how the trip was secretly assembled revealed the extent of Mr Clinton 's sometimes murky network of contacts .
Once considered problematic given the position of his wife as Secretary of State , they give him a unique edge to mediate in crises where the US government might prefer to keep its distance .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Vital on this occasion was his long - standing relationship with Mr Bing , the property development heir and film financer who had a brief brush with the tabloids after a dispute over whether he had or had not fathered a child with the British actress and model Elizabeth Hurley .
( He had . )
A reliable donor to Clinton 's foundation , Mr Bing 's recent film projects include The Polar Express and Martin Scorsese 's Rolling Stones documentary Shine A Light .
With special permits issued at the last minute by the Federal Aviation Authority , the all - business class Boeing 737 ferried the former president and a small coterie of aides across the water to North Korea with two refuelling stops .
The cost of filling its tanks , put at $ 200,000 ( £ 120,000 ) , will be paid by Mr Bing .
Thanks were given to Mr Bing by Al Gore , the former vice - president .
Mr Gore is a co-founder of the news channel , CurrentTV , for which the two women , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , were working when they were arrested in March .
" To Steve Bing and all the folks who have made the flight possible , we say a word of thanks , deep thanks , as well , " he said .
Not to be forgotten , meanwhile , are Dow Chemical and its chief executive , Andrew Liveris .
Also Clinton donors ,
Dow laid on the plane that carried Mr Clinton from his home in New York to Burbank , California , where the Bing aircraft was waiting .
US officials , up to and including Mrs Clinton who is in East Africa all this week , continue to separate the rescuing of the women from the nuclear stand - off with Pyongyang .
" I want to be sure people do n't confuse what Bill did , which was a private humanitarian mission to bring these young women home , with our policy , which continues to be one that gives choices to North Korea , " Mrs Clinton said during a stop - over in Nairobi .
" Our policy remains the same . "
To suggest that Barack Obama had nothing to do with Mr Clinton 's mercy mission at all would not be strictly accurate , however .
It was the White House that approached the former president about attempting the mission .
Mr Clinton agreed , but was said to have left with strict instructions from President Barack Obama 's National Security team to stick rigidly to his brief .
Analysts doubt whether Mr Clinton stuck entirely within those limits .
If nothing else , he had a rare opportunity to note the physical health of Kim Jong - il , whose exact condition is a matter of great interest to the US authorities who started to debrief Mr Clinton yesterday .
Whatever else , though , the fact of the meeting having happened gives both sides a chance to continue talking .
" The North Koreans had a terrific face - saving opportunity , " noted Jack Pritchard , a former US envoy to the country .
" If they did n't take advantage of this to send positive signals to Mr Clinton , then there 's really no hope for them . "
One of the most common claims about Iran 's blatant election fraud is that it stripped the regime of its legitimacy , and therefore badly weakened it .
Consequently , the common wisdom is that U.S. engagement with Tehran is now off the table for two main reasons : Washington can't appear to be rewarding Tehran after a brutal crackdown , and a weakened Iranian regime would be less able and willing to compromise , anyway .
However , as some foreign policy analysts have realized , the Iranian government under Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is stronger and more consolidated than it has been in years .
This is why intensified engagement — not the popular method of imposing additional sanctions — is what Washington needs to pursue in the coming years .
The first thing Washington has to accept is that the reform movement in Iran has been dealt a significant blow over the last three weeks .
Instead of seeing the Green Wave crest and wash away the power of Khamenei and Ahmadinejad , the world has watched it break up and recede .
U.S. relations with Iran do not necessarily have to wax and wane with the fortunes of Iranian reformers , and it is unfortunately at the time when the Iranian regime feels most confident and secure in its hold on power that it will be most willing to negotiate and follow through on deals with the United States .
As President Obama said during the campaign , negotiations are not rewards for the other government , and refusing to enter into talks is not a punishment .
Those perceived to be hard - liners are in a better position to survive the risk of negotiations , and sell the deal as serving national interests rather than betraying national security .
In this respect , Khamenei and Ahmadinejad may be better interlocutors than their counterparts in the reform camp , as they do not need to establish a reputation for opposition and hostility to America , Israel , and the West .
They have credibility as hawks that more accommodating , ostensibly more " pro-Western " figures might not have .
Authoritarian regimes have taken the leap many times before .
In 1979 , for example , Egypt was able to make peace with a decades - long enemy — Israel — after faring reasonably well in a war against it .
And neither détente with Moscow nor the opening of China in 1972 would ever have happened had Washington refused to deal with repressive and thuggish governments .
Though far from perfect , these dealings have worked to the advantage of the United States , and were far preferable to the truly " isolationist " alternative .
The alternative to engagement is the continued souring of relations with Tehran and the imposition of new sanctions .
Wisely , the United States is apparently going to block a European - led push for a new round of Iran sanctions at this year ’s G - 8 summit , but the reason why this is the correct move may not be fully clear .
If these sanctions are imposed explicitly for the benefit of the reformers or to punish the government for suppressing the protests , they will have the perverse effect of shifting the blame for the country ’s economic woes to the opposition , and away from the government responsible for Iran 's disastrous mismanagement .
If they are aimed at compelling regime collapse , they will in all likelihood backfire and drive the population into the arms of a regime that is still capable of exploiting foreign hostility to its advantage .
In the meantime , the adverse economic effects from any sanctions strong enough to weaken the government will harm not only the most vulnerable and poorest Iranians , but will work to destroy the economic base of the burgeoning middle class that remains the core of the reform movement .
For the brief satisfaction at having " taken a stand , " outside powers will have sabotaged the long - term prospects of the movement with which they purport to sympathize .
Even if the Iranian government is weakened to some degree , its opposition will be undermined even more .
Furthermore , collective punishment methods that are aimed at discrediting a government in the eyes of its people very rarely work ( see Hamas and Gaza ) , and they are least likely to have the desired political effect on a regime that has just made its disdain for popular opinion abundantly clear .
There are no guarantees that direct U.S. engagement with Iran will improve the fortunes of Iranian reformers , but we can be reasonably certain that additional sanctions will suffocate an already struggling movement , and will help the current hard - liners retain power even longer .
I am so pissed right now ...

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The financial crisis has laid bare defects in the dollar - led global economy and the world should look to displace the U.S. currency , even if that will take many years , Chinese officials said in comments published on Monday .
The push for fundamental , if gradual , reform of the international financial system comes just before the Group of Eight summit in Italy , where China ’s willingness to question the dollar ’s role could fuel debate .
The Special Drawing Right ( SDR ) , a unit of account used by the International Monetary Fund , presents a viable alternative to the dollar as a global reserve currency , said Li Ruogu , chairman of the Export - Import Bank of China , a major state - run bank .
“ It is a feasible plan to reform the present SDR and make it into a real settlement currency , a universally accepted ‘ currency basket ’ that would replace the dollar at the heart of the monetary system , ” Li was cited as saying in Financial News , a newspaper published by the central bank .
The People ’s Bank of China made waves in March when it first suggested that the SDR , whose exchange rate is determined by a mixture of dollars , euros , sterling and yen , was better suited than any single currency to be a yardstick for global trade and a reliable store of value .
“ The financial crisis caused the global economy to suffer heavy losses and it also let us clearly see how unreasonable the current international monetary system is , ” Li , a former central bank vice governor , said .
“ But it would be difficult to find and implement a feasible replacement plan in the short term , so we will still have to travel a relatively long road for reform of the international monetary system . ”
Li ’s warning was echoed by Wang Xin , a central bank economist , who said it would be impossible “ to get there in one step . ”
Wang , head of the central bank ’s financial research department , said that China was inching toward the internationalization of the yuan with the launch of a pilot programme to allow companies to settle some goods trade in the Chinese currency .
“ Only when the yuan has achieved basic convertibility and when domestic financial markets are fully opened can the yuan truly become an international trade settlement currency and store of value , ” he said , also in comments carried by the Financial News .
INTERNAL TENSION
The tension between China ’s vision for a radical overhaul of the global financial system and its big stake in the existing order has been on display in the run-up to the G8 summit , which starts on Wednesday in Italy .
China holds an estimated 70 percent of its $ 1.95 trillion in official foreign exchange reserves in the dollar and is wary of saying anything that would undermine the value of its investments .
On Sunday , Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
He Yafei said the dollar would stay the world ’s dominant currency for “ many years to come ” and that talk of creating a super - sovereign alternative was confined to academic circles .
Officials from other countries who will attend this week ’s G8 summit have said that Beijing has asked for discussion there about the future of reserve currencies .
He Yafei has said that he was unaware of China making such a request .
Giving a sense of the extended timeframe that China might have in mind , Li Yang , a former central bank adviser , said over the weekend that the process of building up the SDR could take 30 to 50 years .
But Li , a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , the government ’s leading think tank , did not mince his words in passing a verdict on the dollar .
“ When a country that issues a reserve currency has a long - term trade deficit , then that currency is no longer suitable to be a reserve currency and the process to replace it should start , ” he was quoted as saying by local media .
“ Up until now there has been no currency strong enough to replace it , so while the process to replace it has begun , it is far from complete , ” he said .
Chinese President Hu Jintao has steered clear of any statements that could roil financial markets in the G8 lead - up .
The closest he has come to the dollar has been to say that countries which issue reserve currencies should submit to closer oversight .
Sources involved in preparation of the meetings said Brazil and India backed Beijing ’s call for debate but there was consensus among the G8 countries , at least , that nothing of significance could or should materialize at this stage .
Strip malls need a makeover .
Not just to look prettier , but to be safer and more accessible to pedestrians , cyclists and other people on the street .
Photo by Dean Terry .
On the beauty spectrum of community design , nothing ’s uglier than a strip mall , with its massive parking lots , low - lying , box - shaped buildings and uninviting walkways .
But the real beast of this type of commercial space is its lack of safety .
According to the summer issue of Journal of the American Planning Association ( JAPA ) , “ arterial roadways , strip commercial uses , and big box stores all have a profoundly negative effect on traffic safety , while the presence of traditional , ‘ main - street ’ - type retail configurations are associated with safer communities . ”
There are more crashes near big box stores located adjacent to arterial streets , and less crashes for commercial or retail areas that are designed for pedestrians .
The article , “ Safe Urban Form : Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety , ” is based on three years of traffic accident data for the City of San Antonio ( which is home to both the “ strip mall on steroids ” and the very sustainably and beautifully designed Riverwalk . )
Some of the findings :
A 6.6 % increase in total crash incidence for each big box store located adjacent to an arterial thoroughfare and a 2.2 % decrease in crash incidence for each pedestrian - scaled commercial or retail use .
Population density increases were associated with fewer crashes .
Each additional mile of arterial roadway within a block group was associated with a 15 % higher incidence of crashes .
Eric Dumbaugh , assistant professor at Texas A&M University , says “ the modern commercial arterial is a perfect storm of bad planning and design . ”
These roads are designed to support high operating speeds , making it difficult for drivers to stop quickly to avoid a crash , and the presence of commercial and retail uses on these roads means that drivers will routinely need to stop quickly in order to avoid crashing into pedestrians , bicyclists , and especially vehicles turning in and out of driveways .
So how do we give these ugly — and dangerous — retail streets a makeover ?
Dumbaugh and his co-authors present three suggestions :
1 ) “ Manage mobility and access functions of urban arterials . ”
Mobility is all about moving cars .
Access is about ensuring that these vehicles can stop safely and passengers can exit securely to get to where they want to go .
No more fears of getting hit by an SUV on your weekly run to Wal - Mart to buy a gallon of milk .
2 ) “ Relocate retail and commercial uses to lower - speed thoroughfares ( or reduce speeds on roads already lined with commercial uses ) . ”
Cars will slow down if they expect to see pedestrians and cyclists in their path — think more crosswalks , benches , outdoor dining , bicycle lanes and green space — and therefore , avoid crashes .
3 ) “ Give greater attention to how land use planning may affect crash incidence . ”
Building roads for high volumes of cars , routing traffic away from neighborhoods , building tons of four - way intersections , and isolating residential subdivisions and cul - de - sacs create a recipe for a dangerous , auto - centric , accident - prone environment .
Plus , it ’s just plain ugly .

Minesweeper is NP - complete
Introduction
In an article of the Symbolic Journal of Computation , Richard Kaye proposed a translation from a propositional logic formula into a minesweeper configuration , such as asking the question 'is there a solution to this formula ? ' is the same as asking 'is this minesweeper configuration possible ?'.
Because the first problem is NP - complete , and because the translation is in polynomial time , you have that minesweeper is NP - complete .
See Richard Kaye 's Minesweeper Pages for all the details .
Unfortunately , his paper does not exist in electronic format , so you will have to go to your favorite library to read it .
Here , we simply propose a program implementing this translation .
The program is far from efficient .
Anyway , translating a logical formula into a minesweeper configuration is a bit of madness , because the minesweeper configuration is much bigger than the formula , and solving this configuration instead of the formula would be the act of some crazy mind .
The translation is polynomial , but the resulting configuration is too big and simply cannot be handled .
For example , I have a formula saved in a 6,060 bytes long file , and my program produces a 2,099,200,686 bytes long file , representing the corresponding minesweeper configuration .
A computer can handle a 6,060 bytes long file ( a program called zchaff can solve the problem in less than 1 second ) .
I know no program solving a minesweeper configuration able to handle a 2,099,200,686 bytes long file ( by the way I know no program solving a minesweeper configuration ) .
And this formula is just the translation of the question 'is there is number of 2 binary digits with the first one = 1 that divides 6 ?'.
I have a program ( available here ) that can produce formulas for this question but with much bigger numbers than 6 and with more than 2 binary digits .
I did n't even try to transform the produced formulas into minesweeper configurations .
( I must admit that this program is far from generating the smallest formulas though . )
In the following , we first will show how to transform a formula into a minewseeper 's configuration , such as Richard Kaye defined it .
Then , we will see what are the basic blocks of minesweeper configurations that we use .
Then , we will talk a bit about the programs we did .
From a formula to a minesweeper configuration
In this section , we will take as an example the formula ( p or q ) and ( r or ( not q ) ) , where p , q and r are boolean variables .
To translate this formula into a minesweeper configuration , we simply draw it , as illutrated by figure 1 .
This is a visual interpretation of the formula .
We may think of it as being a hardware circuit , coding the formula .
The tree variables come from the left , and go to the right .
Then , each line represents a sub- formula of the main formula , which is simply the output of the last line .
From this visual interpretation , we derivate the corresponding minesweeper configuration .
For this particular example , our program would give us a 2160x2784 image that the curious can see here ( 64,593 bytes ) .
The figure 2 is a 25 % reduction of it .
( Note : I produced an image for the 6,060 bytes long example file , leading to a 1,193,161,327 bytes long png file , produced after several hours of calculation . )
Note that , due to the way our algorithm works , the lines are a bit interleaved , so q is not followed by r , as in figure 1 , but directly by p or q , only then comes r .
It would be easy to rewrite the code to get the wanted order .
The creation of the layout is very simple .
The translation from this layout into a minesweeper configuration is straightforward .
We wo n't describe the algorithms further .
I could refer the interested reader to the source code , but it 's a bit unclean .
Try it anyway .
As we can see in figure 1 , we have several basic blocks .
Those are :
wires ,
spliters ,
cross-over ,
terminates ,
turns ,
logical gates .
Basic blocks
Here come descriptions of all the basic blocks .
First of all , one has to note that our grid has a 3x3 basis , meaning the smallest unit considered is not the cell but a square of cells of size 3x3 .
Some basic blocks created by Richard Kaye ( and others ) do n't fit on this 3x3 basis , so we need to add some more cells to them to fit to this basis .
This explains why if you look at some of ours blocks , they are bigger than the corresponding one introduced by Richard Kaye .
This approach was choosen because the algorithms are simple with it .
Wires
We have two kinds of wires : horizontal ones ( from left to right ) and vertical ones ( from top to bottom ) .
The image above shows 4 blocks of horizontal wires .
The image above shows 4 blocks of vertical wires .
Spliters
We have one kind of spliter .
It will split a wire coming from the left into two wires , one going down and the other going right .
The image above shows a spliter .
Cross-over
Here , we also have one kind of cross-over .
It will cross two wires , one coming from left and going to right and the other one coming from top and going to bottom .
The image above shows a cross-over .
Terminates
Terminates may be hard to understand if you do n't know how all this works .
I highly suggest you to read Richard Kaye 's Minesweeper Pages to get it all .
Here we have two types of terminates .
A left one and a right one .
The image above shows a left terminate .
The image above shows a right terminate .
Turns
We have one type of turn .
It turns a wire going from top to bottom into a wire going from left to right .
It is a bit different from the one seen in Richard Kaye 's paper because we have to handle the 3x3 alignment .
The image above shows a turn .
Logical gates
We can imagine a lot of logical gates .
But we know that all the propositional logic can be expressed with only not and or , so we only have implemented those two gates , as basic blocks .
We have two not gates .
One vertical and one horizontal .
The image above shows a horizontal not .
The image above shows a vertical not .
We have one kind of or .
The image above shows an or .
This basic or cannot be used as is ( the same remark can be applied to the previous not gates as well ) , because wires , in our algorithm , come from top when arriving to the logical gates , so we have to create a gate taking two vertical wires as input , thus leading to the next or gate , where we added a turn ( and the two vertical wires must not be too close , so this explains why we have some horizontal wires between the turn and the or ) .
Now , this or can be seen as a box with two inputs and a output .
We could have considered only a basic or , but placing all the blocks together would have been a much greater pain .
With this box model , we only handle rectangles , much easier to deal with .
Our algorithms are very simplified with this method .
The image above shows the implemented or .
By using both not and or , we can , as previously stated , express any formula .
For example , we know that a and b has the same truth value for any a and b as not ( ( not a ) or ( not b ) ) .
Here comes this and gate we implemented .
The image above shows an and .
It 's getting big .
So , those were the basic blocks .
Programs
mines - 1.0.1.tar.gz ( released 2014-04-02 ) is the same as the 1.0.0 , except it compiles with modern gcc .
mines - 1.0.0.tar.gz ( 39,913 bytes ) contains a program that will produce a minesweeper configuration , coming from a formula .
The formula has to be written in a conjonctive normal form ( CNF ) , which is something like ( a or b or ( not c ) ) and ( c or ( not d ) ) and ( ( not a ) or e or g or ( not f ) ) .
It is possible to convert any formula into something that has this form .
But , in general , you will have an exponential blow - up .
There exists technics to avoid this blow - up .
The interested reader might consult for example On Generating Small Clause Normal Forms by Nonnengart , Roch and Weidenbach to get some ideas about this topic , but it is a bit tricky .
Symbolic Model Checking using SAT procedures instead of BDDs is not primarily interested by this specific matter , but they recall a simple algorithm , easy to understand to transform a formula into CNF ( the original paper dealing with this is not available online ) .
The file - format that is accepted by the program is the one of DIMACS , restricted to the CNF part of it .
There is a program included in the archive that generates CNF files , which correspond to a factorization problem .
But those generated examples are really too big , as stated in the introduction .
( Anyway , any realistic example of formula is probably too big to be translated into an usable minesweeper configuration . )
To build those programs , you will need a unix machine , a C compiler ( gcc is fine ) .
You will need libpng to be able to create png files .
Once downloaded , untar the archive , then read README .
If there is a problem , contact me .
The README says you need libgmp .
This is wrong , sorry .
All the interesting code is in main.c and main2.c .
Unfortunately , it is not very well documented , I apologize for that .
If you want some better technical details , try to contact me .

While Facebook has agreed to adopt some recommendations laid out by Canada 's Privacy Commissioner , it still falls short on a number of user privacy recommendations , said Jennifer Stoddart in a report released Thursday .
The privacy commissioner launched a probe of Facebook 's privacy practices in response to a complaint last year from the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic .
" Canadians truly need to know what they are getting into when joining Facebook and should be able to control the information they share , " said Stoddart at a news conference on Thursday .
" We found serious privacy gaps in the way the site operates . "
Facebook , which has nearly 12 million Canadian users , allows people to keep in touch with friends and family by updating their personal pages with fresh messages and photos .
The investigation into its privacy practices has been ongoing for 13 months , and Facebook is working with Canada 's privacy office to address some concerns .
" We urge Facebook to implement all of our recommendations to further enhance their site , ensure they are in compliance with privacy law , and ultimately show themselves as models of privacy , " says Assistant Commissioner Elizabeth Denham , who led the investigation on behalf of Canada 's privacy office .
The four areas of concern that Facebook has not yet agreed to address are :
The excessive amount of personal user information given to third party application developers from all around the world .
The inability of a user to delete their account , which would eliminate their personal information from Facebook servers permanently .
Currently , users can only deactivate their account .
The lack of information provided to users about how their friends can gain access to their personal information .
The fact that personal information about non-users is collected and used within Facebook .
Stoddart was confident Facebook would address some of the concerns , telling CTV News Channel she expected " to make headway in the next 30 days . "
She said that although Facebook provides information about its privacy practices , it is often confusing or incomplete .
For example , a user is not made aware that if they enter their date of birth on their profile page , that date of birth is shared with advertisers .
Stoddart said that , as a result of her recommendation , Facebook has agreed to make users aware of this fact .
The report said that Facebook breaches the law by keeping users ' personal information indefinitely -- even after members deactivate their accounts .
Stoddart wants Facebook to wipe the information in deactivated accounts after a reasonable length of time and said the site should only hang on to data for as long as necessary .
The report also raised concerns about the sharing of user 's personal data with the almost one million third party developers who create Facebook applications such as games and quizzes .
The site lacks adequate safeguards to effectively restrict these outside developers from accessing personal user information , as well as , the personal information of a user 's friends who are also on Facebook , she said .
" It could be a 17 - year - old developer half way across the world who has access to that information , " said Stoddart .
The privacy commissioner will put forth her full report recommendations to Facebook and gauge the company 's progress after 30 days .
She can take the case to the Federal Court of Canada to have her recommendations enforced .
Fazila Nurani , a Canadian privacy lawyer , told CTV News Channel on Thursday that she does n't think Canadians need to be concerned about whether the privacy commissioner has the legal right to force her recommendations on Facebook , an American company .
" The reputational risk involved for Facebook has already got the company worried and thinking about what sorts of privacy tools they need to have , " said Nurani
Nurani also said she completely agrees with the privacy commissoner 's findings and thinks a report of this nature is long overdue .
However , Michael Geist , a law professor at the University of Ottawa , told CTV News Channel that the privacy commissioner is at a stalemate in her negotiations with Facebook
" It 's clear they have reached an end point and the issue may well fall to a Federal Court , " said Geist .
In a statement released by Facebook on Thursday , the company said : " As part of our continued leadership in developing privacy tools that advance user control over their information , Facebook will soon be introducing a number of new additional privacy features to its service that we believe will address any remaining concerns the privacy commission may have .

Daphnia neonate emerge from a dormant egg ( Daphnia birth ) .
Approximate size is 300 micrometers .
Photomicrograph by P. Spaak
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Suspending a life in time is a theme that normally finds itself in the pages of science fiction , but now such ideas have become a reality in the annals of science .
Cornell ecologist Nelson Hairston Jr. is a pioneer in a field known loosely as " resurrection ecology , " in which researchers study the eggs of such creatures as zooplankton -- tiny , free - floating water animals -- that get buried in lake sediments and can remain viable for decades or even centuries .
By hatching these eggs , Hairston and others can compare time - suspended hatchlings with their more contemporary counterparts to better understand how a species may have evolved in the meantime .
The researchers take sediment cores from lake floors to extract the eggs ; the deeper the egg lies in the core , the older it is .
They then place the eggs in optimal hatching conditions , such as those found in spring in a temperate lake , and let nature take its course .
" We can resurrect them and discover what life was like in the past , " said Hairston , who came to Cornell in 1985 and is a professor and chair of Cornell 's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology .
" Paleo - ecologists study microfossils , but you can't understand much physiologically or behaviorally " with that approach , he said .
Hairston first became interested in the possibilities of studying dormant eggs in the late 1970s , when he was an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Rhode Island .
There , he noticed that the little red crustaceans -- known as copepods -- in the pristine lake behind his Rhode Island home disappeared in the summer , only to return as larvae in the fall .
A female copepod carries a bright red egg sac at the base of her body .
( Actual size is approximately 2 mm . )
These eggs were likely hatched within a few days of this photomicrograph .
Photomicrograph by Nelson Hairston Jr.
The observation prompted him to study why they disappear , research that revealed the copepods stay active under the ice in the winter , but they die out as their eggs lie dormant on the lake floor through the summer when the lake 's fish are most active .
When the fish become less active in the fall , larvae hatch from the eggs , and the copepods continue their life cycle .
This time suspension , where zooplankton pause their life cycles to avoid heavy predation or harsh seasonal and environmental conditions , also increases a species ' local gene pool , with up to a century 's worth of genetic material stored in a lake bed , Hairston said .
When insects , nesting fish and boat anchors stir the mud , they can release old eggs that hatch and offer a wider variety of genetic material to the contemporary population .
In 1999 Hairston and colleagues published a paper in Nature that described how 40 - year - old resurrected eggs could answer whether tiny crustaceans called Daphnia in central Europe 's Lake Constance had evolved to survive rising levels of toxic cyanobacteria , known as blue - green algae .
In the 1970s , phosphorus levels from pollution rose in the lake , increasing the numbers of cyanobacteria .
The researchers hatched eggs from the 1960s and found they could not survive the toxic lake conditions , but Daphnia from the 1970s had adapted and survived .
Hairston and colleagues have organized a resurrection ecology symposium in September 2009 , in Herzberg , Switzerland , to bring together researchers in this growing new field .

Upgrading the iPhone Toolchain
In order to target a device such as the iPhone or the iPod Touch for software development , one needs a " toolchain " .
This typically consists of , at bare minimum :
a compiler ( to convert high - level code down to the system 's assembly language )
an assembler ( to generate formatted binaries and machine code given assembly )
a linker ( to connect these binaries up with existing code available on the platform )
and a set of header files ( or some other description , which tells you what features you may find on the platform and how they are used )
Toolchain 0.30
Until recently , the most popular toolchain for these devices has been provided by the iphone - dev project , which was started by NightWatch .
This project has forked some other open source projects and added whatever was required to make it all work .
This toolchain has stood the test of time and has been used by virtually all of the software you may currently find .
For the compiler and linker , NightWatch forked Open Darwin's CC Tools , which is the open - source side of Apple 's assembler and linker ( as well as a few other , related tools ) .
Really designed to compile on a Mac , he carefully added autoconf scripts and a new build environment to make it compatible with other systems .
The linker seems like it was easy ( the format used for different architectures is roughly the same ) .
The assembler , though , was another matter , and required a complete implementation of the ARM instruction set .
This particular project is one that I have been involved in , providing patches for a few types of instructions that had n't yet been added .
While porting Java I also ran into a few other limitations , many of which were in Apple 's original code , that I either fixed or backported ( Apple 's assembler is an ancient fork of GNU gas ) .
GCC , Apple , and LLVM
The story of the compiler is a little more interesting .
While Apple uses GNU 's gcc , which has been ported to numerous platforms and is maintained by a large number of volunteers , they are often at odds with the GNU developers .
To this day , Apple 's compiler is a rather drastic fork , and gcc proper simply does not target any of Apple 's machines .
Luckily , as is required under the GPL ( gcc 's license ) , Apple publishes the source code for these modifications .
They do n't seem to be very good about it , though ( I have heard that they never released the source code to Xcode 2.5 's build of gcc , and they seem to believe they can provide source on their own schedule , rather than with the corresponding binaries , which is required by the license ) .
As an example : they released the code to their iPhone assembler a month late and only after I complained about it .
( To be frank , I would n't be surprised at all if Apple ends up on the bad end of a GPL - related lawsuit . )
Getting access to current copies of Apple 's compiler technology is thereby difficult , if not impossible .
There is , however , a backdoor : LLVM .
This project has aimed to provide some of the runtime compilation benefits of Java ( which I only use as the exemplar because it is well known , not because it originated any of the techniques ) without requiring all of the sandboxing and safety mechanisms .
Recently , when Apple has needed an optimizer ( such as for their OpenGL shading language implementations ) , they have turned to LLVM .
This has quite possibly been motivated by gcc's recent switch to GPL3 , which Apple seems to have taken offense at .
With their internal engineers working on the project , code merges occur with some frequency from Apple 's internal compiler base .
Considering LLVM-gcc
LLVM also has the property of maintaining the support for other machines that Apple routinely drops , not only as compilation targets , but also as build hosts .
This latter property means that it is generally much simpler to start with LLVM 's codebase to compile on non-Macintosh machines than to begin with Apple 's occasional releases .
Unfortunately , there is also a cost for this usage : the very feature that LLVM has added .
While their JIT compilation work is interesting , it is n't done yet .
In the process of adding it they have also added the occasional bug to the core compiler , which can be difficult to track down .
Also , they adamantly do not support the iPhone , and really only have experimental support for the ARM platform .
Between the added bugs and the experimental optimizer , LLVM manages to scramble almost any complex code .
This burned me while working on porting Java , as JamVM 's threaded interpreter is highly intricate and uses a number of computed jumps , which simply segment faulted if compiled at speed .
This also caused issues with previous work on iPhone kernel extensions , both by myself and the iPhone hacker known as " core " , as " long calls " are not supported by LLVM .
This setup is further limited by the time at which it was ported , which has led to an interesting restriction : no one can upgrade past revision 42498 of LLVM and maintain compatibility with the iphone - dev compiler .
Progress has therefore come to an almost complete halt .
Apple 's iPhone SDK
Luckily , for many , there is an alternative :
In early March ( after missing their own deadline of mid-February ) , Apple finally entered this space , providing the iPhone SDK , which also includes such components as a debugger ( to help isolate software bugs ) and a simulator ( to run code on a desktop machine , where you have a larger screen and a full keyboard ) .
This toolchain , however , only runs on a desktop Macintosh ( and , while I have not verified this personally , supposedly only installs on Intel - based machines ) .
At least for me , this is utterly worthless : I do not own any Macintosh computers , nor do I ever intend to ( I'm personally a Linux user ) .
Additionally , it 's still gcc 4.0 .
The gcc project is now on version 4.3 and does n't even mention 4.0 on it 's main website anymore : it 's just that old .
Personally , I hate using old tools : back when I was spending all of my time working on Menes I routinely required CVS HEAD copies of gcc just in order to compile my ( insanely generic ) C++ templates .
Being forced to use gcc 4.0 in order to do development for the iPhone is therefore quite painful .
Finally , Apple 's released set of system headers for this SDK is miserable .
They 've left out a large number of important files , even though all of the support is there in the system .
This makes it difficult to compile many standard open source projects ( such as screen ) .
Instructions and Disclaimer
Really , neither of these options have been at all attractive to me .
I have therefore spent my free time over the course of almost a month working on doing a massive merge of the latest revision of LLVM - gcc , the most recent code release from Apple for gcc_42 , and doing my own development when required to produce a high quality operational toolchain for the iPhone platform .
Now , the instructions I am providing are n't necessarily " copy and paste " : the goal was to use a precise syntax to describe what I meant , not to write a working shell script .
Still , I have tried to make them obvious and I have even tried to make them just runnable , but I just would n't feel comfortable having someone go through these instructions if they really had no clue what the commands were doing .
If you feel this applies to you , get a friend to help .
Please understand that I can't really state that this will work on anything but my system , but if you e-mail me we can work on figuring out how to make these instructions more general .
My system , for the record , is an AMD64 Debian Linux Etch box .
Hopefully , if we think about it together , we can make it work for everyone .
On this note , I encourage people to come to #iphone on irc.saurik.com to find either myself or others who have worked through this process .
( Although please , do n't come there asking someone to walk you through it .
Only come ask for help if you have a concrete question . )
I will admit have not done much testing with this yet .
I have compiled a lot of code with it and what I 've tested of it seems to work ; but I have n't run that much of it yet .
I think it would be even more useful , though , to use the Telesphoreo bug tracking site to coordinate issues .
When you find problems , file bugs against the component ' Toolchain ' so that others ( including myself ) can work on trying to correct them .
Finally , I have n't spent the time to merge in most Objective - C headers , so you should get those from Erica 's website or classdump them yourself .
I 've been working on an alternative to classdump that is iPhoneOS 2.0 compatible , at which point this toolchain will be 100 % ready to compile any application .
Despite all of that , I think this is still going to be of use to some people .
In fact , it already has : ZodTTD has gotten quite good performance optimizations from this toolchain for his / her Playstation emulator .
Regardless , I think we are n't going to make much progress getting this all to work unless we start somewhere , even if that somewhere is a tad broken .
Filesystem Locations
The first step is obtaining the requisite source materials to begin the compile .
We need a filesystem off an iPhone ( for this I am using an extracted .dmg for iPhone - 1.1.4 ) and the headers from both the Mac OS X 10.5 SDK and the iPhoneOS 2.0 SDK .
In order to make it easier to find things later , and to optimize for screen width , I am going to use environment variables to describe all the paths used in each step of the process .
So , here we define the locations to the two aforementioned parts .
I use bash , so the syntax I use will reflect that .
export iphonefs=/ home / saurik / iPhone - 1.1.4 export target=arm - apple - darwin8 export leopardsdk= / Developer / SDKs/ MacOSX10.5.sdk export leopardinc=${leopardsdk}/usr/include export leopardlib=${leopardsdk}/System/Library /Frameworks export iphoneplt=/ Developer / Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform
export iphonesdk=${iphoneplt}/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS2.0.sdk export iphoneinc=${iphonesdk}/usr/include export iphonelib=${iphonesdk}/System/Library /Frameworks
In a similar vein , we need to decide where things are going to go .
We need a location for the installed toolchain ( the prefix for installations ) , the sysroot of the compiler ( where the compiler will go to find the target system 's filesystem image ) , where we are locally going to build the code for the toolchain , and places to check out all the required source code .
Note that none of these folders currently exist : they will be created by our compilation .
export prefix= / dat / pre export sysroot= / dat / sys export PATH = " ${prefix} / bin " : " $ { PATH} " export cctools=/ dat/src/cctools export gcc=/dat/src/gcc export csu=/dat/src/csu export build=/dat/bld
Now , let 's put everything together to build our sysroot .
This will place our /usr / include within the iPhone filesystem , so it will feel like we copied a real development platform into the folder .
( Oh , and while we are at it , Apple forgot a few symlinks that we are going to need . )
Scattered throughout these instructions , you will find references to a variable we have n't yet defined : $ {apple} .
Each of the folders under this directory correspond to packages available from Apple 's Darwin Open Source Releases .
We are cobbling together all of these sources in order to obtain the most powerful possible set of headers that will let us compile everything from userland applications to system tools to kernel extensions .

Depending on what version of the iPhoneOS and from what source you obtained your filesystem from , there may be a number of missing symbolic links related to IOKit .
Here we will replace those :
ln - sfn A System / Library / Frameworks / IOKit.framework / Versions /Current ln - sf Versions / Current / IOKit System / Library / Frameworks / IOKit.framework
The one final thing we need are the set of object files that gcc links against almost everything .
These handle the dynamic loading and operating system entrypoint bootstrapping .
While the new SDK comes with these , we are going to avoid them as their copies seem to rely on using their new ld64 linker which I have n't yet finished porting to ARM .
( I do have this linker running on Linux though , which is the first step as it's rather Mac- centric ) .
This is a component that NightWatch pretty much wrote from scratch .
mkdir -p " ${csu} " cd " ${csu} " svn co http://iphone-dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/csu . cp - a *.o " $ {sysroot} " /usr / lib cd " ${sysroot} " /usr / lib chmod 644 *.o cp - af crt1.o crt1.10.5.o cp - af dylib1.o dylib1.10.5.o
Checking Things Out
Now that we 've decided where everything is going to happen , we need to get the source code .
I have provided the revision numbers I used in the commands below , in order to assure a repeatable build .
However , it is quite likely that whatever the latest code is will work ( modulo the applicability of the couple patches I have made ) .
rm - rf " ${gcc} " git clone git://git.saurik.com/llvm-gcc-4.2 " ${gcc} "
We also need to get the compiler tools for Darwin ( which includes the assembler and the linker ) .
Apple 's versions of these are ancient , and have a ton of custom modifications for their binary formats , so going direct to the standard source ( binutils ) for this is way too painful .
Instead , we are going to pull the copy from the iphone - dev toolchain project , which maintains a fork that adds support for ARM .
I have a rather large number of changes to this particular project : a more complete parser for modern gas macros , constant offset expressions ( not certain if that 's a technical term ) , a few new forms of relocations , support for the macro instruction adr , common symbol alignment , a couple extra instructions to the grammar , and the new arm v6 - arch type that Apple seems to be going with in their modifications to LLVM - gcc .
However , after writing the first version of this article , I was granted commit access , so now these changes are all integrated into the base toolchain .
This makes the following instructions very easy , and exactly the same as they were for the gcc 4.0 based toolchain most users are using .
I highly recommend people update and track this project now that it is being actively maintained again .
rm - rf " ${cctools} " svn co http://iphone-dev.googlecode.com/svn/branches/odcctools-9.2-ld " ${cctools} "
Building Darwin CC
Tools
This build step is pretty much unchanged .
Note that I have added the - m32 flags because I am using a 64 - bit Linux machine as my development environment and Apple 's code ( irritatingly ) assumes you are targeting a machine with the same word size as the machine you are running the tool on .
You may not need those modifications .
mkdir -p " $ {build} " cd " ${build} " mkdir cctools - iphone cd cctools - iphone CFLAGS=- m32 LDFLAGS=-m32 " ${cctools} " / configure \ -- target = " $ {target} " \ -- prefix= " $ {prefix} " \ -- disable -ld64 make make install
Compiling LLVM-gcc
Compiling LLVM - gcc is a little more complicated , but not overly so .
We have to specify our assembler ( lest the system one get used ) , and match the compilation flags that apple used while building libstdc ++
( they do n't support wchar_t ) , but otherwise this is quite straightforward .
mkdir -p " $ {build} " cd " ${build} " mkdir gcc - 4.2 - iphone cd gcc-4.2 - iphone " ${gcc} " / configure \ -- target = " $ {target} " \ -- prefix= " $ {prefix} " \ -- with- sysroot= " ${sysroot} " \ -- enable - languages=c , c++, objc , obj -c++ \ -- with-as= " $ {prefix} " / bin / " ${target} " - as \ - - with - ld= " $ {prefix} " / bin / " $ {target} " - ld \ --enable - wchar_t=no \ --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr / include/c++/4.0.0 make - j2 make install
One finishing touch , and this is where someone who has more experience working with gcc cross compiles might be able to help , is that the folder that is searched for the C++ include path is now inside the sysroot , even though it was installed to our local prefix .
The simplest fix I have found for this is to simply link our local prefix into the sysroot as if it were also on the target machine .
mkdir -p " ${sysroot} " / " $( dirname " $ {prefix} " ) " ln -s " ${prefix} " " ${sysroot} " / " $ ( dirname " $ {prefix} " ) "
Telesphoreo Compatibility
A final note , if you are wanting to compile Telesphoreo packages with this toolchain ( or simply compile your own packages with the Telesphoroeo build environment ) , you should delete the following libraries , as they are replaced and upgraded by Telesphoreo .
If you leave them , the dependency analysis can get badly confused .
for lib in crypto curses form ncurses sqlite3 ssl xml2 ; do rm -f " ${sysroot} " /usr/lib/lib${lib}.*
done
What Next ?
One thing I 'd recommend more advanced users start checking out is the iphone - gcc package in Telesphoreo .
With the new non-LLVM toolchain , I 've been able to get a stable , working compiler on the iPhone itself that is easy to install thanks to APT and Cydia .
( Currently you will have to provide your own /usr / include , as I still need to think through the legal issues of distributing that . )

Here 's to Apple having produced a useful SDK !
Straight up , I ’m a fan of President Obama .
I think he has the potential to be one of the best — he ’s thoughtful , articulate , intelligent , and dare I say it , seems to want to improve this country .
But the other night during his health care speech to both houses of Congress , I hate to say it , but the man shit the bed .
He needed to stop with the polite talk , and communicate in a way the people of this country could understand .
This is how I wish that evening had transpired :
Obama : Good evening .
Tonight I ’d like to talk to you about a crisis that is facing this country .
A crisis of immense proportions — one that could bankrupt our country if we do n’t deal honestly and quickly with it .
I ’m talking , of course , about health care .
( Democrats applaud .
Republicans sit silently )
Obama : I ’d like to thank my good friend Republican Orin Hatch for his help with previous health care legislation .
I ’d also like to thank John McCain for his suggestions on how better to improve Medicare .
( Democrats applaud .
Republicans sit silently , except for McCain who attempts a smile )
Obama : I want to assure you of a few things .
First off , Sarah Palin is a whack job .
There ai n’t no such thing as a “ death panel , ” just like there was n’t any such thing as a marriage between Bristol and Levi .
Secondly , Eric Kantor , if you keep text messaging while I ’m speaking , I ’m going to take your BlackBerry and shove it up your ass .
Third , I want to assure you that illegal immigrants will not be covered by my health care plan…and finally …
( Voice in the crowd ) : LIAR !
Obama : … say what ?
Who said that ?
( crowd mumbles )
Obama : Come on , do n’t be a pussy , stand up and identify yourself !
( man stands meekly )
Obama :
What ’s your name ?
Wilson : Joe Wilson , Mr. President .
Obama :
Oh , so now it ’s all “ Mr. President ? ”
A second ago it was “ Liar ! ”
And what the hell is it you do Joe Wilson ?
Wilson : I am a Republican representative from the state of South Carolina .
Obama : ( laughs )
No shit , now there ’s a surprise .
You got something to say Mr. Joe Wilson ?
If so , get your ass down here and say it .
Otherwise , sit your cracker - ass down in that seat and keep your pie-hole shut .
( Democrats applaud .
Republicans collectively pee in their pants )
Wilson :
It ’s just that the bill says …
Obama :
The bill says what ?
There ai n’t no bill yet you dumbass !
We got five different committees working on this thing .
Were n’t you listening man ?
I ’m introducing my plan right now !
Wilson :
But the amendments that got voted down …
Obama : ( grabs crotch ) I got your amendments right here !
Now sit the fuck down !
Now as I was saying , if you like your current health plan , keep it .
If you ca n’t afford a plan , or you ’ve been dropped from a plan , then this is an option .
And in the long run , it will save the country money .
God bless you , and God bless the United States .
( Democrats and Republicans applaud … except for Kantor who is trying to remove the Blackberry from his ass ) .

In a scene from " Mad Men , " ad execs hang out at a club with women who are n't their wives .

AMC cable TV drama— a critics ' favorite that recently opened its third season to its largest audience ever — depicts a hard - drinking , chain - smoking , casual - sex - in - the - office lifestyle for top ad agency executives in the 1960s .
How much of this is made - for - TV embellishment — and how much is real ?
USA TODAY marketing reporter Bruce Horovitz took that question to Jerry Della Femina , the veteran ad exec widely regarded as one of Madison Avenue 's biggest personalities , most creative thinkers and an over - the - top publicity - seeker .
At 73 , Della Femina is still a force in the ad biz .
He got into it some 57 years ago , starting at age 16 in a Manhattan ad agency mailroom .
Currently , he 's chairman , CEO and executive creative director at New York agency Della Femina / Rothschild / Jeary and Partners .
He 's also a successful restaurant owner and a best - selling author .
Trade magazine Advertising
Age ranks him among the " 100 most influential advertising people of the 20th century . "
In a no-holds - barred interview , Della Femina , known for his trademark shaved head and aviator glasses , sets the record straight :
All the drinking , smoking and sex depicted on Mad Men may be an understatement .
Q : Did ad agency executives really drink that often — and that much — in the 1960s ?
A : If anything , it 's underplayed .
There was a tremendous amount of drinking .
Three - martini lunches were the norm .
Q : At your agency , too ?
A : My ( former ) agency , Della Femina Travisano & Partners , had five top people .
We 'd go to the Italian Pavilion ( now Michael 's in Manhattan ) , and as we walked through the door , the bartender would see us and start shaking the martinis .
As we were being seated at the table , he 'd put them down .
Everyone had one , and without even asking , the second would arrive .
Then , while we were still looking at the menu , the third would arrive .
Q : This was lunch ?
A : This was lunch .
Then we 'd order food and a bottle of wine .
Then , when lunch was over , invariably at dessert time , someone would ask for a double scotch and drink it , and then we'd go back to work .
Q : How could you possibly work after that ?
A : The only thing that saved us was that the clients and agencies that we were going back to drank as much as we did .
One time , while pitching the Geritol account , my brain was so fried that I asked for far more money than I should have .
I realized my mistake and told them — but they were still ready to give it to me .
Q : But the show makes it look like everyone kept a bottle or two in their desk drawer .
And it was n't Geritol .
A : Bottles in desk drawers were not the exception but the rule .
I had an open bar at the agency in which I kept 10 to 15 bottles of booze .
Anyone at the agency could walk in and get it .
Invariably , one or two guys would come in at 9 a.m. , pour a shot and slug it down .
It was a business of drinking .
The way we lived really would make the characters in Mad Men all look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm .
We drank and screwed around .
Q : And now ?
A : Nobody drinks or screws around like that anymore .
It all stopped ( by the mid 1980s ) when the financial guys took over .
Maybe the agency chairman can still drink , but not the soldiers .
Today it 's about people looking at the bottom line .
It 's changed as a business .
Mad Men is celebrating a time that no longer exists .
Q : Did agency executives really smoke that much ?
A : I smoked three to four packs a day .
Everybody smoked at all times in all meetings .
Once , when I was sitting in a meeting for the Contac account , I had a ( lit ) cigarette in my hand and another in the ashtray .
When I put down the cigarette to do a chalk talk , I tried to light the piece of chalk .
Q : Was some of that smoking to kiss up to tobacco company clients ?
A : We had two R.J. Reynolds brands ( Winston Super Kings and Carter Hall pipe tobacco ) .
The R.J. Reynolds guys would get off the elevator on our floor where we had two of those tall ashtrays filled with sand .
The RJR guys would claw through the sand to see if there were butts from any other brands .
These were executives .
They wanted to know what our people were smoking .
Q : Did those clients smoke ?
A : One time I went to visit RJR in Winston - Salem ( N.C. ) .
They hosted a big party at some country club , and they had a giant dance floor with everyone milling about .
I walked up to the balcony and looked down and noticed that everyone was holding a cigarette — all the clients and all of their wives .
But something was n't right .
I noticed that none of the cigarettes were lit .
They were simply holding them .
They believed the statistics .
Q : Do you still smoke ?
A : I have n't touched a cigarette in 20 years .
I have heavy allergies and developed asthma .
The doctor said if I touched another cigarette , I 'd die .
Q : Did agency execs really dress so snappily in the 1960s ?
A : Yes , people dressed .
We went to Brooks Brothers to get our uniforms .
We certainly dressed better than any other business .
Since we were n't bankers , doctors or lawyers , we could wear suits that were high fashion .
The amount of money we had to spend on clothes , well , this was the kind of money we thought we 'd never have .
All for writing a headline or some body copy or doing a nice layout .
It was more money than we could possibly spend .
A lot of people were afraid it would go away .
And it was that fear that led people to drink , smoke and screw around .
Q : As long as you 're alluding to it , what about all the office sex depicted on the show ?
A : There was a tremendous amount of sex .
I do n't know of a single marriage that survived that time .
My first marriage ended after 24 years .
Society had changed .
Suddenly , it was n't just the WASP establishment living the good life .
Suddenly , there were ethnics and kids — who once hoped they could earn $ 12,000 per year — earning fortunes .
All of this money shocked us people in the middle of it .
We lived a Hollywood life .
Did I grow up thinking I 'd ever be paged at the Beverly Hills Hotel ?
Did I ever think I 'd make so much money writing ads ?
No .
It was a lot of people in a great celebration .
But no one wanted to go home .
It was too good .
There was too much booze , too many cigarettes and too many women .
People found themselves in this wonderful gold rush .
Mad Men only touches on how wild it was .
It was beyond whatever I thought could happen to my life .
Q : Can you give one example of this " tremendous amount of sex " at your former agency ?
A : We used to have an agency " sex " contest near the end of every year .
…
We 'd go to a no - name Mexican restaurant , … and we 'd drink giant margaritas all day .
It was an idea I had when I realized our people were spending too much time talking and thinking about sex , and not working it .
We 'd take a blind vote to name the person at the agency you 'd most want to go to bed with .
We also took a vote on the person of the same sex you 'd like to go to bed with .
We did this for 15 years .
I 'd get to announce the winners each year .
The first prize was a weekend at The Plaza hotel for the winning couple .
Second prize was one night at The Plaza .
The third prize was a night on Ron Travisano 's office couch .
People took this very seriously .
Of course , the clients did n't know about it .
One year , we had to rip down signs about the contest when a client unexpectedly showed up at the agency .
Q : Was this contest for real — or for fun ?
A : Only one couple took advantage of it .
Q : Were you , perhaps , half of that winning couple ?
A : I did win one year .
It was a great honor .
My wife even asked me why I got home so late from the party .
But , no , I did n't take advantage of winning .
ASK THE AD TEAM Q : I would really like to know the age and gender of the person who used Donovan 's Catch the Wind in a recent Mass Mutual ad .
It 's such a fabulous song .
And what is Donovan doing now ?
— Lilly Markons , Windham , Conn .
A : The track in the ad is Donovan 's original version of Catch the Wind , out in 1965 .
It plays as the ad shows a father giving up a big job and corner office for a start - up business and home office .
Mass Mutual selected the song for the ad , by agency Mullen , because it " captured the appropriate message and feel of a father making difficult decisions in order to spend more time at home with his daughter , " says Karen Lavariere - Sanchez , a Mass Mutual spokeswoman .
Catch the Wind was the title song on Donovan 's break - out album , and the folk singer - songwriter from Scotland followed with 11 consecutive Top 40 hits , including Mellow Yellow , Sunshine Superman and Wear Your Love Like Heaven .
Donovan Leitch will be named a BMI Icon at the annual London Awards on Oct. 6 and continues to perform .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : darcs 2.3.0
Hello !
I 'd like to announce immediate availability of a new stable release of darcs , 2.3.0 .
There is a number of improvements and bugfixes over the previous stable release , 2.2 .
Moreover , work has been done to improve performance of " darcs whatsnew " for large repositories .
As in the past , there are two source tarballs available .
As of this release , the cabal - based build is preferred , and the autoconf build is deprecated .
You can obtain the source tarballs at these addresses : * http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0.tar.gz * http://repos.mornfall.net/darcs/darcs-2.3.0_autoconf.tar.gz
The build instructions are available in the enclosed README file in those tarballs .
Moreover , if you have cabal - install available , you can install latest stable release of darcs by issuing the following commands ( no tarballs needed ) : $ cabal update $ cabal install darcs
This should give you a darcs binary in `~/.cabal / bin` -- you should probably add this to your PATH .
More detailed instructions for installing on Windows are available near the end of this announcement .
What 's New ----------
This is a summary of important changes since the last stable release ( 2.2 ) : * Lots and lots of documentation changes ( Trent ) . * Haskeline improvements ( Judah ) .
* Cabal as default buildsystem ( many contributors ) .
* Fixes in darcs check / repair memory usage ( Bertram , David ) .
* Performance improvement in subtree record ( Reinier ) .

-----------------------
Using GHC 6.10.3 or newer is * strongly recommended *.
You may compile darcs with GHC 6.8 , but there are several caveats .
If you are using 6.8.2 or older , please disable mmap support ( pass - f - mmap to cabal install or runghc Setup configure ) .
Note that the GHC 6.8.2 that ships with Debian Lenny is not affected and it should be safe to keep mmap enabled .
It is also recommended to disable use of Hackage zlib when compiling with GHC 6.8.2 ( including the Debian Lenny version ) : pass - f - zlib to cabal .
When using zlib , we have seen occasional crashes with error messages like " openBinary File : file locked " -- this is a known GHC 6.8.2 bug ( and is fixed in GHC 6.8.3 ) .
Last , if you are using a 64 - bit system , darcs may hang when you exit a pager when compiled with GHC older than 6.10.3 .
Although this is harmless , it is quite inconvenient .
Overall , the status of GHC 6.8 is " semi- supported " : for many cases , things will work just fine , especially if you take a little extra caution with compilation flags .
Installing on Windows ---------------------
To install darcs on Windows systems from scratch , please download the Haskell Platform and MSYS : * http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/2009.2.0.1/HaskellPlatform-2009.2.0.1-setup.exe * http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS+Base+System/MSYS-1.0.11-rc-1.exe/download
After installing both , you should have an " MSYS " icon : run MSYS and in the terminal window type ( the `$` character denotes the prompt , do not repeat it ) : $ cabal update $ cabal install darcs -f - curl This should download , compile and install all required dependencies and also darcs itself .
The resulting darcs executable will be placed into the Haskell Platform executables folder , and should be accessible from the MSYS shell ( just type " darcs -- version " to check ) .
Yours , Petr .
Barack Obama has demanded the Pentagon conduct a radical review of US nuclear weapons doctrine to prepare the way for deep cuts in the country 's arsenal , the Guardian can reveal .
Obama has rejected the Pentagon 's first draft of the " nuclear posture review " as being too timid , and has called for a range of more far - reaching options consistent with his goal of eventually abolishing nuclear weapons altogether , according to European officials .
Those options include :
• Reconfiguring the US nuclear force to allow for an arsenal measured in hundreds rather than thousands of deployed strategic warheads .
• Redrafting nuclear doctrine to narrow the range of conditions under which the US would use nuclear weapons .
• Exploring ways of guaranteeing the future reliability of nuclear weapons without testing or producing a new generation of warheads .
The review is due to be completed by the end of this year , and European officials say the outcome is not yet clear .
But one official said : " Obama is now driving this process .
He is saying these are the president 's weapons , and he wants to look again at the doctrine and their role . "
The move comes as Obama prepares to take the rare step of chairing a watershed session of the UN security council on Thursday .
It is aimed at winning consensus on a new grand bargain : exchanging more radical disarmament by nuclear powers in return for wider global efforts to prevent further proliferation .
That bargain is at the heart of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which is up for review next year amid signs it is unravelling in the face of Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions .
In an article for the Guardian today , the foreign secretary , David Miliband , argues that failure to win a consensus would be disastrous .
" This is one of the most critical issues we face , " the foreign secretary writes .
" Get it right , and we will increase global security , pave the way for a world without nuclear weapons , and improve access to affordable , safe and dependable energy – vital to tackle climate change .
Get it wrong , and we face the spread of nuclear weapons and the chilling prospect of nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists . "
According to a final draft of the resolution due to be passed on Thursday , however , the UN security council will not wholeheartedly embrace the US and Britain 's call for eventual abolition of nuclear weapons .
Largely on French insistence , the council will endorse the vaguer aim of seeking " to create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons " .
Gordon Brown is due to use this week 's UN general assembly meeting to renew a diplomatic offensive on Iran for its failure to comply with security council demands that it suspend enrichment of uranium .
The issue has been given greater urgency by an International Atomic Energy Agency document leaked last week which showed inspectors for the agency believed Iran already had " sufficient information " to build a warhead , and had tested an important component of a nuclear device .
Germany is also expected to toughen its position on Iran ahead of a showdown between major powers and the Iranian government on 1 October .
But it is not yet clear what position will be taken by Russia , which has hitherto opposed the imposition of further sanctions on Iran .
Moscow 's stance will be closely watched for signs of greater co-operation in return for Obama 's decision last week to abandon a missile defence scheme in eastern Europe , a longstanding source of irritation to Russia .
" I hope the Russians realise they have to do something serious .
I do n't think a deal has been done , but there is a great deal of expectation , " said a British official .
Russia has approximately 2,780 deployed strategic warheads , compared with around 2,100 in the US .
The abandonment of the US missile defence already appears to have spurred arms control talks currently underway between Washington and Moscow : the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , said today that chances were " quite high " that a deal to reduce arsenals to 1,500 warheads each would be signed by the end of the year .
The US nuclear posture review is aimed at clearing the path for a new round of deep US - Russian cuts to follow almost immediately after that treaty is ratified , to set lower limits not just on deployed missiles but also on the thousands of warheads both have in their stockpiles .
The Obama strategy is to create disarmament momentum in the run-up to the non-proliferation treaty review conference next May , in the hope that states without nuclear weapons will not side with Iran , as they did at the last review in 2005 , but endorse stronger legal barriers to nuclear proliferation , and forego nuclear weapons programmes themselves .
" The review has up to now been in the hands of mid-level bureaucrats with a lot of knowledge , but it 's knowledge drawn from the cold war .
What they are prepared to do is tweak the existing doctrine , " said Rebecca Johnson , the head of the Acronym Institute , a pro-disarmament pressure group .
" Obama has sent them it back saying : ' Give me more options for what we can do in line with my goals .
I 'm not saying it 's easy , but all you 're giving me is business as usual . ' "
Michelle Malkin has a new book out .
If it 's as well researched as her two most recent outings -- which featured the classic right - wing technique of gathering any smidgen of evidence one can find to support a thesis ( no matter how dubious or downright false ) while carefully excising any smidgen of contradictory evidence ( no matter how mountainous ) -- it promises to be a real mess .
Malkin was on Sean Hannity 's program last night touting it .
I was particularly interested in how she described it -- heavy on innuendo , intimations of shady dealings , and a major emphasis on First Lady Michelle Obama as a kind of Machiavellian manipulator running the show from behind the scenes .
She labels her " the First Crony . "
This has a familiar ring , does n't it ?
The wingnut right attacked Bill Clinton relentlessly as a corrupt Southerner involved in shady dealings ( think Whitewater or Mena ) , while the Evil Hillary ran the show behind the scenes .
And the mainstream right made heavy use of these attacks .
It 's just deja vu all over again .
Especially the complete and utter loss of perspective :
Hannity : Now that you 've done all this research -- and I 'll let the audience , because you really , with great specificity and detail , go into the corruption -- how corrupt is this administration compared to others ?
Malkin :
Well , I think you have to judge them by their rhetoric .
And if you look at the gap between the rhetoric and the reality , this has to be one of the corrupt , most corrupt administrations in recent memory .
Hmmm .
I dunno about you , but when I look at the levels of corruption within an administration , I look for actual things like , you know , corruption .
Things like Halliburton and Enron .
As for the gap between rhetoric and reality , I usually think of it as matter of disappointment and disenchantment , not of corruption per se ( though it can indicate a kind of ethical corruption , depending on the facts ) .
And I think most other people do too .
Malkin and Hannity sure have a strange standard for what constitutes " corruption . "
Especially considering they not only stood idly by and cheered while corruption ran rampant in Bush 's little war zone but aggressively attacked anyone who brought it up as insufficiently patriotic .
Why Does God Hate Amputees ?
Or , Why Does God Love Marshall Brain ?
by Rich Deem
Introduction
Why Does God Hate Amputees ?
The website , Why Does God Hate Amputees has numerous arguments against the existence of the God of the Bible , although most are quite amateurish .
Does the argument that God does not heal amputees provide the knockout punch to the possible existence of the God of the Bible , as claimed by Marshall Brain 's website ?
Marshall Brain , founder of " How Stuff Works " is also the author of an anti-Christian website , " Why Does God Hate Amputees , " which has been renamed to " Why wo n't God heal amputees ? "
Brain 's main point is that God does not ( hence the " hate " title ) or cannot heal amputees , presumably because He does not exist .
Does this argument provide a valid case against the existence of God ?
Amputees have never been healed ?
The premise of the argument is that amputees have never been healed and that all other " healings " throughout the history of mankind have really been due to natural , but rare , events .
However , there is at least one healing of an amputee that has been recorded .
When Jesus was being arrested prior to His trials , the disciple Peter took a sword and , missing the mark , sliced off the ear of the high priest 's servant :
And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear .
But Jesus answered and said , " Stop !
No more of this . "
And He touched his ear and healed him .
( Luke 22:50 - 51 )
Jesus responded by calling a halt to the violence and healing the man 's ear .
It should be noted that He did not pick up the severed piece of ear , but merely touched the stump to heal the man 's ear .
Although not quite as dramatic as replacing entire legs , it nonetheless represents a miracle that is beyond any possible naturalistic explanation , since humans cannot instantly ( or even over time ) regrow ears .
Bible made it up ?
The common objection to his argument is that the Bible just made up this miracles , like all others it reports .
Of course , this objection is offered without any proof of being correct .
It is just assumed that the disciples would do anything , including lying , in order to propagate their lies .
The funny thing about the assertion is that it directly contradicts the teachings of Jesus , which was fiercely against the hypocrites .
So , the disciples are being accused of doing exactly what they preached against .
Again , no evidence is offered that they ever did any such kind of lying .
What they skeptics wo n't tell you is that there is actually evidence that directly contradicts this assertion .
The problem with the idea that the disciples made up the miracles of Jesus is that the hostile witnesses of the time ( the Jewish religious leadership ) never denied that those miracles took place , but attributed them to the work of Satan . 1
In his rebuttal to Jewish Celsus , Origen reported Celsus as saying Jesus had obtained His miraculous gifts while in Egypt ( obviously by the power of sorcery ) .
2
If the miracles of Jesus had been made - up , the Jews would have denied they ever happened , rather than attribute them to the work of the devil .
It was , in fact , the miracles of Jesus that convinced a large number of people that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah .
So , the extra-biblical evidence actually supports the Bible 's claim that Jesus performed numerous miracles , including the healing of an amputee .
The experiment to " prove " Brain 's point
Marshall Brain has designed an experiment to " prove " that God can not heal amputees .
The experiment goes something like this .
Pick an amputee ( must have both legs severed , just one would not be good enough ) , and have millions of Christians throughout the world pray for his healing .
According to Brain , this proves that God does not exist .
The main problem is that the experiment has never been done .
So , in reality , Brain has proved nothing .
Even if the experiment were to be run , there are some problems with its design .
The first wrong assumption is that a large number of Christians are able to dictate to God what He should do .
Healings do not necessarily require large numbers of people praying , since most recorded healings have involved just one prayer .
The second wrong assumption is that God heals all who are prayed for .
Even the Bible records examples of Christians - even apostles - who were not healed , despite prayer .
3
The third wrong assumption is that every Christian has the gift to heal people .
The Bible clearly says that this is not so .6
A fourth wrong assumption is that somebody can be found who is " deserving . "
According to the Bible , none of us is worthy of being saved .
5 However , God , in His love , saves the undeserving through His mercy .
4
God does not heal everybody of every infirmity in this life .
I began working for my current boss in 1983 at the UCLA Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center .
Within two years , I developed Crohn 's Disease , the most severe form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease , which has no cure .
I found myself unable to do things using my own abilities and strength .
After two months of being bedridden in severe pain , I cried out to God , even though I was a deist at the time ( I had gone from an agnostic atheist to a deist in college ) .
Within three months all symptoms of Crohn 's disease had disappeared .
That was over 25 years ago , and no symptoms of the disease have ever reappeared .
However , thousands of people have gone through our Inflammatory Bowel Disease clinics and not been cured .
I am sure that most of those people have prayed to God , but are still suffering .
For some reason , God chose to heal me , so that I would know that He was personally involved in the lives of people .
God acts to produce eternal , spiritual outcomes , and not just temporal , physical changes .
Jesus says to become an amputee !
The really ironic thing about Marshall Brain 's experiment is that Jesus addresses it exactly opposite from what Brain says .
Jesus says there are more important things than having limbs .
In fact , He suggested that people amputate their limbs ( or gouge out their eyes ) if those parts helped them to sin :
" If your right hand makes you stumble , cut it off and throw it from you ; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body , than for your whole body to go into hell .
( Matthew 5:30 )
" If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it from you ; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame , than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire .
" If your eye causes you to stumble , pluck it out and throw it from you .
It is better for you to enter life with one eye , than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell .
( Matthew 18:8 -9 )
The main thing that Mr. Brain has failed to understand is that this life is a mere short prequel to the life that is to come .
Nobody is going to avoid all the discomforts or escape life intact .
In fact , your destiny is death .
If God healed everyone 's illnesses , there would be no death .
God wants to do more than just heal your physical bodies , which are temporary .
God wants to heal your soul , which is eternal .
God wants to make you perfect !
7
However , God does not want to force anyone to act against his own will , so He give us choices .
Agree to give up your " right " to sin and go along with God 's plan , and He will reward you with a perfect soul in heaven .
Brain is incognito
I would have much more respect for Mr. Brain , if he would sign his name to his writings .
Originally , he listed himself as author of the pages on his website .
However , now , his name has disappeared for some reason .
Be a man , Mr. Brain and stand up for what you believe !
Why does God love Marshall Brain ?
The main question that needs to be asked is not why God hates amputees ( which He does n't ) , but why God loves Marshall Brain ?
As you can probably tell , I am not a great fan of Marshall Brain .
However , God loves him dearly8 and wants to spend eternity with him .9
I 'm not quite there yet .
However , if God can change the author of this article from an atheist into a believer , He can certainly do it for Mr. Brain .
If you are a Christian , pray for Mr. Brain .
Changing him into a lover of God would certainly be a miracle greater than replacing someone 's legs .
Conclusion
Contrary to the claims of Marshall Brain , God already has healed amputees physically .
The objection that the Bible just made up the healing miracles of Jesus was never put forth by the skeptics of Jesus ' day because the people of the time had seen those miracles first hand .
Mr. Brain 's experiment to pick a " deserving " amputee and pray to have him healed has never been done .
So , his conclusion that God would not ever heal an amputee remains untested .
God will heal amputees and everybody else who wants to be healed spiritually , to receive perfect spiritual bodies in heaven .
10
It 's quite a deal , and a much better one than the alternative offered by Marshall Brain .
11 Mr. Brain thinks that technology will solve all the world 's problems .
However , what technology is really good at is giving us " better " ways to kill each other and more free time to commit sin .
No thanks , Mr. Brain .
I prefer a place in which righteousness dwells .

( 1 Corinthians 15:42 - 44 ) Marshall Brain 's idea is to create " Heaven on Earth " , the phrase which he has apparently trademarked , although this trademark has been used to sell everything from soap , ice cream , massage therapy , jewelry , etc .

Maybe he should do more than just trademark the phrase !
As He was setting out on a journey , a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him , and asked Him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? "

As reported , 75 year old Reginald Baker was a retired British man , whose physical strength was limited .
His small home was filled with family photos , and collectible models of military vehicles .
His home had been broken into once , and a burglar stole over £ 2,300 of his retirement savings .
Fearing a repeated break - in , Reginald decided to store his money securely at the local post office , and had police install a security camera at his home .
A few weeks after that first burglary , 4 young men broke into Reginald ’s home and demanded his money .
He told them that the money was at the post office , but they did n’t believe him .
The criminals proceeded to torture the elderly man , breaking every single one of his ribs , stabbing him in the face , slicing his finger nearly completely off , beating him , and breaking his back .
Reginald begged the criminals to stop , but they continued to torture him until he died , at which point they spent the night partying and drinking .
The gruesome security camera footage led to the men ’s conviction , for which two of them will serve 28 and 30 years in prison , while others will receive lesser sentences .
This and the many other cases , where British citizens are left defenseless against violent criminals , show the folly of the British ban on gun ownership .
Such gun bans do n’t prevent violence , since violence is caused by the intentional actions of a criminal , not the presence of an inanimate object .
Instead , those bans only ensure that the law abiding members of society will be unarmed when those violent criminals attack , and that those who rightfully defend themselves will be sent to jail .
This is especially true for the elderly , as few unarmed senior citizens can fight off a younger , stronger , and faster attacker .
Armed senior citizens , on the other hand , have the best possible chance of defending themselves against attack by criminals .
This armed 85 year old woman held a home invader at gunpoint , and made him call the police on himself .
This armed 93 year old man shot a home invader in self defense after the home invader began to attack him .
This armed 70 year old woman held an intruder at gunpoint until the police arrived to arrest him .
This armed 91 year old man used his handgun to fend off two home invader who had broken in and threatened his wheelchair - bound wife with their guns .
This armed 84 year old man used his handgun to stop a criminal who repeatedly tried to enter his home through the front door , back door , and a window .
I could go on with more examples , but the point should be clear : gun ownership saves lives every day and allows even physically frail elderly people to stop the strongest criminals .
The most common rebuttal that I hear to my above statements is the assertion that gun bans keep guns out of the hands of those violent criminals .
This is simply not the case .
Whether we ’re talking about Britain , or US cities like Chicago , guns bans fail to keep guns out of the hands of criminals .
That is because criminals who want guns will get them , just as they are able to get illegal drugs and other contraband on the black market .
For such criminals , gun control laws are just another law for them to break , and a person willing to commit robbery or murder wo n’t think twice about breaking such a gun control law .
That is why gun related crime will often rise after guns are banned , as criminals become emboldened by their monopoly on guns , and go about using those guns to deadly effect against their now - disarmed victims .
Interestingly enough , knife related crime also tends to rise after guns are banned , possibly because the emboldened knife - wielding criminals are less afraid that their victim may have a self defense gun .
Moreover , as this case shows , criminals without guns are more than capable of killing their victims .
I would also like to note that security cameras do not prevent violent crime , as this man and many others have sadly learned .
Instead , such cameras only gather evidence , so that the criminals can sometimes be identified and prosecuted at a later time .
While ( possibly ) eventually bringing criminals to justice is a good thing , it does not un -rape a woman , or un - torture a home invasion victim .
We Americans need to learn from the terrible mistake that the British people made when they banned guns , lest the same thing happen in our country .
The British should also learn from their mistake , and take steps to restore their gun rights .
Opera E-mail client has it ’s own set of advantages that sets it apart from rest of the e-mail clients , some of the brilliant features being :
1 > An e-mail client that handles ( POP3 / IMAP ) which has an integrated messaging client .
The beauty of this messaging client is that when ever you have conversation with anyone , it keeps track of the information of people who you ’ve had conversation with ,
2 > In built news reader ( NNTP ) ,
3 > In built RSS or Atom feed reader ,
If you ’ve made a shift to use Opera e-mail client or thinking about making a shifting to use Opera e-mail client there is one fact about Opera that you should know , that is Opera does not support importing contacts from other famous and widely used e-mail clients / software like Microsoft Outlook , Outlook express , Google ’s Gmail , Yahoo Mail and such .
Manually typing address and other details of contact from one E - mail client to another can be a dreaded task .
To simplify and ease this process , you need a third party tool which will save your time by speeding up the process of importing the contacts and coOpera is one such tool .
First , export contacts from your other email clients ( Microsoft Outlook , Microsoft Outlook express , Yahoo ! mail and gmail ) in CSV format and save it in a folder on your system .
Open the CSV file with coOpera and it will bring up a screen showing the list of your contacts contained in the CSV file .
Choose the contacts you would like to be converted to Opera Browser format and export those contacts to a fresh ADR file or a pre-existing ADR file .
Leave the rest to coOpera and it will migrate all personal information about your contacts like E-mail , Phone , Web Site URL and Address automatically .
What otherwise would take hours to accomplish will be finished in matter of seconds .
coOpera is free for personal , non-commercial use .
coOpera works on Microsoft Windows 2000 / XP/2003 / Vista systems and requires Microsoft .NET Framework installed on your computer .

It took several rounds of tear gas , an 8 hour standoff — and a robot negotiator — but the LAPD has captured that guy in the Volkswagen Beetle , who they wanted for " threats " against the White House .

From the LA Times :
After repeatedly firing tear gas into the suspect 's Volkswagen Beetle , officers pulled him out and placed him under arrest .
His condition was not known .

Earlier post :
The standoff follows a " wild " freeway chase led by a young fellow who is wanted " as part of a federal inquiry into threats against the White House , " which does n't sound like the kind of thing you really want to be wanted for — hence , you know , the running from police .
Anyway : the bomb squad 's robot has been conscripted to try to " coax the suspect out of the vehicle , " possibly bringing him a cellphone and giving the police clues as to who might be in the car with him .
This is pretty surreal , but I 'd imagine this kind of thing — the use of robots in law enforcement , not dudes who do n't like Barack Obama getting into protracted car chases — will be a common sight before too long .
Good luck , fellas !

UPDATE !!!
UPDATE !!!
The MSM may be starting to pay attention .
I just got off the phone with CBS News radio , who will be covering this story imminently .
It was just yesterday that I was lamenting about the mainstream media ’s failure to report on the anti-cancer properties of cannabis .
And then along comes Reuters with this :
Cannabis chemicals may help fight prostate cancer
via Reuters News Wire
Chemicals in cannabis have been found to stop prostate cancer cells from growing in the laboratory , suggesting that cannabis - based medicines could one day help fight the disease , scientists said Wednesday .
After working initially with human cancer cell lines , Ines Diaz - Laviada and colleagues from the University of Alcala in Madrid also tested one compound on mice and discovered it produced a significant reduction in tumor growth .
Their research , published in the British Journal of Cancer , underlines the growing interest in the medical use of active chemicals called cannabinoids , which are found in marijuana .
Experts , however , stressed that the research was still exploratory and many more years of testing would be needed to work out how to apply the findings to the treatment of cancer in humans .
“ This is interesting research which opens a new avenue to explore potential drug targets but it is at a very early stage , ” said Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , which owns the journal .
“ It absolutely is n’t the case that men might be able to fight prostate cancer by smoking cannabis , ” she added .
Well , well , well , leave it to the MSM to misrepresent the facts and miss the real story .
First , the chemicals assessed in this study , R (+ ) - Methanandamide and JWH - 015 , are neither “ cannabinoids ” nor are they “ chemicals in cannabis . ”
Rather , they are synthetic , selective CB2 receptor agonists .
In short , they are chemicals created in a lab to mimic certain elements in marijuana , and to bind to specifically to those cannabinoid receptors that are not located in the brain .
After all , we ca n’t possibly have the terminally ill feeling ‘ better ’ , now can we ?
Second , US federal researchers have known for some 35 years that the naturally occurring chemicals in cannabis — not just synthesized agonists — can halt the proliferation of multiple types of cancer , including including brain cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer , skin cancer , and pancreatic cancer .
We even know how .
Cannabinoids : potential anticancer agents
via Nature Reviews Cancer ( 2003 )
Cannabinoids are usually well tolerated , and do not produce the generalized toxic effects of conventional chemotherapies .
…
Cannabinoids inhibit tumor growth in laboratory animals .
They do so by modulating key cell - signaling pathways , thereby inducing direct growth arrest and death of tumor cells , as well as by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis .
Cannabinoids are selective anti-tumor compounds , as they can kill tumor cells without affecting their non-transformed counterparts .
Of course , the real question — conveniently ignored by Reuters and the rest of the MSM — is this :
Why , after three decades and dozens of preclinical trials documenting cannabis ’ potent anti-cancer abilities , are “ many more years of testing ” necessary ?
Last I checked , humans die en masse from cancer , not rats !
Yet for some 35 years scientists have been content to replicate these cancer - killer findings in animals and in petri dishes , all the while warning , “ It absolutely is n’t the case that men might be able to fight prostate cancer by smoking cannabis . ”
Well why the hell not ?
Not only can cannabis alleviate cancer patients ’ nausea and pain , elevate their mood , and increase their appetite , but also — as dozens of preclinical trials over the past three decades consistently demonstrate — marijuana may help to alleviate the very disease that ’s ravaging their bodies .
Of course , rather than put this theory to the test , investigators for more than three decades have been willing to let people with a terminal illness die while they piddle around with their petri dishes .
And to date , not one reporter from the mainstream media has ever had the guts to ask them why .

I sit on a wooden bench facing a basketball court , watching ten guys , all black , mid-teens to mid-twenties , playing a pick - up game .
They glisten in a pack around the ball .
They yell , “ Come on , come on , come on ” and “ hey hey hey ” and “ what ’s that ” and “ that ’s right , that ’s right . ”
It ’s 1993 .
I ’m twenty - two , a new college grad , broke as a junk - yard car , living on a poor block in Richmond , Virginia .
I flip through my notebook , which I carry around because I ’m going to write a novel about THE SOUTH .
That ’s how I think of it , this soon - to - be - aborted project :
All caps .
A book about Flannery O’Connor ’s “ Christ - haunted ” land , or V.S. Naipaul ’s cultural space of racial oppression , strife , and coexistence — “ black people there , black people there , white people there .
Black people , black people , white people , black people …
White people , white people , black people , white people ” — a place of hard facts and dark history , a place where widely held beliefs are , depending on your perspective , either magical or delusional .
A shadow falls over me .
I look up .
It ’s Jesus .
Startled , I say hello to the dark face , which is backlit by the sun , as Jesus probably should be .
“ What ’s up ? ” Jesus says , putting his hands in the pockets of his tattered jeans .
I move over .
He sits down beside me on the bench .
He hands me a white , self - published paperback book called Street Preacher .
It has the heft and sturdiness of a good literary journal .
It ’s a collection of short , biographical sketches , with only minor grammatical problems , of traveling evangelists — old men in Alabama , a woman in Charleston , a thirteen - year - old prodigy , “ strong with the Lord , ” who fills school gymnasiums and community centers in central Florida .
The last section of the book is about him , written in the third person .
He is a man , according to himself , burning with God ’s mission to spread the Word .
The cover , the copyright page ( he drew the C inside a circle himself ) , and the final chapter tell me his name is not Jesus .
But he looks like our conventional notion of Jesus , which largely comes , I recently learned , from a 1941 painting by Warner Sallman , a painting I used to see every Sunday at my family ’s Methodist church in Hampton , seventy - five miles to the southeast .
Jesus — this guy — is handsomely Caucasian — rosy - cheeked , bearded , long - haired , and peaceful in his countenance to the point of beatitude .
I quit church as a teen , but I can honestly say I feel comfortable , really comfortable , not threatened in the least , in the presence of this Jesus .
“ Are you saved ? ” he asks .
“ Probably not . ” I was baptized at five , maybe six .
I remember the cold trickle of water on my forehead .
I remember thinking , even as an accepting , God-fearing boy — a boy who ached for God ’s favor , ached to be “ good ” — how formal , rote , and empty it felt as I looked out at the families scattered in the dark - wood pews in their Sunday bests .
“ You are or you ’re not .
No probably . ”
“ Not then .
I do n’t feel particularly saved from anything . ”
“ I ’ll save you if you want .
I ’m ordained as a reverend .
I did a correspondence course .
You ’d be maybe my two - hundredth soul saved , something like that , so I ’ve got experience .
Nothing should go wrong . ”
He hands me a card with his name and the word “ Reverend ” on it .
Jesus tells me he owns a trailer park with his brother - in - law , his dead wife ’s brother .
Jesus ’ wife died of cancer , breast cancer first , but then “ all - over - body cancer . ”
He was religious before , a “ strong believer , ” but when his wife was dying he met a hospice nurse at the hospital , who was an angel in the flesh , he says , and it was then that he felt the calling to ministry .
This woman — he does n’t say her name — started to come to their trailer during her time off .
She wanted to offer assistance .
It was free assistance , since Jesus ( the maintenance man , not yet the reverend ) and his wife did n’t have insurance .
One day Jesus , his bed - ridden wife , and the hospice nurse held hands and prayed .
They put their heads together .
At that moment , through a small window in the trailer above his wife ’s bed , a piercing ray of sunlight coated each of them in gold .
“ We each felt the presence of God like warmth and strength , ” he says , “ and we were all crying , and I knew it was okay for my wife to die , and I knew that if I did n’t let her go , let her go in my heart , I mean , go to the next , better place , she would suffer more .
My holding on was selfish and against God .
God wanted my wife .
It was part of His plan . ”
That night , he says , he slept on a cot , his wife miserably uncomfortable , sweating through the sheets in the bed .
In a dream , he saw her on a wood - and - rope swing under a big tree .
He watched her from a distance , and she was young and happy and healthy .
“ She was only twenty maybe , with her hair long the way it was when we met , ” he says .
His life had been all worry and sorrow , depression and anxiety .
When he woke up , he says , rain was beating on the roof of his trailer , and he knew his wife was dead .
He ’s now a street evangelist , ordained and with a certificate , or something like a certificate .
I imagine , but do not know , that he grew out his hair and beard after his wife ’s death .
He walks these streets every day , as a soldier of a sort .
Then he goes home to the trailer park , where he mows the grass , collects the monthly rent , fixes faucets and windowsills .
“ Right here right here right here , ” one of the men on the court shouts just before a stylish under - the - basket lay - up .
Rush - hour traffic is starting to pile up on the one - way road behind us .
“ So do you want to be saved ? ” he asks .
I consider .
“ I do n’t see why not , ” I say .
“ There you go , ” he says .
“ There you go . ”
He puts his hand on the back of my head and pushes my face downward , like a barber about to cut my hair .
“ Dear , Lord , ” he says , his other hand in the air , the bounce bounce bounce of the basketball in the background .
“ I ask in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , that this young man be taken into your flock and looked after all the days of his life , good days and bad days , through love and loss , suffering and joy , until he arrives to be with you , Lord , in the kingdom of Heaven , where all pain is erased and our service is rewarded with paradise .
Amen . ”
He takes his hand off my neck .
I look at him .
“ Alright , ” he says .
“ That ought to be a big help .
Do you feel anything ?
Be honest . ”
I think for a moment .
“ I feel a little awkward about you putting your hand on my neck like that . ”
“ Sure .
Sure , ” he says .
“ You ’re on Earth , buddy , to live out your days .
Suspicion , mistrust , all normal .
And shame , our mortal curse , brought down upon us when Eve ate the apple .
It ’s not magic , getting saved .
It ’s more like insurance .
I just gave you a kind of insurance policy . ”
“ Okay , ” I say .
“ Thanks . ”
“ You ’re very welcome , ” he says , then walks down the sidewalk in the shouting of the game and the low , hot roar of the traffic , singing some hymn I ca n’t name but think I recognize .
Day three of the CRTC 's network management hearings brought in the views of several additional stakeholders along with the first large telco of the week .
Witnesses included the Independent Film and Television Alliance , the Canadian Film and Television Production Association , Council for Canadians with Disabilities , the ARCH Disability Law Centre ACTRA , and MTS Allstream .
While all the creator and producer groups expressed support for net neutrality , it was their position on BitTorrent that was particularly noteworthy .
Perhaps heralding an end to the demonization of file sharing , ACTRA emphasized that it wants to compete with illegal downloading and that the best way to do that is to ensure that its members can use applications like BitTorrent to distribute their content .
In other words , copyright alone wo n't address their concerns ( they added the need for copyright reform ) as network management practices that create a level playing field are essential .
Meanwhile , the independent producers emphasized the economic potential of BitTorrent - based distribution .
Moreover , ACTRA argued that it was not the role of ISPs to determine the legality of content on their networks .
That position is a far cry from what groups like CRIA would like to see happen .
The other big story of the day was MTS Allstream arguing that dominant carriers should never be permitted throttle wholesale services ( ie . they argue that any throttling should only occur at the retail level ) .
This led to repeated discussion about the nature of wholesale services ( referred to as GAS or Gateway Access Service ) with MTS explaining that wholesale service is not like buying Internet access as a retail customer ( it was described as akin to a private virtual network ) .
For that reason , there is no valid claim that congestion concerns are the basis for throttling wholesale services ( left unsaid is why a company like Bell would throttle – competition from the very ISPs to whom it supplies wholesale access ) .
The discussion was stunning since it left the distinct impression that the Commission did not fully understand what was at issue in the CAIP throttling case .
There was two other exchanges involving Commissioner Len Katz worthy of note .
The first was a question in which he suggested that Bell and Rogers do not have a dominant position in Ontario , something that will be news to the overwhelming majority of broadband subscribers in the province .
The second was the recognition that prioritization of content is effectively the same thing as throttling of content since the effect in both instances is to place some content on a fast lane and other content on a slow one .
These issues may arise again tomorrow when CAIP appears .
Today 's summary was compiled by Yael Wexler , a law student at the University of Ottawa .
Other coverage available from the National Post liveblog , CBC.ca , and the cippic twitter feed ( or mine for MTS ) .
CRTC Net neutrality Hearings – July 8 , 2009
CFTPA and IFTA
Summary :
1. Independent producers are important content creators in Canada and the US .
2 . The Internet is a necessary tool – sometimes the only tool – for financing , producing and distributing independently produced works .
3 . Industry consolidation – the vertical integration of ISPs with production companies – threatens independently produced works with slower distribution in favour of preferential treatment for allied productions .
4. Network congestion must be more clearly defined .
5 . Increasing capacity is the best way to ensure broadband service meets demand
6. Traffic management practices must be disclosed and transparent to the customer .
7 . Urge the CRTC to reconsider whether ISPs should be immune from s. 27 ( 2 ) of the Act
Opening remarks :
John Barrack , National Executive Vice - President Counsel , CFTPA :
Come before the CRTC to share the perspective of independent producers – the content creators – at home and abroad on the worldwide issue of ISP traffic control .
Since CAIP v. Bell , the CRTC has taken initiative to develop a unified policy on this matter .
The Alliance asks that the Internet remain a forum of direct , unfettered access to audiences for independent producers , via wireline or wireless .
The Internet is the most efficient distribution method and is necessary for the very viability of Canadian independent production .
ISP traffic management practices ( ITMPs ) create insurmountable barriers for independent producers to monetize their productions .
Moreover , ITMPs hinder the innovation of new content - creating ( new media ) business models and practices .
Another concern is that allowing ISPs ITMPs to go unfettered will result in a two - tiered Internet , whereby the big ISPs that are vertically integrated with production companies will give their productions preferential treatment at the expense of independently produced works .
Susan Cleary , vice President and General Counsel of IFTA
Ms. Cleary highlighted the situation in the United States , having first - hand knowledge of the issues there in her role at IFTA .
IFTA puts the focus on independent content creators and the vast potential of the online space to finance , produce and distribute content .
In many cases , the Internet is the only way for independent producers to work and recover revenues lost in tv , theatrical and DVD sales .
The problem for independent producers is industry consolidation – the ISPs are also the cable , radio , newspaper and production company owners .
In 2003 only 18 % of US primetime was independently produced .
Industry consolidation risks preferential treatment and carriage under guise of network management of congestion without a clear idea justification as what that is .
ITMPs such as throttling and packet forging are likely to contravene s. 27 ( 2 ) and 36 .
These offer a reasonableness standard for ITMPs , not targeting of specific applications given that they represent the only way to access non-conglomerate productions .
Brad Fox – Producer , Strada Films and Rocket Ace Moving Pictures
New media content - creators can't run the costs and risks required by an ' after - the - fact , case - by - case ' basis regulatory approach to traffic throttling .
Discriminatory ITMPs are being erroneously portrayed by the ISPs as being in the public 's interest when they are not at all .
The CRTC should use its powers under s.24 to prohibit discriminatory ITMPs .
This would promote competition in the ISP industry and set a straightforward standard for acceptable ITMPs .
Dan Hawes – President and Founder of March Entertainment
There are preferred means of managing traffic .
First , increasing capacity is the best way to ensure broadband service meets demand .
An inquiry to how US federal spending on national broadband infrastructure has worked leaves Canadians with broadband envy .
The CRTC 's call for national digital media strategy can help in this regard .
“ One of the pillars of any such strategy must be to reclaim Canada 's place as a legitimate leader in broadband speed , access , and affordability . ”
A second option is to increase last - mile capacity and a third is deploying content delivery networks .
There are others ; they all indicate that there are other solutions to traffic management other than throttling .
Reynolds Mastin – Associate Counsel , CFTPA
Traffic mgmt practices must be disclosed and transparent to the customer .
The CRTC should impose notification requirements on ISPs so that consumers can have greater understanding of their Internet service and give them greater control to the service they pay for .
We support Score Media 's proposal of disclosing the proportion of physical access link that is dedicated to Internet access in order to see if there is ‘ fast tracking ' of types of files .
Another proposal is for symmetrical regulation of wireless and wireline services , by reconsidering whether ISPs should be immune from s. 27 ( 2 ) of the Act and including an undue preference / discrimination clause in the New Media Broadcasting Undertakings .
CFTPA continues to advocate for the inclusion of ISPs under “ broadcast undertakings ” and therefore under the purview of the Broadcasting Act .
Questions :
Chair –
The problem with the Alliance 's submission is that the CRTC has laws against undue preference .
On what basis can we as regulators believe that “ throttling ” will be a future business strategy ISPs employ knowing it is against the law ?
I 'm not convinced that a condition of license would have better adherence than the same as a provision of the law
Alliance ( Reynolds ) –
Knowing something is against the law is different from abiding by it , or hedging your bets that a small time producer is n't going to fight a big player ISP on the issue .
There is potential for throttling to become the dominant mode of ITMP .
If it becomes an established practice , plus the exigencies of filing a complaint under 27 ( 2 ) , could have a damaging impact on independent and emerging producers ' ability to get their product to market .
The best way to avoid this practice is to include a rule against it as a condition of the license for an ISP to operate .
The difference between having it be a law and a condition of service is the difference between ‘ may ' and ‘ must . '
Chair –
Is it a lie that P2P takes more bandwidth than direct access sites ?
Alliance
Comcast decided to throttle all Bit torrent regardless of the content , which they lied about , and then paid people to sit in public hearings about it to contravene the democratic process .
The FCC was enraged , and did not fine them , but made them to disclose their throttling practices .
Commissioner Timothy Denton –
How did you come up with the three part test ?
Reynolds –
3 stage analysis is common among the people testifying in this proceeding .
Whether the practice is reasonable and in the public interest , and it provides a clear lens for reaching a decision .
Denton –
Congestion is the basic problem carriers are trying to deal with ?
( Alliance ) Barrack –
When an ISP is building up its network , it 's economically viable to build it up to full capacity .
But when you under - provision , you run the risk of congestion .
We recognize the need for flexibility in ISP management , except in this one respect of throttling certain types of carriage .
Denton –
Will this allow for the propagation of obnoxious practices by those who would use the public rules to get around them ?
Alliance ( John ) –
Transparency is the answer .
We 're not suggesting that publishing is the solution , but it would allow for the opportunity for everyone to know what 's going on .
Alliance ( Reynolds ) –
We need to have an informed consumer .
As a general principle , when it comes down to how something is being trafficked , the maximum amount of information disclosed is optimal .
Denton –
A complaints - driven process may be necessary but it might give undue weight to one side .
Alliance ( John ) –
It 's extremely useful to hear the voices of the independent producers who can't afford to carry through the entire legal process .
We can learn some of the lessons about solutions from other self - regulating models .
Commissioner Leonard Katz –
Risk of independent producers being squeezed out by ISP gatekeepers vertical integration .
What if businesses engaged in transactions between non-aligned producers for preferential treatment , how would that not be any different than vertical integration ?
Would you be opposed to that ?
Alliance ( Cleary ) –
Independent producers can't find aggregators interested in those kind of transactions , they ‘re not interested in one - off productions or even medium sized catalogues .
Hulu is the closest we 've come to that type of arrangement .
Katz –
So you 're issue is broader , you 're interested in the way we regard independent productions as people and as an industry ?
Alliance ( Barrack ) –
Yes , but we 're most concerned about this democratic forum of the Internet .
Wireless devices are indistinguishable .
Katz –
But you acknowledge why wireless has had a more flexible environment .
Alliance ( Fox ) –
A significant proportion of our audience that we had n't anticipated are commuters , who use wireless .
Commissioner Suzanne Lamare –
The last mile in wireless access is spectrum management , which is part of the infrastructure .
In order to manage traffic , building on infrastructure is a good way to go .
But it 's much easier to unroll cable than spectrum .
So when you talk about the greatest degree possible of symmetrical regulation of wireline and wireless , the regulations are n't the same b/c they have different capacities .
Alliance ( Reynolds ) –
By maintaining scarcity , it creates content management issues and veils it as capacity issues .
Scarcity could be used to the advantage of independent producers .
Lamare –
Is it your opinion that P2P is the way for independent producers to monetize their work ?
Alliance ( Cleary ) –
P2P does n't equal piracy .
You can monetize it , and you do n't have to go through an aggregator .
We do n't advocate it industrially because the practices are n't there yet for great monetizing , but it has potential .
When people talk about P2P they think Bit torrent , which sometimes has a negative framing as being unprofitable .
Council of Canadians with Disabilities and ARCH Disability Law Centre ( ARCH )
Summary :
1. People with disabilities rely on the Internet to improve their quality of life .
2. Traffic management practices must not be directly or indirectly discriminatory , and should not force people with disabilities to forego on their privacy .
3. ARCH presents its own three - step approach to s.36 disputes .
4 . The advantageous programs on the Internet and inventive ways of combining programs are too many to count .
Therefore a whitelist approach to obtaining special exemptions or recourse for traffic control of necessary services for disabled people is impractical .
Opening remarks :
We advocate and represent the expansion of the world of accessible technology and software applications .
We recommend that the CRTC establish clear guidelines for s.36 against controlling content carriage .
However , ARCH welcomes the initiatives only if the guidelines directly make provisions for accessibility that is their legal obligation , just as it is in privacy considerations .
We hope the result will provide accessibility without needing the commission 's specific direction every step of the way or after - the - fact .
ARCH suggests its own three part test for determinations under s.36 , but that is different than the Oakes - like test the Open Internet Coalition suggested yesterday .
However , ARCH would hold on creating a test for s. 27 .
If the Oakes - like test is applied to .s27 the CRTC risks undoing years of s.27 jurisprudence .
1. Consideration of whether ITMP is caught under s.36
2. Determination of whether the ITMP practice is contrary to law .
This is different from the Oakes test .
You are asked to determine if there is a contravention of s.36 by asking , does it amount to unjust discrimination and against the law ?
Assessment must be made
3 . The practice can be saved if it 's found to be neutral or a positive intervention .
Then the min impairment test may apply ( as suggested by the OIC ) .
Expert Dr. Gregg Vanderheiden :
People with disabilities are now enjoying a greater lifestyle due to the many services of the Internet .
The captioning of non-captioned movies by crowd sourcing , availability of film and entertainment outside of the regular channels of commerce for people with intellectual or social disabilities are just some examples of how the Internet can be used advantageously for disabled people .
We 're looking for a level playing field , where people with disabilities can use programs without needing to register them as ‘ special ' or name themselves .
Traffic management needs to be non-discriminatory .
ISPS that require that consumers use specific programs rather than those of their choosing precluded people w/ disabilities from finding the programs that are best for their circumstances .
Users must be free to use any combination of programs - whether it's preferred by the ISP or not – so that they can use the Internet freely and to better their lives like everyone else .
Whitelisting is not a solution – it would be impractical because of the tailoring to individual 's needs .
Also , it 's not that these people are using alternative programs , it 's that they 're using mainstream programs in a different ways in order to accommodate their needs .
Whitelisting also can be used to target people for marketing , or discriminated against for employment , insurance purposes , which the individuals do not want .
People with disabilities do not require significantly larger bandwidth , but it may be needed in some areas .
For ex : phone calls , lower bandwidth for talking than for video with sign language , so it would require higher bandwidth .
However , both of these are nothing compared to an HD movie .
But if an ISP decides that the audio is important but not the video , it affects people with disabilities .
Disclosure of ITMPs is critical for people with disabilities .
Accordingly , the CRTC must not take a wait and see approach and trouble shoot problems only after occur .
Questions :
Chair –
You 're saying that when private information exists , the ISPs will use it in wrong ways , for marketing for instance .
But there is no grounding for an assumption that the ISP will give out private info to marketers about people with disabilities .
ARCH –
Well , when things are vertically integrated , like they are in the US , the ISPs can misuse their customer information in a manner that violated privacy .
ID fraud happens all the time – once you 're in databases with specific personal info is out there , it is out there and you 're vulnerable to targeting .
There is information harvesting done from sources of information .
Our concern is with whitelisting .
For the ISP to take that information for service provision purposes , the ISP is doing more than just being a pipeline , it advertises and directs users to a server with advertising .
It is a common practice for ISPs to direct specific advertising .
Commissioner Leonard Katz –
Self identification levels the playing field and helps people with disabilities .
But you 're saying that whitelisting wo n't work .
So what will work ?
ARCH – –
If barriers to accessibility on the Internet are broken down , and the creation of software applications continues , then we 'll get to a place where one wo n't need to self identify as disabled .
If the CRTC does this right , people wo n't need to declare and forego on their privacy .
We 're not saying that if you want a discount , you should n't have to self identify , but just for disabled people to get the regular service , at the regular price , should n't demand self - identification .
Katz –
If the CRTC was going to look into getting special rates for people with disabilities , how much that would cost ?
ARCH –
The amount is minimal because for instance , the cost of having captions does n't increase even if bandwidth does , it 's a standard price .
The Internet provides the option of not needing extra costs like other telecoms need .
The Internet gives us the option for multiple types of communication at once ; if we are able to use the Internet without barriers , there is the potential for no extra costs and time for people with disabilities .

Summary :
1. ISPs giving undue preference to their content threatens the content creators ' ability to reach audiences
2. Traffic throttling is an abuse of power by the ISPs
3. ITMPs are against the Telecommunications Act and moreover , ISPs should be governed by the Broadcasting Act .
4. ITMPs should be a temporary solution , the need for which should be publicly justified as it happens by the ISPs
Opening remarks
Ferne Downey – National President
Canadian artists do not want the CRTC to hand over the keys of the Internet to Canadian ISPs .
We help create the content , and so we 're worried about Internet traffic management .
More Canadians are using the Internet to access our work .
About 70 % of Canadian Internet usage is for AV files , and the Internet is helping us to compete in local and international markets .
Two specific concerns :
1 . The risk of ISPs giving undue preference to content they own :
The ability of the Internet to provide open access is threatened if ISPs can give preference to their own content .
2 . The potential of ISPs to slow down Internet traffic – to abuse their power as gatekeepers : Vertical media integration is a threat to diversity and the same is true for ISPs .
Stephen Waddell – National Executive Director
P2P like BitTorrent ( BT ) receive undue criticism by the ISPs as a scapegoat to traffic control .
BT is the standard for distributing large files , for legitimate copyright holders ( even CBC used it to distribute “ Canada 's Next Great PM ” ) .
ACTRA is not endorsing illegal file sharing , but it's not the job of ISPs to determine the legality of files going through their networks .
Therefore , ITMP is against the Telecommunications Act. Moreover , we ask that the CRTC reconsider its jurisdiction over ISPs under the Broadcasting Act .
Traffic management should be only to avoid serious problem and a temporary solution to them .
The CRTC should regulate it according to the following principles :
1 . Onus should be on ISPs to prove they need to manage traffic to manage the integrity of the system
2. ISPs must fully disclose what types of traffic mgmt practices they are using and when
3 . There should be no discrimination as between wholesale and retail clients
4 . There should be no discrimination as between end users
5 . There should be no differential treatment between different applications of content
6 . The only exceptions to these principles would be the ability for ISPs to give preferential access to any emergency service authorized by public authorities .
Questions :
Chair –
This is a utopian picture you 're painting .
The fact is that there 's more usage than their pipes , just like cars and we have to make regulations and discriminate fairly .
So how can you come here and say that there should be no throttling or controlling ?
Presumably , ISPs are doing the best they can , after all , they 're business people who want to satisfy their customers .
We clearly have more demand than capacity .
ACTRA ( Waddell answered all the questions ) –
It is utopian indeed .
ISPs who are making significant profits should reinvest in their own system , their own infrastructure .
ACTRA had no hard evidence to present to the Chair when he asked for evidence of self - preferences occurring contrary to the law .
Chair –
In terms of p2 p , is your industry a heavier user of p2 p than others ?
Will ITMP hurt Canadian film industry harder than anybody else ?
ACTRA –
Yes .
Since the Canadian AV industry relies on P2P heavily .

Summary :
1. Competition in the market should be promoted because that would obviate the need for regulation or traffic controlling
2. ITMPs should never be imposed on a wholesaler from the dominant carrier .
ITMPs should only be in a retail context .
3 . The CRTC should implement a case - by - case approach to assessing and justifying ITMPs .
Opening remarks :
Theresa Griffin - Muir – VP , Regulatory Affairs
Kelvin Shepherd - President of the consumer market division
Paul Frizado – Chief Information and Technology Officer
Principles :
1. Competition in the market should be promoted b/c it has a direct impact on the need regulation .
The UK example illustrates our point that the more competition , the less need for Internet neutrality regulation , like in the UK .
Each ISP can decide how best to manage its own practice and consumers can choose among them .
2 . No ITMPs other than normal network management should ever be imposed by a dominant carrier on wholesale access customers .
Wholesale access customers should be able to decide their own practices subject only to the CRTC , and if the dominant carrier oversteps their boundaries , the CRTC should step in .
Bell 's contention that they can't identify if the traffic is being controlled by their users or a wholesalers is a red herring and is n't true .
3 . The CRTC should take a pragmatic , case - by - case approach to assessing the use of ITMPs .
Not every control will be problematic .
For example , with spamming , ITMPs are considered reasonable .
The reasonableness of other measures might be judged by assessing whether such arrangements are applied to all content providers .
Paul Frizado –
How should ISPs deal with congestion ?
Regardless of the view on traffic , the best approach to network management is the same :
1. Network planning and engineering
2. Compliance with laws of general application
3 . Measures that are agnostic in the their treatment of content
4. ‘ CAP ' based measures – content application protocol based on latency of an application , blocking , expediting , throttling , Deep packet inspection ( DPI ) .
Are CAP measures necessary ?
Yes , in some cases .
The debate around DPI has become inflammatory for nothing .
It 's just one tool among many for a larger network management strategy , and the large ISPs have been saying this .
It would be a mistake to attempt to regulate Internet technology .
The solution is a marketplace where there is enough competition to provide their users differential retail options which would mitigate the issues around net neutrality and customer satisfaction .
Questions :
Chair –
You explain that traffic shaping should only apply in the retail , not wholesale , context .
Wo n't you get congestion then ?
Do n't you need wholesale ITMP ?
MTS ( Frizado ) –
Once it 's sold to a wholesaler , it 's out of the dominant carrier 's network .
We 're not buying Internet access like a retailer .
Bell 's diagram shows that they can identify the different traffic , even prior to DPI equipment was invented .
Chair –
Are there economic decisions that motivate Bell or a dominant carrier to traffic control usage not on their networks ?
MTS –
Not that we know .
Commissioner Lamarre –
In category 1 , do you really mean infrastructure building ?
MTS ( Frizado ) –
Yes .
The one exception is some types of filtering like anti-virus and measures to prevent denial of service attacks are considered category 1 .
Lamarre
Do you demonstrate to your customers the due diligence you took in determining that category 1 techniques have been applied before others ?
MTS ( Shepherd ) –
Category 3 measures are legitimate starting points , and where services are defined around the speed of the Internet , you start with cat .
1 , but cat .
3 and 4 come into play when you want to increase the quality of service being offered to customers .
So they can be employed to ensure the performance and the network to end users .
So the answer is n't to apply cat 1 techniques first all the time , because cat .
3 and 4 do play an important part .
Lamarre –
Do you really need to go to cat .
4 prioritization ever ?
MTS ( Frizado ) –
Yes for reasonable quality of service .
It 's not always possible to anticipate traffic surges on the network , like the Michael Jackson funeral .
Traffic management was necessary because it 's unpredictable .
Predictable issues on the network warrant the cat .
1 .
Lamarre –
In justifying a discriminatory infringement of 27 ( 2 ) , you mentioned that the consent from the user is an element that could help the CRTC to determine whether or not the measure was just .
How do you reconcile these ?
Being an informed consumer is one thing , but whether or not the consumer has been informed and even consented does n't make it just .
Our market is n't such that if I have a contract for three years , and you disclose something to me about network management and I 'm faced with a choice of breaking the contract , at a cost , and finding another network , at a cost , there 's nothing just about it .
We do n't have a market with so much choice and ease of movement between them .
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) –
Once you 've transparently disclosed the practice and the customer has consented ( as against another ISP who does n't disclose ) then it is just .
We advocate for more competition in the market .
Consent is only one factor , as is the degree of choice .
There 's legislation around privacy and we would have to be compliant with it and could n't force a customer into consent simply because they have no other choice of ISP .
Explicit consent for marketing , let 's say , does n't seem problematic to us .
Lamarre –
Dominant , as in “ dominant supplier , ” is a relative term .
For instance , MTS is the dominant player in Manitoba .
So when you 're on the dominant side of the coin , do you agree to act accordingly to the rules you 've put forward today ?
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) –
Yes .
Commissioner Katz –
Can you tell us whether there are ITMP employed by British Telecom .
All the competition is on a retail basis , buying space from British Telecom .
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) –
British Telecom is on a retail basis ; it does n't do ITMP on a wholesale basis .
Katz –
Can you clarify what you mean by exclusive content to end users ?
MTS ( Shepherd ) –
There are customers who want quality of service agreements for their service which is possible to get into .
If you throttle everybody else for someone , as opposed creating agreements , there is a difference in what you 're doing .
If it 's exclusive , there 's potentially a discriminatory element that may exist .
You have to assess whether the arrangement is being offered to all application providers , the competitiveness in the market .
This is an emerging area and it's not something that has been implemented in the market yet .
Offering those applications might require a performance in capacity more than what is available .
Commissioner Candice Molnar –
If there is no traffic management on the wholesale service , as the wholesale customer , can you provide guarantees that the GAS customer would have no impact on the underlying network , even if all cat .
2/3 was pulled off of that service .
If all traffic mgmt was removed from GAS as a wholesale customer of that product , you can guarantee the incumbent that their service would n't be affected .
Shepherd –
Yes .
Unaffected .
Requires that the services you 're using have the capacity .
Congestion hits where multiple slams hit the Internet access piece .
Molnar –
Are there any concerns particular for the business market which you serve ?
Ex : SME 's use the Internet for debit cards in rural areas , lottery terminals .
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) -
No , there 's nothing specific .
SME 's look very much like consumers in the applications they 're using .
Typically , large businesses are n't using the public Internet for large applications .
Commissioner Denton –
You 're saying it's on the retail service provider to engage in traffic management ?
Yesterday they were talking about the need between the retailer to signal the wholesaler on its traffic management .
MTS ( Frizado ) –
That was to indicate that congestion is going on .
That 's a plan for the future , but not something now .
Denton –
How is your four - part classification to be implemented , if the CRTC were to accept the proposals ?
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) –
If you accept that beyond cat . 1 generally speaking there is no need to go further , if there is sufficient competition in the retail industry , our suggested measures could be adopted .
Anything beyond that would go to the CRTC if it were allegedly discriminatory .
But the CRTC should n't be telling us that we can't use certain types of tech like DPI .
Denton –
The complaint is that smaller players can't keep coming to the CRTC to deal with issues .
So in order to do something preventative , what would you do ?
We want to know about how you would implement your own suggestions .
MTS ( Griffin - Muir ) –
We would still have it be case by case dispute resolution , but we will submit a more detailed plan in the final submissions .
As many as 50 million Americans are living sedentary lives , putting them at increased risk of health problems and even early death , a leading expert in exercise science told the American Psychological Association today .
Speaking at APA 's 117th Annual Convention , Steven Blair , PED , called Americans ' physical inactivity " the biggest public health problem of the 21st century . "
Blair is a professor of exercise science and epidemiology at the University of South Carolina 's Arnold School of Public Health .
He is one of the world 's premier experts on exercise and its health benefits and was the senior scientific editor of the 1996 U.S. Surgeon General 's Report on Physical Activity and Health .
Research has shown approximately 25 percent to 35 percent of American adults are inactive , Blair said , meaning that they have sedentary jobs , no regular physical activity program and are generally inactive around the house or yard .
" This amounts to 40 million to 50 million people exposed to the hazard of inactivity , " Blair said in an interview .
" Given that these individuals are doubling their risk of developing numerous health conditions compared with those who are even moderately active and fit , we 're looking at a major public health problem . "
Blair 's extensive research comes primarily from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study , in which he found that fitness level was a significant predictor of mortality .
The ongoing study began in 1970 and includes more than 80,000 patients .
The researchers periodically measured the participants ' body composition and body mass index , and each patient underwent a stress test .
Researchers also looked at numerous other factors including the participants ' medical histories .
One follow - up study of 40,842 longitudinal study participants showed poor fitness level accounted for about 16 percent of all deaths in both men and women .
The percentage was calculated by estimating the number of deaths that would have been avoided if people had spent 30 minutes a day walking .
This percentage was significantly higher than when other risk factors were considered , including obesity , smoking , high cholesterol and diabetes .
The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study also found that moderately fit men lived six years longer than unfit men .
More examination of 14,811 female patients in the ACLS showed that women who were very fit were 55 percent less likely to die from breast cancer than women who were not in good shape .
This was after the researchers had controlled for BMI , smoking , family history of breast cancer and other possible risk factors .
Blair also highlighted the benefits of exercise on the mind , referring to recent emerging evidence that activity delays the mind 's decline and is good for brain health overall .
Blair said he thinks psychologists can be integral in helping patients understand the health hazards of being inactive and encouraging people to look for more ways to get moving .
" Over the past few decades , we have largely engineered the need for physical activity out of the daily lives of most people in industrialized societies , " said Blair .
The message should be simple , he said : Doing something is better than doing nothing , and doing more is better than doing less , at least up to a point .
" We need numerous changes to promote more physical activity for all , including public policies , changes in the health care system , promoting activity in educational settings and worksites , and social and physical environmental changes .
We need more communities where people feel comfortable walking .
I believe psychologists can help develop better lifestyle change interventions to help people be more active via the Internet and other technological methods . "

A politician being touted as Britain 's next Prime Minister has been persuaded to take action to criminalize 7 million citizens following intensive industry lobbying over file - sharing .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson is in favor of introducing tough laws including Internet restrictions and fines of up to £ 50,000 ( $ 83,000 ) .
The debate on how Britain should tackle illicit file - sharing is heating up .
The government has already set an utterly unrealistic target of reducing online piracy by 70 % within a year .
If that is n’t achieved , under the Digital Britain proposals communications regulator Ofcom would be given extra powers to take degenerative action against the functionality of a user ’s Internet connection .
Now , thanks to intense lobbying from the music and movie industries , the government is considering giving Ofcom these powers more quickly .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , the man being touted among his Labour party voters as the successor to Prime Minister Brown , is said this morning to have been “ persuaded by the argument for tough laws to curb illegal file - sharing . ”
But what could ’ve prompted this renewed aggressive anti-piracy stance from Mandelson ?
According to a report today , the Business Secretary ’s intervention comes after he and David Geffen – the billionaire producer who co-founded the DreamWorks studio with Steven Spielberg – had dinner with members of the Rothschild banking dynasty at the family ’s holiday villa on the Greek island of Corfu .
The consultation document on Government ’s latest plans – which could be included in the Queen ’s Speech later this year – could mean the criminalizing up to 7 million British citizens including Internet restrictions and fines of up to £ 50,000 .
UK Pirate Party leader Andrew Robinson is naturally against these draconian fines .
“ You ’re branding a huge percentage of this population criminals for doing something that does n’t have any proven implications , ” he said this week .
“ It ’s a ridiculous state of affairs .
People who copy a movie are lumped in with people who steal cars . ”
The continuing decline of basic comfort and civility in air travel has been a source of continued complaint on this blog and other sites .
Many have complained about how they book a flight with a major airline only to be shoved on to some small puddle jumper run by an unknown carrier .
Then there are the horror stories of being held for hours on planes on the tarmac .
A new story involving Continental Airlines Flight 2816 combines all of these problems into a nightmare where passengers were left on a plane with malfunctioning toilets overnight after being diverted from their intended airport .
They were held overnight because the flight crew was over their limit for flying and the security staff at the airport had gone home for the night .
While consumer advocates have tried for years to get real legal rights and causes of action against airlines , this powerful lobby has blocked every substantive effort — even as the public helped the airlines with massive financial assistance .
This case shows how people have become little more than cargo in the eyes of airlines .
The 47 passengers took off from Houston to go to Minneapolis .
While they purchased their tickets from Continental , they were put on an ExpressJet flight .
Due to thunderstorms , they were diverted to Rochester .
However , once they landed , the crew had reached their maximum number of hours and were not allowed to fly any further .
Moreover , the security staff at the airport had gone home for the night , so the staff refused to allow the passengers to leave the small plane with a number of crying children and malfunctioning toilets .
They remained there overnight .
They were given one snack and one free drink during their ordeal .
In the morning , they were briefly allowed into the airport before being put on the same plane ( with the broken toilets ) for the flight to Minneapolis .
Beyond the huge support of the airline lobby , one of the reasons why Congress may not be willing to act on real protections for passengers is that they have their own fleet of luxury planes for junkets and just called for over a half billion dollars to expand their fleet of jets .
Indeed , given how horrible the economy is and how horrible commercial air travel has become , one could blame the members for wanting the public to buy them luxury jets to go on European vacations ?
After shoving its passengers on to the ExpressAir flight , Continental is now referring any inquiring to that airline .

Wingtip to wingtip , two legendary warriors of the air reach for the sky
They are two of Britain ’s most iconic aircraft – but they have rarely taken to the skies together .
The world ’s last flying Vulcan , our most potent nuclear deterrent during the Cold War , dwarfed the Mk XIX Spitfire during a flypast .
To the delight of onlookers , the aircraft flew in tight formation over Bass Rock , an island in the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland , after an air show at RAF Leuchars last weekend .
Flying high : The Vulcan , top , and the Mk XIX Spitfire on their flypast over Bass Rock
Vulcan XH558 was close to being grounded for ever this year until an 11th - hour Mail on Sunday campaign helped to raise £ 500,000 in just five days keep it flying .
The V - bomber was built in 1960 and flew for the first time in 15 years in 2007 after a £ 7 million restoration project .
But the money needed to maintain it had nearly run dry before the Vulcan to the Sky Trust launched its fundraising campaign in March .
The Trust is urging readers to keep donations rolling in .

It s a fairly sober and sunny Sunday afternoon in the apartment like most any other , but in my brightest intentions and most thought out plans Ive something dark and wild in store .
The wish is to recreate the conditions of the plus ++++ experience I had had in the past , when I had last successfully mixed DMT and mescaline .
All attempts succeeding that one wherein I manically thought : my sensorium is a sun-rapt field fox fur fine and silk sheets sensual that I m being lovingly dragged through by a ballistic missile had been frustratingly lacking due to unpredictable mimosa timing and effectiveness , or involuntarily aborted in an eruption of too - soon green cactus barf .
Reaching it again has consumed me spiritually .
But I have it figured it out now .
I will eat far less cactus by using syrian rue ( an herbal MAOI ) , and eat it slowly too .
Then Ill inject synthetic DMT intramuscularly , thereby avoiding the inconsistencies of DMT digestion .
Theres no fucking that up .
T+0:00 After swallowing 3g of ground syrian rue , I begin the marathon pill eating session of 30g of dried green T. Peruvianus flesh , ~60 pills over and hour and a half .
I have done more than this before and it worked out fine .
I begin to feel the mescaline about an hour after swallowing the first cap of the ground up flesh .
A half - hour after this trying desperately to ignore the feeling by watching a Mr. Show DVDI am undeniably nauseous .
So much so that exhaling at any speed beyond cautiously slow causes my stomach to rhythmically spasm .
Thankfully I had thought ahead and was keeping a plastic bag by my side , because there was no way I wouldve made it to the toilet in that conditionT +2:00
The result of all that work , nausea , and vomit is a mescaline buzz that I know doesnt have nearly the vital power to provide the DMT with the necessary escape velocity to guide me to that skyward realm of endlessly accelerating beauty that the combos parabolic trajectory rocketed me through before .
It is nt a bad buzz , perhaps a low ++ , but it is nt enough .
I decide to inject ( IM ) 3 mg of 2C - Eenough to prop up the mescaline launch pad without necessitating redesign to accommodate its own specs , I think .
And I m right .
Within an hour I am at a solid ++ , a warm and sensuous phenethylamine enclosure whose predominantly emotional architecture is , as predicted , mostly mescaline - inspired .
T+3:00 I dissolve 10 mg of 4 - AcO - DMT in juice and drink it down .
Im hoping to mimic a long lasting mimohuasca * T+4:00 Within an hour of imbibing the 4 - AcO - DMT , the tripartite combo is humming along nicely , though strangely still lacking in intensity .
Despite taking the 4 - AcO - DMT on top of syrian rue it did not feel like the addition of a mimohuasca high to the established trip , but rather the combinatory effects of it with the other two chemicals created a kind of sweet n mild psychedelic euphoria , entirely pleasant in one respect but falling far short of the presumptive synergistic potential of all these psychedelic Titans in another vexing respect .
During this hour I spend my time priming my mind for the DMT dose with images of roses .
Their aesthetic is one of fantastically lush and vibrant bounty .
There is a mathematical elegance inherent to the most healthful forms of the species that engages both the cerebral side and the artistic heart .
It was that mixture of precision and fecundity that embodied that last trip a deific scream of evermore quickly unfurling reams of eidetic art , projected directly into my mind from the luminous visions of mad seraphic geniuses .
The rose , I deem , is my hopeful vision incarnate .
Now I m ready for theDMT .
** I knew from a past experience that 50mg of DMT intramuscularly injected would come on almost fully within 6 minutes and by itself produce a +++ level of intensity .
Though I had combined mimohuasca with small doses of every psychedelic involved in this trip to good effect in the past , I had never used this specific combo before , nor had I ever used DMT intramuscularly with a MAOI .
I therefore decide to start with 25 mg .
T+5:00 I do so .
I listen to a couple of songs containing especially high levels of harmony and markedly florid compositions to further tune my mind to the desired frequencies .
When they re finished eight minutes have passed .
Past experiences tell me I should be peaking yet the trip is only lightly colored by DMT at this point and there are no indications that the intensity is increasing .
T+5:09 I inject the remaining 25 mg .
Within three minutes the DMT increases in intensity six - fold .
Im here this place , that before the great experience this one hoped to model was my conception of heaven : a heterodox hell of endlessly accelerating beauty and creative substance so great and unrelenting I cannot will myself from it , and thus can never escape it , but in whose fugacious beholding is inspired a tremulous , soul - buckling gratitude and staggering awe .
For about a minute and a half my DMT addition is a success .
I am precisely where I want to be .
I open my eyes but I can hardly see a thing .
Hot , histemic tears bathe my face as I fumble manically with my headphones .
***
Now I want desperately to be lying down and listening to music .
I need a rhythm .
I finally hit play I dont even know what I will be listening to and don my tear - speckled headphones before collapsing prostrate onto my mattress .
As soon as I lay back a slippery gulp of hot , watery mucus slides down my throat , the flow of mucus from here on is constant .
T+5:11 My throat is suddenly parched , doubtless a symptom of the massive water draw this pseudo - allergic reaction is causing .
If theres a cup of water nearby Ill never find it in this condition .
I must make it to the bathroom sink .
I sit up in bed and stare through cascading tears into the torrent of visuals before me .
But this lachrymose sight is also a feeling : one of having gone too far .
I am strongly disoriented and my head feels hot .
I am the heat ripples radiating from the forehead that houses the febrile dream of a blessedly - mad mental patient .
Major ego-tectonic activity being registered here shit .
My psycho-strata are shifting like alternating layers of clear hot oil and ice , creating isolated bubbles of immiscible thoughts and sensations , though all transparent to each other and growing evermore fluid .
On my way to the bathroom I need to defend myself from an ambush by my treacherous walls and open closet doors .
Fuckers come at me the three - hundred - and - sixty - first degree of lateral planer rotation , which I didnt expect .
Making my defense is quite an ordeal because my hands are still four feet behind me .
But I finally pull through and make it to the bathroom .
With what will be my last fully successful effort at purposeful movement for over an hour , I fill a cup with water at the bathroom sink and hastily gulp it down .
I allow my shaking legs to buckle and I drop to the floor .
Soon my proprioception is shred to ribbons and thrown to a riot of winds where it thrashes about violently in twisted currents .
I can feel pressures and textures but cannot discern where they are in relation to any part of my body , so I must deduce the positions of my limbs from the pressures and textures they encounter and cross-reference that with my memory of the layout and material composition of my bathroom fixtures , I remain , surprisingly , detached and rational .
My limbs are so weak .
A kind of strange mixture of numbness and exhaustion seems to permeate their muscles .
I am about to find this feeling is a result of neither of these descriptors , but rather that my limbs  loyalty to me is surreptitiously being relinquished to some mysterious , imperious menace .
Suddenly teeth gritted and fists balled I am wrenched into the fetal position by a spastic reflex .
This is accompanied by a viciously energetic surge of profound disorientation and nausea .
My face is soaked in tears and spattered by constant trickles and bursts of mucus from my nose and mouth .
My hair and body become soaked with sweat alarmingly fast .
I will not lie in my own vomit too .
I feel out the toilet , as opening my eyes to find it is futile , and just barely raise my head over the bowl .
I look down at the water , which appears to be directly below me , but the proprioceptive impression I receive from my hands is that I am actually too far away to make it into the bowl .
My trembling arms are about to give out , and so I must hook my chin on the rim for support before I can vomit , trusting from the pressure on my neck that I am indeed over the bowl .
The sensation of vomiting is horrendous and unrelenting .
I think the retching has been stretched to its most miserable limits , and then , in a feat of gastrointestinal contortionism , curling like the fetid petal - edges of a rotten flower , my esophageal sphincter suddenly feels as though it blows inside out .
It comes with a wet pop and a grotesque , synaesthetic vision that s rancid to the core , infected by bilious colors and violently visceral dynamism .
After approximately a minute of this convulsive , un - breathing hell I fall back to the floor and drop my head onto a slippery dollop of snot I had ejected earlier and gasp for air , my lungs slurping in fluid from my throat and reflexively sputtering out coughs in rapid - fire succession .
This is could be bad .
****
I know from previous experiences that , when its used intramuscularly , the peak of DMT only lasts 15 minutes before a noticeable decline , and I m about due to start noticing that decline .
But it doesnt come .
Another surge throttles me and I fold inward , clenching my gut while digging my nails into my palms .
Jesus , what s happening to me ?
Now my right shoulder is irresistibly being brought to the side of my head , and my left arm has been stretched at full extension towards my hip , all against my will !
Ive experience quite elaborate , drug- mediated , extra-volitional body contortions or idiomotor effects  in the past on 4 - AcO - DMT and 2C - Ethese effects have accompanied most of the most rapturous of my psychedelic experiences but there they were ordered , purposeful , ecstatic , and ultimately resistible ( resistible in such a way as one can resist a yawn ) .
This experience though is of being maliciously tied in knots to satisfy a sadistic puppeteer that his power has been indelibly demonstrated .
Attempts to move outside his dictates are met with increased limb numbness , disorientation , and nausea .
The surges are an ear popping , ego - concussing kind of electrochemical ramp up that turns every nerve terminal molten before finally subsiding and leaving me frozen in a state of wide - eyed shock .
They re mostly physical , at least insofar as my emotional and cerebral reaction to them remains sober , and so during all this , despite their overwhelming power , my thoughts stay coherent .
I snap up a quick , deep breath the air is saturated with the acid - stink of vomitand begin to hum .
I hold and repeat the tone that reverberates most strongly in my chest plate .
Towards the end of my breath I aspirate shhh in a progressively thinning staccato rhythm , over my tongue - tip and through my teeth , like a Diamondbacks fast - diminishing rattle .
I need the steady vibration and distinct tactile sensations of this exercise to coil and compose myself around .
I need something constant .
This instinctual mantra will be with me often throughout the remainder of the experience .
I need to vomit again .
This time its worse .
~ 30 seconds of convulsions are followed by another 30 of coughing on the floor after I choke on fluid again .
I havent taken a breath .
My eyes are closed yet even the darkness seems to go in and out of focus .
Im losing grip on even the most basic concept of symmetry .
My mantra is silent .
If I pass out now after all this exertion , continue convulsing and breath in vomit or significantly more fluid , I could really be in trouble .
Worst of all this is a concern that I know from these atypical circumstances is nt something that I can tell myself that , upon later sober reflection , I will see as just panic stricken and irrational , this is nt just a threat to my future mental stability , but to my immediate being and mere existence .
*****
Then , at the crumbling edge of consciousness , another surge hits , but its accompanied this time by a fiercely mortal fear that savagely tears me from the rapidly sealing envelope of unconsciousness .
With frantic grasps I claw my way over the edge of oblivion and tumble into the field of brittle ontic shards that comprise the world .
Im breathing .
I regain my mantra .
But now the fear lurks between breaths .
I consider shoving my fingers down my throat to purge the remaining liquid in my stomach so it cant choke me if I pass out , but I dont .
This is now a trial .
It is important that I face it as such .
Upon this determined thought my body twists me over onto my stomach .
My face is being forced into the floor .
My teeth saw across the tile in a serrated rhythm that reverberates deep into my jaw .
My arms and legs are being irresistibly stretched to their full vertical extensions .
What the fuck is this !
I demand to know out loud in a tone that quavers between indignation and a whimper .
Stop !
My right hand is driven into the outer edge of the bath and cannot extend any farther .
At this limitation my wrist cramps painfully and I m flooded with images of deformed growth .
The visions impart that what is happening is a kind of egoic metamorphosis inextricably bound up with the movements of my body , such that each movement is a direct and integral manifestation of the metamorphic process .
Staunching the flow of these movements now will cause an aberration in the assemblage of what will be my reformed ego .
I give myself a burn on my bathroom carpet and scrape my ankle on the unfinished bottom of the sink cabinet while moving my legs out of the door the door that has to be there somewhere so that they can be fully extended , but I do it .
I have to do it .
This drug cant possibly last any longer , though I suspect I m already far past the point when past experiences tell me I should be down ( and Im right , this is different ) .
But another surge is nevertheless working its way up .
This time the convulsions are harder and last even longer .
When I can open my mouth to breath I immediately gag on the acrid air and expend all received relief .
I crumple from the toilet to the ground , vomiting swallowed mucus on the floor next to me .
Im being held underwater .
My vision begins to blur again .
This is happening NOW .
Questioning , analysis , any distancing from its demands is wholly impossible .
There is nothing else in my mind .
I am in my most desperate , most silent momentWill I call out to my mother , make a plea to a past love , burn my last breath screaming for help to any nearby neighbors ?
Will this hour of desperation culminate in a moment of revelation when an anthropomorphized interventionist god , at my tortured supplication , bestows
His mercy and delivers me from this demonic tryptamines possession ?
For reasons I dont fully understand , and at first to my own self - estrangement , but then with briefly stuttering , lonely - but - resolute allegiance , I choose the forms of the sublime their being , their memory , and their mere potential to exist , as abstract and impersonal as that sounds as the hope of my deliverance .
Soon it is evident that Ive made the right choice .
The pounding waves of distortion and caustic washes of physical misery begin slowly drawing into a whirling form .
At the moment it is just a glint , the liminal - edge of some terrible resplendence descried through the haze of perceptual bombardment and wavering consciousness , but the rose , apotheosized , is its manifest form .
Those earlier images , that precious 90 seconds , I can feel their phenomenal echo casting out from my memory .
I can trace it back to its inviolate source within me .
I begin to do just this , and in doing so I come full circle to the rose : an exquisite crucible where these ragged tendrils of my psyche can be poured and alloyed , recast with grafts from its supple textures , and re-braided in the whirling wake of its spiraling convolutions .
For a moment I revel in absolution , but am soon disturbed by a strange force hurdling up from below me .
I am struck with great urgency that this , this immanent fusion of psychology and form , this ego - entrainment with the sublime , is far too important to be met passively .
With pain and bitter effort , working against the spastic compulsions of the DMT , I roll flat onto my back .
Shakily I bend my arms at right angles to the floor , ball my fists , and focus on these feelings of balance and symmetry Ive so difficultly wrought .
It is painful but it is good .
It is the feeling of interjecting marshaled will into a wild , vicious conflict , of forming the beginnings of a promising trialogue with my seditious body and the scattered ranks of my subconscious mind .
The resulting mixture of beauty and pain , reined by deft volition , evokes sensuously symbolic images of silk spooling around broken glass , and shapes into mind graceful forms hewn of battered iron .
I reflect on why I choose sublimity as my salvation over a personal god or interpersonal love .
It might have something to do with a recent re-scan of Kants Critique of Judgment , where he speaks of the sublime as free and transcendent , but I think it has much more to do with self - determination .
Because it does not matter to me that Kants theories have since fallen into some disrepute .
What matters to me is that what is most important to me , revealed by mortal fear as honest and at the core of my being , is a self - formed ideal , one that I choose to believeits ontological status being secondary to be free and transcendent , to be unassailable , to be non-contingent .
And most crucially , most centrally , that I have it in my ability to choose such an aspect of myself consciously and with a total permeation of my being .
It is evidence against self - doubt , evidence that these thoughts to me are ultimately not mere self - delusions and rationalizations that hide the fearful truth that environmental machinations and my own self - interested power schemes subconsciously and fully define me ( thoughts that other powerful but less weighty psychedelic experiences have taunted me with in the past ) .
It confirms that my spiritual proclamations , when their content is made phenomenologically transparent , are not devotionally reducible to lip service , but are inextricable from what I am .
My recent experiences in coming to understand an active , intelligent , and quasi- autonomous subconscious aspect of myself through psychedelics also makes me wonder to what degree this aspect might be implicated in this experience .
The way this experience has unfolded is a little too tight and punctuated by too many strange and idiosyncratic happenings , things seem , in ways , plotted to fall together .
I think not that this is mere grasping for sense in the wake of a senseless trauma , but that perhaps I was never in real danger and the central proceedings of the trip unfolded as they did though a purposeful subconscious mediation .
Its as though that subconscious self , with understanding , has seized this opportunity to temper my conscious mind in mortal fear , and through this fundamental life experience it brings to full awareness a deeper order within myself , and thus expands the scope of my self - awareness .
It s happened to erase self - doubt and to bring my conscious self more fully in league with my deepest passions .
This process serves to bring about a self - determined spiritual evolution , an evolution effectively expedited through the unique properties of psychedelic drugs .
If this sort of radically accelerated , subconsciously mediated spiritual evolution really occurs , it just has .
By the end of these reflections the DMT has faded in intensity enough for me to walk .
Visuals are still swirling around my alarm clock as I verify that it has been over one - and - a - half hours since I injected the DMT ( it did nt just seem longer ) .
When I drink ayahuascaas opposed to dehydrating and encapsulating it the trip will usually last about 50 minutes , so for intramuscularly injected DMT to last this long , with or without an MAOI , is exceptional .
It s another half hour before the DMT fades into relative insignificance , bringing the total time of its influence to over two hours .
The trip from the other drugs has been extremely blunted by its comparative timidity to the DMT and by my own exhaustion .
Moreover I am simply reluctant to endure them .
I go into a dreamless sleep , and when I wake up a couple of hours later I feel only a slight afterglow .
Though I am excited by the potential implications of this experience my life has not greatly changed .
I am grateful for the long - needed humbling , but long ago I reached the essential limits of what the perspectives afforded to me by psychedelics could do to correct my overt flaws and improve my life out in the world .
The majority of my best experiences with them have nevertheless , and counter intuitively , occurred after this realization .
The value of these latter trips is only made apparent to me deep in thought , and in certain charged moments that vibrate with impossible vigor and affirmation , quiet quakes whose bottomless faults I know now to open through my core .
These most elevated moments require no justification , they are free and transcendent , and I choose them . *
The problem with intramuscular DMT is that its so damned short , for me it will last only 40 minutes start to finish , or so I figure from past experiences absent syrian rue that is .
In the experience I was modeling this one after I had used a boiled - down - to - powder - and - encapsulated mimosa extract .
The result was two and a half hours of DMT powered bliss .
I wanted to emulate that .
A past experience with syrian rue and 4 - AcO - DMT had been remarkably similar to the effects of the just mentioned mimohuasca form ( which for me is slower and smoother in effect than its liquid form ) , and so that is why I used it here .** I am fully aware of the perceived futility ( a justified perception ) of trying to recreate a ++++ experience by deferring to exacting mimetic practices , nevertheless , three of my six ++++ experiences in a decade of psychedelics use have occurred in the past 10 months , and this recent rapture - proneness  makes the idea that the state can be significantly affected in me through these means seem more probable .*** That this is a histamine reaction is unknown , but I simply dont know what else would mediate a reaction like this .**** Even despite the numerous psychedelic elements in play during the trip I believe the overwhelming reaction I had was due almost entirely to the syrian rue and intramuscularly injected DMT .
The only drug in the mix I have not combined mimohuasca with is 4 - AcO - DMT , though I have used it with mushrooms , which are of course closely related chemically .
In fact Ive even combined mimohuasca ( at a +++ level , the same level 50mg DMT ( IM ) without an MAOI takes me to ) with Peruvian Torch and 2C - E in the past , as well as these latter two with 4 - AcO - DMT , all without troubles , giving me confidence it the relative safety of their combination here .
More strange still is the delayed reaction of the DMT .
I had used 50 mg doses of DMT ( IM ) alone twice prior to this excursion and both times I was peaked in a lucid and manageable trip in less than 6 minutes , and completely down by the 40 - minute mark .
Yet at 8 minutes into this trip I barely even felt the first 25 - milligram make - sure - the - MAOI - doesnt - intensify - it - that - much dose .
Also , my impression was that MAO levels in the blood were not so concentrated that their inhibition would cause a profound increase in the intensity and duration of an IM dose , my hardly affected experiences with IM DPT  which is quite susceptible to an MAOI orally in conjunction with syrian rue certainly support this impression .
It s abundantly clear now that even though I think I know my bodys reactions to drugs based on numerous past experiences , and that there is reason to believe most all of the drugs involved , at the small dosages taken are fairly safe , when dealing with powerful psychedelics no amount of precaution and past experience can truly guarantee safe passage .***** Im fairly certain that the DMT is nt doing any metabolic damage here directly , but I never expected and never read of such violent or bizarre physical symptoms .
Death or lasting harm affected by lack of oxygen from choking while unconscious ( or from some fatal idiosyncratic or unforeseen contraindicative reaction ) didnt , and doesnt seem out of the question under these conditions .

Concern about the long - term stability of North Korea mounted today following reports that the country 's leader , Kim Jong - il , has pancreatic cancer .
The South Korean broadcaster YTN made the announcement about the leader 's health in an unsourced news flash this morning .
Kim , 67 , has ruled the reclusive communist country with absolute authority since his the death of his father , the founder of the state , Kim Il - sung , in 1994 .
His health is one of the most closely guarded secrets in North Korea .
Kim looked gaunt during a rare appearance last Wednesday , when the country marked the anniversary of his father 's death .
North Korean television showed Kim looking thin and frail .
He usually does not speak at public events ; however he has had an active public profile in recent months since re-emerging after a suspected stroke last year .
This raised questions about who will succeed him and who will control the country 's military and weapons programmes .
Some reports have said Kim has anointed his youngest son , Jong-un .
South Korean officials have said the North 's recent military grandstanding , including its nuclear test in May , was aimed at helping Kim pave the way for his successor .
The South 's unification minister , Hyun In - taek , has said Kim 's grip on power has become stronger as he brought to the fore figures sympathetic to his succession plans .
North Korea 's propaganda machine has carefully managed Kim 's re-emergence from his illness with reports of tours to factories and military bases , mostly still photographs of the visits .
The UN imposed further sanctions against North Korea after the nuclear test in May , aimed at cutting the country 's lucrative arms trade .

Noted iPhone security destroyer Jonathan Zdziarski has cracked the iPhone 3GS encryption security , which is to be expected , but the ease and speed with which he did it is worrisome .
Zdziarski claims the iPhone 3GS is thus " useless " to businesses .

The iPhone certainly is n't as ubiquitous for corporate use as BlackBerry or even Windows Mobile , but that 's starting to change , and Zdziarski is very concerned that the iPhone 3GS 's security puts sensitive data at unnecessary risk .
He claims that with easily - available software , anybody can break into an iPhone 3GS and start extracting data within two minutes , and access everything on the phone within 45 .
After reading this , we could see why companies might just be reluctant to trade their BlackBerrys in for a shiny new iPhone 3GS .

September 12 , 2009 – Some people cancel holidays abroad , others stage yard sales or start shopping at low - cost supermarkets .
To that list must now be added a new way to get through economic hard times : grow cannabis .
Law enforcers on the west coast of the US and in the middle states straddled by the foothills of the Appalachian mountains are reporting a common trend .
It is boom time for marijuana cultivation , and much of the incentive they say is to beat the recession .
So far this year , police in parts of the country where cannabis is traditionally grown have chopped down plants with a street value of $ 12bn .
The core growing area is in California , Washington and Oregon to the west , but the Appalachian states of Kentucky , Tennessee and West Virginia are also witnessing an explosion .
More than 600,000 cannabis plants have been cut and burned in those states this summer , reversing a previous decline in production brought about by stringent law enforcement .
It is not only the quantity of crop that is on the rise , the nature of the growers is also changing .
Ed Shemelya , who leads the marijuana eradication programme in the Appalachia region , says a new type of grower is emerging wholly different to the family cartels that have cultivated the drug for generations .
“ We are seeing a lot more individuals who would n’t normally be growing marijuana .
They are not your professionals . ”
Shemelya puts it down to the dire economy in this part of America .
The region is almost entirely dependant for jobs on coal mining , which has suffered severely from the recession .
“ People are growing marijuana to supplement their income or support themselves in poor economic times .
This is about economic necessity , ” he said .
The newcomers to the business are typically restricting their practices to fields of around 80 plants – that ’s tiny compared to the mega cultivation seen in California where 5.3 m plants were destroyed last year up from 4.9 m in 2007 .
But at around $ 2,000 a plant , that still provides a good living in Appalachia .
Growers tend to locate their crops as close to their homes as possible , on the edge or just inside the forest that carpets much of the foothills .
They clear foliage from the trees to allow in light , then grow the plants between the trunks to hide them from aerial detection by the drug authorities .
On top of the economic incentive , the clampdown on marijuana traffic across the border from Mexico has also provided a reason for new participants to enter the market .
Dave Keller , a drug enforcement officer in Appalachia , told the Associated Press that both small and large growers were trying to fill the void .
The booming business is proving challenging not only for law enforcement .
A devastating forest fire in the mountains of Los Padres National Forest in California last month was found to have been started by a Mexican drug cartel that had been cooking marijuana on a camp fire .
Some 30,000 plants were seized from the farm hidden away in the forest .

Technological replicators are affecting human nature ( Image : Burneverything )
Your ideas :
Help find a name for the third replicator
WE HUMANS have let loose something extraordinary on our planet – a third replicator – the consequences of which are unpredictable and possibly dangerous .
What do I mean by “ third replicator ” ?
The first replicator was the gene – the basis of biological evolution .
The second was memes – the basis of cultural evolution .
I believe that what we are now seeing , in a vast technological explosion , is the birth of a third evolutionary process .
We are Earth ’s Pandoran species , yet we are blissfully oblivious to what we have let out of the box .
This might sound apocalyptic , but it is how the world looks when we realise that Darwin ’s principle of evolution by natural selection need not apply just to biology .
Given some kind of copying machinery that makes lots of slightly different copies of the same information , and given that only a few of those copies survive to be copied again , an evolutionary process must occur and design will appear out of destruction .
You might call it “ design by death ” since clever designs thrive because of the many failures that do n’t .
The information that is copied , varied and selected is called the replicator , and the process is well understood when applied to biology .
Genes are copied , mutated and selected over and over again .
Assemblages of genes are used to build vehicles that carry them around , protect them and propagate them .
These vehicles – the lumbering robots , as Richard Dawkins calls them – are animals and plants , the prolific and exquisitely designed products of the first replicator .

PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
Air France will pay families about € 17,500 ( $ 24,500 ) in initial compensation for each victim of the crash of Flight 447 this month , the company 's chief executive says .
French Senator Gerard Larcher throws a tribute wreath into waters in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , on Thursday .
So far , Air France has been in touch with about 1,800 relatives of the people who died when the Airbus A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1 , chief executive Paul - Henri Gourgeon told France 's RTL radio Friday .
The company is also providing families with counseling , he said .
" Of course , this is not always easy , ( but ) we make up for it , " he said .
" We have psychologists in each country , in each stop .
You know that the passengers were of 32 different nationalities , so all that is of great complexity , but we have the ability to manage this complexity .
It 's just a question of means and no limits on the means that we put in place . "
Gourgeon said it has been difficult tracing the relatives of all 228 victims .
" The modern world is different and we often have only a cell phone , and as you can imagine , this cell phone is unfortunately in the aircraft , " he said .
" So we probably put more hours to access all the relatives . "
The aircraft has not been found , though search teams have found dozens of pieces of debris in the water and think they know the general location of the wreck .
The head of the French accident investigation board , Paul - Louis Arslanian , said this week that there is a chance the entire aircraft may never be found .
Watch more wreckage recovered from crash »
Do n't Miss Manufacturer optimistic flight data recorder will be found
With no wreckage and few clues about what caused the plane to go down , searchers are focused on finding the plane 's data recorders , the so - called black boxes .
Data from the recorders may be crucial in pinning down a cause .
Autopsies conducted on some of the 50 bodies found so far show they suffered broken bones , including arms , legs and hips , Brazilian authorities have told French investigators , Arslanian said .
Experts have said such injuries indicate the flight broke apart before hitting the ocean .
Asked about that theory , Gourgeon said he would not go that far .
" What I know is that the investigators would like to know the causes of death , " Gourgeon said .
" That knowledge of causes of death will better clarify what exactly happened .
Were the victims killed before the impact , or during impact ? "
There has been difficulty in exchanging information between French investigators and Brazilian coroners , but that is being resolved , he said .
Investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as Pitot tubes , among other factors , as a possible cause of the crash .
The plane sent 24 automated error messages in the four minutes before it crashed , Arslanian said Wednesday .
The error messages all indicate there were problems with on - board information about the plane 's speed , which can cause some of the plane 's instruments to stop functioning , Arslanian said .
CNN 's Pierre Meilhan in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .

Bicycles are n’t known for being high - tech when compared with other forms of transportation .
But cyclist Chris Boardman ’s new bike design prototype takes bikes well beyond advances in carbon - fiber frames and electric assist technology .
The bike , which relies on existing technology , has a mini-computer attached to the handlebars to count calories ; a purportedly unbreakable locking device that uses fingerprint identification ; and a battery - assisted motor powered by solar panels .
Boardman ’s design also features a lightweight carbon - fiber frame , spoke - less wheels that improve aerodynamics , and self inflating , puncture - proof tires .
All told , the contraption could remove many of the barriers that prevent citygoers from using bikes as their main source of transportation , including concerns about theft , maintenance , and too much physical exertion .
The one hurdle Boardman ’s advanced design still needs to work on ?
Cost .
The Olympic cyclist estimates that it will take 20 years before the bike is cheap enough for mass - market adoption .
But look on the bright side :
If you start riding your current bike instead of driving , you ’ll save enough money to be able to afford this thing when Boardman gets it made .

Jenson Button has vowed to take a more aggressive approach at the Belgian Grand Prix following a series of disappointing results for the championship leader .
Button , winner of six of the first seven races of the season , has managed no better than fifth place in the last four events and saw Brawn team - mate Rubens Barrichello win the European Grand Prix to move back into second place in the standings .
Button finished in seventh place at Valencia , despite his team having returned to the top following a series of disappointing performances .
The Briton reckons it 's time to be more aggressive , not only with his driving , but also with his strategies , if he is to stay on top of the championship table .
" It is better to be consistent and not crash , but if you are consistent and get two points it is not enough , " said Button .
" I am going to go to Spa and be more aggressive , for sure .
In every way , not just driving , but with the strategy and with the tyres .
" It is where we have got to be , because otherwise it is going to be slowly eaten away .
It is a very difficult season this year because we have had some really poor weekends and some really strong weekends , and this was the first time when we have had a strong car that I have not been able to get the most out of it .
" That is the most frustrating thing .
We have to turn that around . "
Despite his lack of results in the last few races , Button is still 18 points ahead of Barrichello with six races to go , having benefited from the poor race Red Bull endured in Valencia , where both Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber failed to score .
The Brawn driver admitted he is surprised to have managed to keep a healthy lead after such difficult races .
And he believes he will continue to benefit from the rivalry between Webber and Vettel in the remaining races .
" Yeah , that is the pretty amazing thing , " he added .
" My best finish has been fifth in the last two .
This one should have been a lot more , but it was n't .
I got two points though and I 've got 18 points over Rubens .
That is still a good margin but Rubens is very quick at the moment .
" As I 've said before , we are in the same car and this is not a typical day for myself .
I think we got very unlucky , which was caused by me making the mistake in qualifying .
And we have got a 20.5 lead to Webber , and Sebastian is another five points behind him .
" The good thing is that the Red Bulls are still going to be fighting .
They are going to be quick for sure over the next few races , especially the next one at Spa , although I do n't think the McLarens will be as quick as they were here .
" I think we have sorted out a few of our issues , and we have some updates , so Rubens and myself will be very quick at Spa .
" I just hope I can get a good lap in qualifying , as I have been doing most of the season , because two - and - a - half tenths can be three places on the grid , so you need the perfect lap .
I enjoy Spa and I think we can have a good weekend there . "
Summer is drawing to a close ( sorry , but it is ) and it's time to tackle the dreaded chore of cleaning the vacation detritus collecting in our vehicles .
I try to keep my truck reasonably tidy throughout the year , but when summer vacation hits and the truck becomes the primary family wheels , it can be tough to keep up .
The aftermath , come late August or September , can be grim .
A typical fall cleaning session takes me an entire day with the vacuum , carpet shampooer , assorted scrubbers and cleaning potions , and yields bags of dirt , sand , crumbs , pieces of broken toys and stray Pokemon cards .
I 've learned a few lessons along the way and I 'm using that knowledge to produce my own list of banned items and substances with the goal of more pleasant road trips and easier fall cleanups .
Needless to say , it is n't popular and I 'll be the first to admit that it 's quite possibly even more arbitrary than the TSA 's Prohibited Items list .
Generally speaking , I agree with the TSA when it comes to sharp objects such as meat cleavers , ice picks and scissors , and I 'll also stick with their decision to ban firearms , cattle prods , drills , blasting caps , hand grenades , plastic explosives , pepper spray and tear gas .
My kids do n't have access to most of those items , but it works for me as a common - sense baseline .
The last thing I need 10hours into a 12 - hour drive is an accidental blast of pepper spray to the face or a cattle prod duel breaking out between the occupants of rows two and three .
I probably have dozens of pet peeves after nearly a decade of doing the parental driving routine , but here are five things that really drive me nuts and are therefore banned ( although my wife naturally retains veto power and the ability to overrule any of my so - called proclamations ) :
1 . Those grabby pincer things they sell at all souvenir shops
These plastic claw things are ubiquitous in gift shops , particularly zoo gift shops , for some reason , where they 're usually fashioned so the grabby part resembles an animal 's head .
Robot hands are also a popular choice , and dinosaurs are always fair game .
Having three rows of seats in my vehicle ensures a certain degree of separation that helps reduce disputes around touching , poking or personal - space intrusion .
One of these diabolical devices extends the reach of any child , giving him the ability to stealthily poke , nudge or pinch anyone in the vehicle .
That 's bad enough , but when the poorly made toy inevitable snaps due to retaliation , hyper extension , or perhaps from attempting too ambitious a caper ( like snatching a bottle of water from a cup holder ) , then there 's the inevitable aftermath of the upset owner .
Avoid these at all cost !
2. Chewing gum
I do n't have anything against a good chew , but keep the stuff out of my truck .
Unless you 're an adult , but even then , I 'm watching you ....
My children know they should n't swallow gum , they know not to play with it or otherwise pull it out of their mouths , and they know better than to litter .
The rule used to be :
Once you 're done with your gum , ask mom for a napkin to safely contain it until we stop where there 's a garbage can .
Now the rule is :
No chewing gum in the vehicle !
In my experience , spent chewing gum mysteriously ends up in hair , stuck to clothes , attached to door handles and stuck to the seats .
No -one is at fault though as , unbeknownst to me , chewing gum has apparently become sufficiently autonomous to hop out of the mouth and throw itself onto inconvenient things .
One useful feature of winter is that it gets cold enough outside to chisel any gum deposits off instead of having to work at it for hours with scrubbers and various solvents .
3 . Cheese doodles
The second item on my foodstuff - related theme .
Do n't get me wrong , whatever brand name they might go by in your area , cheese doodles can be a tasty , if not particularly healthy , treat .
However , in the context of being consumed by children in an automobile interior , they may as well have called these things " l'il orange car wreckers . "
Heaps of brightly colored , dusty coating that 's the perfect consistency to be ground into upholstery , leaving smelly orange streaks ?
Check !
Brittle snack that easily disintegrates into millions of particles that will fall into every crevice , including between seats , under booster seats , inside seat belt mechanisms and collect at the bottom of door pockets ?
Check !
Morphs into a slimy , bloated orange slug that smears on anything when exposed to moisture ?
You bet .
We took the kids to the drive - in a few years ago and they chose a bag of cheese doodles as one of their movie snacks .
I 'm still finding crunchy orange things when flipping seats around , nearly three years later .
Just as frightening , the three - year - old doodles look as though they just fell out of the bag yesterday .
4. Stickers
I do n't remember stickers being such a big thing when I was a kid .
Yes , we had them , but they seemed less common and were therefore more prized .
You did n't just slap a sticker on anything , you made sure the surface was worthy .
I do n't know if it 's the advances in cheap printing or the fact that destinations feel obligated to give every kid at least something as a takeaway , but sticker use is epidemic .
We come back from the doctor 's with stickers , the dentist gives out stickers , museums slap stickers on you and stores sell books full of stickers that look as though they'd be an awesome way for the kids to kill a few hours on an extended drive .
That 's a trap if I ever saw one .
Stickers have a way of migrating from where they should be – on a page , or perhaps a shirt – to the backs of seats .
Good luck to you if one makes its way onto a harder surface like a window or door sill .
If you do n't notice one of these things adhered to a flat plastic surface and it bakes in the sun for a few days , you 'll learn the hard way what " sticker " really means .
5. Sand
My family loves the beach .
We live in London , Ontario , and although our city is more or less landlocked ( unless you count the Thames River or the artificial Fanshawe Lake ) , we 're only half an hour 's drive from Port Stanley on Lake Erie and an hour from Grand Bend on Lake Huron .
We frequent the beaches from spring through fall and our summer vacations frequently include waterfront destinations like Prince Edward Island and Cape Cod .
The kids practically grew up on beaches .
The downside to beach activity combined with kids , is sand .
Sand is my nemesis when it comes to my truck .
The kids track in sand that gets ground into carpets , works its way into rubber seals reducing their effectiveness , scratches paint and finds its way into various mechanisms resulting in grinding wear and tear .
I can never win this battle – the vacuum will always be full of sand at the end of every summer – but I try to enforce a sand ban as a way to reduce the damage .
This involves an elaborate ( and some say extreme ) degree of rinsing off , shaking down and brushing of people and things after all beach excursions .
Two things I always carry in the truck that make life easier :
1. A box of diaper wipes .
We have n't had to deal with changing diapers for years ( thank you , thank you , thank you .... ) , but I still carry these things around because they are so incredibly useful .
First line of defense against ice - cream smeared faces , sticky hands , spills , food stains on clothing , " gas pump smell " hands from self - serve re-fueling , and in a pinch they can be used to attack big messes ( usually bird or bug - related ) on the windshield that the wipers are choking on .
They do it all .
Yes , there are similar products sold as all purpose cleaning wipes , but diaper wipes are usually stronger , cheaper , easier to find , and my wife kind of likes the scent .
2. Lint Roller .
The two - sided tape kind .
A good roller will pick up the deeply embedded dog hair that even our Dyson wo n't pull out of the upholstery ; it picks up food crumbs and sand as well .
Strips of a sheet can be used to retrieve coins dropped into a difficult to reach nook ( think chimps fishing for termites with a stick ) .
The only downside to this one ( at least for those of us in Northern climates ) is the stickiness takes a significant hit when temperatures drop below freezing .

President Obama ’s counter - terrorism chief on Thursday repeatedly rebuked the Bush administration in a speech designed to make the case for a broader approach to fighting Islamic extremism .
In his first public appearance as the White House counter - terrorism advisor , John O. Brennan said that President George W. Bush ’s policies had been an affront to American values , undermined the nation ’s security and fostered a “ global war ” mind - set that served only to “ validate Al Qaeda ’s twisted worldview . ”
“ Rather than looking at allies and other nations through the narrow prism of terrorism -- whether they are with us or against us -- the [ Obama ] administration is now engaging other countries and people across a broader range of areas , ” Brennan said .
The sharp language is likely to extend the war of words between the current administration and conservative critics such as former Vice President Dick Cheney , who has carried out an unusually high - profile campaign accusing Obama of abandoning methods that made the country safe .

Brennan ’s speech was the latest in a series of addresses by senior administration figures in recent weeks outlining the president ’s national security agenda .
Brennan emphasized the argument that the United States must move beyond using the CIA and the military to attack Al Qaeda and must work to expand economic and educational opportunities across the Muslim world .
“ We can not shoot ourselves out of this challenge , ” Brennan said .
“ If we fail to confront the broader political , economic and social conditions in which extremists thrive , then there will always be another recruit in the pipeline , another attack coming downstream . ”
Brennan presented what he described as a multi-tiered approach -- including using the U.S. military to train the security forces of allied countries , supporting democratic reforms and directing billions of dollars in aid to impoverished regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan .

Even while seeking to advance the Obama administration ’s agenda , Brennan often struck a defensive tone .
At one point , he decried “ the inflammatory rhetoric , hyperbole and intellectual narrowness that has often characterized the debate over the president ’s national security policies . ”
Brennan had been a casualty of attacks from the left as Obama was assembling his leadership team .
Widely considered a leading candidate to run the CIA under Obama , Brennan -- who had spent most of his career in the agency -- was forced to withdraw in the face of criticism that he was too closely tied to the harsh tactics employed by the Bush administration .

Brennan complained at the time that his critics were misinformed .
On Thursday , he denounced the CIA ’s use of waterboarding and other interrogation measures .
Such methods , he said , serve only as “ a recruitment bonanza for terrorists , increase the determination of our enemies and decrease the willingness of other nations to cooperate with us . ”
At the White House , Brennan has been deeply involved in the work of committees that Obama established to overhaul the CIA ’s interrogation procedures and to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
This week , administration officials acknowledged that they were considering a plan that would set up detention and trial facilities for Guantanamo inmates in the United States , possibly in Kansas or Michigan .

Brennan declined to comment on the deliberations but indicated that the administration believed it was on target to meet its January deadline to close the Cuba facility .
The president ’s objective is for Guantanamo to “ be shuttered -- there ’d be no detainees there , ” Brennan said .
“ We are going to get there . ”

We have a comic for you today even though Tony was rushed to an undisclosed location and Wes spent most of the week in Middle - earth .
ALSO , you may have noticed a NEW and EXCITING button up there !
That ’s right , you can now order high quality prints of all of our comics !
They are big and sexy .
From a policy standpoint , there was nothing new in President Obama ’s speech to a joint session of Congress tonight .
It can only be assessed , therefore , in political terms .
I read the transcript rather than watching it , but the speech struck me as reasonably effective .
I assume the delivery was standard Obama–smooth , generally flat , occasionally a bit whiny .
One striking aspect of the speech was that Obama kept talking about the “ plan ” that he “ announced ” tonight–but there is no plan ; not in writing , anyway .
Not unless Obama meant Nancy Pelosi ’s
House bill , but he did n’t seem to , since he made a point of saying that details remain to be filled in , referred to work still going on in committee , and said that “ his plan ” is open to alternatives to the public option .
This vagueness gives him a sort of deniability : what he was describing was more his concept of the qualities health care legislation should have , rather than a specific bill .
Whether that was politically smart remains to be seen .
So far , vagueness has n’t seemed to be the President ’s friend on this issue .
Here are some excerpts from the speech that I thought were noteworthy :
Instead of honest debate , we have seen scare tactics .
Then , a few minutes later :
Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing .
Our deficit will grow .
More families will go bankrupt .
More businesses will close .
More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most .
And more will die as a result .
By far the biggest scaremonger on this issue has been Obama himself .
Well the time for bickering is over .
The time for games has passed .
I ’m not sure whether Obama and his handlers understand how this sort of talk grates on those of us who are not liberal Democrats ( a large majority of the country ) .
Debating public policy issues is not “ bickering . ”
Disagreeing with a proposal to radically change one of the largest sectors of our economy is not a “ game . ”
This kind of gratuitous insult–something we never heard from President Bush , for example –is one of the reasons why many consider Obama to be mean - spirited .
I assume most people noticed how , in tonight ’s speech , Obama ’s assurance that we will not lose our present insurance coverage has been scaled back .
This was after thousands of critics pointed out that under the Democrats ’ proposals , many people ( more than 100 million according to some estimates ) will in fact lose the insurance coverage they now have :
[ I ] f you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job , Medicare , Medicaid , or the VA , nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have .
Let me repeat this : nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have .
That ’s true , of course .
No one ever said it did .
What the Democrats ’ plan does do , however , is give employers the opportunity and , depending on pricing , the incentive to terminate their employees ’ plans and dump them into the public system .
And whether private insurance companies can compete with the public “ option ” depends on whether Obama keeps his pledge that the public program wo n’t be subsidized .
[ I ] nsurance companies will be required to cover , with no extra charge , routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies – because there ’s no reason we should n’t be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse .
How does that work ?
Better coverage for more people at less cost .
Does anyone actually believe that is possible ?
I do n’t think so .
Obama described his plan for an insurance exchange where those who are not part of a larger plan will be able to buy coverage .
He then added :
This exchange will take effect in four years , which will give us time to do it right .
But wait !
Are n’t people dying ?
The Democrats tried to ram their bill through Congress before the August recess , with essentially no debate and with virtually no one having read it .
Their theory was that we are facing such a dire emergency that there is not a moment to lose .
If , in fact , we have four years to spare , could we maybe stop trying to cram the bill down Americans ’ throats ?
Now , even if we provide these affordable options , there may be those – particularly the young and healthy – who still want to take the risk and go without coverage .
That ’s true , of course .
There are millions of people , mostly young and single , who choose not to buy health insurance or take a job where compensation comes largely in the form of benefits ( same thing ) because they have made a rational decision that for them , health insurance is n’t worth the money .
As Americans , they should have that right .
The problem is that , in the unlikely event they do get sick , they know they will be treated anyway .
That ’s why under my plan , individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance – just as most states require you to carry auto insurance .
Traditionally , it was liability insurance that drivers were required to carry , not to protect themselves , but to protect others from their possible negligence .
It is only because of no - fault laws that most states now require drivers to carry insurance that includes first - party coverage .
There are some similarities , but many differences , between automobile and health insurance .
[ U] nless everybody does their part , many of the insurance reforms we seek – especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions – just ca n’t be achieved .
This is a key point that many will overlook .
One of the central purposes of nearly all health care “ reform ” proposals is to force young people into the system to help pay older peoples ’ bills .
Why is it that you ca n’t force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions –i.e. , “ insure ” against something that has already happened , a logical impossibility –unless you force young people to “ do their part ” ?
Insurance companies , and , eventually , the government as single payer , need young people to pay premiums that far exceed any actual risk to subsidize the known losses that will come from being forced to “ insure ” people whose medical conditions are not risks but certainties .
Consider the analogy to life insurance : could a dying , 90 - year - old person expect an insurance company to issue him a million dollar life insurance policy ?
Maybe , but it would cost close to a million dollars .
Why can life insurance companies sell policies at rates that people consider reasonable ?
Only because they are insuring against premature death , and the insured has been paying premiums for many years , during most of which time there was little risk of his dying .
The same principle applies , pretty closely , to health insurance .
Some of people ’s concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost .
The best example is the claim , made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts , but prominent politicians , that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens .
Such a charge would be laughable if it were n’t so cynical and irresponsible .
It is a lie , plain and simple .
No , it is n’t .
The Democrats ’ bill does n’t call the agencies it sets up “ death panels , ” it says they will decide on “ best practices . ”
But any socialized medicine scheme saves money by rationing care .
Who gets shorted , the politically powerful ?
No , of course not ; the elderly and those who are otherwise helpless .
In the United Kingdom , the death panel goes by the Orwellian acronym “ NICE . ”
There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants .
This , too , is false – the reforms I ’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally .
This is an outright lie , as Congressman Joe Wilson could n’t resist blurting out during Obama ’s speech .
The Democrats defeated Republican - sponsored amendments that would have attempted , at least , to prevent illegals from being treated under the House version of Obama ’s plan .
I think everyone expects that if Obamacare becomes law , illegals will receive benefits on an equal basis with citizens .
And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up – under our plan , no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , and federal conscience laws will remain in place .
More oily language from the master of the half - truth .
Under Obama ’s plan , it wo n’t be necessary for federal dollars to fund abortions , at least not until socialized medicine actually arrives .
Insurance dollars will fund abortions .
The House bill sets up a nameless , unaccountable committee that will decide what coverages must be included in any approved private insurance policy .
Those required coverages , you can be 100 percent certain , will include the costs of abortions .
But Obama will take no responsibility ; those are just “ best practices . ”
This seems to me to be the most critical moment in Obama ’s speech :
My guiding principle is , and always has been , that consumers do better when there is choice and competition .
Unfortunately , in 34 states , 75 % of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies .
In Alabama , almost 90 % is controlled by just one company .
Without competition , the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down .
In fact , Obama and Congressional Democrats have zero interest in increasing choice and competition .
If they did , there is an easy solution .
There are over 1,000 health insurance companies in the United States ; why do you think it is that in Alabama , one company has 90 percent of the business ?
It is because there are major legal obstacles to insurance companies operating across state lines .
State legislatures , and lots of the companies , like it this way .
Competition is hard .
But if Obama really wanted to expand “ choice and competition ” in health care , all he would have to do is go along with the Republican proposal to allow health insurance companies to sell on a national basis .
Like , say , computer companies , beer companies , automobile companies , law firms , and pretty much everyone else .
The Democrats ’ refusal to allow existing health insurance companies to compete against each other nationwide , more than anything else , puts the lie to their nonsense about “ choice and competition . ”
Now , I have no interest in putting insurance companies out of business .
Really ?
We ’ve all seen the YouTube video where Obama says that under his plan , private health insurance will be driven into extinction over a period of ten to twenty years .
Has he changed his mind ?
When ?
Why ?
Does President Obama fail to understand the ubiquity of YouTube ?
Does he not understand that many millions of Americans consider him a liar when he says things like this ?
President Obama talked about the “ public option ” and assured listeners that it would not be subsidized by the government :
I have insisted that like any private insurance company , the public insurance option would have to be self - sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects .
But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits , excessive administrative costs and executive salaries , it could provide a good deal for consumers .
Is it churlish to point out that profits are not overhead ?
It might be if this were just a slip of the tongue on the stump .
But this was a speech that was carefully crafted by Obama and his top advisers .
They really do not know the first thing about business or economics .
So why should we put them in charge of our economy ?
I want to speak directly to America ’s seniors for a moment , because Medicare is another issue that ’s been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate .
Actually , the administration has said that around half the cost of the plan , $ 500 billion , would be paid for by cuts in Medicare .
So it is n’t exactly “ demagoguery and distortion ” to suggest that there might be cuts in Medicare .
[ N] ot a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay for this plan .
I should hope not , since there is n’t any Medicare trust fund , just like there is n’t any Social Security trust fund .
The only thing this plan would eliminate is the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud …
Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan .
But wait !
If we can identify hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and fraud in Medicare and Medicaid and we know how to eliminate it , why have n’t we done so already ?
Why do n’t we do so–right now !
–regardless of the administration ’s highly controversial health care bill ?
There is no possible answer to these questions .
The Obama plan–whatever it is , once reduced to writing –depends for most of its financing on the bare assertion that we are currently wasting hundreds of billions of dollars , and that we will stop wasting that money only if taxpayers knuckle under to Obamacare .
This was not , to put it kindly , a speech that was directed at thinking people .

Some of the most impressive images in science are produced when researchers take numerical data and represent it visually through modeling and computer graphics .
The Department of Energy honored 10 of this year 's best scientific visualizations with its annual SciDAC Vis Night awards , at the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing conference ( SciDAC ) in June .
Researchers submitted visualizations to the contest , and program participants voted on the best of the best .
From earthquakes to jet flames , this gallery of videos and images show how beautiful ( and descriptive ) visual data can be .
( We 've adapted the captions from the SciDAC Vis Night blurbs . )

This visualization illustrates some of the rupture and wave propagation phenomena of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the San Andreas fault in Southern California .
It shows how an earthquake originating 60 miles south of Palm Springs can end up shaking Los Angeles , Ventura and Santa Barbara minutes after the original fault rupture .
The animation captures more than four minutes of complex dynamic rupture and wave propagation .
Nearly 12 terabytes of earthquake simulation data was used to generate the animation .

A Lifted Ethylene - Air Jet Flame Stabilized by Autoignition in a Heated - Air Co-flow
This video demonstrates how a jet flame made of ethylene and air can be stabilized by a co-flow of preheated air .
As the ethylene fuel interacts with air particles by diffusion , massless tracer particles show how the two substances react with each other .
The researchers say this visualization will help study models for similar combustion processes that occur in " non-premixed " ( fuel and air separated ) scenarios .

Simulation of Non-Newtonian Suspensions Non-Newtonian fluids are substances that do n't have constant flow properties or a constant viscosity .
These suspensions are found in building materials such as paint , concrete and mortar .
This simulation examines how the viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid changes as strain is applied :
The fluid at the center stays viscous while a force is applied to the boundary .
The researchers say this observation could have practical implications for construction — for example , in a situation where construction workers want to control the flow of concrete as they finish a surface .

Explosion of Type Ia Supernovae From Multiple Ignition Points Type
Ia supernovae are thought to be white dwarf stars in binary systems that explode due to a thermonuclear runaway .
This movie shows a simulation of Type Ia supernovae exploding from multiple ignition points .
When the hot ash breaks through the surface of the star , it spreads rapidly across the stellar surface , converges at the opposite point and produces a jet - like flow that triggers a detonation .
The simulation shows that multiple ignition points generate more nuclear burning and produce more expansion of the star than a single ignition point .
As a result , less radioactive nickel is produced during the detonation phase , and the explosion is less luminous .

A man in the United States has been found guilty of killing his sick daughter by praying for her recovery instead of seeking medical care .
Prosecutors convicted the father , Dale Neumann , of second degree reckless homicide .
Madeline Neumann died after collapsing at her family home in the town of Weston in rural Wisconsin .
The 11 - year - old was suffering from undiagnosed diabetes .
The court was told how her family surrounded her and prayed for her recovery rather than seek medical care .
Only when she stopped breathing did anyone call an ambulance .
Neumann , who once studied to be a Pentecostal minister , testified that he believed God would heal his daughter .
He said that by calling a doctor , he would have been putting the doctor before God .
Mr Neumann 's wife was also convicted of second - degree reckless homicide earlier this year .
The couple both face up to 25 years in prison .

ANAHEIM , California ( Reuters ) -
It ’s home to Disneyland -- “ the happiest place on earth ” -- but deputies enforcing home evictions in Anaheim find mold , backed - up plumbing , marijuana crops , abandoned grandparents and the occasional suicide .
Protesters hold signs outside a foreclosed apartment building , which four families are being evicted from , in Los Angeles June 11 , 2009 .
California is one of the places hardest hit by foreclosures as hundreds of thousands defaulted on the subprime loans that fueled a buying frenzy .
But in the year since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the number of prime borrowers who are overdue or in foreclosure has also skyrocketed to one in 10 .

Orange County Sheriff ’s Deputy Ramona Figueroa says nothing surprises her any more but the job is getting worse , and she hopes the downward slide does n’t last too much longer .
One common task these days is serving eviction notices to people who have done nothing wrong -- who rent properties that have fallen into foreclosure , or are repossessed to recover unpaid debts .
“ They are shocked and surprised , ” Figueroa said as she went on her rounds .
“ And here I am giving them a five - day notice and they explain that just five days earlier the homeowner was at the home collecting rent . ”
With 17,000 homes going into foreclosure in this Southern California county in the first half of 2009 , Figueroa has found her caseload in the last year getting heavier and harder to bear .
Homeowners forced into difficulty often take out their frustration on her when she comes knocking on the door to tell them it is time to leave .
“ With the financial situation the way it is , people did n’t get into buying a home with the intentions of losing it , ” said Figueroa .
“ They are disappointed , they are angry . ”
California is one of the places hardest hit by foreclosures as hundreds of thousands defaulted on the subprime loans that fueled a buying frenzy .
But in the year since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the number of prime borrowers who are overdue or in foreclosure has also skyrocketed to one in 10 .
“ When I first started enforcing court orders , I ’d see one foreclosure every four or five years , and now I see a foreclosure every day , ” said Figueroa , a 25 - year veteran of law enforcement .

‘ EVERYBODY TO BLAME ’
Another trend on the rise is evictions of single - family homes that are occupied by dozens of people .
The harder the slump , the more people cram in together .
“ You get in there and where you think you have two to three people , turns out you ’ve got 25 , ” said Figueroa .
“ I had that in the city of Brea where I was pulling people out of closets and rooms in a four - bedroom , two - bath home . ”
The deputies give residents five days ’ notice of eviction in person and then return to turn them out .
Dan Mendoza , another Orange County deputy , says most people comply and leave the property without incident .
“ Eviction is a business disagreement , ” said Mendoza as he drove to his next eviction .
“ No one is here to get hurt . ”
But the deputies witness heartwrenching pain .
One day , Mendoza has to evict -- due to a mortgage foreclosure -- a 70 - year - old woman named Aida , who only speaks Spanish and cries with worry over her grandchildren ’s belongings .
As she clutches her stomach , Mendoza calls the paramedics , just to make sure that Aida “ is medically and physically OK . ”
Mendoza talks about finding senior citizens , small kids and pitbulls left behind in the homes .
Figueroa says many homes are in appalling state , with mold eating through the roof , meat rotting in the refrigerator and animal feces and urine soiling the carpet .
One older man was growing marijuana upstairs , another took his life when deputies arrived .
And yet , Figueroa says she loves her job .
But in this last year , she has been troubled by the constant shifting of blame that came with the sharp rise in evictions .
No one wants to be seen as responsible for this large scale breakdown of people ’s lives and dreams .
“ I get the property people blaming the real estate people , the real estate people blaming the banks , the banks blaming the homeowners .
It is just this vicious circle .
“ I think everybody is to blame for getting into this whole mess .
It has kind of snowballed . ”

( AP ) --
The bathroom lines at the already crowded space shuttle and space station complex got a lot longer Sunday because of a flooded toilet .
One of two commodes aboard the international space station malfunctioned , right in the middle of complicated robotic work being conducted by the two crews .
The pump separator apparently flooded .
Mission Control advised the astronauts to hang an " out of service " sign on the toilet until it could be fixed .
In the meantime , the six space station residents had to get in line to use their one good toilet .
And Endeavour 's seven astronauts were restricted to the shuttle bathroom .
There have never been so many people - 13 - together in space .
The toilet repair work fell to Belgian Frank De Winne , who had to don goggles , gloves and a mask .

It could turn out to be significant .
It 's too early to tell right now . "
Teams of specialists in Houston and Moscow hurriedly convened to discuss the problem .
The Russian - built , multimillion - dollar toilet flew up on a shuttle last November .
Smith said there is no urgency to the bathroom situation , at least for now .
But he said if the toilet remains out of action for several days , " then we 'll readdress the situation and see what we have to do . "
Going into this mission , NASA wanted at least four of Endeavour 's crew to use the space station 's bathrooms , so the shuttle waste water tank would not fill up .
As long as Endeavour is docked to the space station , it cannot eject any waste water .
The nozzle is located near the newly installed porch on the Japanese lab ; the attach mechanisms for experiments could corrode if sprayed by water .
Two bathrooms ultimately are needed for a full station crew of six .
Smith said he did not know how long six occupants could rely on a single toilet .
Both the shuttle and station are equipped with other ways for the astronauts to relieve themselves , Smith said , including Apollo - era urine collection bags .
Much of Sunday - the eve of the 40th anniversary of man 's first moon landing - was spent using a pair of robot arms to move a large cargo carrier , loaded with batteries and spare parts , from the shuttle to the station .
It was a relatively quiet day sandwiched between spacewalks .
The 13 - by - 8 - foot platform holds an antenna , pump and engine for the station 's rail car , all of which will be removed and secured to the space station during a spacewalk Monday .
NASA wants to store as many big spare parts as possible at the space station , before shuttles stop flying at the end of next year .
Also on the carrier are six batteries that will be plugged into the station by spacewalking astronauts later in the week , replacing old batteries .
In all , five spacewalks are planned during Endeavour 's 1 1/2 - week space station visit .
As for the Apollo 11 anniversary , Smith noted that the Mercury , Gemini and Apollo programs contributed to today 's international space station .
He observed that he was n't born when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon July 20 , 1969 ; neither were two of the 13 spacefarers .

A Canadian infectious - diseases boffin has published an authoritative mathematical model of zombie plagues .
He concludes that the only scenario in which our civilisation could survive a zombie outbreak is one in which normal humans react immediately using extreme violence against the undead , without any attempt to cure or quarantine them .
Professor Robert Smith ?* of Ottawa Uni is a mathematician specialising in the modelling of infectious diseases such as HIV / AIDS ( " I started off in the rectal microbicide team , but then switched to the vaginal team .
The jokes were never - ending , I can assure you " ) .
Now he has turned his skills to analysing the fashion in which a zombie plague might affect the human population .
According to Smith ? , a major factor restraining normal plagues from utterly devastating humanity is that they tend to kill their victims , after which the sufferers can no longer move about and infect others .
This is one reason the frightful Ebola virus has never spread , for instance : it knocks people down and then kills them so fast that they have only a limited chance to pass it on .
Not so with zombification .
Once someone has died of Z - plague , they remain a mobile carrier .
The factors which have prevented humanity being rendered extinct by the Black Death , smallpox , cholera etc do n't apply .
Smith ?'s models assume traditional dull - witted shuffler zombies rather than the nimbler types popular in some recent film offerings , but nonetheless the dynamics of undead contagion remain implacable .
In essence , as soon as there are any zombies in existence , humanity 's only chance for survival is to instantly and effectively extirpate them .
According to Smith ?:
Human - zombie coexistence is impossible ...
Since all eigenvalues of the doomsday equilibrium are negative , it is asymptotically stable .
It follows that , in a short outbreak , zombies will likely infect everyone .
He considers the use of schemes in which efforts are made to place zombies in quarantine of some sort , so rendering them unable to infect more people .
Apparently this wo n't work : such a scheme can never completely contain the plague .
It will therefore break out of confinement with disastrous results .
Likewise , even if a cure for zombification could be developed , it would n't work unless it also made the re-humanised undead immune to further infection .
If it merely turned a zombie back into a human who could then be re-zombified once again , end results would be unpleasant .
Some humans could survive , but only as a minority among the brain - scoffing swarms .
Suppose we are able to quickly produce a cure for ‘ zombie - ism ’ .
Our treatment would be able to allow the zombie individual to return to their human form again .
Once human , however , the new human would again be susceptible to becoming a zombie ; thus , our cure does not provide immunity ...
In this case , humans are not eradicated , but only exist in low numbers .

Does anything make sense in football anymore ?
Last season , the Pittsburgh Steelers allowed 57 sacks , rushed for 2.9 yards per carry in the playoffs -- and won the Super Bowl .
The other Super Bowl entrant , the Arizona Cardinals , reached the big game despite finishing last in rushing yards .
Rookie quarterbacks , who are never supposed to win , were dominant 2008 players , with Joe Flacco and Matt Ryan combining to go 24 - 12 .
The previous two rookie quarterbacks to start an entire season , David Carr and Peyton Manning , were a combined 7 - 25 .
High school strategy was the year 's happening thing .
Not just the Wildcat formation employed by Miami and a dozen other clubs -- the first - and second - ranked offenses in the NFL , New Orleans and Denver , ran the spread , pretty much exactly as it's run under Friday night lights on prep campuses around the nation .
My guess is that this autumn , NFL teams will turn to the stack , the high school defensive counter to the spread .
Why all this strangeness ?
Because an NFL playbook from the year 2387 came backward in time and altered the football timeline -- just like the spaceships from the future that altered the timeline in the latest Star Trek movie .
And just like in the movie , now nothing makes sense !
Expect that trend to continue through 2009 .
Also , a Tuesday Morning Quarterback from 2387 came backward in time , further altering events .

( Speaking of wasteful spending , last season Owens got $ 13.6 million and caught 69 passes -- $ 197,000 per reception . )

This kind of stuff is incredibly rare , right ?
Teens -- Do Not Text While Navigating a Submarine !
Also in February , two nuclear - missile submarines -- Vanguard from the United Kingdom and le Triomphant from France -- collided in the Atlantic .
The New York Times quoted " military experts in London and Paris " who called what happened " a one - in - a- million occurrence . "
Really ?
This was the second time in less than two decades that nuclear submarines smacked into each other in the blue water : America 's Baton Rouge collided with Russia 's Barracuda in 1992 .
Submarines can't seem to get out of each other 's way .
Perhaps " military experts in London and Paris " should know this !
All four boats involved in the two collisions of nuclear submarines contain millions of dollars , pounds , francs or rubles worth of high - tech equipment designed to ... detect other submarines .
Subs - gone - wild bonus No. 1 : In March , the U.S. nuclear submarine Hartford collided with the U.S. amphibious ship New Orleans .
The sub was surfacing and rose directly into the hull of the New Orleans .
The Hartford is an attack submarine whose role is to sink other vessels .
As such , it is crammed with millions of dollars worth of high - tech equipment designed to ... detect ships .
In 2003 , the Hartford ran aground off Sardinia ; the submarine failed to detect a 9,000 - square - mile island .
Subs - gone - wild bonus No. 2 : Fleets sometimes name ships after famed vessels of the past .
Vanguard , nameship of a class of submarines , carries forward the name of the last battleship ever launched by any nation .
Commissioned by the United Kingdom in 1946 , the 46,000 - ton Vanguard never saw action and was sold for scrap just 14 years after its maiden voyage .

Not only was Miss California stripped of her title , even worse , she had to kiss Donald Trump .
Satan Also Voted for Adam Lambert : Carrie Prejean failed to become Miss USA because she declared her opposition to gay marriage .
Judges found this view too controversial to be associated with the pageant winner , and named Prejean first runner - up .
Once no woman who favored gay marriage could have won Miss USA ; now you can't win if you 're opposed ; this sociological indicator means gay marriage is being accepted as a norm .
Afterward Prejean said Satan planted the question about gay marriage , in order to tempt her .
If Satan was running the Miss USA pageant , ratings would be a lot higher !
Prejean was dethroned as Miss California , following a flap about her posing " partially nude . "

I even enjoy reading about burgers .
But the cheeseburger in the Patridge ad contains an outrageous 930 calories and 61 grams of fat .

And as Carl Bialik of the Wall Street Journal points out -- his " Numbers Guy " column , which analyzes misuse of math and stats in business and politics , is one of the sharpest features in contemporary journalism -- restaurants and fast - food chains consistently understate the calories and fat in their fare .

Three cheers for the Ford family , owners of a controlling share of Ford Motors .
In recent years , several wealthy families whose forebears founded great enterprises , including the Bancroft family behind the Wall Street Journal , have voted to sell out , take the cash and to hell with what their grandparents spent a life building .
Not the Fords .
As the family stake fell from a value of $ 2.2 billion in 2000 to a low of $ 140 million in winter 2009 , repeatedly they voted to stand fast and work for the preservation of the company .
Ford has kept itself in business without government bailouts .
Ford also made a voluntary corporate commitment to fuel efficiency and high - quality manufacturing four years ago -- unlike General Motors and Chrysler , which did not make these commitments until being compelled to this year -- and already has the proof in showrooms , such as the terrific Ford Fusion .
Everybody 's bemoaning how General Motors and Chrysler fell to pieces .

College Presidents -- the New AIG Executives ?
After President Barack Obama accepted an invitation to give the commencement address at Arizona State University , the school announced Obama would not receive the traditional honorary doctorate , because ASU only awards such degrees to " someone who 's really outstanding . "
Past recipients who were deemed qualified for an ASU honorary degree include columnist Erma Bombeck , Chinese government minister Wu Qidi and the guy who produced the first " Pink Panther " movies .
After ASU was roundly mocked for insulting the president , the school announced a scholarship program in Obama 's name , while apologizing " for the confusion " about the presidential invite .
The " confusion " was reporting of ASU 's own decision !
The president of ASU , Michael Crow , gets $ 700,000 in pay and benefits , pretty heady for a guy who made one of the worst blunders ever for a college president , and one whose institution is ranked a measly 121st in its category in the essential U.S. News & World Report ratings .
Arizona State University is n't a private organization , it is subsidized by Arizona taxpayers .
Arizona taxpayers are paying through the nose for a guy who caused national embarrassment to their state .
Wall Street CEOs who screw up nevertheless kept their lavish paychecks .
How come college presidents keep their lavish paychecks regardless of performance ?
This is hardly just an ASU problem .
Public university leaders enjoy a median salary of $ 427,000 , more than the president of the United States , and most also receive substantial perks such as free housing and hefty pension contributions .
Many colleges and universities are cutting payments to teachers , reducing class offerings and cancelling extracurriculars ; public universities in California and Florida are limiting enrollment ; other essential parts of the college mission are in jeopardy .
But not college leaders ' pay -- there , the pigs keep wallowing .
Only a few college presidents have taken pay cuts ( subscription required ) , and the cuts are mainly small , symbolic ones .
Crow , for instance , donated a $ 60,000 bonus back to the school -- but kept the $ 700,000 .

Only Incredible Prosecutorial Excess Could Result in an Item of Sympathy for Blago :
As the conviction of former Alaska senator Ted Stevens was dropped , there were accusations of corruption at -- the Justice Department 's Public Integrity Section !
The Framers feared prosecutorial abuses , and there have been plenty lately .
There was the withholding of evidence in the Stevens case .
The Justice Department used leaks to discredit New York governor Eliot Spitzer who , in the end , was never charged with any crime .
Chicago federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald called a news conference to denounce Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich based solely on accusations rather than anything proven in court .
When two New Jersey mayors and associates were charged with corruption , federal prosecutor Ralph Marra Jr. called a news conference in which he spoke of the allegations as factually established and the accused as " ethics - free , " though nothing had been determined by a jury .
Blagojevich may be a cheeseball , and we are all inclined to assume the worst of Jersey politicians .
But the Framers would have been outraged at prosecutors using unproven allegations to promote themselves on television .
And if the Stevens , Spitzer , Blago and Jersey cases show what prosecutors do to the well - connected , can you imagine how average people are being mistreated ?

Please Don't Tell Me You Ordered an iLane While Driving : Other than North Korean plutonium , the year 's worst new product is iLane , which allows someone driving a car to listen and respond to e-mails and text messages .
Let 's hope states outlaw this product and impose tickets and raised insurance rates on those caught using it .
So what if the gizmo does n't display the message , but rather speaks the word and allows the driver to reply verbally .
Studies show it is distraction -- not whether the driver is holding something -- that contributes to crashes .
Hands - free cell phones are just as dangerous as hand - held , which suggests hands - free texting while driving is dangerous too .
A driver using any form of calling device is eight times more likely to cause a collision than a driver paying attention to the road .
This new Virginia
Tech study , which found that drivers who are texting are up to 23 times more likely to cause a crash than other drivers , suggests texting - driving is more dangerous than drunken driving .
Seat belt laws , electronic brakes , drunken driving crackdowns and car engineering keep decreasing road deaths .
Measured per 1 million miles traveled -- the best metric , incorporating population growth and amount of driving -- U.S. highway deaths peaked in 1966 , at 5.5 fatalities per million miles , and have declined on an almost annual basis to a record low of 1.3 per million miles traveled in 2008 .
That means in 1966 , getting behind the wheel was four times as likely to cause death as today , a tremendous trend of progress .
But considering engineering advances ( especially crash - survival frame design , an unseen feature of late - model cars ) , road fatalities would be even lower if it were n't for cell phones , texting and other electronic distractions , now joined by the odious iLane .
Few states have taken any action to get cell phones away from drivers , and there is no national law .
If news reports said 100 Americans per day were being killed by beta corthantium leaking from imported lawn mulch , there would be national outrage .
That 's how many Americans die each day in traffic crashes , and the response is a national shrug .
At least 10 Americans per day die in cellphone - caused collisions , according to estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Traffic crashes are also the leading cause of paraplegia and quadriplegia , which result in human suffering , higher federal health care spending and raised health insurance premiums .
Yet states and the federal government blithely allow drivers to speed while texting or screaming into cell phones .
We 're all in such a hurry to get where we 're going and , of course , accidents only happen to other people !
Plus telecommunications lobbyists donate money to members of Congress -- lobbyists for the dead do n't .
Footnote :
Though road fatalities should be down even more , leave it to the media to put a negative spin on declining death .
" Bad economy holds highway deaths to 1960s levels " read the headline of The Associated Press wire story .
The gist was that the recession caused people to drive less , so they were getting into fewer crashes .
Put aside that The Associated Press missed the real economics - related factor in fewer deaths -- because gas was above $ 3 a gallon for much of 2008 , there was less speeding .
Fuel consumption declines when speeding declines , and less speeding means less blood spilled .
Anyway , if more people die in 2009 , perhaps The Associated Press will run a giddy headline , " Rebounding economy leads to welcome increase in highway fatalities . "

NASA Was Terrified by the Asteroids -- Terrified the Agency Might be Assigned a Worthwhile Mission : During the offseason an asteroid crossed within 48,000 miles of Earth -- well inside the orbit of the moon , and only somewhat above the level of telecommunications satellites .
Another asteroid exploded in Earth 's upper atmosphere .
In July , something enormous struck Jupiter , leaving a " scar " thousands of miles across in the dense Jovian atmosphere .
Had the object , probably a mega - comet , instead struck here , you would not be reading this , as life on Earth would have ended last month .
As telescopes and astronomy improve , potentially hazardous space objects -- asteroids and comets -- are turning out to be far more common than previously believed and far more likely to hit the Earth than once assumed .
Currently there are more than 6,200 known near - Earth objects of significant size , and nearly two - thirds were discovered in this decade .
Details of the potentially deadly ones are here .
As is shown here , astronomical discoveries that there are a much greater number of dangerous space rocks than once assumed , coupled to geological discoveries that wide - area destruction from space - object strikes has been much more recent than we'd like to think , argue for building a system to stop asteroids from hitting the Earth .
But while NASA continues to plan to waste hundreds of billions of your tax dollars opening a Motel Six on the moon -- even Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin calls the moon base plan " a dead end " -- the space agency is doing nothing to protect the Earth from space objects .
NASA / JPL / Infrared Telescope Facility
This impact mark on Jupiter is almost as large as Earth .
If whatever hit there hit here , you would n't be reading this caption .

Stopping an asteroid from hitting Earth appears technically feasible .
Maybe an anti-asteroid system would never be used , but if one were , this would not only return tangible benefits to taxpayers -- it could be , oh , the single greatest achievement in human history .
Yet NASA has n't lifted a finger on an anti-space - object system .
Space agency budget priorities continue to be focused exclusively on serving NASA internal constituencies that benefit from a Moon Motel Six -- aerospace contractors , congressional districts with manned - space flight centers -- and the taxpayer be damned .
Though , NASA just established a Web site that lets you sign up for Twitter alerts on deadly objects approaching Earth .
Maybe one will read , " Human life about to end .
NASA got $ 1 trillion since founding yet did nothing .

World 's Fourth - Most - Populous Country Rarely Mentioned in U.S. Press :
While the fixed vote in Iran received extensive international attention , the world paid no notice to an honest election in Indonesia -- the world 's largest Muslim nation .
As recently as the 1970s , Indonesia was a repressive military dictatorship ; gradually it has become a democracy with a civil - society basis and freedom of speech , plus strong economic growth .
And America did not force this outcome on Indonesia or , for that matter , have anything to do with what happened -- Indonesians made their nation a democracy entirely on their own .
Why do the same politicians and pundits who have limitless breath to denounce the troubled Muslim nations say nothing about the success story of Muslim Indonesia ?
Islamist fanatics hate freedom in Indonesia as much as they hate it in the United States and Europe , and have committed awful crimes against Indonesia democracy .
But the world only notices Indonesia when a bomb goes off there -- how about some notice for social and economic progress ?
If They Say Why , Why , Tell ' Em That It 's Human Nature : Congress never voted on a daffy resolution to honor Michael Jackson for such trivia as " transforming the music video from a promotional tool into an art form . "
Art form ?
Jackson made a couple of really good pop albums , and then became weird ; the international fixation on him is something TMQ does not pretend to understand .
His life seems an object lesson in the principle that it can be healthy to hear the word " no " spoken .
What struck me about the proposed congressional resolution is how trite its content was , especially considering the text likely was composed by the Jackson camp .
According to the resolution , in 30 years of celebrity , Jackson made about 20 visits to the sick or appearances for philanthropies .
Less than one per year -- that 's lame .
The resolution praises Jackson because he sometimes " donated personal items " to charity auctions .
This can be a self - interested act by celebrities : they have " personal items " appraised for far more than the items are worth , claim a generous tax write - off , and come out ahead .
And the resolution says Jackson gave away about $ 50 million .
Sound good ?
Sister LaToya estimates Jackson 's earnings at more than $ 1 billion , while other estimates place his net worth at death at between $ 500 million and $ 2 billion .
If Jackson made $ 1 billion and donated $ 50 million , he gave away 5 percent and kept 95 percent for himself .
That goes beyond lame to pathetic .

At the United Nations , " Battlestar Galactica " characters become confused about whether they can order the General Assembly into a wormhole .

Q : Is n't the preservation process fatal ?
A : Cryopreservation is not yet reversible with present technology , but this says nothing about the abilities of future technology .
What is " fatal " varies from place to place and time to time depending on available medical technology .
What is " fraud " varies from place to place depending on available law enforcement !
If someone dies and the corpse is preserved cryogenically , any " abilities of future technology " are irrelevant .
Suppose a cancer patient died today in a research hospital , and moments later a biologist ran through the halls shouting , " Eureka , I have found the cure for cancer ! "

" Now that I 've altered the timeline , maybe I can amend my contract to get William Shatner 's residuals . "
My big complaint ?
Yet another time travel plot .
Time travel is almost certainly impossible on a physical - law basis .
Forget how a time machine would work -- where would you travel to ?
For there to be a destination for time travel , a vast number of universes would need to exist , each eternally locked in different moments .
In order for spaceships to come backward in time from 2387 to 2233 , as happens in the movie , there must be one universe in which it is 2387 and another universe in which it is 2233 .
Maybe you 'd need 365 universes in which it is eternally each day of 2233 .
Maybe you 'd need 8,760 universes in which it is eternally each hour of 2233 .
Maybe you 'd need 525,600 universes in which it is eternally each minute of 2233 .
And that 's just to have 2233 preserved as a destination for time travelers .
Maybe you 'd need 525,600 universes for each year of history .
The cosmos appears to be about 14 billion years old , so multiply those two numbers and count the zeros .
I can't prove there are not thousands of trillions of universes , each eternally locked in one minute of time .
But what are the odds ?
While time travel into the past is unimaginable , one - way travel into the future might work .
Einstein showed that as velocity increases toward the speed of light , time slows from the standpoint of the traveler .
Suppose you flew at 99 percent of the speed of light , the fastest speed possible under known physics , to 47 Ursa Major , a star system similar to ours , and 40 light - years away .
Departing today , you would arrive in 2049 .
Because you were at relativistic speed , only a short period would pass from the standpoint of your body clock , meaning you would jump 40 years forward in time -- it 's just there would never be any way to come back to 2009 , because that year would no longer exist .
If you turned your ship around in 2049 and flew back to Earth -- after taking cell - phone photos of 47 Ursa Major , of course -- you 'd arrive in 2089 , having aged only by a few months .
For all intents and purposes you would have time - traveled 80 years into the future .
But 2089 better be pretty good -- perhaps by then the DirecTV monopoly on NFL Sunday Ticket will be over -- because there would never be any way to return to 2009 .
In theory , long flights at near the speed of light would enable a person to travel thousands or even millions of years into the future , with the caveat that there would never be any possibility of return .
The experiences of a soldier who journeys at great speed to lead attacks against a distant planet , and each time he returns to Earth he finds a century has gone by -- gradually human culture becomes unrecognizable to him -- is the basis of the haunting 1974 novel " The Forever War " by Joe Haldeman .
Why has n't this book been made into a movie ?
Star Trek has sure been made into a movie .
For Trek producers , the value of having the latest flick include time travel is that Old Original Spock gets to announce that two ships coming backward to 2233 altered the timeline .
If time has been altered , then New Improved Kirk and New Improved Spock can have adventures that do n't require continuity with the original series .
Original Spock says his trip into the past caused " an alternate reality that coexists with the previous timeline . "
So the 1960s Enterprise can still depart for its five - year mission in syndication , but there is now a companion reality in which the Enterprise characters have different experiences and much better hair .
Wait -- you 're telling me that a spaceship falling into a time warp creates an entire new universe ?
If an alternate reality came into existence when the ships from 2387 went backward in time , some force had to create a new universe for the alternative reality to inhabit .
[+]
Enlarge Fox On Earth / B , the show " Fringe " makes sense .
On our world ...
Actually , this has been confirmed by science .
" Each time you make a choice , that creates an alternative reality in a new universe , " a Harvard scientist of the present day intones somberly on Fox 's " Fringe , " a product of the same producer - writer team as the Trek movie .
So every time I order coffee , that creates a new universe ?
On " Fringe " there are two Earths , separated by some kind of dimensional barrier .
Earth / A is ours .
On Earth / B , John Kennedy was not assassinated and the Twin Towers were never destroyed .
Perhaps on Earth / B , Fox News commentators do n't shout .
Maybe the version of " Fringe " airing on Earth / B makes more sense than the one airing in our dimension .
Maybe the scientist character of Earth / B says , " Each time you make a choice , that alters what happens to you personally . "
Fun note :
The campus scenes in " Fringe " are set at Harvard , but filmed at Yale .
The really big alteration of the timeline that occurs in the new Star Trek movie is not the planet Vulcan being destroyed or Kirk becoming a teen idol .
Rather , it is Original Spock 's declaration that time travel had never happened before .
In previous Trek movies and television episodes , traveling in time is as easy as catching a streetcar !

( " Enterprise . " )
Note :
In the " temporal emitter " episode , it is asserted that transmitting a burst of hexadecimal code one year into the past is so phenomenally complex , the power of a starship engine is required .
In the " time conduit " episode , characters have a live two - way videoconference across nine centuries , using a device powered by a communicator battery .
Paramount Pictures " Goodbye , Nyota .

URUMQI , China ( CNN ) --
Chinese police had detained at least 1,434 people by Tuesday morning following weekend demonstrations by ethnic Uyghur residents in Xinjiang province , Xinhua reported , citing government officials , as protests spread to more cities .
Chinese riot police patrol a street in Urumqi in Xinjiang province on July 6 .
Streets had reverted to calm and curfews were in force in major districts of Urumqi as the death toll mounted from rioting .
Police halted people who had gathered in nearby Yili Kazak Prefecture and Aksu City and dispersed more than 200 people who had tried to gather in nearby Kashgar at the Id Kah Mosque , the largest mosque in China , the news agency said .
Along the road into Kashgar from the airport , many areas were deserted ; residents said police had set up blockades in some areas and were rerouting traffic .
The regional public security department put the toll from riots at 156 deaths and more than 800 injuries , according to Xinhua , the state - run news agency .

That was an increase from the 140 deaths reported at noon Monday .
" Among the 16 newly reported dead , some died in hospitals and others were recovered from street corners , the police said , " according to Xinhua .
With a massive presence of soldiers and anti-riot squads , the government said Tuesday , the unrest in this capital of China 's far - west Xinjiang region had been brought under control .

In a rare public display of dissatisfaction , thousands of Uyghurs -- many of whom feel they are treated as second - class citizens and complain of being discriminated against by the majority Han Chinese -- took to the streets Sunday chanting and screaming , which prompted a police lockdown of the city .
" Traffic control was partially lifted Monday morning in parts of Urumqi ... but tension still exists in the city , " Xinhua said .
" Debris has been cleared from the roads and normal traffic has resumed .
Workers are still pulling away damaged vehicles from the worst - affected roads in the city . "

State - run media reported that protesters attacked passersby , burned public buses and blocked traffic Sunday .
The report did not say how many people took part in the protest or what their grievances were .
But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that soon after the protest started about 5 p.m. , hundreds of protesters " grew into easily over 1,000 -- men , women and children , all ethnic Uyghurs -- screaming and chanting . "
Police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street , but " people pushed them over , " the witness said .
" They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses . "
As the violence escalated , hundreds of riot police arrived , the witness said .
" They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd .
I saw fire trucks , ambulances , armed personnel carriers and what looked like tanks .
I heard random gunshots . "
Late Sunday , the witness said , Urumqi was in a lockdown , with hundreds of People 's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets .
He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleys and rounding up many of them .
The witness speculated that the protest , which took place in the predominantly Uyghur - populated Bazaar district , may have been a reaction to racial violence in southern China .
The violence reportedly happened at a toy factory in Guangdong province , where many migrants , including Uyghurs , have moved in search of work .
A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities .
Two Uyghurs reportedly died .
Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs .
China 's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy .
However , ethnic tensions run deep .
Minority groups such as the Uyghurs complain that they are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han nationality .
The World Uyghur Congress , a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich , Germany , condemned the crackdown on what it described in a written statement as Sunday 's " peaceful protest " by Uyghurs .
" The Chinese authorities should acknowledge that the peaceful protest was sparked by the unlawful mob beating and killing of Uyghur workers at a Guangdong toy factory more than a week ago , " it said .
" The authorities should also acknowledge that their failure to take any meaningful action to punish the Chinese mob for the brutal murder of Uyghurs is the real cause of this protest . "
It accused Chinese authorities of having " used tear gas , automatic rifles and armored vehicles to disperse the Uyghur protesters .
During the crackdown , some were shot to death , and some were beaten to death by Chinese police .
Some demonstrators were even crushed by armored vehicles near Xinjiang University , according to eyewitnesses . "
The government in Xinjiang blamed " foreign forces " for Sunday 's rioting .
" The violence is premeditated , organized violent crime , " said Nur Bekri , chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region , the equivalent of a governor .
" It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country . "
Bekri accused the World Uyghur Congress of spreading rumors and inciting anger that led to the rioting , in a speech carried by Xinjiang television .
The World Uyghur Congress denied the charge .
It is led by Rebuya Kadeer , a businesswoman of Uyghur ethnicity who was detained in 1999 and accused of harming China 's national security .
She was freed on bail in 2005 and was allowed to leave for the United States for medical care .
Bekri accused Kadeer of instigating the unrest via the Internet and said the fight at the Guangdong toy factory was exploited to incite ethnic strife .
" We should bear in mind that stability is to the greatest interest of all people in China , including the 21 million - plus people from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang , " he said .

The demographic divide — the inequality in the population and health profiles of rich and poor countries — is widening .
Two sharply different patterns of population growth are evident : Little growth or even decline in most wealthy countries and continued rapid population growth in the world ’s poorest countries .
The Population Reference Bureau ’s 2008 World Population Data Sheet and its summary report offer detailed information about country , regional , and global population patterns .
“ Nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the world ’s poorer countries , ” said Bill Butz , PRB ’s president .
“ Even the small amount of overall growth in the wealthier nations will largely result from immigration . ”
In 2008 , world population is 6.7 billion : 1.2 billion people live in regions classified as more developed by the United Nations ; 5.5 billion people reside in less developed regions .
“ We will likely see the 7 billion mark passed within four years , ” said Carl Haub , PRB senior demographer and co-author of this year ’s Data Sheet .
“ And by 2050 , global population is projected to rise to 9.3 billion .
Between now and mid-century , these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in today ’s less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent . ”
The 2008 World Population Data
Sheet provides up - to - date demographic , health , and environment data for 209 countries and 25 regions of the world .
It points up stark contrasts between developed and developing countries , as shown in the table .
“ The differences between Italy and the Democratic Republic of the Congo illustrate this widening demographic divide , ” said Mary Mederios Kent , co-author of this year ’s Data Sheet .
“ On one side are mostly poor countries with high birth rates and low life expectancies .
On the other side are mostly wealthy countries with low birth rates and rapid aging . ”
United States Italy Dem. Rep. Congo Population mid-2008 305 million 60 million 67 million Population 2050 ( projected ) 438 million 62 million 189 million Lifetime births per woman 2.1 1.3 6.5 Percent of population below age 15 20 % 14 % 47 % Percent of population ages 65 + 13 % 20 % 3 % Life expectancy at birth 78 years 81 years 53 years Annual births 4.3 million 568,120 2.9 million Annual deaths 2.4 million 575,300 0.8 million Annual births minus deaths 1.9 million - 7,200 2.1 million Percent of population undernourished < 2.5 % < 2.5 % 74 %
Other highlights from the 2008 World Population Data Sheet :
World population will have an urban majority .
In 2008 , for the first time , half of the world ’s population will live in urban areas .
Despite some improvement , maternal mortality continues to be very high in developing countries .
In those countries , 1 in 75 women still die from pregnancy - related causes .
In both sub -Saharan Africa and in the 50 countries defined by the United Nations as least developed , that risk is a shocking 1 in 22 .
In stark contrast , about 1 in 6,000 women in the developed countries die from pregnancy - related causes .
Worldwide , women now average 2.6 children during their lifetimes , 3.2 in developing countries excluding China , and 4.7 in the least developed countries .
Lifetime fertility is highest in sub-Saharan Africa at 5.4 children per woman .
In the developed countries , women average 1.6 children .
The United States , with an average of 2.1 children , is an exception to this low - fertility pattern in the world ’s wealthier countries .
In less developed countries , 18 percent of the population is undernourished .
In the least developed countries , 35 percent of the population consumes fewer than the minimum calories required to lead a healthy active life .
That figure rises above 60 percent in several sub-Saharan countries .
The Bush administration and Congress discussed the possibility of a breakdown in law and order and the logistics of feeding US citizens if commerce and banking collapsed as a result of last autumn 's financial panic , it was disclosed yesterday .
Making his first appearance on Capitol Hill since leaving office , the former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson said it was important at the time not to reveal the extent of officials ' concerns , for fear it would " terrify the American people and lead to an even bigger problem " .
Mr Paulson testified to the House Oversight Committee on the Bush administration 's unpopular $ 700 bn ( £ 426bn ) bailout of Wall Street , which was triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers last September .
In the days that followed , a run on some of the safest investment vehicles in the financial markets threatened to make it impossible for people to access their savings .

Paul Kanjorski , a Pennsylvania Democrat , asked Mr Paulson to reveal details of officials ' concerns , which were relayed to Congress in hasty conference calls last year .
The calls included discussion of law and order and whether it would be possible to feed the American people , and for how long , according to Mr Kanjorski .
" In a world where information can flow , money can move with the speed of light electronically , I looked at the ripple effect , and looked at when a financial system fails , a whole country 's economic system can fail , " Mr Paulson said .
" I believe we could have gone back to the sorts of situations we saw in the Depression .
I try not to use hyperbole .
It 's impossible to prove now since it did n't happen . "
The Oversight committee is investigating the takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America , a deal forged in the desperate weekend that Lehman Brothers failed , and which later required government support because of Merrill 's spiralling losses .
Mr Paulson defended putting pressure on Bank of America when it had last - minute doubts about the deal in December .
Not to have done so could have rekindled the " financial havoc " the bailout had calmed .

One spring day this April , at the Franklin Correctional Institution on Florida ’s Highway 67 , Sgt. Walter Schmidt pulled out his Electronic Immobilization Device — EID in officer parlance — and zapped two people , who immediately “ yelped in pain , fell to the ground and grabbed red burn marks on their arms , ” according to the St. Petersburg Times .
The two were not inmates at the prison , however .
They were students visiting the facility as part of “ Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Day . ”
The move cost Sgt. Schmidt his job , despite his claim that he merely intended to demonstrate how the devices worked .
He even asked the children ’s parents ( who were also employees at the prison ) permission first .
“ When they said ‘ sure , ’ I went ahead and did it , ” he told the Times .
“ It was n’t intended to be malicious , but educational .
The big shock came when I got fired . ”
Schmidt was n’t alone in his job - costing blunder .
In fact , it came just one day after multiple children , visiting different prisons were similarly shocked .
“ A total of 43 children were directly and indirectly shocked by electric stun guns during simultaneous Take Your Sons and Daughters to Work Day events gone wrong at three state prisons last month , ” reported the St. Petersburg Times on May 16th .
“ One was a warden ’s daughter . ”
Their ages ranged from five to 17 .
Fourteen of the kids were “ directly shocked . ”
The other 29 were “ indirectly exposed when they held hands with a person who was shocked .
With the kids circled together , the electricity could flow from one child ’s hands to the next . ”
Walt McNeil , Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections told the Times , “ I ca n’t imagine what these officers were thinking to administer this device to children , nor can I imagine why any parent would allow them to do so .
This must not happen again . ”
The bizarre rash of student electrocutions might have been an aberration on Florida prison grounds , but the guards — three of whom were fired and two of who resigned — might be forgiven for assuming that such devices are somehow safe for kids .
Even as news outlets across the country report episode after episode where police officers tase and use stun guns on unlikely people — take the pregnant woman tased at a baptism in Virginia or the 72 - year - old woman tased in a Texas traffic stop — more and more police officers are being given tasers to carry into schools .
And not just college campuses ; middle and high schools across the country are inviting Taser - toting cops on school grounds .
This comes at a time when Tasers have claimed the lives of hundreds of people , including three teenagers this year alone .
While heightened security might be a necessity in an age where kids smuggle deadly weapons to school , this fact alone should give parents and school officials pause .
Even as school administrators and local law enforcement accept and incorporate Tasers as disciplinary measures , deploying them on school grounds is putting students at risk .
Is Breaking School Rules A Crime ?
Last September , police officers in Hawthorne , CA tased an autistic 12 - year - old boy at his middle school after he became “ violent , ” launching a misconduct investigation by the police department .
In June , at Penn Hills High School in Pennsylvania , a student was tased in the hallway after ignoring a police officer ’s orders to put away his cell phone .
( “ The kid refused to listen , ” Penn Hills Police Chief Howard Burton explained , saying the student then “ pushed the officer . ” )
In 2006 , an 11th grader named Angel Debnam was tased at her high school in Bunn , North Carolina , just outside Raleigh .
“ Something sticks in you , and it ’s like a wire , ” Debnam described to local ABC affiliate WTVD .
( “ When I was on the ground crying and shaking , he asked me , ‘ Was that enough ?
Are you calmed down now ? ’ and he did it again . ” )
In March , the Los Angeles Times reported that “ the number of law enforcement agencies that have given Tasers to officers who work on school campuses has grown to well over 4,000 , ” according to Steve Tuttle , Vice President of Communications at Taser International .
That ’s up from 1,700 in 2005 .
In an e-mail to AlterNet last week , Tuttle said that this estimate remains accurate , noting that it “ includes municipal law enforcement agencies that have School Resource Officers ( SROs ) for elementary and high schools , as well campus police for colleges and universities . ”
But Tuttle took issue with the notion that Tasers are used “ ‘ for unruly students ’ as the LA Times article inferred . ”
“ They are used to protect students and faculties , ” he said , as well as police officers hired to patrol school grounds .
Just weeks into the 2009 /2010 school year , at least one report has surfaced of a student being tased on school grounds .
In Topeka , Kansas , a teenager at Capital City School was sent to the hospital after being tased , reportedly after “ attacking ” a school police officer while a Topeka police officer handcuffed him .
( According to local media , the student “ was being suspended for violating school rules . ” )
“ Our premier law enforcement electronic control device ”
Last fall , police officers patrolling Duval County Public Schools in Jacksonville , Fl joined the ranks of school security officers who carry Tasers on campus .
The decision followed years of controversy over the measure , which was first announced in 2005 .
That January , local press reports revealed that the Jacksonville Sheriff ’s Office ( JSO ) had signed a $ 1.8 million contract with Taser International to buy 1,800 Taser guns for city police officers over the next two years , some of which would be used by school security officers .
The timing was at least partly motivated by Superbowl XXXIX , which was held at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium that February .
According to the Associated Press , “ some school officials [ were ] surprised by the action , saying they were never told by the Jacksonville Sheriff ’s Office that it planned to issue stun guns to the officers assigned to most middle and high schools . ”
But plans to deploy the Tasers were put on hold shortly after .
In late February 2005 , Sheriff John Rutherford imposed a blanket moratorium on Taser use by the JSO after it came under fire for the repeated tasing of a 13 - year - old , 65 lb girl who was in handcuffed inside a patrol car .
Llahsmin Lynn Kallead had reportedly kicked the inside of the police car when she was shocked multiple times by her arresting officer .
“ I saw her jump from one side of the police car to the other ” from the shock , her mother , Rosie Vaughan , told reporters .
“ She shook . ”
It was surely a PR nightmare for Sheriff Rutherford , who had gone to great lengths to prove the safety and usefulness of the devices , holding town hall meetings across the county on the topic .
The stocky 52 - year - old had even volunteered to be tased himself , on camera , to demonstrate .
( “ Rutherford took a hit in the back and fell to the floor as other officers held his arms , ” according to Jacksonville ’s News 4 .
“ He bounced back up almost immediately , saying , ‘ There you have it . ' ”
In a conversation with AlterNet , the sheriff ’s office preferred to refer to Tasers by the name the company gives them : “ Electronic Control Devices ” or ECDs .
An JSO employee told AlterNet , “ we were , obviously , very thorough and deliberative in making sure that they fit in our use - of - force matrices . ”
For the JSO , the main value of the Taser is that “ it enables the officer to bring someone under control . ”
This apparently includes students and other hard - to - handle populations .
Not only are the devices deployed in all the middle and senior high schools in Jacksonville , according to the Sheriff ’s office , “ we ’ve also had many incidents where a mentally impaired person was brought under control through the use of the ECD . ”
The model used in Jacksonville schools is the TASER X26 , which , unlike those used by the police officer who tased the kids on “ Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Day ” can be fired remotely , hitting targets as far as 35 feet away with 50,000 volts of electricity .
Taser International describes the X26 model as “ our premier law enforcement electronic control device . ”
A “ Non-Lethal ” Weapon That Has Killed Hundreds
In December 2008 , Amnesty International released a 130 - page report titled “ Less Than Lethal ?
The Use of Stun Weapons in U.S. Law Enforcement , ” which found that 334 people had died after being tased since 2001 .
( This figure is already obsolete . )
The vast majority of these deaths were due to cardiac or respiratory arrest .
Of the 334 victims , 299 of them were unarmed .
The state with the most recorded Taser deaths was California , with 55 .
Florida ranked second , with 52 .
The victims were mostly adults , but they also included teenagers , like 17 - year - old Darryl Turner , who “ collapsed shortly after being shocked for 37 seconds in the chest . ”
According to the autopsy , a “ lethal disturbance ” of his heart rhythm was “ precipitated by the agitated state and associated stress as well as the use of the conducted energy weapon . ”
According to Amnesty , “ the coroner also noted that there were no anatomic findings indicating a pre-existing cardiac abnormality or disease , and no illegal drugs in his system . ”
The first three reported deaths by Taser in 2009 all involved teenage victims .
In January , 17 - year - old Derick Jones of Martinsville , Virginia died after a police officer responded to a complaint about public urination by chasing him into a house and tasing him when the boy “ moved rapidly ” toward him .
In the spring , two teenage boys in Michigan died within weeks of one another after being tased by police officers , 15 - year - old Brett Elder , and 16 - year - old Robert Mitchell .
In both cases , police accused the teens of resisting arrest .
Elder ’s father , Eugene , acknowledged that his son , who was days away from his 16th birthday , might have been confrontational .
Still , he told the Bay City Times .
“ There ’s no reason to kill my boy . ”
“ [ The police ] are here to protect us , ” Renea Mitchell , Robert Mitchell ’s mother told CNN .
“ There ’s no reason for what they ’ve done , ” she said .
“ There ’s no reason , no excuse . ”
Taser critics have long pointed out that the devices are marketed as non-lethal despite a lack of independent data — and considerable anecdotal evidence to the contrary .
According to Amnesty , “ the only medical safety studies prior to the marketing of the Advanced M26 Taser in late 1999 were animal tests conducted for Taser International to see whether the device could cause ventricular fibrillation in a pig and three dogs . ”
Even those conclusions have been challenged in recent years .
In a study carried out by a team of doctors and scientists at Chicago ’s Cook County hospital in 2006 , 11 unfortunate pigs were shocked with Taser guns — researchers tased them multiple times , in 40 second increments — to devastating effect .
“ When the jolts ended , every animal was left with heart rhythm problems , the researchers said .
Two of the animals died from cardiac arrest , one three minutes after receiving a shock . ”
Some have argued that pigs are n’t reliable testing subjects .
( “ In my modeling , I prefer to use humans , ” Dr. Jeffry Ho , an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Minnesota told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . )
This includes Taser International ’s co-founder , Rick Smith , who has argued that pigs weigh less than 100 pounds and “ have a very different physiology from humans , ” according to CBC News — an argument that would seem to undermine the company ’s own research techniques .
In March 2005 , a report by the ( rather bizarrely named ) Human Effects Center of Excellence at Brooks Air Force Base , which tests and “ non-lethal ” weapon technology , found “ a large margin of safety with the ‘ normal X26 operating output ’ in the case of large children and adults , ” according to Amnesty .
The study ’s authors , who based their research primarily on data provided to them by Taser International , also reviewed other studies , including “ tests investigating the effects of Tasers on the hearts of pigs weighing between 30 and 117 kilograms . ”
They found that the more a pig weighed , the less potential risk there was for internal injury .
“ These tests have been interpreted to conclude that smaller individuals ( e.g. children ) may be more susceptible to adverse effects from Taser shocks , ” according to Amnesty .
In 2007 , the UK ’s Defense Scientific Advisory Council Sub -Committee on the Medical Implications of Less - Lethal Weapons ( DOMILL ) concluded that although there is “ very limited information globally on the relative vulnerability of children to Tasers , ” existing data suggest that “ the safety factor for induction of ventricular fibrillation by Taser discharge in children at the younger ( i.e. smaller ) range of the pediatric population may be lower compared with that in the adult population . ”
In other words , the smaller the child , the less voltage it takes to hurt them .
“ Until more research is undertaken to clarify the vulnerability of children to Taser currents , ” the study concluded , “ children and persons of small stature should be considered at possible greater risk than adults . ”
Playing With Fire
Reports of children who have died after being tasered may mainly tell the stories of teenagers , but , along with an apparent misunderstanding of the sheer force of Tasers and stun guns ( at least if the Take Your Children to Work Day fracas is any indication ) , the already heavy - handed approach to students as young as seven in some schools suggests that arming police officers with Tasers might invite dangerous scenarios .
Take , for example , police in Avon Park , FL , who handcuffed and arrested a seven - year - old girl named Desre’e Watson , when she threw a tantrum in her kindergarten class .
Or cops in Detroit this past June , who handcuffed a fourth grader and special ed student to the door of his principal ’s office for four hours .
If teachers , administrators , and police have resorted to such measures to get a handle on unruly children wo n’t adding Tasers to the equation up the risk factor ?
In an era that sees students standing in line to go through metal detectors before homeroom , there ’s no question that weapons in school require reliable school security .
Arming school security officers with “ non-lethal ” weapons might seem to be a good solution .
That is , if Tasers actually fit the bill .
As another August 6th approaches , let me tell you a little story about Hiroshima and me :
As a young man , I was probably not completely atypical in having the Bomb ( the 1950s was a great time for capitalizing what was important ) on my brain , and not just while I was ducking under my school desk as sirens howled their nuclear warnings outside .
Like many people my age , I dreamed about the bomb , too .
I could , in those nightmares , feel its searing heat , watch a mushroom cloud rise on some distant horizon , or find myself in some devastated landscape I had never come close to experiencing ( except perhaps in sci - fi novels ) .
Of course , my dreams were nothing compared to those of America ’s top strategists who , in secret National Security Council documents of the early 1950s , descended into the charnel house of future history , imagining life on this planet as an eternal potential holocaust .
They wrote in those documents of the possibility that 100 atomic bombs , landing on targets in the United States , might kill or injure 22 million Americans and of an American “ blow ” that might result in the “ complete destruction ” of the Soviet Union .
And they were pikers compared to the top military brass who , in 1960 , found themselves arguing over the country ’s first Single Integrated Operational Plan for nuclear strategy .
In it , a scenario was laid out for delivering more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Communist world , including at least 130 cities which would , if all went well , cease to exist .
Official , if classified , estimates of possible casualties from such an attack — and by then , nuclear weaponry and its delivery systems had grown far more powerful — ran to 285 million dead and 40 million injured ( and this probably underestimated radiation effects ) .

From the National Security Council and the Pentagon to a teenager ’s nightmares , an American obsession with global annihilation undoubtedly peaked when President Kennedy came on the air on October 22 , 1962 , to tell us that Soviet missile sites were just then being prepared on the island of Cuba with “ a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere . ”
Listening to his address , Americans everywhere imagined a nuclear confrontation that could leave parts of the country in ruins .
Nuclear fears , however , began to fade ( even as the superpower arsenals grew ) when the Cuban Missile Crisis was defused and , along with atomic tests , went underground after the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963 .
Then , of course , the Vietnam War seemed to swallow the world .
In 1979 , after the reactor core of a nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania partially melted down , the bomb returned to me in an odd way .
Then a book editor , I went out to lunch with a potential author who had been on one of the investigatory panels created by the President ’s Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island which Jimmy Carter had set up .
She told me of a Japanese journalist who testified before her panel .
He had interviewed the mothers of young children and pregnant women belatedly evacuated from the potential danger zone to an iceless ice rink in the state capital , Harrisburg .
None of them had heard of Hiroshima or Nagasaki .

This so startled me that I decided to search for a book to publish on what had happened on those August days in 1945 when two Japanese cities were wiped out by a new weapon and the nuclear age began .
With the help of a historian and friend , I finally came across a Japanese book of images drawn by Hiroshima survivors , few of them artists , sometimes with school materials borrowed from their own grandchildren .
Each drawing caught a moment experienced on that terrible day when Hiroshima was wiped out and was accompanied by a little personal description .
Many of images were in pastels , or even crayon , and looked invitingly sprightly until you read the horrific accounts that accompanied them .
The book was called Unforgettable Fire and it played a small role in the massive anti-nuclear movement that arose in those years .
Unfortunately — and this tells us something — it ’s now long out of print .
A couple of years later , I was invited by Japanese publishers to visit their country .
Only on arriving did I discover that the man who had shepherded Unforgettable Fire to publication — and who was surprised to discover that an American editor wanted to publish it in translation — planned to take me to Hiroshima .
As a former atomic dreamer , who now knew a good deal about the history of the dropping of the bomb , and was , above all , the editor of possibly the only mainstream visual record in the U.S. of what had happened under that mushroom cloud , I was touched by the gesture , but somewhat bored by the idea .
After all , Japan was then dazzling .
It was the era of “ Japan as Number One ” mania and there was so much to see in a few brief days — and I , of course , knew pretty much what there was to be known about the experience of the first A - bombing .
That ’s just how plain dumb I was .
The trip to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum with its caramelized children ’s lunchbox and permanently imprinted human shadows was , to say the least , unspeakably horrifying .
In fact , it left me literally speechless , so much so that , although I returned to New York babbling about Japan , I found , for a long time , I could n’t talk about what I had seen in Hiroshima .
And that , mind you , was only the museum , which means it was next to nothing compared to what actually happened that long ago day .
When American strategists in the 1950s confidently began , in Herman Kahn ’s famous phrase , “ thinking the unthinkable , ” they , too , undoubtedly had no idea what they were incapable of imagining .
By and large , they still do n’t .
As TomDispatch regular Frida Berrigan points out , the weapons that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the equivalent of BBs compared to what ’s now in the major nuclear arsenals on this planet .
So sweet dreams this Hiroshima Day .

" In which country could this be called genocide ? " said a spokesman .
" In 1949 , the population of Uighurs in Xinjiang was 3.29 million , at present the Uighur population there is nearly 10 million , or three times more than 60 years ago .
What kind of ethnic genocide is this ? " he said .
At first glance this this group of photos is pretty eerie in a Dr. Strangelove type of way , but they have ice cream so how bad could it really be .
Not to mention that pneumatic tube document delivery system .
Any place with one of those is a - okay in my book .
In fact , I am currently looking into installing a pneumatic tube document delivery system in my office , fuck email .
If you are into the office tech of a certain sixties drama on AMC , then you will love this set of photos from the then “ state - of - the - art ” Pentagon from the early fifties , less than a decade after the building ’s opening .
The Pentagon is so massive it is like a city in a city , back in the fifties it had all sorts of services like a barber shop , Western Union and even a type writer repair shop .
Are there any ACL readers that work for the DoD that can verify if any of this stuff still exists ?
Or is that classified ?

Politik 2.0 : Roter Iro , nix dahinter
Sascha Lobo soll die SPD für Online - Freaks interessant machen - es gelingt ihm kaum .
Politik funktioniert im Großen und Ganzen wie folgt :
Es gibt eine gesellschaftliche Sorge , dann kümmert sich eine Bewegung darum , Medien berichten , und am Ende gucken die Parteien doof und versuchen , irgendwie auf den fahrenden Zug aufzuspringen .
Das letzte Beispiel : Die Sorge um Internetrechte und Datenschutz .
Alle Parteien wissen seit dem Erfolg der Piraten : Für die Bundestagswahl braucht man auch einen Internetfreak .
Schwierig , mit dem vorhandenen Personal zu schaffen .
Wolfgang Bosbach mit Piratenklappe ?
Funktioniert nicht .
Münte vor einem beklebten Laptop und im ranzigen T - Shirt ?
Nein , da muss ein anderes Symbol her - und die Sozialdemokraten haben es : Sascha Lobo , schnauzbärtiger Irokesen - PC - Nerd aus Berlin .
Seit die Computergeneration als Wähler entdeckt wurde , ist auch Sascha Lobo auf einmal für die SPD zur wichtigen Figur geworden .
Man fragt sich lediglich : warum ?
An der beruflichen Karriere von Sascha Lobo kann es eigentlich nicht liegen .
Im Sommer 2000 eröffnete er eine New - Economy - Werbeagentur , die nach anderthalb mäßig erfolgreichen Jahren Konkurs anmelden musste .
Dann jobte Lobo mal hier , mal dort und widmete sich seiner eigentlichen Lieblingstätgkeit : dem Bloggen .
2005 folgte der Grimme Online Award für den Blog " Riesenmaschine " und ein Jahr später ein Buch , in dem er über Latte macchiato trinkende Dauerchiller ohne festen Arbeitsvertrag sinnierte .
Natürlich ohne sich , Bewohner des Berliner Szenebezirks Mitte , damit selbst zu charakterisieren .
Egal , die Marke Lobo war geboren und ist jetzt vielleicht das Gesicht der SPD im Online - Wahlkampf 2009 .
Lobo sitzt schon seit 2007 im Online - Beirat .
Der Beirat ist ein Gremium ohne besonders weitreichende Kompetenzen , in dem sich ein paar Symbolkämpfer aus der Internetszene versammeln .
Die bisher aufsehenerregendste Aktion dieser Gruppe war es , das Netzsperrengesetz abzulehnen .
Neben der Tätigkeit im Beirat twittert Lobo so erfolgreich wie kaum jemand anderer im deutschsprachigen Raum , über 15.000 Leute folgen seinen Ergüssen auf 140 Zeichen .
Der politische I nhalt seiner Texte ist dabei zweitrangig .
Denn der Marktwert von Sascha Lobo ist im allgemeinen Online - Hype gestiegen .
Für ihn haben sich dadurch auch abseits der SPD neue Möglichkeiten der Vermarktung ergeben .
Der 34 - Jährige wurde doch noch zum erfolgreichen Geschäftsmann und erhielt einen Werbevertrag mit dem Telekommunikationsriesen Vodafone .
Dabei übersah Lobo offenbar , dass sich der Konzern für das Internetsperrengesetz ausgesprochen hatte , das Lobo vor allem mit moralischen Argumenten wortreich bekämpft hatte .
Entsprechende Kritik gab es aus der Bloggerszene .
Als wäre dies nicht genug , gilt auch die Werbekampagne als gefloppt .
Denn die , die Lobo aus dem Netz kennen , finden sie peinlich .
Und die anderen erkennen den Typen mit dem roten Iro einfach nicht .
Bleibt Lobo also nach diesem erneuten kommerziellen Misserfolg der Rückzug in den Parteiauftrag .
Vielleicht gewinnt Lobo ja ein paar Stimmen für die SPD .
Oder man geht gemeinsam unter .
The website of Apache was taken offline for several hours on Friday after the SSH remote administration key on one of its servers was compromised .
SSH is a widely used technology for remote administration , so in the worst scenario the compromise created a means for hackers to upload Trojanised code onto the download section of Apache 's website .
Around 50 per cent of webservers run Apache , according to the latest stats from Netcraft , so any problem would be extremely widely felt .
It 's unclear at present whether any code on the Apache website was actually modified .
Nor do we know how the attack was carried out or who was behind it .
Apache 's web site was restored after DNS records were changed so that servers based in Europe rather than at the main US site were carrying the load .
Rik Ferguson , a security researcher at Trend Micro , notes that the same type of compromised SSH key problem led to attacks that attempted to install rootkits on Linux based systems in August 2008 .
Screenshots of Apache 's statement on the incident , since removed , have been preserved for posterity in a blog posting by Trend Micro here and F - Secure here . ®

Reg reader Jack C told us on Thursday that http://httpd.apache.org/ was giving a directory listing where the index page should be .
We saw this but did n't think much of it at the time .
Friday 's SSH glitch potentially casts this incident in a new light .
Ashley Greene ’s naked pictures have leaked on the Internet .
In case you are n’t a prepubescent girl Ashley Greene is one of the stars from the movie “ Twilight ” .
Why these young starlets keep taking nude photos of themselves is beyond me .
I can only assume that they are trying to impress me .
I must say of all the leaked naked pictures I ’ve seen Ashley Greene ’s are some of the best .
It looks like she used a real camera instead of a cell phone , and she made sure to take a nice shot of the vag .
Every young actress should put this much care into their nude pictures .
*** Update *** Ashley Greene ’s lawyers have “ asked ” us to remove her pictures .
But never fear .
We have found topless pics of that other girl from “ Twilight ” , and she is much hotter than Ashley .
Which of these two scenarios sounds more vibrant for the overall quality of life and health ?
The wind on your face , the sun on your skin , you talk with a local farmer about the size and taste of this year 's harvest of peaches , as you pop a slice in your mouth .
After tasting several different varieties , you choose your favorite one , walking away with a great memory of the farmer in your mind .
Or ...
You stand shivering in the freezer section at your local mega-mart , your eyes begin to glaze over from the halogen lights and the neon - colored cardboard boxes containing substances claimed to be food products ?
You decide on the one with the least amount of additives and make your way to the self - check - out line , excited to get in your car and out of the supermarket .
Most of us would agree that the first scenario , at the local farmer 's market , is much more appealing than a trip to a big chain grocery store .
But what , besides the aesthetic factor , are some of the other benefits of supporting your local farmers market ?
Here are ten reasons why I believe you should shop at your local farmers market .
Benefits of Shopping at Your Local Farmer 's Market
1. Buying Locally
Buying from your local farmer allows you to support local agriculture .
This means that the food you are eating comes from nearby , and does not require us to waste lots of energy and petroleum to ship the food halfway around the world .
You are eating food in your environment , where it has perfectly - created nutrients for your specific climate and region .
You are also supporting the environment by reducing the usage of fossil fuels .
2. Cheaper Organic Fruits & Veggies
You can find a variety of fresh , organic produce at more affordable prices than in a supermarket .
There are also many farmers that carry products that are not technically " organic , " but have many low - priced foods that are pesticide and herbicide free .
The advantage at a farmers market is that you can actually talk to the farmer , learn about their methods , and then decide for yourself .
In some cases , they may even allow you to come and visit their farm .
3. Supporting Your Local Economy & Farmers
You are supporting human beings and the local economy , not massive agribusiness GMO food conglomerates .
Not only will your money be staying in your area , but you will happily please the farmer that worked to grow that food .
Your belly will remember the farmer 's smile as they handed you that juicy peach .
4. Eat Seasonally
By shopping at the local farmers market , you will eat seasonally , fresh and ripe .
This is a great way to increase your overall health .
Supermarkets offer too much variety , and the food is picked before it has ripened decreasing the vitality .
The body does not need to be eating imported pineapple in the dead of a Montana winter !
5. Safer Foods
Food from your local farmers market is generally safer .
Remember the recent outbreaks of E. coli in bagged spinach ?
These things happen mostly in large industrial settings , where business - men work to mass produce food , preserve it and bag it in mass amounts .
6. Fresher Fruits & Veggies
The food from your local farmers market is , quite frankly , fresher .
Because it was grown locally , there is a good chance that the apple you buy from the farmer was picked a few days ago .
This is virtually impossible in a big supermarket .
7. Great Variety
There is usually an amazing variety of fruits and veggies at your local farmers market .
Each farmer may have a method for growing tomatoes or peppers .
This is something that never happens at a grocery store .
8. Better Taste
There is no doubt that locally - grown foods just simply taste better .
You will never be able to eat a carrot from the grocery store again !
9 . It 's Healthy !
There 's just no way around it , eating fresh , locally - grown fruits and veggies are great for your health .
Buy yourself some local honey , which is sold at most local farmer markets .
It has just the right components for allergy prevention in your neck of the woods , not to mention it 's tasty !
10 . Most Importantly —
It 's Fun !
We stated it in the beginning , but farmers markets are just plain fun for the whole family .
Meeting your local community is an excellent way to feel connected to the world around you , increasing health for body , mind , and spirit .
Or Just Start Your Own Organic Garden
An even better solution is to grow your own food by creating an organic garden in your yard or even on your balcony .
Of course , this will take extra time and money , which a lot of us seem to lack these days .

SYNOPSIS : A discussion of the ugly truth about race and the lethally inept Katrina response
By three to one , African - Americans believe that federal aid took so long to arrive in New Orleans in part because the city was poor and black .
By an equally large margin , whites disagree .
The truth is that there 's no way to know .
Maybe President Bush would have been mugging with a guitar the day after the levees broke even if New Orleans had been a mostly white city .
Maybe Palm Beach would also have had to wait five days after a hurricane hit before key military units received orders to join rescue operations .
But in a larger sense , the administration 's lethally inept response to Hurricane Katrina had a lot to do with race .
For race is the biggest reason the United States , uniquely among advanced countries , is ruled by a political movement that is hostile to the idea of helping citizens in need .
Race , after all , was central to the emergence of a Republican majority : essentially , the South switched sides after the passage of the Civil Rights Act .
Today , states that had slavery in 1860 are much more likely to vote Republican than states that did n't .
And who can honestly deny that race is a major reason America treats its poor more harshly than any other advanced country ?
To put it crudely : a middle - class European , thinking about the poor , says to himself , " There but for the grace of God go I . "
A middle - class American is all too likely to think , perhaps without admitting it to himself , " Why should I be taxed to support those people ? "
Above all , race - based hostility to the idea of helping the poor created an environment in which a political movement hostile to government aid in general could flourish .
By all accounts Ronald Reagan , who declared in his Inaugural Address that " government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem , " was n't personally racist .
But he repeatedly used a bogus tale about a Cadillac - driving Chicago " welfare queen " to bash big government .
And he launched his 1980 campaign with a pro-states ' - rights speech in Philadelphia , Miss. , a small town whose only claim to fame was the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers .
Under George W. Bush - who , like Mr. Reagan , is n't personally racist but relies on the support of racists - the anti-government right has reached a new pinnacle of power .
And the incompetent response to Katrina was the direct result of his political philosophy .
When an administration does n't believe in an agency 's mission , the agency quickly loses its ability to perform that mission .
By now everyone knows that the Bush administration treated the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a dumping ground for cronies and political hacks , leaving the agency incapable of dealing with disasters .
But FEMA 's degradation is n't unique .
It reflects a more general decline in the competence of government agencies whose job is to help people in need .
For example , housing for Katrina refugees is one of the most urgent problems now facing the nation .
The FEMAvilles springing up across the gulf region could all too easily turn into squalid symbols of national failure .
But the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which should be a source of expertise in tackling this problem , has been reduced to a hollow shell , with eight of its principal staff positions vacant .
But let me not blame the Bush administration for everything .
The sad truth is that the only exceptional thing about the neglect of our fellow citizens we saw after Katrina struck is that for once the consequences of that neglect were visible on national TV .
Consider this : in the United States , unlike any other advanced country , many people fail to receive basic health care because they can't afford it .
Lack of health insurance kills many more Americans each year than Katrina and 9/11 combined .
But the health care crisis has n't had much effect on politics .
And one reason is that it is n't yet a crisis among middle - class , white Americans ( although it 's getting there ) .
Instead , the worst effects are falling on the poor and black , who have third - world levels of infant mortality and life expectancy .
I 'd like to believe that Katrina will change everything - that we 'll all now realize how important it is to have a government committed to helping those in need , whatever the color of their skin .
But I would n't bet on it .
